The '''American Library Association''' ('''ALA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in the [[United States]] that promotes [[library|libraries]] and library education internationally. It is the oldest and largest library association in the world,<ref>{{cite web |title=American Library Association |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761563357 |website=MSN Encarta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111163603/https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKCy7XB?url=http%3A%2F%2Fencarta.msn.com%2Fencnet%2Frefpages%2FRefArticle.aspx%3Frefid%3D761563357 |archive-date=November 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=December 1, 2008 }}</ref> with more than 57,000 members.<ref>"Report to Executive Board," by ALA Interim Executive Director Mary Ghikas, EBD  #7.0, 2017– 2018, December 28, 2017,  "The total ALA membership roster at the end of October 2017 was 57,498 compared to the October 2017 count of 57,195.

==History==
Founded by [[Justin Winsor]], [[Charles Ammi Cutter]], [[Samuel Swett Green|Samuel S. Green]], James L. Whitney, [[Melvil Dewey]] (Melvil Dui), Fred B. Perkins, [[Charles Evans (librarian)|Charles Evans]], and [[Thomas W. Bicknell]] on October 6, 1876, during the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] and chartered<ref>([http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/charter-1879-revised-1942 ALA Charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328000718/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/charter-1879-revised-1942 |date=2014-03-28 }})</ref> in 1879 in [[Massachusetts]], its head office is now in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justin-Winsor|title=Justin Winsor {{!}} American librarian|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}</ref>

During the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, 103 librarians, 90 men and 13 women, responded to a call for a "Convention of Librarians" to be held October 4–6 at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. At the end of the meeting, according to Ed Holley in his essay "ALA at 100," "the register was passed around for all to sign who wished to become charter members," making October 6, 1876, to be ALA's birthday.
In attendance were 90 men and 13 women, among them Justin Winsor (Boston Public, Harvard), William Frederick Poole (Chicago Public, Newberry), Charles Ammi Cutter (Boston Athenaeum), Melvil Dewey, and [[Richard Rogers Bowker]]. Attendees came from as far west as Chicago and from England.<ref>{{cite web | title=History | url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history}}</ref>
The aim of the association, in that resolution, was "to enable librarians to do their present work more easily and at less expense."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128031727/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history |archive-date=2013-01-28 }}</ref> The association has worked throughout its history to define, extend, protect and advocate for equity of access to information.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED462981|title=''Rocks in the Whirlpool: Equity of Access and the American Library Association''}}|  Submitted to the Executive Board of the American Library Association June 14, 2002.| ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)|  ED462981| Retrieved December 21, 2011</ref>

Library activists in the 1930s pressured the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom.  In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of what they had to say resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later.<ref>(Samek, 2001, p.&nbsp;7)</ref>  During this period, the first [[Library Bill of Rights]] (LBR) was drafted by [[Forrest Spaulding]] to set a standard against censorship and was adopted by the ALA in 1939.  This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates.<ref>(Robbins, 1996, p.&nbsp;166)</ref>  The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.

The ALA appointed a committee to study censorship and recommend policy after the banning of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and the implementation of the LBR.  The committee reported in 1940 that intellectual freedom and professionalism were linked and recommended a permanent committee – Committee on Intellectual Freedom.<ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63">(McCook, 2011, p.&nbsp;63)</ref>  The ALA made revisions to strengthen the LBR in June 1948, approved the Statement on Labeling in 1951 to discourage labeling material as subversive, and adopted the Freedom to Read Statement and the Overseas Library Statement in 1953.<ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63"/>

In 1961, the ALA took a stand regarding service to [[African Americans]] and others, advocating for equal library service for all.  An amendment was passed to the LBR in 1961 that made clear that an individual's library use should not be denied or abridged because of race, religion, national origin, or political views.  Some communities decided to close their doors rather than desegregate.<ref>Rubin, R. E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science (3rd edn). New York: Neal-Schuman, p.294</ref>  In 1963, the ALA commissioned a study, ''Access to Public Libraries'', which found direct and indirect discrimination in American libraries.<ref>(McCook, 2011, p.&nbsp;55)</ref>

In 1967, some librarians protested against a pro-[[Vietnam War]] speech given by General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] at the annual ALA conference in San Francisco; the former president of [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Harold Taylor, spoke to the Middle-Atlantic Regional Library Conference about socially responsible professionalism; and less than one year later a group of librarians proposed that the ALA schedule a new round table program discussion on the social responsibilities of librarians at its next annual conference in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  This group called themselves the Organizing Committee for the ALA Round Table on Social Responsibilities of Libraries.  This group drew in many other under-represented groups in the ALA who lacked power, including the Congress for Change in 1969.<ref>(Samek, 2001, pp.&nbsp;67–8)</ref> This formation of the committee was approved in 1969 and would change its name to the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) in 1971. After its inception, the Round Table of Social Responsibilities began to press ALA leadership to address issues such as library unions, working conditions, wages, and intellectual freedom.  The [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] was created by ALA's Executive Board in 1969.<ref>(Samek, 2001, p. 69)</ref> The [[Black Caucus of the American Library Association|Black Caucus of the ALA]] and the Office for Literacy and Outreach were set up in 1970.<ref>(Rubin, 2004, p. 296)</ref>

At a national convention of the ALA in Dallas in 1971, [[Barbara Gittings]] staffed a kissing booth underneath the banner "Hug a Homosexual," with a "women only" side and a "men only" side.<ref>Bullough, Vern, ed. (2002) ''Before Stonewall: Activists for gay and lesbian rights in historical context.'' Harrington Park Press; {{ISBN|1-56023-192-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaypioneers.com/soundbitesframe-gittings.cfm |title=Gay Pioneers |publisher=Gay Pioneers |access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> When no one took advantage of it, she and [[Alma Routsong]] kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map."<ref name="citypaper">Warner David.{{cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/042299/feat.20q.shtml |title=20 questions |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516124313/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/042299/feat.20q.shtml |archive-date=2008-05-16 }} CityPaper.net.

In June 1990, the ALA approved "Policy on Library Services to the Poor" and in 1996 the Task Force on Hunger Homelessness, and Poverty was formed to resurrect and promote the ALA guidelines on library services to the poor.<ref>(Berman, 2001, p.&nbsp;12)</ref>

In 2014, Courtney Young, the president of the association, commented on the background and implications of a racist joke author [[Daniel Handler]] made as African-American writer [[Jacqueline Woodson]] received a National Book Award for ''Brown Girl Dreaming''. "His comments were inappropriate and fell far short of the association's commitment to diversity," said Young. "Handler's remarks come at a time when the publishing world has little diversity. Works from authors and illustrators of color make up less than 8 percent of children's titles produced in 2013. The ALA hopes this regrettable incident will be used to open a dialogue on the need for diversity in the publishing industry, particularly in regards to books for young people."<ref>[http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2014/11/29/award-winning-author-jacqueline-woodson-responds-racist-joke "Award-Winning Author Jacqueline Woodson Responds to Racist Joke"], ''The Advocate'', November 29, 2014</ref>

====Notable sub-organizations====

Established in 1969, the Social Responsibilities Round Table currently oversees a number of task forces including the 'Feminist Task Force'; the 'Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty Task Force (HHPTF)'; the 'International Responsibilities Task Force'; the 'Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Task Force (MLKTF)'; 'The Rainbow Project Task Force'; and the 'Task Force on the Environment'. According to their website, the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) have worked to make the American Library Association (ALA) more democratic and progressive. Their primary focus is to promote social responsibility as a core value in librarianship and to ensure that libraries and librarians work to recognize and solve social problems in their community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/rt/srrt/about-srrt |title=About SRRT |website=ala.org|publisher=The Social Responsibilities Round Table of the American Library Association|access-date=31 March 2018}}</ref>

In 1970, the ALA founded the first [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] professional organization, called the "Task Force on Gay Liberation", now known as the [[Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table]] or GLBT Round Table.<ref name=glbtrt>{{cite web | title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Round Table (GLBTRT) |url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/ | publisher=ALA | access-date=2010-09-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223855/http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/rts/glbtrt/index.cfm| archive-date= 16 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=gittings>{{cite book |last=Gittings |first=Barbara |title=Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years |location=Philadelphia |year=1990}}</ref> The first leader was [[Israel David Fishman]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel David Fishman papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/1012|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref> [[Barbara Gittings]] became its coordinator in 1971. In the early 1970s, the Task Force on Gay Liberation campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the [[Library of Congress]] reclassified from HQ 71–471 ("Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes"). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 ("Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement"). In 1971, the GLBTRT created the first award for GLBT books, the Stonewall Book Award, which celebrates books of exceptional merit that relate to LGBT issues. ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' by [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name Isabel Miller) was the first winner. In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the GLBTRT (then called the Gay and Lesbian Task Force) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world. Some commenters called the cover "in poor taste" and accused American Libraries of "glorifying homosexuality," while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was "not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians." In 2010, the GLBTRT announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee. This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.

On July 23, 1976, the committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship was established as a Council Committee of the ALA on recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee with the same name (which had been appointed by the President of the ALA in December 1975) and of the Committee on Organization. The committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship works to "officially represent the diversity of women's interest within ALA and to ensure that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field; to promote and initiate the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship; to coordinate the activities of ALA units which consider questions of special relevance for women; to identify lags, gaps, and possible discrimination in resources and programs relating to women; in cooperation with other ALA units, to help develop and evaluate tools, guidelines, and programs designed to enhance the opportunities and the image of women in the library profession, thus raising the level of consciousness concerning women; to establish contacts with committees on women within other professional groups and to officially represent ALA concerns at interdisciplinary meetings on women's equality; and to provide Council and Membership with reports needed for establishment of policies and actions related to the status of women in librarianship; and to monitor ALA units to ensure consideration of the rights of women." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/hrdr/abouthrdr/hrdrliaisoncomm/statusofwomen/committeestatus|title=COSWL|work=ala.org}}</ref><ref name="library.illinois.edu">[https://archive.today/20120804020111/http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/ala/holdings/?p=creators/creator&id=3540]</ref> In 1979, the committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship received the Bailey K. Howard – World Book Encyclopedia – ALA Goal Award to develop a profile of ALA personal members, known as the COSWL Study. In 1980, the committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship was awarded the J. Morris Jones – World Book Encyclopedia – ALA Goals Award with the OLPR Advisory Committee to undertake a special project on equal pay for work of equal value.<ref name="library.illinois.edu"/>

Beside the Alex Awards, ALA disseminates some annual lists of [[ALA Notable Books|"Notable"]] and "Best" books and other media.

The annual awards roster includes the [[John Cotton Dana Award]] for excellence in library public relations.

In 2000, the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) launched the [[Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture]] in tribute to the work of the first OLOS director, Dr. Jean E. Coleman.  [[Barbara J. Ford]] gave the inaugural lecture, "Libraries, Literacy, Outreach and the Digital Divide."

Since 2006, the ALA has selected a class of [[Emerging Leaders]], typically comprising about 100 librarians and library school students. This minor distinction is a form of organizational outreach to new librarians. The Emerging Leaders are allocated to project groups tasked with developing solutions to specified problems within ALA divisions. The class meets at the ALA Midwinter and Annual Meetings, commonly January and June. Project teams may present posters of their completed projects at the Annual.<ref>Emerging Leaders Program Info: http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/leadership/emergingleaders</ref>

====Conferences====
The ALA and its divisions hold numerous conferences throughout the year. The two largest conferences are the annual conference and the midwinter meeting. The latter is typically held in January and focused on internal business, while the annual conference is typically held in June and focused on exhibits and presentations. The ALA annual conference is notable for being one of the largest professional conferences in existence, typically drawing over 25,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=confservices | title =Conference Services | publisher =ALA | access-date =2006-11-14| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061116140233/http://www.ala.org/template.cfm?Section=confservices| archive-date= 16 November 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>

in 2020 [[Wanda Kay Brown]] was the first president in 75 years under whom the Annual Conference, scheduled for Chicago in June 2020, was cancelled because of the COVID-19,  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]. In a press release about cancellation of the conference Brown stated, “ALA’s priority is the health and safety of the library community, including our members, staff, supporters, vendors and volunteers."<ref>[http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2020/03/american-library-association-cancels-2020-annual-conference-due-covid-19 American Library Association cancels 2020 Annual Conference due to COVID-19], American Library Association, March 24, 2020.</ref>”

The ALA [[Public Library Advocacy|advocates]] positions on [[United States]] political issues that it believes are related to libraries and librarianship. For court cases that touch on issues about which the organization holds positions, the ALA often files [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]] briefs, voluntarily offering information on some aspect of the case to assist the court in deciding a matter before it. The ALA has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], that [[Lobbying|lobbies]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] on issues relating to libraries, information and communication. It also provides materials to libraries that may include information on how to apply for grants, how to comply with the law, and how to oppose a law.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm | title =Washington Office | publisher =ALA | access-date =2010-09-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920060616/http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm| archive-date= 20 September 2010 | url-status= live| date =June 30, 2006 }}</ref>

In 1950, the Intellectual Freedom Committee, the forerunner of the OIF, investigated the termination of [[Ruth W. Brown]] as librarian of the [[Bartlesville]] Public Library, a position she held in the [[Oklahoma]] town for 30 years.  Brown's termination was based on the false allegation that she was a communist and that she had as part of the library's serials collection two left wing publications, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.  The ALA support for her and the subsequent legal case was the first such investigation undertaken by the ALA or one of its state chapters.<ref>Robbins, L.S. (2000). The dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown. Norman, The University of Oklahoma Press.</ref>

In 1999, radio personality [[Laura Schlessinger]] campaigned publicly against the ALA's intellectual freedom policy, specifically in regard to the ALA's refusal to remove a link on its web site to a specific sex-education site for teens.<ref>{{cite web | date =1999-05-10 | url =http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | title ="Dr. Laura" Continues Criticism of ALA | work =Library Journal | publisher =MediaSource, Inc. | access-date =2006-11-14 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204559/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | archive-date =2007-09-30 }}</ref> [[Sharon Priestly]] said, however, that Schlessinger "distorted and misrepresented the ALA stand to make it sound like the ALA was saying porno for 'children' is O.K."<ref>{{cite journal | last =Priestly | first =Sharon |date=Winter 2001 |  title =Don't Listen to Dr. Laura | journal =Free Inquiry | volume = 41 | issue = 1}}</ref>

In 2002, the ALA filed suit with library users and the ACLU against the United States [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA), which required libraries receiving federal E-rate discounts for Internet access to install a "technology protection measure" to prevent children from accessing "visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf | title =Text of the Children's Internet Protection Act}}</ref> At trial, the federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional.<ref>''United States v.

In upholding the law, the Supreme Court, adopting the interpretation urged by the U.S. Solicitor General at oral argument, made it clear that the constitutionality of CIPA would be upheld only "if, as the Government represents, a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay on an adult user's request."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=539&invol=194 | title =''US v ALA'' 539 U.S. 194, 2003 | publisher =FindLaw | access-date =2007-03-21| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070219172248/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=539&invol=194| archive-date= 19 February 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Privacy===

==== 1970s ====
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] attempted to use librarians as possible informants in the conspiracy case of the [[Harrisburg Seven]] in 1971. The Harrisburg Seven, made up of religious anti-war activists, were primarily accused of conspiring to kidnap National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]]. The supposed leader of the group, [[Philip Berrigan]], was serving time at the Lewisburg penitentiary. The FBI sought "to use library surveillance and librarian informants" at [[Bucknell University]] as evidence of the Harrisburg Seven's "characters and intentions."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Lamdan|first=Sarah Shik|year=2013|title=Why library cards offer more privacy rights than proof of citizenship: Librarian ethics and Freedom of Information Act requestor policies|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=133|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2012.12.005|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=cl_pubs}}</ref> Boyd Douglas became one such informant for the FBI: he was a prisoner at the same penitentiary with a work-release position at the library. Boyd presented himself as an anti-war activist and offered to smuggle letters he collected while at work to Philip Berrigan at the prison.

The FBI also attempted to use [[Zoia Horn]], a librarian at the Bucknell library, and interviewed other library workers. The FBI met with Horn in her home to debrief her, but Horn refused to answer their questions. She refused to testify, even after she was given immunity from self-incrimination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sparanese|first=Ann|year=2003|title=Activist Librarianship: Heritage or Heresy?|journal=Progressive Librarian|volume=22|pages=45|via=Biography Reference Bank}}</ref> Horn stated, "To me it stands on: Freedom of thought" and that the government "spying in homes, in libraries and universities inhibits and destroys this freedom."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IalBZuoiOf4C&q=The%20CIA%20on%20Campus:%20Essays%20on%20Academic%20Freedom%20and%20the%20National%20Security%20State&pg=PP1|title=The CIA on Campus: Essays on Academic Freedom and the National Security State|last=Zwerling|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2011|isbn=9780786488896|pages=105|via=Google Books}}</ref> Zoia Horn was charged with contempt of the court and served 20 days in jail.

In the 1970s, [[United States Department of the Treasury]] agents also pressured public libraries across the country to "release circulation records recording the names and identifying information of people who checked out books on bomb making."<ref name=":0" /> The ALA believed this to be an "unconscionable and unconstitutional invasion of library patrons' privacy."<ref name=":0" />

As a result of these two situations and many others, the ALA affirmed the confidential status of all records which held patron names in a ''Policy on the Confidentiality of Library Records''. The ALA also released the ALA Statement on Professional Ethics in 1975 which advocated for the protection of the "confidential relationship" between a library user and a library.<ref name=":0" />

==== 1980s ====
The FBI tried to use surveillance in library settings as part of its [[Library Awareness Program]] of the 1980s; it aimed to use librarians "as partners in surveillance." The program was known to the FBI as "The Development of Counterintelligence Among Librarians," indicating that the FBI believed that librarians might be supportive in its counterintelligence investigations. The FBI attempted to profile "Russian or Slavic-sounding last names" of library patrons to look for possible "national security threats." The FBI wanted libraries to help it trace "the reading habits of patrons with those names."<ref name=":0" />

The ALA responded by writing to the FBI director. The Intellectual Freedom Committee also created "an advisory statement to warn libraries" of the Library Awareness Program, including ways to help librarians "avoid breaking their ethical obligations if faced with FBI surveillance."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamdan|first=Sarah Shik|year=2013|title=Why library cards offer more privacy rights than proof of citizenship: Librarian ethics and Freedom of Information Act requestor policies|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=cl_pubs|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=134|via=Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2012.12.005}}</ref>

==== USA PATRIOT Act ====
In 2003, the ALA passed a resolution opposing the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which called sections of the law "a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users".<ref>{{cite web | date =2003-01-29 | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa | title =Resolution on the USA PATRIOT Act and Related Measures that Infringe on the Rights of Library Users | publisher =ALA | access-date =2010-09-01 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120203034603/http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa | archive-date =2012-02-03 }}</ref> Since then, the ALA and its members have sought to change the law by working with members of Congress and educating their communities and the press about the law's potential to violate the privacy rights of library users. ALA has also participated as an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' in lawsuits filed by individuals challenging the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act, including a lawsuit filed by four Connecticut librarians after the library consortium they managed was served with a [[national security letter]] seeking information about library users.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cowan | first = Alison Leigh | date = 2006-05-31 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/nyregion/31library.html | title = Four Librarians Finally Break Silence in Records Case | work = The New York Times | access-date =2007-02-07}}</ref> After several months of litigation, the lawsuit was dismissed when the FBI decided to withdraw the National Security Letter.<ref>{{cite web |date=2006-06-26 |url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I7WHRqQX?url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html |archive-date=2013-07-15 |url-status=live |title=FBI drops demand for information from Connecticut library group |work=Raw Story |access-date=2007-02-07 }}</ref> In 2007, the "Connecticut Four" were honored by the ALA with the Paul Howard Award for Courage for their challenge to the National Security Letter and gag order provision of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship, '' pp. 63–64. 2nd ed.

In 2006, the ALA sold humorous "radical militant librarian" buttons for librarians to wear in support of the ALA's stances on intellectual freedom, privacy, and civil liberties.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/archive/radicalbutton | title ="Radical, Militant Librarian" Button | publisher =ALA | access-date =2010-09-01 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121024044804/http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/archive/radicalbutton | archive-date =2012-10-24 }}</ref> Inspiration for the button's design came from documents obtained from the FBI by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request. The request revealed a series of e-mails in which FBI agents complained about the "radical, militant librarians" while criticizing the reluctance of FBI management to use the secret warrants authorized under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>{{cite press release|date=2006-01-17 |url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&template=/contentmanagement/contentdisplay.cfm&ContentID=113573 |title=ALA introduces "Radical, Militant Librarian" button |publisher=ALA |access-date=2007-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404072818/http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&template=%2Fcontentmanagement%2Fcontentdisplay.cfm&ContentID=113573 |archive-date=4 April 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Renaming of Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal===
In 2018, the organization changed the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal to the [[Children's Literature Legacy Award]]. According to the ''New York Times'', the name change was made "in order to distance the honor" from what the ALA described as "culturally insensitive portrayals" in Wilder's books.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chokshi |first1=Niraj |title=Prestigious Laura Ingalls Wilder Award Renamed Over Racial Insensitivity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/books/laura-ingalls-wilder-book-award.html |access-date=19 September 2018 |work=New York Times |date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>
