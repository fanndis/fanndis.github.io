===Strategic motivations===
The Chinese government maintains its actions in Xinjiang are justifiable responses to a threat of extremism and terrorism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greitens |first1=Sheena Chestnut |last2=Lee |first2=Myunghee |last3=Yazici |first3=Emir |title=Counterterrorism and Preventive Repression: China's Changing Strategy in Xinjiang |journal=International Security |date=January 2020 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=9–47|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00368|s2cid=209892080 }}</ref> Several additional potential motives for increased repression in Xinjiang have been presented in scholarly research outside of China. First, the repression may simply be the result of increased dissent within the region beginning in circa 2009; second, it may be due to changes in minority policy that promoted assimilation into Han culture; and third, the repression may be primarily spearheaded by Chen Quanguo himself, the result of his personal hardline attitudes towards perceived sedition.{{sfn|Greitens|Lee|Yazici|2020|pp=22–28|ps=: "Three common explanations for increased repression in Xinjiang appear in scholarly literature and policy analysis: (1) increased levels of contention in Xinjiang beginning around 2009; (2) resulting shifts in the CCP’s ethnic minority policies; and (3) the individual leadership of Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo."}}

Additionally, some analysts have suggested that Xinjiang is viewed as a key route for China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]] (BRI) and that the ruling Communist Party perceives its local population as a potential threat to the initiative's success, or is anxious that opening it up may lead to radicalizing influences from other BRI participant states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Anna |title=Interwoven 'Destinies': The Significance of Xinjiang to the China Dream, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Xi Jinping Legacy |journal=Journal of Contemporary China |date=2 January 2020 |volume=29 |issue=121 |pages=31–45 |doi=10.1080/10670564.2019.1621528|s2cid=191742114 }}</ref> Sean Roberts of [[George Washington University]] said the CCP sees Uyghurs' attachment to their traditional lands as a risk to the BRI.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/chinas-plan-xinjiang-seen-key-factor-uighur-crackdown|title=China's Plan in Xinjiang Seen as Key Factor in Uighur Crackdown|last1=Kashgarian|first1=Asim|date=22 December 2019|work=[[Voice of America]]|access-date=25 December 2019|last2=Hussein|first2=Rikar}}</ref> Researcher [[Adrian Zenz]] has suggested the initiative as an important factor behind the control of the Chinese government over Xinjiang.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1668516/xinjiang-crackdown-at-the-heart-of-chinas-belt-and-road|title=Xinjiang crackdown at the heart of China's 'Belt and Road'|date=28 April 2019|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|access-date=24 July 2020|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}</ref>

In November 2020, when the US dropped the [[Turkistan Islamic Party]] from its terrorist list because it was no longer "in existence", the decision was lauded by some intelligence officials because it removed the pretext for the Chinese government to introduce "terrorism eradication" campaigns against the [[Uyghurs]]. Yue Gang, a military commentator in [[Beijing]] stated however, that "in the wake of the US decision on the ETIM China might seek to increase its counterterrorism activities". The group continues to be designated as a terrorist group by the [[United Nations Security Council]] and other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lipes|first=Joshua|date=5 November 2020|title=US Drops ETIM From Terror List, Weakening China's Pretext For Xinjiang Crackdown|work=[[Radio Free Asia]]|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/etim-11052020155816.html|access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://icct.nl/app/uploads/2017/11/ClarkeKan-Uighur-Foreign-Fighters-An-Underexamined-Jihadist-Challenge-Nov-2017-1.pdf "Uighur Foreign Fighters:An Underexamined Jihadist Challenge]" ''ICCT.

Both prior to and until shortly after the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]], [[Wang Lequan]] was the [[Party Committee Secretary|Party Secretary]] for the Xinjiang region, effectively the highest subnational role; roughly equivalent to a governor in a Western province or state. Wang worked on modernization programs in Xinjiang, including industrialization, development of commerce, roads, railways, hydrocarbon development and pipelines with neighboring [[Kazakhstan]] to eastern China. Wang also constrained local culture and religion, replaced the [[Uyghur language]] with [[Standard Mandarin]] as the medium of education in primary schools, and penalized or banned among government workers (in a region in which the government was a very large employer), the wearing of beards and headscarves, fasting and praying while on the job.<ref name="nyt090710">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/world/asia/11xinjiang.html |title=A Strongman Is China's Rock in Ethnic Strife |last=Wines |first=Michael |date=10 July 2009 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/security-chiefs-failed-to-spot-signs-calling-for-uighur-revolt-tdsg765zxhg |title=Security chiefs failed to spot signs calling for Uighur revolt |last=Swain |first=Jon |date=12 July 2009 |work=The Sunday Times |access-date=12 July 2009 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2005/04/11/devastating-blows/religious-repression-uighurs-xinjiang |title=Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=11 April 2005}}</ref> In the 1990s, many Uyghurs in parts of Xinjiang could not speak Mandarin Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/china00pete/page/304|title=China the Silk Routes|author=Peter Neville-Hadley|series=[[Cadogan Guides]]|publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press]]|page=304|year=1997|quote=Travelling east from Khotan{...}Many Uighurs speak no Chinese at all, and most hotels are even less likely to have English speakers than those elsewhere in China.}}</ref>

Most of those facilities were converted from existing schools or other official buildings, although some were purpose-built.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/10/china-free-xinjiang-political-education-detainees |title=China: Free Xinjiang 'Political Education' Detainees |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>

The heavily policed region and thousands of check points assisted and accelerated the detention of locals in the camps.

Victor Shih, a political economist at the [[University of California, San Diego]], claimed in July 2019 the mass internments were unnecessary because "no active insurgencies" existed, only "isolated terrorist incidents". He suggested that because a great deal of money was spent setting up the camps, the money likely went to associates of the politicians who created them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/a-political-economist-on-how-china-sees-trumps-trade-war |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190523034716/https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/a-political-economist-on-how-china-sees-trumps-trade-war |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 May 2019 |title=A Political Economist on How China Sees Trump's Trade War {{!}} The New Y… |date=23 May 2019 |website=archive.is |access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref>

===''New York Times'' and ''ICIJ'' leaks===
{{main|Xinjiang papers|China Cables}}
On 16 November 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' released an extensive leak of 400 pages of documents, sourced from a member of the Chinese government, in the hope that CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping would be held accountable for his actions. ''The New York Times'' stated that the leak suggests discontent inside the Communist Party relating to the crackdown in Xinjiang. The anonymous government official who leaked the documents did so with the intent that the disclosure "would prevent party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions."<ref name=":1"/>

<blockquote>We must be as harsh as them and show absolutely no mercy. — Xi Jinping on the terror attacks in 2014,<!--{{citation needed span|after 3 recent terrorist attacks|date=December 2019|reason=As with all material on the Wikipedia website, a source does actually need to be provided for this claim.}}--> (translated from [[Mandarin Chinese]])<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>

One document was a manual aimed at communicating messages to Uyghur students who were returning home and would ask about their missing friends or relatives who had been interned in the camps. It said that government staff should acknowledge that the internees had not committed a crime and that "It is just that their thinking has been infected by unhealthy thoughts." Officials were directed to say that even grandparents and family members who seemed too old to carry out violence could not be spared.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=Guardian/>

''The New York Times'' stated that speeches obtained show how Xi views risks to the party similar to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], which ''The New York Times'' stated Xi "blamed on ideological laxity and spineless leadership."<ref name=":1" /> Concerned that violence in the Xinjiang region could damage social stability in the rest of China, Xi stated "social stability will suffer shocks, the general unity of people of every ethnicity will be damaged, and the broad outlook for reform, development and stability will be affected."<ref name=":1" /> Xi encouraged officials to study how the US responded following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=":1" /> Xi likened Islamic extremism alternately to a [[virus]]-like contagion and a dangerously addictive drug, and declared that addressing it would require “a period of painful, interventionary treatment.”<ref name=":1" />

The ''[[China Daily]]'' reported in 2018 that CCP official Wang Yongzhi was removed for "serious disciplinary violations."<ref name=":1" /><ref name="CD20180327">{{cite news |last1=Yin|first1=Cao|title=Xinjiang official removed, expelled|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201803/27/WS5ab9a62aa3105cdcf6514820.html |access-date=17 November 2019 |publisher=China Daily |date=27 March 2018}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' obtained a copy of Wang's confession (which the report noted was likely signed under duress) and stated that ''The New York Times'' believed he was sacked for being too lenient on Uyghurs, for example his release of 7,000 detainees. Wang had told his superiors that he was concerned that the actions against the Uyghurs would breed discontent and thus result in greater violence in the future. The leaked documents stated, "he ignored the party central leadership's strategy for Xinjiang, and he went as far as brazen defiance. ... He refused, to round up everyone who should be rounded up".<ref name=":1" /> The article was discreetly shared on the Chinese platform [[Sina Weibo]], where some netizens expressed sympathy for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1750441/china-sees-online-tributes-to-official-who-freed-uyghurs-in-xinjiang/|title="He refused": China sees online tributes to an official who freed Muslims in Xinjiang|last=Li|first=Jane|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/show-no-mercy-leaked-documents-reveal-details-of-chinas-mass-xinjiang-detentions|title='Show no mercy': leaked documents reveal details of China's Xinjiang detentions|last=Kuo|first=Lily|date=17 November 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 December 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In 2017, there were more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang for infractions or resistance in the "fight against separatism", which was more than 20 times the figure in the previous year.<ref name=":1" />

Shortly after the publication of the China Cables, leaker Asiye Abdulaheb went on to provide Adrian Zenz with the "[[Karakax list]]", allegedly a Chinese government spreadsheet that tracks the rationale behind 311 of the internments at a "Vocational Training Internment Camp" in the seat of [[Karakax County]] in Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zenz |first1=Adrian |title=The Karakax List: Dissecting the Anatomy of Beijing's Internment Drive in Xinjiang |journal=Journal of Political Risk |date=February 2020 |volume=8 |issue=2 |url=https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/ |access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> The purpose of the list may have been to coordinate judgments on whether an individual should remain in internment; in some entries, the word "agree" was written beside a judgment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e0224416-4e77-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5 |access-date=18 February 2020 |work=ft.com |date=February 2020}}</ref> Records detail how subjects dress and pray, and how their relatives and acquaintances behave.<!-- ref bbc --><ref>{{cite news |title=Uighurs 'detained for beards and veils' - leak |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51520622 |access-date=18 February 2020 |work=BBC News |date=17 February 2020}}</ref> One subject was interned because she wore a veil years ago; another was interned for clicking on a link to a foreign website; a third was interned for applying for a passport, despite posing "no practical risk" according to the spreadsheet.

==Camp facilities==
In urban areas, most of the camps are converted from existing vocational schools, CCP schools, ordinary schools or other official buildings, while in suburban or rural areas the majority of camps were specially built for the purposes of re-education.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/at-least-120000-muslim-uighurs-held-in-chinese-re-education-camps-report |title=China 'holding at least 120,000 Uighurs in re-education camps' |last=Phillips |first=Tom |date=25 January 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref> These camps are guarded by armed forces or special police and equipped with prison-like gates, surrounding walls, security fences, surveillance systems, [[watchtowers]], guard rooms and facilities for armed police etc.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/china/2018/08/18/china-suggests-its-camps-for-uighurs-are-just-vocational-schools |title=China suggests its camps for Uighurs are just vocational schools |website=The Economist |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.xjats.gov.cn/P/C/1736.htm |title=Approval opinion for the environmental impact report on Atush vocational skills training center project |access-date=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706221430/http://www.xjats.gov.cn/P/C/1736.htm |archive-date=6 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-25/china-uighur-ethnic-cleansing-xi-jinping-chinese-muslims/10033472 |title=Patriotic songs and self-criticism: why China is 're-educating' Muslims in mass detention camps |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/22/chinas-mass-internment-camps-have-no-clear-end-in-sight/ |title=China's Mass Internment Camps Have No Clear End in Sight |website=Foreign Policy |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>

While there is no public, verifiable data for the number of camps, there have been various attempts to document suspected camps based on satellite imagery and government documents.

In a 2018 report from US government-funded ''[[Radio Free Asia]]'', [[Awat County]] (Awati) was said to have three re-education camps. An RFA listener provided a copy of a "confidentiality agreement" requiring re-education camp detainees to not discuss the workings of the camps and said local residents were instructed to tell members of re-education camp inspection teams visiting No. 2 Re-education Camp, which had transferred thousands detainees and removed barbed wire from the perimeter  of the camp walls, that there was only one camp in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/preparations-12122018152245.html|title=Xinjiang Authorities 'Preparing' Re-education Camps Ahead of Expected International Monitors|date=12 December 2018|access-date=14 May 2020|publisher=Radio Free Asia|author=[[Shohret Hoshur]], Joshua Lipes}}</ref>

[[Mihrigul Tursun]], an Uyghur woman detained in China, after escaping one of these camps, talked of beatings and torture. After moving to [[Egypt]], she traveled to China in 2015 to spend time with her family and was immediately detained and separated from her infant children. When Tursun was released three months later, one of the triplets had died and the other two had developed health problems. Tursun said the children had been operated on. She was arrested for the second time about two years later. Several months later, she was detained the third time and spent three months in a cramped prison cell with 60 other women, having to sleep in turns, use the toilet in front of security cameras and sing songs praising the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview: 'I Did Not Believe I Would Leave Prison in China Alive'|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/detentions-11012018100304.html|agency=Radio Free Asia|language=en|access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref>

Tursun said she and other inmates were forced to take unknown medication, including pills that made them faint and a white liquid that caused bleeding in some women and [[loss of menstruation]] in others. Tursun said nine women from her cell died during her three months there. One day, Tursun recalled, she was led into a room and placed in a high chair, and her legs and arms were locked in place. "The authorities put a helmet-like thing on my head, and each time I was electrocuted, my whole body would shake violently and I would feel the pain in my veins," Tursun said in a statement read by a translator. "I don't remember the rest. White foam came out of my mouth, and I began to lose consciousness," Tursun said. "The last word I heard them saying is that you being an Uyghur is a crime." She was eventually released so that she could take her children to Egypt, but she was ordered to return to China. Once in Cairo, Tursun contacted U.S. authorities and, in September, came to the United States and settled in Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.apnews.com/61cdf7f5dfc34575aa643523b3c6b3fe |title=Woman describes torture, beatings in Chinese detention camp |date=27 November 2018 |work=Associated Press |access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> <!-- WP is not censored.

'''{{flag|Pakistan}}'''
* On 19 January 2020, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Imran Khan]] was asked why he was not more outspoken about the situation of Uyghurs in China. He said that he has not been as outspoken primarily because the [[Human rights abuses in Kashmir|human rights situation in Kashmir]] and [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019|Citizenship Amendment Act]] were problems much larger in scale. He said that the second reason was that China has been a [[China–Pakistan relations|great friend of Pakistan]] and had helped Pakistan through their toughest time with the economic crisis, so that "the way we deal with China is that when we talk about things, we talk about privately. We do not talk about things with China in public right now because they are very sensitive.

We also stand with Tibetan Buddhists, [[Falun Gong]] practitioners and Christians throughout China who face the worst crackdown on freedom of religion or belief since the [[Cultural Revolution]]. We urge people of faith and conscience everywhere to join us: in prayer, solidarity and action to end these mass atrocities.
