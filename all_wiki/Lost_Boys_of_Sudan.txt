'''The Lost Boys of Sudan''' was the name given to a group of over 20,000 boys of the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and [[Dinka people|Dinka]] ethnic groups. These boys were displaced or [[orphan]]ed during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1987–2005) in which about 2 million were killed and others were severely affected.<ref name=irc>[http://www.rescue.org/lost-boys-sudan Lost Boys of Sudan], official IRC website.</ref> The name "Lost Boys of Sudan" was colloquially used by aid workers in the [[refugee camps]] where the boys resided in Africa.

The boys embarked on treacherous journeys to refugee camps in [[Ethiopia]] where they were sheltered for a few years. Soon, official resettlement programs began throughout the US. The Lost Boys were offered new lives in major US cities.

==History==

===Sudanese Conflict===

The Sudanese conflict, which incited the journey of the Lost Boys, stemmed from divisions among the Arabic-speaking Islamic Northerners and the Christian, Roman Catholic, and indigenous religions in the South. Following Sudan's independence from Britain in 1956, these divisions became contentious. The northern region of the country was primarily Muslim, which contrasted ideologically and culturally with the Christian, Roman Catholic, indigenous religions, and atheists that were more prevalent in the south.<ref name="Sudan: Conflict and minorities">{{cite journal|last1=Verney|first1=Peter|title=Sudan: Conflict and minorities|journal=London: Minority Rights Group|date=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Francis |title=Sudan - Civil War and Genocide |url=https://www.meforum.org/articles/other/sudan-civil-war-and-genocide |journal=Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Middle East Forum |accessdate=June 18, 2018|date=January 2001 }}</ref> In the Northerners' minds, the South was a legitimate place of conversation because the Christian religion promotes secularization. For each side, religion constituted identity, making the conflict extremely personal for all involved. Further, the Northern population was primarily Arabic-speakers, while the South comprised an English speaking population. The new Sudanese government was dominated by Islamic Northerners who sought to Arabize and make the South an Islamic state, which had previously associated more with their African ethnicity rather than Arab. Additionally, the conflict boosted economic elements. Although the north had more of the urban centers of the nation, they depended heavily on natural resources such as oil and minerals that were found in the southern region. The interests of northern business in extracting these resources contrasted the interests of southern farmers to protect and own their own land for agriculture <ref name="Sudan: Conflict and minorities"/>  In all, these competing identities and interests created an organized civil war lasting over two decades.

===Sudanese War===

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], children were unable to adequately support themselves and suffered greatly from the terror. Many children were orphaned or separated from their families because of the systematic attacks of genocide in the southern part of the country. Some children were able to avoid capture or death because they were away from their villages tending cattle at the cattle camps (grazing land located near bodies of water where cattle were taken and tended largely by the village children during the dry season) and were able to flee and hide in the dense African bush. Some of the unaccompanied male minors were conscripted by the Islamic Southern rebel terrorist forces and used as soldiers in the rebel army, while others were handed over to the Islamic State by their own families to ensure protection, for food, and under a false impression the child would be attending school.<ref>See for example [http://emmanueljal.org/#journal/desc/1/1/34 War Child: A Child Soldier's Story] by Emmanuel Jal</ref> Children were highly marginalized during this period. As a result, they began to conglomerate and organize themselves in an effort to flee the country and the war.

===The Hardships===

Motivated by the loss of their parents and their need to find food and safety from the conflict, an estimated 20,000 boys from rural southern [[Sudan]] fled to bordering [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Biel|first1=Melha Rout|title=The Civil War in southern Sudan and its effect on youth and children.|journal=Social Work & Society|date=2003|volume=1|issue=1|pages=119–127}}</ref> Much of the travel took place by foot in large groups with the boys traveling in single file lines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eggers |first1=Dace |title=What is the What |date=November 13, 2007 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=9780307385901 |url=https://archive.org/details/whatiswhatau00egge }}</ref> The journey from South Sudan to the nearest refugee camp could be up to thousands of miles. Travel ranged from a span of weeks to two or more years. Often, the children traveled with no possessions besides the clothes on their backs.<ref name="The Lost Boys of Southern Sudan">{{cite journal|last1=Walgren|first1=Judy|title=The Lost Boys of Southern Sudan|journal=Africa Report|date=1994|volume=39.3|issue=40}}</ref> The Boys often depended on the charity of villages they passed for food, necessities, and treatment of the sick. However, most of their travel was in isolated regions with very little infrastructure. Groups of Boys were often organized and led by the oldest boy in the group, who could be a young adult or sometimes as young as ten or twelve years old.

The Lost Boys on this [[Human migration|migration]] were on average extremely [[malnourished]], as food was sourced through donations from villages encountered along the way, hunting, and theft.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> They were also vulnerable to [[heat exhaustion]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and other diseases for which they had little means of prevention or treatment.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Additionally, attacks  by lions, snakes, and other wild animals were not uncommon. It is estimated that over half of the young migrants died along their journey due to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], disease, attacks by wild animals and enemy soldiers.<ref name=journey/> Conditions were made even more dangerous by the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] soldiers, who would attack the boys or forcibly recruit them as [[child soldiers]]. The SPLA estimated that 1,200 boys were recruited from groups of displaced children, although they deny forcing any of them into conflict.<ref name="The Lost Boys of Southern Sudan"/> Experts say the Lost Boys are the most badly war-traumatized children ever examined.<ref name=irc/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The journey of the Lost Boys was filled with suffering and unknowns as the boys rarely knew the direction they were headed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The lost boys of Sudan |url=https://www.unicef.org/sowc96/closboys.htm |website=Children in War |publisher=Children in War |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>

===Arrival at refugee camps===

Initially, most of the fleeing boys went to a refugee camp in Ethiopia, until the war in 1991 sent the boys fleeing again to a different refugee camp called Kakuma, which is located in Kenya.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lost Boys of Sudan |url=https://www.rescue.org/article/lost-boys-sudan |website=International Rescue Committee |publisher=International Rescue Committee |accessdate=June 19, 2018|date=2014-10-03 }}</ref> The arrival of the Lost Boys to the [[refugee camps]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]] were welcomed to various degrees. It was difficult for the camps to provide sufficient food for the hundreds of boys arriving daily. The [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]] and involved non-governmental organizations were often constrained to meet the needs of the population. A unique problem for the story of the Lost Boys is how the age and family structure dynamics of the camps changed with the influx of young people.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Lost Boys came to the camps without guardians or adult supervision. They immediately required housing and schooling, which changed the allocation of resources in the camps. With some of the boys arriving in the camps at ages as young as 6 or 7, many of the Boys spent the majority of their childhood and adolescence being raised in the camps.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Ultimately, being raised in a refugee camp significantly altered their development and ability to assimilate into regular life.

==Current status and resettlement==

Between 1992 and 1996, [[UNICEF]] reunited approximately 1,200 Lost Boys with their families. However, about 17,000 were still in camps throughout Ethiopia and Kenya as of 1996.<ref name="unicef.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/closboys.htm|title=The lost boys of the Sudan|work=unicef.org|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> These camps' inability to sustain the additional population burden made it evident to government officials that more needed to be done.

In 2001, as part of a program established by the [[United States Government]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), approximately 3,800 Lost Boys were offered resettlement in the [[United States]].<ref name=journey/> Prior to the inception of this program, approximately 10,000 boys left the refugee camps for other opportunities, making them ineligible for the US's resettlement program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sudan: American Resettlement of "Lost Boys" Continues |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-american-resettlement-lost-boys-continues |website=Reliefweb |publisher=OCHA |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref> They are now scattered over at least 38 cities, including major metropolises such as Chicago, Dallas, Boston, Seattle and Atlanta.<ref name=irc/> Halted after [[9/11]] for security reasons, the program restarted in 2004. As of 2006, the largest population of [[Sudanese refugees]] in the United States is in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], which hosts about 7,000 people.<ref>Burbach, C. "Rally features Sudanese vice president." ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]''. July 22, 2006.</ref> Numerous resettlement agencies, such as [[Catholic Charities]], [[Lutheran Services in America|Lutheran Social Services]], the IRC ([[International Rescue Committee]]), [[World Relief]] and other privatized organizations assisted in this resettlement process. A variety of programs have been initiated to help these displaced people in areas of education, medical assistance, reconnecting with families in South Sudan and in rebuilding efforts and providing humanitarian aid in Southern Sudan.<ref name=journey>[[Joan Hecht]]. ''The Journey of the Lost Boys''</ref>

Because many boys were over the age of 18, they were unable to be placed into the foster care system. Thus, they were placed into apartment complexes with one another in hopes that they would sustain the kind of family atmosphere that was cultivated in Kakuma.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Matuszak|first=Sascha|date=January 14, 2016|title=A Lost Boy of Sudan in the Midwest MMA Circuit|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/pgnej8/a-lost-boy-of-sudan-in-the-midwest-mma-circuit|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-21|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref>

Despite the program's intention to facilitate [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], many of the Lost Boys still face difficulties in adapting to life in [[The United States]], [[Canada]], or any of the European countries that offered [[refugee resettlement]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Meade|first1=Fionn|title=The Lost Boys of Sudan|date=2002|pages=358–362}}</ref> [[Posttraumatic stress]], separation from loved ones, cultural isolation, [[racism]] and discrimination against the refugees made assimilation extremely difficult.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|last1=Luster|first1=Tom |display-authors=etal |title=The Lost Boys of Sudan: Ambiguous Loss, Search For Family, and Reestablishing Relationships with Family Members.|journal=Family Relations|volume=57|issue=4|pages=444–456|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2008.00513.x|year=2008}}</ref> Many studies have discussed a common condition among the Lost Boys of [[ambiguous loss]]. This occurs when someone experiences the loss of a family member without the closure of death, which allows for mourning and moving forward.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Moreover, a 2005 study found that 20% of Lost Boys under the age of 18 suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Geltman |display-authors=etal |first1=Paul |title=The "Lost Boys of Sudan" Functional and Behavioral Health of Unaccompanied Refugee Minors Resettled in the United States |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/02d0/4437f8c61383329b36309c8b55f116cfe01f.pdf |publisher=Semantics Scholar |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>  Resettlement to the US made it easier for many of the Lost Boys to reconnect with family members via western technology. However, it was often difficult to reunite if the boys were already in the US and the families remained in camps. South Sudan allows free access to Lost Boys/Girls and Sudanese [[Diaspora]] from around the world to return to their homeland. As a result, many are now returning to South Sudan to [[pay it forward]] and help in the rebuilding of their war-torn country, and to provide humanitarian aid and support.

In January 2011, 99.47% of South Sudanese voted to separate from the north and become an independent nation. Some American former Lost Boys and Girls now hold positions in the current [[Government of Southern Sudan (2005–2011)|Government of South Sudan]].<ref name="alliance for the lost boys">{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforthelostboys.com/|title=Alliance for the Lost Boys of Sudan - Alliance for the Lost Boys of Sudan|work=allianceforthelostboys.com|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>

=The Lost Girls=

Although there is much attention directed toward the Lost Boys, common historical narratives often ignore their counterparts, the Lost Girls. Even before the conflict, inequalities between the Lost Boys and Lost Girls were manifested in the cultural practices of the [[Dinka]] and [[Nuer people]].  This marginalization heavily influenced their post-conflict recovery and integration in refugee camps and resettlement programs.

Not unlike other parts of Africa, Sudanese women were viewed as subordinate to men in families and villages. Family law consistently gave preference to men. Male children inherited their parents' wealth after their death, and so parents strongly desired to have male children, often at the expense of the care of the females. Men were allowed to have multiple wives, and [[polygamy]] was expected if the father had no sons by his other wives.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite journal|last1=El Jack|first1=Amani|title=Education is My Mother and Father: The "Invisible" Women of Sudan|journal=Refuge: Canada's Journal on Refugees|date=2012|volume=27|issue=2}}</ref> Moreover, the use of a brideprice was common practice in Sudan, making women more of a commodity to her husband rather than a partner.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bassoff |first1=Leah |title=The Untold Story of The Lost Girls of Southern Sudan |url=https://groundwoodbooks.com/the-untold-story-of-the-lost-girls-of-southern-sudan-guest-post-by-leah-bassoff-and-laura-deluca/ |website=Groundwoodbooks |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=June 22, 2018}}</ref> Subsequently, women hold little weight within a marriage.

When conflict reached the rural parts of Southern Sudan, women were affected just as much as the men, only in different ways. Rape was rampant during attacks on villages as the attackers would use rape as a weapon of the war. Women and small children (boys and girls) were taken to the north to be sold as slaves.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harriss|first1=Anne|title=I Ain't No Girl: Representation and Reconstruction of the" Found Girls" of Sudan.|journal=Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts|date=2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=41–63|doi=10.2979/racethmulglocon.2010.4.1.41}}</ref> Further,  women and children were often forced or coerced into a trafficking situation. Once a person was involved in trafficking, it was extremely difficult for family members to relocate them.

Upon their arrival in the camps in [[Ethiopia]], the boys were placed into boys-only areas of the camp. Yet according to Sudanese culture, the girls could not be left alone, so they were placed with surviving family members or adopted by other Sudanese families.<ref name=journey/> Although these family placement practices provided security for young women, families often exploited the extra pair of hands at home. The girls were expected to fulfill numerous domestic responsibilities that were often very taxing or even dangerous.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The expectations of domestic work often prevented the girls and young women from attending school while in the camps, and even when allowed to attend, their housework often kept them behind their male classmates, who had time to study. In this way, girls were prevented from earning a formal education, further entrenching them in their inability to sustain themselves. Many girls were physically and/or sexually abused by their host families, raped by other refugees during activities such as fetching water or food rations, and occasionally, even sold as brides for profit.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In each of these examples, the girls were taken in only as a potential profit or benefit to the family.

When the US resettlement program began in 1999, one requirement was that the children must be orphans. Because these girls had been living within a family unit for anywhere from 9–14 years, they were no longer considered orphans, and therefore were ineligible for the [[Refugee resettlement|resettlement]] program. As a result, relatively few of the Lost Girls were able to benefit from the resettlement program to the US.<ref name=journey/> Of the 4,000 Sudanese refugees approved in 2000, only 89 were women.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Moreover, the stories of the Lost Girls are generally forgotten in light of their limited exposure when in the refugee camps. While the boys were encouraged to share their stories and what happened to them, girls were shunned from public light. Speaking of the rape was unacceptable and left the girls vulnerable to being blamed for the rape that occurred against them. Therefore, the Lost Boys are more focused on in literature.
