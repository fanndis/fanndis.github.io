The '''Fawcett Society''' is a membership charity in the United Kingdom which campaigns for women's rights. The organisation dates back to 1866, when [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] dedicated her life to the peaceful campaign for [[women's suffrage]]. Originally named the '''London National Society for Women's Suffrage''', and later as the '''London Society for Women's Suffrage''', the organization was renamed The Fawcett Society in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/11/millicent-fawcett-famous-quotes-7611242/|title=Who was Millicent Fawcett and what were some of her famous quotes?|date=2018-06-11|website=Metro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>

It is a charity registered with the [[Charity Commission]]<ref>{{EW charity|1108769|The Fawcett Society}}</ref> and has a membership of around 3,000. Its supporters include [[Carrie Gracie]], [[Emma Thompson]], and [[Ophelia Lovibond]].

The organisation's vision is a society in which women and girls in all their diversity are equal and free to fulfil their potential, creating a stronger, happier, better future for all.

Its key areas of campaign work include equal pay, equal power, tackling gender norms and stereotypes and defending women's rights. The Society publishes research to educate, inform and lead the debate. It aims to bring together politicians, academics, grassroots activists and wider civil society to develop innovative, practical solutions, and campaigns with women and men to make change happen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/about|title=Who we are|website=Fawcett Society|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>

There are local Fawcett Society groups across the UK, which support the campaigning work of Fawcett and organise events and activities in their areas. Locations include Devon, Milton Keynes and Tyneside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/find-a-local-group|title=Find a local group|website=Fawcett Society|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>

The library and archives of the Society, formerly the '''Fawcett Library''', are now part of the [[Women's Library]] at the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]], the main library of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/Home.aspx |title=Library - Library - Home |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}</ref>

==Governmental action==
The Fawcett Society filed papers with the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] seeking a [[judicial review]] of the government's [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget|2010 budget]], contending that the Treasury did not fully assess the impact that budget cuts would affect different groups, as is required by law. An analysis of the budget found that women would be paying around £5.8 billion of the £8 billion of savings planned. Their judicial review was denied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/fawcetts-bid-for-a-judicial-review-of-the-2010-budget/ |title=The Fawcett Society |publisher=The Fawcett Society |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022130716/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/fawcetts-bid-for-a-judicial-review-of-the-2010-budget/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead  |df= }}</ref>

In September 2020 the Society called upon the Chancellor to assist the childcare sector in the Autumn 2020 Comprehensive Spending Review, arguing that funds allocated to the UK's furlough scheme will have been wasted if parents are unable to work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Emma|date=|title=Childcare sectors in urgent need of funding, warn unions and parents|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9f4ad950-a90e-4289-ba2a-36d3292d0a2d|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-23|website=www.ft.com}}</ref>

==Gender pay gap==
In October 2020 the Society and the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College London co-published their joint report into legislation surrounding gender pay gap reporting. It found the UK lagged behind other countries in not requiring employers to produce a plan for addressing gender pay gaps, but praised the UK for its transparency and legislative compliance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Media|first=P. A.|date=2020-10-13|title=UK ‘unique in its light-touch approach’ to gender pay gap|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/14/uk-unique-in-its-light-touch-approach-to-gender-pay-gap|access-date=2020-10-14|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Society has been criticised by business groups for comparing average pay for full-time men with average-pay for part-time women to highlight the disparity,<ref>[http://www.thebusiness.co.uk/trading-floor/487086/jackie-ashleys-answer.thtml]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107140449/http://www.thebusiness.co.uk/trading-floor/487086/jackie-ashleys-answer.thtml |date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref> and a lack of transparency in making their methodology clear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timworstall.com/2008/02/25/the-fawcett-society-on-the-gender-pay-gap/ |title=The Fawcett Society on the Gender Pay Gap |publisher=Tim Worstall |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}</ref> The Society incorporated this criticism in its 2015 Gender Pay Gap methodology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/blog/calculating-the-gender-pay-gap/ |title=Calculating the gender pay gap |publisher=Fawcett Society |date=2015-11-11 |accessdate=2015-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115035843/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/blog/calculating-the-gender-pay-gap/ |archive-date=2016-01-15 |url-status=dead  |df= }}</ref> The 2015 pay gap quoted was for full-time employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/equal-pay-day-2/ |title=Equal Pay Day |publisher=Fawcett Society |date=2015-11-09|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref>

==T-Shirt and controversy==
In October 2014, the Fawcett Society in association with [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'' UK]] and the high street chain [[Whistles (company)|Whistles]] produced a new version of the society's "This Is What a Feminist Looks Like" T-shirt. A number of politicians were persuaded to wear the shirt in public, including [[Ed Miliband]] and [[Nick Clegg]], for promotional photographs, and [[Harriet Harman]] during [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] reportedly declined to wear the shirt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/29/harriet-harman-wears-feminism-t-shirt-to-pmqs |title=Harriet Harman wears feminism T-shirt to prime minister’s questions |work=The Guardian |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2014-11-02}}</ref>

The £45 shirt was produced in a [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] factory where it was believed migrant workers from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India and Vietnam were paid less than a pound a day, slept 16 to a room, and otherwise kept in [[sweatshop]] conditions.<ref>"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29868458 'Sweatshop' claims over Fawcett Society slogan T-shirt]", [[BBC News]], 2 November 2014.</ref> The Fawcett Society responded with a press release stating, "We remain confident that we took every practicable and reasonable step to ensure that the range would be ethically produced and await a fuller understanding of the circumstances under which the garments were produced."<ref name=Tshirt>{{cite web |url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/2014/11/feminist-looks-like-t-shirt-fawcett-society-response/ |title=‘This is what a feminist looks like t-shirt’: Fawcett Society Response |publisher=Fawcett Society |date=2014-11-01 |accessdate=2014-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105012324/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/2014/11/feminist-looks-like-t-shirt-fawcett-society-response/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead  |df= }}</ref> Fawcett were assured by Whistles that their suppliers were "a fully audited, socially and ethical compliant factory which has the following accreditations".<ref name=Tshirt />
