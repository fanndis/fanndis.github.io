The '''Anti-Defamation League''' ('''ADL'''), formerly known as the '''Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith''', is an international [[Jews|Jewish]] [[non-governmental organization]] based in the United States. It was founded in late September 1913 by the Independent Order of [[B'nai B'rith]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[service organization]], in the wake of the wrongful conviction for murder of [[Leo Frank]]. ADL subsequently split from [[B'nai B'rith]] and continued as an independent US section 501(c)(3) nonprofit. ADL states that its mission is a dual one: "To stop the defamation of the Jewish people, and to secure justice and fair treatment to all," via the development of "new programs, policies and skills to expose and combat whatever holds us back."<ref name="ADLCharter">{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are/our-mission|title=Our Mission|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030231725/https://www.adl.org/who-we-are/our-mission|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> With a focus on combating [[antisemitism]] and other forms of hate, and fighting domestic [[extremism]] both online and off, ADL describes its "ultimate goal" as "a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias, discrimination or hate."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, ADL rebranded itself as an "anti-hate" organization, and adopted the logo: "Fighting Hate for Good."<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Logo and Identity for ADL|url=https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_adl_by_starfish.php|access-date=October 10, 2020|website=BrandNew}}</ref>

== Origin ==
Founded in late September 1913 by [[B'nai B'rith]], with [[Sigmund Livingston]] as its first leader, the ADL's charter states, {{quote|The immediate object of the League is to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience and, if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people. Its ultimate purpose is to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens.<ref name=ADLCharter />}}
The Anti-Defamation League was founded by B'nai B'rith as a response to attacks on Jews; the recent conviction of [[Leo Frank]] was mentioned by [[Adolf Kraus]] when he announced the creation of ADL.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Deborah Dash|title=B'nai B'rith and the Challenge of Ethnic Leadership|year=1981|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-480-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/bnaibrithch00moor/page/108 108]|url=https://archive.org/details/bnaibrithch00moor/page/108}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Jews in American Politics: Essays|year=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0181-2|page=105|author=Jerome A.

== Goals ==
[[File:Jonathan Greenblatt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Greenblatt, National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League since 2015]]
The stated purpose of the ADL is to fight: {{quote|anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry (in the United States) and abroad, combat international terrorism, probe the roots of hatred, advocate before the United States Congress, come to the aid of victims of bigotry, develop educational programs, and serve as a public resource for government, media, law enforcement, and the public, all towards the goal of countering and reducing hatred.}} Historically, ADL has opposed groups and individuals it considered to be antisemitic and/or racist, homophobic, xenophobic, including: [[Nazism|Nazis]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Henry Ford]], Father [[Charles Coughlin]] (leader of the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]]), Nation of Islam leader [[Louis Farrakhan]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/ADL-pans-congressman-who-wont-condemn-Farrakhan-for-lacking-courage-544221|title=ADL pans congressman who won't condemn Farrakhan for lacking 'courage'|date=March 5, 2018|access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref> the [[Christian Identity]] movement, the [[German-American Bund]], [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], the [[Militia (United States)|American militia]] movement and [[white power skinhead]]s (although ADL acknowledges that there are also non-racist [[skinhead]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/racist_skinheads/ |title=Racist Skinhead Project |publisher=ADL}}</ref><ref>Salberg, Melvin.

April 29, 1994.</ref> 

ADL maintains that some forms of [[anti-Zionism]] -- as well as [[criticism of Israel]] that demonizes Israel, holds it to a double standard not applied to other countries, or delegitimizes the existence of the Jewish state or the right of the Jewish people to self-determination and nationhood in their ancient homeland -- can cross the line into antisemitism.<ref>{{Cite web|last=ADL|date=2020|title=Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era|url=https://antisemitism.adl.org/anti-zionism/|access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref> The organization states:
{{quote|Criticism of particular Israeli actions or policies in and of itself does not constitute anti-Semitism. Certainly the sovereign State of Israel can be legitimately criticized just like any other country in the world. However, it is undeniable that there are those whose criticism of Israel or of "Zionism" is used to mask anti-Semitism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Response To Common Inaccuracy: Israel Critics are Anti-Semites|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/fact-sheets/response-to-common-inaccuracy-israel-critics-are-anti-semites|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=May 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629155644/https://www.adl.org/resources/fact-sheets/response-to-common-inaccuracy-israel-critics-are-anti-semites|archive-date=June 29, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

=== Tracking extremists ===
During the 1930s, ADL, along with the American Jewish Committee, coordinated American Jewish groups across the country in monitoring the activities of the German-American Bund and its pro-Nazi, nativist allies in the United States. In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925 to 1931. From 1934 to 1941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of "un-American activities" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York}}</ref>

Since the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 "Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA"], George Michael.

Retrieved February 27, 2017</ref>  In April 2020, ADL joined with George Washington University's Program on Extremism to release a joint report on white supremacist terrorism, which supported additional government actions to combat the surging threat; the release of the report was timed to occur the same day that the US government, for the first time, designated a white supremacist group and individuals associated with it a Specially Designated Global Terrorist ([[Specially Designated Global Terrorist|SDGT]]) organization - akin to the [[United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]] (FTO) designation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20200407-new-report-outlines-tactics-of-modern-whitesupremacist-terrorism|title=New Report Outlines Tactics of Modern White-Supremacist Terrorism|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/report-u-s-has-struggled-to-adapt-to-changing-domestic-terrorism-landscape/|title=Report: U.S. Has Struggled to Adapt to Changing Domestic Terrorism Landscape|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref>

ADL keeps track of the activities of extremist groups and movements, primarily through its Center on Extremism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/ADL_CR_Bigots_on_Bikes_online.pdf|title=Bigots on Bikes: The Growing Links between White Supremacists and Biker Gangs|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are/our-organization/advocacy-centers/center-on-extremism|title=Center on Extremism|access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref> According to former ADL Director Abraham Foxman: "Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings ….

Some have performed great service to the American people—for example, by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps—with no recognition and at considerable personal risk."<ref>"A League of His Own", letter to the editor, ''The Village Voice'' 38:20 (May 18, 1993)</ref> A person apprehended in connection to the [[2002 white supremacist terror plot]] had drawn a cartoon of himself blowing up the Boston offices of ADL.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/national/16PLOT.html|title=Boston Couple Plotted Blasts to Incite Race War, Prosecutor Says|date=July 16, 2002|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

ADL regularly releases reports on US antisemitism and extremist activities on both the [[Far-left politics|far left]] and the [[Far-right politics|far right]]. As part of its Law Enforcement Agency Resource Network (L.E.A.R.N.), ADL has published information about the [[Militia Movement]]<ref name="militia">{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/militia-movement|title=The Militia Movement|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}</ref> in America and a guide for law enforcement officials titled ''Officer Safety and Extremists''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Officer-Safety-and-Extremists-An-Overview.pdf|title=Officer Safety and Extremists|publisher=ADL|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref> An archive of "[[Mark Pitcavage#Militia Watchdog|The Militia Watchdog]]" research on US right-wing extremism (including groups not specifically cited as antisemitic) from 1995 to 2000 is also available on ADL website.<ref name="militia" />

In the 1990s, some details of ADL's monitoring activities became public knowledge; the ADL had gathered information about some non-extremist groups which became a contentious issue. In 2013, J.M. Berger, a former nonresident fellow of the [[Brookings Institution]], wrote that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) and ADL, arguing that they are "not objective purveyors of data".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=J.

=== Separation of church and state ===
One of ADL's major focuses is [[Freedom of religion#Judaism|religious freedom]] for people of all faiths.<ref name="RelFree">{{cite web|title=Primer on the First Amendment & Religious Freedom|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/the-first-amendment-and-religious-freedom|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=May 11, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Religious Freedom|url=https://www.adl.org/what-we-do/discrimination/religious-freedom|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=May 11, 2018|language=en}}</ref> In the context of public schools, ADL has taken the position that because [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]] are religious beliefs, and the government is prohibited from endorsing the beliefs of any particular religion, they should not be taught in [[science]] classrooms: "The U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to believe the religious theories of creation (as well as other theories), but it does not permit them to be taught in public school science classes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adl.org/issue_religious_freedom/create/creationism_QA.asp |title=Religion in the Science Class?

In 2008, ADL opposed [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] in California; Prop 8 was a successful ballot proposition for a state constitutional amendment opposing same sex marriage that was subsequently overturned by the federal courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_California_Proposition_8|title=2008 California Proposition 8|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2020}} ADL submitted amicus briefs supporting same sex marriage in those cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://38.106.4.56/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentID=1228|title=BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE ET AL.

ADL has also based its support for women's equality and reproductive choice on, among other legal arguments, the argument that the state should not adopt as law a particular religious belief,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/abortion-bans-undermine-equality-for-all|title=Abortion and Religious Freedom: The Right-Wing Assault on Religious Diversity in Reproductive Freedom|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref> although the United States federal courts have not accepted this religious freedom and state/church separation line of argument.

=== Holocaust awareness ===
ADL holds the view that it is important to remember [[the Holocaust]], in order to prevent such an event from reoccurring. Along with sponsoring events opposing [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] and revisionists, ADL has been active in urging action to end modern-day [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] in places such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Darfur]], and [[Sudan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} ADL gives out its [[Courage to Care Award]] to honor rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} ADL has also sharply criticized Holocaust Denial as antisemitism and particularly singled out Facebook for its refusal to remove Holocaust denial content from its platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/01/26/auschwitz-liberation-ban-holocaust-denial-on-facebook-column/4555483002/|title=Facebook should ban Holocaust denial to mark 75th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation|last=Greenblatt|first=Jonathan|date=January 26, 2020|access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref>

ADL spoke out against an advertising campaign by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) beginning in 2003 that equated meat-eating with the [[Holocaust]]. A press release from ADL stated that, "[[PETA]]'s effort to seek 'approval' for their 'Holocaust on Your Plate' campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes [[chutzpah]] to new heights. Rather than deepen our revulsion against what the [[Nazis]] did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and find ways to make sure such catastrophes never happen again."<ref>{{cite press release |title=ADL Denounces Peta for its "Holocaust On Your Plate" Campaign; Calls Appeal for Jewish Community Support 'The Height Of Chutzpah' |publisher=ADL |date=February 24, 2003 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/4235_52.htm}}</ref> In May 2005, PETA apologized for its campaign, with PETA President [[Ingrid Newkirk]] stating that causing pain "was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry".<ref>{{cite news|title=Rabbinate to phase out 'shackle and hoist' animal slaughter.

However, PETA has a history of controversial campaigns. On May 5, 2005, PETA issued an apology for its 'Holocaust on Your Plate' exhibit, which traveled to more than 100 cities. The exhibit compared the treatment of farm animals to that of victims of the Nazi concentration camps. PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said she realized that the campaign had caused pain: 'This was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry.'}}</ref>

ADL's Education Department focuses on Holocaust and Genocide Education, primarily through its Echoes and Reflections Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://echoesandreflections.org/|title=CONFIDENTLY TEACH ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST |website=Echoes & Reflections|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Echoes and Reflections is sponsored by ADL, [[Yad Vashem]], and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|United States Holocaust Museum]]. In 2019–20, ADL's national lobbying group and the regional offices refocused efforts on federal and state funding of Holocaust and genocide education, in part as a result of the upsurge of antisemitism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/why-we-need-legislation-to-ensure-the-holocaust-is-taught-in-schools|title=Why We Need Legislation to Ensure the Holocaust is Taught in Schools|date=February 21, 2019|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>

Several of these laws, which seek to prohibit State agencies and instrumentalities from investing in companies that boycott Israel and from entering into contracts with entities that boycott Israel, have been successfully challenged in the courts. The legal challenges have primarily been brought by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|CAIR]] on First Amendment constitutional grounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/26/us/texas-bds-law/index.html|title=Texas has a law that says contractors can't boycott Israel.

In 1997, the National Center for Black-Jewish Relations of [[Dillard University]], a [[historically black college|historically black university]] in [[New Orleans]], awarded the director of ADL, [[Abraham H. Foxman]], with its first Annual [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]–Donald R. Mintz Freedom and Justice Award.

In 2004, ADL became the lead partner in the Peace and Diversity Academy, a new New York City public high school with predominantly black and Hispanic students. In celebration of [[Black History Month]], the ADL created and distributed lesson plans to middle and high school teachers about [[Shirley Chisholm]] (1924–2005), the first black woman elected to the [[US Congress]], and an important civil rights leader.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

ADL has also publicly accused a number of prominent African Americans of being antisemitic:
* ADL has catalogued a more than three-decade history of [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s espousal of antisemitic rhetoric such as claims that certain Jews are "not real Jews" and that they are "wicked deceivers of the American people" who "sucked [Americans'] blood", and that powerful Jews promote homosexuality and control black leadership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/farrakhan_own_words2/farrakhan_own_words.asp |title=Farrakhan In His Own Words |publisher=ADL}}</ref> Farrakhan first attracted the attention of the ADL with comments in a March 11, 1984, radio broadcast saying that, "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was a very great man".<ref name="finalcall">{{cite journal |title=Farrakhan and the Jewish Rift; How It All Started |journal=[[The Final Call]] |url=http://www.finalcall.com/perspectives/rift.html}}</ref> Farrakhan insists that he was using the word 'great' in the sense of 'Great Depression' or 'great white shark'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.noi.org/judaism-religion/|title=Minister Farrakhan rebuts fraudulent "Judaism is a Gutter Religion" canard|date=August 5, 2010}}</ref> and on June 24, 1984, he described the Jewish state as "structured on injustice, thievery, lying and deceit and using the name of God to shield your dirty religion under His holy and righteous name."<ref name="finalcall" /> ADL has urged various groups including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (whose leader [[Benjamin Chavis]] developed a working relationship with Farrakhan in 1994) to dissociate themselves from Farrakhan and his views.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Foxman |first=Abraham H. |author-link=Abraham Foxman |date=July 20, 1994 |title=Today's N.A.A.C.P.

* Film Director [[Spike Lee]] was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for his portrayal of Jewish nightclub owners Moe and Josh Flatbush in his film ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990). The Anti-Defamation League said that the characterizations of the nightclub owners "dredge up an age-old and highly dangerous form of anti-Semitic stereotyping", and it was "disappointed that Spike Lee – whose success is largely due to his efforts to break down racial stereotypes and prejudice – has employed the same kind of tactics that he supposedly deplores".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 16, 1990 |title=Spike Lee's Jews and the Passage From Benign Cliche Into Bigotry|journal=[[The New York Times]] |author=Caryn James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-spike-lee-s-jews-passage-benign-cliche-into-bigotry.html}}</ref> Lee's portrayal also angered the B'nai B'rith and other such Jewish organizations, causing Lee to address the criticism in an opinion piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'', where he stated "...if critics are telling me that to avoid charges of anti-Semitism, all Jewish characters I write have to be model citizens, and not one can be a villain, cheat or a crook, and that no Jewish people have ever exploited black artists in the history of the entertainment industry, that's unrealistic and unfair.".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 22, 1990 |title=I Am Not an Anti-Semite|journal=[[The New York Times]] |author=Spike Lee|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/082290lee-editorial.html}}</ref>
* During the 2002 election cycle, ADL, in a letter to ''The New York Times'', harshly criticized [[Congressional Black Caucus]] member [[Cynthia McKinney]] of Georgia for launching attacks perceived as racial against her Jewish opponent. According to an August 19, 2002, article in ''The New York Times'', ADL Director Abraham Foxman said, "It made sense that Jewish Americans would want to contribute to efforts to replace Ms. McKinney".

=== Interfaith camp ===
ADL's New England Regional Office has also established a faith-based initiative called "The Interfaith Youth Leadership Program", better known as "Camp If", or Camp Interfaith. Involving teenagers of the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic faiths, the camp brings the teens together for a week at camp where the teens bond and learn about each other's cultures. The camp has emerged as a new attempt to foster good relations between younger members of the Abrahamic faiths.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Siek |first=Stephanie V. |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A different kind of camp |journal=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/06/a_different_kind_of_camp/}}</ref>

=== Arab American and African American lawsuit against ADL ===
In 1996, ADL settled a federal civil lawsuit filed by groups representing [[African Americans]] and [[Arab Americans]] that alleged that the ADL hired agents with police ties to gather information. ADL did not admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to a restraining injunction barring ADL from obtaining information from state employees who are forbidden by law to divulge such information. ADL also agreed to contribute $25,000 to a fund that funds inter-community relationship projects, and cover the plaintiffs' legal costs of $175,000.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-04/news/mn-40507_1_anti-defamation-league Anti-Defamation League Settles Lawsuit by Civil Rights Groups], LA Times, September 4, 1996</ref><ref>[https://www.jta.org/1996/09/06/archive/adl-to-pay-200000-to-settle-suit-alleging-spying-activities ADL to Pay $200,000 to Settle Suit Alleging Spying Activities], JTA, September 6, 1996</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QM1hloeMQqgC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22Anti-Defamation+League%22+settlement+1996&source=bl&ots=d1L3G8qgX8&sig=Auo9IfPqSIcVRuL2g7zlDpFJTF4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjO5Y7Pr7XfAhWQDuwKHeNbB1MQ6AEwC3oECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Anti-Defamation%20League%22%20settlement%201996&f=false American Jewish Year, Book 1998], page 96</ref>

=== Armenian Genocide controversy ===
{{undue weight section|date=February 2019}}
In 2007, Abraham Foxman came under criticism for his stance on the [[Armenian Genocide]]. ADL had previously described it as a "massacre" and an "atrocity," but not as a "genocide."<ref name="http">{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5114_00.htm|title=ADL Statement on the Armenian Genocide|date=August 21, 2007}}</ref> Foxman had earlier opposed calls for the US Government to recognise it as a "genocide".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/feature/2007-07-09/fire_foxman |title=Fire Foxman: Denying the Armenian Genocide should be the last atrocity perpetrated by the ADL chief.}}</ref> In early August 2007, complaints about the Anti-Defamation League's refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]] led to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]]'s, unanimous town council decision to end its participation in ADL's "No Place for Hate" campaign. (Watertown is known for its Armenian population.) In the subsequent months, some [[human rights]] commissions in other Massachusetts communities decided to follow Watertown's lead and withdraw from the ADL's No Place for Hate anti-discrimination program.<ref name="Woolhouse">{{cite news|last=Woolhouse|first=Megan|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/12/05/adls_regional_leader_resigns/|title=ADL's regional leader resigns: Backers cite rift on genocide issue|date=December 5, 2007|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Esker/medford@cnc.com|first=Sharon Tosto|url=http://medford.wickedlocal.com/x96464381|title=City recognizes Armenian genocide, suspends ADL membership|work=Medford Transcript|access-date=May 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  ADL had earlier received direct pressure from the Turkish Foreign ministry.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/911393.html טורקיה לישראל: עזרו לנו לעצור הכרה אמריקאית בשואה הארמנית] Haaretz, 10/10/07, Barak Ravid</ref>

Also in August 2007, an editorial in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' criticized ADL by saying that, "as an organization concerned about human rights, it ought to acknowledge the [[genocide]] against the Armenian people during [[World War I]], and criticize Turkish attempts to repress the memory of this historical reality."<ref>{{cite news |date= August 3, 2007 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2007/08/03/a_genocide_not_to_be_denied/ |title=A genocide not to be denied |work=[[Boston Globe]]}}</ref>

On August 17, 2007, ADL fired its regional [[New England]] director, Andrew H.

The 2007 ADL "Statement on the Armenian Genocide," was criticized by activists as failing to be a full, unequivocal acknowledgment of the [[Armenian genocide]], because the use of the qualifier "tantamount" was seen as inappropriate, and the use of the word "consequences" was seen as an attempt to circumvent the international legal definition of genocide by avoiding any language that would imply intent, a crucial aspect of the 1948 UN [[Genocide Convention]] definition.

On May 13, 2016, [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], then ADL's CEO and National Director for less than a year, published a blog post in which he wrote "What happened to the Armenian people was unequivocally genocide" and urged the US to take a position recognizing the Armenian genocide.<ref>[[Jonathan Greenblatt|Greenblatt, Jonathan]] (May 13, 2016) [https://www.adl.org/blog/adl-on-the-armenian-genocide "ADL on the Armenian Genocide"] Anti-Defamation League website</ref>  In late 2019, ADL publicly endorsed and lobbied for a historic Congressional resolution commemorating the Armenian genocide, which passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-endorses-congressional-resolution-commemorating-the-armenian-genocide|title=ADL Endorses Congressional Resolution Commemorating the Armenian Genocide|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/armenian-genocide-resolution.html|title=House Passes Resolution Recognizing Armenian Genocide|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/senate-armenian-genocide.html|title=Senate Passes Resolution Recognizing Armenian Genocide, in Defiance of Trump|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref> The US Senate passed a similar resolution, which was also backed by ADL, but in December 2019 the Trump administration, under pressure from Turkey's President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], refused to back recognition of the Armenian genocide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-armenian-genocide-erdogan-turkey-native-americans-a9250281.html|title=Trump refuses to back recognition of Armenian genocide after Erdogan threat|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

=== Denver defamation suit ===
In 1994, ADL became embroiled in a dispute between neighbors in Denver, Colorado. Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of antisemitism, and counter charges of defamation.

Candace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with "Nazi scare tactics," the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not antisemitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.

Not knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as "a vicious antisemitic campaign," based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.

Two days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.

The Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

Upon investigation, and after assistant district attorney Steven Jensen heard on the tapes the context of Mrs. Quigley's remarks, all charges but one, a misdemeanor traffic violation against Mr. Quigley, were dropped. The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in "anti-Semitic conduct or harassment."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>

The Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.

According to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge "lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>

=== New antisemitism controversy ===
{{main|New antisemitism}}
A book entitled ''The [[New antisemitism|New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein argued that a new kind of antisemitism is on the rise. A subsequent book, ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'' (New York, 1982) was written by ADL national leader Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter. In ''Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: "We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s—if not a greater one."<ref name="adl.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism |publisher=ADL}}</ref>

Reviewing Forster and Epstein's work in a May 1974 issue of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]], argued that a "new anti-Semitism" was indeed emerging in America, in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias.<ref>Raab, Earl. "Is there a New Anti-Semitism?", ''Commentary'', May 1974, pp. 53–54.</ref> Allan Brownfeld writes that Forster and Epstein's new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into "a form of political blackmail" and "a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East,"<ref>{{cite journal|title = Anti-Semitism: Its Changing Meaning|last = Brownfeld|first = Allan|journal = [[Journal of Palestine Studies]]|publisher = [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]|issn = 1533-8614|volume = 16|issue = 3|year = 1987|pages = 53–67|doi = 10.2307/2536789|jstor = 2536789}}</ref> while Edward S. Shapiro, in ''A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II'', has written that, "Forster and Epstein implied that the new anti-Semitism was the inability of Gentiles to love Jews and Israel enough."<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Edward S.|title=A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801843471/page/47 47]|isbn=0-8018-4347-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801843471/page/47}}</ref>

[[Norman Finkelstein]] has written that organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s, "not to fight antisemitism, but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism."<ref name=Finkelstein21>{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|title=Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History|publisher=University of California Press|year=2005|pages=21–22}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has reported that the ADL has repeatedly accused Finkelstein of being a "[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]]," and that "these charges have proved baseless."<ref name="WP sparks">{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Michael |date=October 9, 2006 |title=In N.Y., Sparks Fly Over Israel Criticism |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |pages=A03 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/08/AR2006100800817.html}}</ref>

=== Park51 Community Center controversy ===
On July 28, 2010, ADL issued a statement in which it expressed opposition to the [[Park51]] Community Center, a proposed Islamic community center and mosque near the [[World Trade Center site]] in New York. ADL stated, "The controversy which has emerged regarding the building of a Community Center at this location is counterproductive to the healing process. Therefore, under these unique circumstances, we believe the City of New York would be better served if an alternative location could be found."<ref name="berk" /> ADL denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project. Foxman opined that some of those who oppose the mosque are "bigots," and that the plan's proponents may have every right to build the mosque at that location. Nevertheless, he said that building the mosque at that site would unnecessarily cause more pain for families of some victims of 9/11.<ref name="berk">Jacob Berkman, [http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2010/07/30/2740283/adl-opposes-world-trade-center-mosque ADL opposes World Trade Center Mosque] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803005159/http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2010/07/30/2740283/adl-opposes-world-trade-center-mosque |date=August 3, 2010 }}, [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], July 30, 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jacoby |first=Susan |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/spirited_atheist/2010/08/ground_zero_mosque_protected_by_first_amendment--but_its_still_salt_in_a_wound.html |title=The Spirited Atheist: Ground Zero mosque protected by First Amendment – but it's still salt in a wound|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 6, 2010 |access-date=April 24, 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817115334/http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/spirited_atheist/2010/08/ground_zero_mosque_protected_by_first_amendment--but_its_still_salt_in_a_wound.html| archive-date= August 17, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="nytimes6">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/opinion/l05mosque.html | work=The New York Times | title=The ADL, the Mosque and the Fight Against Bigotry | date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/CvlRt_32/5820_32.htm "Statement On Islamic Community Center Near Ground Zero"], Anti-Defamation League, July 28, 2010.</ref>
