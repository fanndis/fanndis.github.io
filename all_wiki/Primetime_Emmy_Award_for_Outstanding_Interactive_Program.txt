The '''[[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Interactive Program''' is presented to integrated interactive experiences for linear [[Broadcast programming|television programming]]. According to Emmy rules, this includes "excellence in the combined, overall interactive media execution for an existing program or series, containing programming and features that extend the program experience beyond passive viewing, often across multiple platforms." Examples include behind-the-scenes content, commentary, story and character extensions, and social audience interaction or input that drives the program forward.<ref name=69thRules>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/2017-rules-procedures-v3.pdf |title=69th Primetime Emmy Awards 2016-2017 Rules and Procedures |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |page=33 |date= |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, categories were renamed and reclassified.  '''Outstanding Original Interactive Program''' honors work not related to an existing television program or series. '''Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media within a Scripted Program''' and '''Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media within a Unscripted Program''' recognize interactive experiences for both scripted TV and documentary, nonfiction, reality and reality-competition programs. '''Outstanding Innovation in Interactive Programming''' encourages pioneering interactive experiences, based on "exceptional distinctiveness, inventiveness, and relevance of the submitted work in expanding and redefining the conventions of interactive media experiences."<ref name=69thRules /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/awards-170224 |title=Two New Categories and Rules Modifications |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |date=February 24, 2017 |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>
