The Twin Cities metro and their surrounding suburbs contain about 3.64&nbsp;million people, making it the third-largest economic and population center in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|16th-largest metropolitan area in the US]].<ref name=IHS>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmayors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/US-Metro-Economies_Sept-2017-1.pdf|title=US Metro Economies|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=IHS Markit|access-date=March 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617065013/http://www.usmayors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/US-Metro-Economies_Sept-2017-1.pdf|archive-date=June 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Minneapolis lies on both banks of the [[Mississippi River]], just north of the river's confluence with the [[Minnesota River]], and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with [[list of lakes in Minneapolis|13 lakes]], wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the [[Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway]]. Due in part to its high degree of accessibility, the city is often ranked as having one of the best park systems in the US.<ref>{{cite web |title=2020 ParkScore Index |url=https://www.tpl.org/parkscore |website=The Trust for Public Land ParkScore |publisher=The Trust for Public Land |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> Minneapolis was once the world's flour [[mill (grinding)|milling]] capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between [[Chicago]] and [[Seattle]], as well as the largest urban population area between the two cities. Minneapolis is home to five [[Fortune 500]] companies, and the Twin Cities are the fifth-largest hub of major corporate headquarters in the US.

Anchoring strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning [[Guthrie Theater]] and the historic [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue nightclub]]. Reflecting the region's status as a center of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Underground and independent hip-hop and rap scenes produced artists such as [[Lizzo]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], and [[Dessa]]. Minneapolis is often ranked as one of the best cities in the US for [[cycling|biking]].

==Etymology==
Before its incorporation, the city was known by several different names. The [[Dakota language|Dakota]] name for Minneapolis is ''Bdeóta Othúŋwe'' ('Many Lakes City').<ref name=decolonial>{{Cite web|url=https://decolonialatlas.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/minneapolis-st-paul-in-dakota-and-ojibwe/|title=Minneapolis–St. Paul in Dakota and Ojibwe|date=January 20, 2018|publisher=Decolonial Atlas|accessdate=November 29, 2020}}</ref> The ''St. Paul Pioneer''  dubbed it facetiously "All Saints" anticipating that the town might absorb its neighbors St. Paul and [[Saint Anthony, Minnesota|St. Anthony]]. First west-bank settler [[John H. Stevens]] preferred "Hennepin" for the town and "Snelling" for the county. It was called "Lowell" for its water features, "Addiesville" or "Adasville" for a daughter of settler [[Charles Hoag]], "Winona" by those who wished to preserve indigenous language, and "Brooklyn". "Albion" was recorded by the newly organized county government but a majority of residents rejected that name. The city's first schoolmaster, Hoag was searching for indigenous syllables, when he stumbled on "[[Indianapolis]]". In the ''St. Anthony Express,'' Hoag proposed "Minnehapolis," with a silent ''h,'' to combine the Dakota word for "waterfall", ''Mníȟaȟa,''<ref name=decolonial /> and the Greek word for "city", {{lang|el|polis}}. ''Express'' editor George Bowman and Daniel Payne dropped the ''h'', leaving out the ''hah,'' to create ''Minneapolis,'' meaning 'city of the falls'.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Atwater|editor1-first=Isaac|title=History of the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota|chapter=Early Settlement," "History and Incidents of Banking," and "Pioneer Life in Minneapolis—From a Woman's Standpoint|last1=Baldwin|first1=Rufus J.|last2=Atwater|first2=Isaac|pages=29–48, 80, 498 [39]|publisher=Munsell & Company|date=1893|oclc=22047580|volume=1|url=https://archive.org/details/historycityminn00atwagoog/}} and {{cite book |title=Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society|chapter=Minnesota Journalism in the Territorial Period|last1=Johnston|first1=Daniel S.

===Dakota natives, city founded===
The [[Dakota people|Dakota Sioux]] were the region's sole residents when French explorers arrived in 1680. Gradually, more European-American settlers arrived, competing for game and other resources with the Native Americans. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], British land east of the Mississippi River became part of the United States.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) ''Treaty of Paris''] (1783), Article 2.

===Waterpower; lumber and flour milling===
Minneapolis developed around [[Saint Anthony Falls]], the highest waterfall on the [[Mississippi River]] and a source of power for its early industry. Forests in northern Minnesota were a valuable resource for the [[lumber]] industry, which operated seventeen [[sawmill]]s on power from the waterfall.

By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses, including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frame|first1=Robert M., III|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Hess |title=West Side Milling District, Historic American Engineering Record MN-16 |publisher=US National Park Service (via US Library of Congress) |page=2 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&fileName=mn/mn0100/mn0100/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=2&itemLink=r?pp/hh:@FIELD(DOCID+@BAND(@lit(MN0100))) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702035218/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&fileName=mn%2Fmn0100%2Fmn0100%2Fdata%2Fhhdatapage.db&recNum=2&itemLink=r%3Fpp%2Fhh%3A%40FIELD%28DOCID%2B%40BAND%28%40lit%28MN0100%29%29%29 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 2, 2014 |date=January 1990 |access-date=April 16, 2007 }}</ref> Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]] business by the 1890s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hart|first=Joseph |url=http://www.citypages.com/1997-06-11/news/lost-city/full/ |date=June 11, 1997 |newspaper=City Pages |title=Lost City |access-date=October 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104062935/http://www.citypages.com/1997-06-11/news/lost-city/full/ |archive-date=November 4, 2013 }}</ref> The farmers of the [[Great Plains]] grew [[cereal|grain]] that was shipped by rail to the city's thirty-four [[gristmill|flour mills]].

Different forms of bigotry played roles during the first half of the 20th century. In 1910, a Minneapolis developer started writing restrictive covenants based on race and ethnicity into his deeds. Copied by other developers, the practice prevented minorities from owning or leasing certain properties. Though such language was prohibited by state law in 1953 and by the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act of 1968]], restrictive covenants against minorities remained in many Minneapolis deeds as recently as 2017.<ref>About 10,000 such covenants remain as of 2017, in: {{cite news|title=Massive project works to uncover racist restrictions in Minneapolis housing deeds|url=http://www.startribune.com/massive-project-underway-to-uncover-racist-restrictions-in-minneapolis-housing-deeds/441821703/|last=Furst|first=Randy|date= August 26, 2017|newspaper=Star Tribune}} and {{cite journal|last1=Delegard|first1=Kirsten|first2=Kevin|last2=Ehrman-Solberg|year=2017|title='Playground of the People'?
