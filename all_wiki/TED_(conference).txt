==History==

===1984–1999: Founding and early years===
[[File:Bill Clinton talking at TED 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] addresses TED, 2007]]
TED was conceived in 1984 by Emmy-winning broadcast and graphic designer [[Harry Marks (broadcast designer)|Harry Marks]], who observed a [[technological convergence|convergence]] of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, "TED"). He approached architect and graphic designer [[Richard Saul Wurman]] for assistance, who agreed on the condition that he be allowed to be a co-founder.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-04-27|title=Remembering Harry Marks, co-founder of the TED Conference|url=https://blog.ted.com/remembering-harry-marks-co-founder-of-the-ted-conference/|access-date=2020-10-11|website=TED Blog|language=en}}</ref> The first conference, organized that same year by Marks and Wurman with help from Dr. Frank Stanton, featured demos of the [[compact disc]], co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and one of the first demonstrations of the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.<ref name="addict"/><ref name="forum">Cadwalladr, Carole [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr TED – the ultimate forum for blue-sky thinking] July 4, 2010, [[The Guardian]], Retrieved September 20, 2012.</ref> Presentations were given by famous mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and influential members of the [[digerati]] community, like [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Stewart Brand]]. The event was financially unsuccessful; hence, it took six years before the second conference was organized.<ref name="ted.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/16|title=History of TED {{!}} Our Organization {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

TED2 was held at the Monterey Conference Center in California in 1990. From 1990 onward, a growing community of "TEDsters" gathered annually with Wurman leading the conference in Monterey until 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ted.com/a-last-hurrah-at-the-monterey-conference-center-31-years-later/|title=A last hurrah at the Monterey Conference Center, 31 years later|date=2015-05-27|website=TED Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> when it was relocated to [[Long Beach, California]] due to a substantial increase in attendees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/will-the-ted-conference-elite-yield-something-concrete-for-the/article_7fe99b74-56c5-55f0-93e0-973d191e3f54.html|title=Will the TED conference elite yield something concrete for the rest of us?|last=May|first=Tina|date=February 28, 2008|website=Monterey County Weekly|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Victoria|title=Long Beach to host influential TED conference|date=January 16, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/business/fi-ted16|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.<ref name="ted.com"/>

===2000–present: Recent growth===
[[File:Chris Anderson 2007.jpg|thumb|Curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] in 2007]]
In 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company [[Future plc|Future]] bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The [[Sapling Foundation]] (motto: "fostering the spread of great ideas")<ref name=howtedworks/> acquired TED from Future for £6m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref> In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of [[curator]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted.html|title=TED's nonprofit transition|last=Anderson|first=Chris|website=ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Wurman left after the 2002 conference.

In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/invitations|title=Getting Invited (attendees)|work=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|access-date=February 7, 2009}}</ref> The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2018 conference was $10,000 per attendee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/ted-conference#h3--ted-conference-standard-membership|title=TED Conference|website=ted.com|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref>

Between 2001 and 2006, TED upgraded its platform to have TED talks online for free, added TEDGlobal that became a worldwide conference, and created the TED prize.

In 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

TED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as [[Google]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[AOL]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=How TED Works|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works|website=TED.com|access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name=americanu>{{cite web|last1=Ochoa|first1=Rosmari|title=Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED): A case study on how complementary on- and off-line approaches can build community and cultivate platforms for innovation and creativity|url=https://www.american.edu/soc/communication/upload/Rosemari-Ochoa.pdf|website=American University School of Communication|publisher=American University|access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, TED staff consisted of about 180 people headquartered in [[New York City]] and [[Vancouver]], B.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/who-we-are|title=Who we are - Our organization - About - TED|website=TED.com|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> On July 1, 2019, the TED Conferences LLC was transferred from Sapling Foundation to TED Foundation to "align with our brand and make it easier for our donors to connect TED donations to TED Conferences, LLC."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works |title=How TED works  |publisher=TED |access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.com.pg/excellent-learning-platform/|title=Excellent learning platform|last=Pitoi|first=Seik|date=2020-01-17|publisher=The National (Papua New Guinea)|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>

At TED 2015, [[Bill Gates]] warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] began. The ensuing pandemic prompted the 2020 edition of the event to be initially postponed from April to July 2020 before its outright cancellation.<ref>[https://blog.ted.com/ted2020-postponed-to-july-26-30/ TED2020 postponed to July 26-30]</ref>

==TED Prize==
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world".<ref>[[Bruno Giussani]]. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruno-giussani/ted-2008-day-2-dave-egger_b_89106.html "Day 2: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion"], ''Huffington Post'', February 28, 2008</ref> Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing [[urbanization]]. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/|title=TED Prize {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=tedprize.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> TED Prize winners in previous years:

TED Conference commissioned New York artist [[Tom Shannon (artist)|Tom Shannon]] to create a prize sculpture to be given to all TED Prize winners. The sculpture consists of an {{convert|8|in|cm|spell=in|adj=mid|-diameter}} aluminum sphere magnetically levitated above a walnut disc.

In 2005, Chris Anderson hired [[June Cohen]] as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.<ref name="giving">{{cite web |title=Giving Away Information, but Increasing Revenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16ecom.html |publisher=NYT |access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector|title=TED|work=YouTube|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.<ref name="giving"/><ref name="CFP">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=M|title=Benefits of TED Talks|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1080|pmid=25500595|pmc=4264800}}</ref>

As of October 2020, over 3500 TED talks had been posted.<ref name="numbertalks"/> Every week 5 to 7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/27/ted-anniversary/|title=With 500 Million Views, TED Talks Provide Hope for Intelligent Internet Video|last=Kessler|first=Sarah|website=Mashable|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.<ref name="billion"/> Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
<blockquote>It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/teds-chris-anderson|title=TED's Chris Anderson|website=Departures|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

In March 2012, [[Netflix]] announced a deal to [[streaming media|stream]] an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content was made available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/03/15/netflix-to-stream-ted-talks/|title=Netflix To Stream TED Talks|last=Savitz|first=Eric|website=Forbes|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Hosted by Jami Floyd, ''[[#TED.com|TED Talks NYC]]'' debuted on [[NYC Media|NYC Life]] on March 21, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=TED TALKS IN NYC –FEATURING WORLD-RENOWNED TALKS FROM TED.COM – PREMIERES ON NYC LIFE |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |access-date=January 17, 2012 |newspaper=.nyc.gov |date=March 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |archive-date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>

===TEDGlobal===
In 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in [[Oxford]], UK (2005), in [[Arusha]], Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in [[Edinburgh]], UK (2011, 2012, and 2013). In 2014, it was held in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/ted_conferences_about_past_teds_v2|title=Past TEDs {{!}} Conferences {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Additionally, there was TED India, in [[Mysore]] (2009) and TEDGlobal London in [[London]] (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tedgloballondon_programbrochure.pdf|title=TEDGlobal>London Tuesday 16 June 2015|website=tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com|access-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> TEDGlobal 2017 was held again in Arusha, Tanzania and it was curated and hosted by Emeka Okafor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ted-global-2017-arusha-tanzania|title=Ten years on, TEDGlobal is tackling Africa's education crisis|last=Christian|first=Bonnie|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>

===TED Translators (formerly The Open Translation Project (OTP))===
TED Translators started as the TED Open Translation Project in May 2009. It intends to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/OpenTranslationProject|title=TED Open Translation Project|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> The OTP used crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program. (Until May 2012 it worked with its technology partner [[dotSUB]], and then with the [[Open-source software|open source]] translation tool [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]]). When the project was launched, 300 translations had been completed in 40 languages by 200 volunteer transcribers.<ref name="TED"/> By May 2015, more than 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/otp-2014-annual-report|title=2014 annual report: TED Open Translation Project {{!}} Translate {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amara.org/en/teams/ted/|title=Dashboard - TED {{!}} Amara|website=amara.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

The project helped generate a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website. Traffic from outside the US has increased 350 percent: there has been 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-1-year-anniversary-teds-open-translation-project-celebrates-more-than-7000-completed-translations-from-4000-volunteers-in-75-languages-93683249.html|title=At 1-Year Anniversary, TED's Open Translation Project Celebrates More Than 7,000 Completed Translations From 4,000 Volunteers in 75 Languages|website=prnewswire.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

===TED Fellows===
[[File:TEDGlobal2012.jpg|thumb|TEDGlobal 2012 at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]]]]
TED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia.

In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).

2019 marked the tenth anniversary of the TED Fellows program.

Acceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic [[credential]]s, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/248|title=Application tips {{!}} Apply to be a TED Fellow {{!}} TED Fellows Program {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with [[mentorship|mentoring]] by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the "TED Fellows" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|title=Wired meets 2011's TED Fellows|last=Rowan|first=David|date=July 18, 2011|website=Wired|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175312/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|archive-date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

===TED-Ed===
TED-Ed is a [[YouTube]] channel from Ted which creates short animated educational videos. It also has its own website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref> TED-Ed lessons are created in collaboration with educators and animators. Current advisers for Ted-Ed lessons include [[Aaron Sams]], Jackie Bezos, John Hunter, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French Gates]], and [[Sal Khan]]. It has over 18.5 million subscribers and over 1.5 billion views as of September 2020.

Season Four began in March 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] as a live-stream broadcast co-hosted by Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers and often offered listeners the opportunity to submit questions to the speaker.

===TEDMED===
{{Main|TEDMED}}

[[TEDMED]] is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/tedmed_a_new_pa/|title=TEDMED: a new partnership|date=January 19, 2010|website=TED Blog|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]], who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodosh's ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.<ref name=":0" />

The second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego. It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.<ref>{{Citation|last=TEDMED|title=Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne with Nathaniel Pearson at TEDMED 2010|date=December 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX0culYjU_A|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news

==Criticism==

===Pricing===
Frank Swain, a deaf journalist, refused to participate in a TEDx event without getting paid. He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges TED attendees $6,000 but prohibits organisers of the smaller, independently organized TEDx events from paying anything to speakers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/futures-exchange/why-im-not-a-tedx-speaker-3be652b8eccb|title=Why I'm Not a TEDx Speaker|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=November 8, 2013|website=Medium|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Speakers and performers at official TED events are not compensated for their talks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/about/conferences/speaking-at-ted|title=Speaking at TED|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

[[Sarah Lacy]] of ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a "hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.<ref name="techcrunch.com">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/ted-now-with-more-elitism/|title=TED: Now with More Elitism?|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref>

===TED Talk content===
Disagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] referred to adopting a "retarded" child. TED organizer [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] objected via his [[Twitter]] account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/14/ted-organizer-trashes-speaker-fails-social-iq-test/|title=TED Organizer Trashes Speaker, Fails Social IQ Test|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/the-ted-v-sarah-silverman-fight-turns-really-retarded/|title=The TED v.

Also in 2010, statistician [[Nassim Taleb]] called TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers". He claimed TED curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their site on purely cosmetic grounds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|year=2010|title=The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a New Section: 'On Robustness and Fragility'|url=https://archive.org/details/blackswanimpacth00tale_767|url-access=limited|publisher=Random House Trade|page=[https://archive.org/details/blackswanimpacth00tale_767/page/n367 336]|isbn=978-0-8129-7381-5}}</ref>

[[Nick Hanauer]] spoke at TED University, challenging the belief that top income earners in America are the engines of job creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/here-is-the-full-inequality-speech-and-slideshow-that-was-too-hot-for-ted/257323/|title=Here Is the Full Inequality Speech and Slideshow That Was Too Hot for TED|author=National Journal|date=May 17, 2012|work=The Atlantic|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> TED was accused of censoring the talk by not posting it on the website.<ref name=IBT>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/342291/20120517/ted-censors-nick-hanauer-talk-income-inequality.htm|title=TED Censors Seattle Multimillionaire Nick Hanauer?s Talk On Income Inequality, Taxing The Rich|date=May 17, 2012|work=International Business Times|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/too-hot-for-ted-income-inequality-20120516|title=Too Hot for TED: Income Inequality|work=nationaljournal.com|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> The ''[[National Journal]]'' reported Chris Anderson had reacted by saying the talk probably ranked as one of the most politically controversial talks they had ever run, and they needed to be careful about when they posted it.<ref name=IBT/> Anderson officially responded, indicating that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tedchris.posterous.com/131417405|title=Good night, Posterous|website=tedchris.posterous.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Forbes]]'' staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as "shoddy and dumb"<ref>Bruce Upbin.

Following a TEDx talk by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that "there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims" made in the talk and recommended that it "should not be distributed without being framed with caution". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were "simply not true" since Sheldrake's talk was still on their website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/19/the-debate-about-rupert-sheldrakes-talk/ |title=The debate about Rupert Sheldrake's talk |publisher=TED |date=March 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Bignell, Paul |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ted-conference-censorship-row-8563105.html |title=TED conference censorship row |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=April 7, 2013}}</ref> A 2013 talk by [[Graham Hancock]], promoting the use of the drug [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], was treated in the same way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ted.com/the-debate-about-graham-hancocks-talk/|title=The debate about Graham Hancock's talk|date=2013-03-19|website=TED Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref><ref name="a fresh take"/>

According to Professor [[Benjamin H. Bratton|Benjamin Bratton]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted "We need to talk about TED"], Prof. Benjamin Bratton, ''The Guardian'', December 30, 2013</ref> Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/ted-not-civilisational-disaster-but-wikipedia "TED is not a recipe for civilisational disaster"], Chris Anderson, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2014</ref>
