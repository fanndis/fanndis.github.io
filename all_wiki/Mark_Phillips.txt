==Equestrian career==
Phillips was a reserve member of the British equestrian team for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. He was part of the British [[three-day event]] teams that won a world title in 1970, a European title in 1971 and Olympic gold medals in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]; individually, he finished in 35th place in 1972. At the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], his horse sustained a pulled muscle and could not complete the individual three-day event, but Phillips won a silver medal with the British team. Phillips was a four-time champion at the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], in 1971 and 1972 on ''Great Ovation'', in 1974 on ''Colombus'', and in 1981 on ''Lincoln''. It was through his equestrian activities that he met Princess Anne, the only daughter of Elizabeth II and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who he married. Their own daughter [[Zara Tindall|Zara]] later won a silver medal in the three-day event with the British team at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]].<ref name=sr>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ph/mark-phillips-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418040948/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ph/mark-phillips-1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 April 2020|title=Mark Phillips|publisher=Sports Reference|access-date=16 May 2018}}</ref>

In 1998, Phillips designed the cross-country venue for the [[Red Hills Horse Trials]], a qualifying event for the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] located in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], United States.

It is believed that Phillips declined a [[peerage]] from the Queen, which would have allowed his children to use [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy titles]].{{refn|As female-line grandchildren of the Sovereign, Princess Anne's children were never eligible for the style "Royal Highness" or the title "Prince/Princess" under the terms of [[George V]]'s [[letters patent]] of 1917.
