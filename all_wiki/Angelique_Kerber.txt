At the latter, Kerber also received a first-round bye and defeated [[Mona Barthel]] to set up a rematch of her Olympic final against [[Monica Puig]], which she won in straight sets.

Kerber went out in the fourth round of [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], losing to eventual champion Garbiñe Muguruza. Due to Kerber's early exit and Simona Halep's loss to Johanna Konta in the quarterfinals, Karolína Plíšková became the new No. 1 after the tournament.

Her woes continued into the US hard court swing where she lost to [[Sloane Stephens]] in the opening round of the [[2017 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]]. She suffered another opening-round loss to Ekaterina Makarova at the [[2017 Western & Southern Open]] despite having a match point, and another first round loss to [[Naomi Osaka]] as the defending champion at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].

Following the withdrawal of [[Petra Kvitová]], however, Kerber was promoted to 9th Seed, and the match was cancelled. She defeated [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]] in straight sets in the first round, but she retired from her match against [[Dayana Yastremska]] due to a left-hamstring injury, with Kerber down one set and a break.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/1572067/yastremska-moves-past-injured-kerber-in-adelaide|title=Yastremska moves past injured Kerber in Adelaide|website=Women's Tennis Association|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> At the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Kerber defeated [[Elisabetta Cocciaretto]], [[Priscilla Hon]], and [[Camila Giorgi]], before falling to [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]] in the fourth round.

==Playing style==
Kerber is a defensive baseliner, who has been noted for her speed, agility, athleticism, and footwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/angelique-kerber-serena-williams-wimbledon-2018-final-nick-bollettieri-column-a8447661.html|title=Wimbledon 2018: Angelique Kerber's athleticism told in final victory over Serena Williams|website=[[The Independent]]|date=14 July 2018|access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref> She is known for her counterpunching style of play, extending rallies to attempt to draw an error out of more aggressive players and to win points relatively easily. Kerber has powerful groundstrokes, allowing her to hit winners from frequently defensive positions. Her forehand is widely considered her most dangerous weapon, with her being able to hit powerful shots with disguise and speed. Kerber is known for hitting her backhand whilst squatting, allowing her to generate considerable power and to create sharp angles on the court. Her serve is considered her major weakness, rarely serving aces and hitting, on average, fewer service winners than many of her fellow players. Her second serve is a particular weakness, and is highly susceptible to attack, meaning that she rarely wins more than 50 percent of second serve points. Kerber, however, is one of the best returners on the WTA tour, ranking consistently in the top 50 players based on percentage of return points won.

==Sponsors==
Kerber has endorsement deals with [[Adidas]], her clothing and shoe sponsor, and [[Yonex]], her racquet sponsor. In early 2015, she became global ambassador of [[Stuttgart]] car manufacturer [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AngeliqueKerberOfficial/photos/a.153791464698322.39272.112796148797854/763631963714266/?type=3&theater|title=Angelique Kerber – Timeline|website=Facebook|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> In late 2016 she signed a deal with insurance group [[Assicurazioni Generali|Generali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellerossingh/2016/10/30/for-tennis-star-angelique-kerber-sponsorship-millions-beckon/#e4f9a5010657|title=For Tennis Star Angelique Kerber, Sponsorship Millions Beckon|website=Forbes|date=2016-10-30|accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> In late 2016, she became beauty ambassador for the US cosmetics company Bare Minerals, a [[Shiseido]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bareminerals.de/on/demandware.store/Sites-BareEscentualsDE-Site/default/Landing-Show?cid=CA_BM_BrandAmbassador | title=bareMinerals | publisher=bareMinerals | accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref> In 2017, she became the global brand ambassador for Australian health snack brand Slim Secrets<ref>{{cite web|title=The 'Secrets' Out – International Sporting Star Angelique Kerber Partners with Australian Brand|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secrets-international-sporting-star-angelique-042300964.html|website=Yahoo!
