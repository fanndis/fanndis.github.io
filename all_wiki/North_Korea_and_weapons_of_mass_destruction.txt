North Korea's nuclear weapons program dates back to the 1980s. Focusing on practical uses of [[Nuclear power in North Korea|nuclear energy]] and the completion of a nuclear weapon development system, North Korea began to operate facilities for uranium fabrication and conversion, and conducted [[high-explosive]] detonation tests.<ref name="globalsecurity" /> In 1985 North Korea ratified the NPT but did not include the required safeguards agreement with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] until 1992.<ref name="IAEAfactsheet2003" /> In early 1993, while verifying North Korea's initial declaration, the IAEA concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete. When North Korea refused the requested special inspection, the IAEA reported its noncompliance to the [[UN Security Council]]. In 1993, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], but suspended that withdrawal before it took effect.<ref name="IAEAfactsheet2003" />

Under the 1994 [[Agreed Framework]], the U.S. government agreed to facilitate the supply of two light water reactors to North Korea in exchange for North Korean disarmament.<ref>[http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/agreedframework The U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework at a Glance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201065709/http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/agreedframework |date=December 1, 2010}} Fact Sheet, Arms Control Association.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/09/nuclear.northkorea |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201172536/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/09/nuclear.northkorea |archive-date=December 1, 2016}} additional text.</ref> Such reactors are considered "more proliferation-resistant than North Korea's graphite-moderated reactors",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/acda/factshee/wmd/nuclear/npt/dprk.htm |title=Non-Proliferation Treaty |publisher=Dosfan.lib.uic.edu |date=October 21, 1994 |access-date=March 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306030123/http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/acda/factshee/wmd/nuclear/npt/dprk.htm |archive-date=March 6, 2012  }}</ref> but not "proliferation proof".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1908571.stm |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609102529/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1908571.stm |archive-date=June 9, 2009}} additional text.</ref> The Agreed Framework was undermined by a Republican Congress during Clinton's presidency, as Congress denounced the agreement with North Korea, imposed new sanctions on North Korea, and hindered the Clinton administration from providing the supplies to North Korea that were part of the Agreed Framework.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108562225/type/book|title=On the Brink: Trump, Kim, and the Threat of Nuclear War|last=Jackson|first=Van|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108562225|edition=1|pages=31–32|doi=10.1017/9781108562225.002}}</ref> Implementation of the Agreed Framework foundered, and in 2002 the Agreed Framework fell apart, with each side blaming the other for its failure.

On March 17, 2007, North Korea told delegates at international nuclear talks that it was preparing to shut down its main nuclear facility.

On February 7, 2016, roughly a month after the alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4|a satellite]] into [[orbit]] around the Earth. [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]] had warned the North to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged "the relevant parties" to "refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35515207 |title=North Korea fires long-range rocket despite warnings |work=BBC News |language=en-GB |access-date=February 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208080648/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35515207 |archive-date=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

By 2002, the United States believed North Korea was pursuing both [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] technology and plutonium reprocessing technologies in defiance of the Agreed Framework. North Korea reportedly told American diplomats in private that they were in possession of nuclear weapons, citing American failures to uphold their own end of the Agreed Framework as a motivating force. North Korea later "clarified" that it did not possess weapons yet, but that it had "a right" to possess them, despite the Agreed Framework. In late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea began to take steps to eject [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspectors while re-routing spent [[fuel rod]]s to be used for plutonium reprocessing for weapons purposes. As late as the end of 2003, North Korea claimed that it would freeze its nuclear program in exchange for additional American concessions, but a final agreement was not reached.

North Korea's plutonium-based [[nuclear reactor]]s are located at the [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]], about 90&nbsp;km north of [[Pyongyang]].
* One Soviet-supplied IRT-2000 research reactor, completed in 1967.<ref>Joo, Seung-Hoo (2000). ''Gorbachev's Foreign Policy Toward the Korean Peninsula, 1985–1991: Power and Reform''. E.

The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] estimated that this reactor could have been used to produce up to 1–2&nbsp;kg of plutonium, though the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee said that the amount was no more than a few hundred grams.<ref>[http://www.isis-online.org/publications/dprk/DPRKplutoniumFEB.pdf The North Korean Plutonium Stock, February 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017211603/http://www.isis-online.org/publications/dprk/DPRKplutoniumFEB.pdf |date=October 17, 2012}} by David Albright and Paul Brannan, Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), February 20, 2007.</ref>
* A newer nuclear reactor with a capacity of 5&nbsp;[[MWe]]. This gas-graphite moderated [[Magnox]] type reactor is North Korea's main reactor, where practically all of its plutonium has been produced. A full core consists of 8,000 fuel rods and can yield a maximum of 27–29&nbsp;kg of plutonium if left in the reactor for optimal burnup.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:wGkjyeC74ZAJ:www.isis-online.org/publications/dprk/dprkplutonium.pdf+8000+fuel+rods+27+29+kg+plutonium&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiEpLQFX_EwxvBe1hzu7oFxYV_G9wGdWcvwYfzQTShQHy-CyCmLFbGYMvM6TYG5GH5nFFMZQgzIGHd0tDhGb5hhBCMZt8d92xyFdqO80zd_GgoEeAE1PvJjqrVAkj0F0ehkf4eY&sig=AFQjCNE1josvTXYwm2uJfhVb51vboNGzOQ Albright, David; Brannan, Paul (June 26, 2006)]</ref> The North Korean Plutonium Stock, Mid-2006, is estimated to be able to produce 0.9 grams of plutonium per thermal megawatt every day of its operation.

There are three known cores which were unloaded in 1994 (under IAEA supervision in accordance with the [[Agreed Framework]]), 2005, and 2007.

:In 1989, the 5&nbsp;MWe reactor was shut down for a period of seventy to a hundred days. In this time it is estimated that up to fifteen kilograms of plutonium could have been extracted. In 1994, North Korea unloaded its reactors again. The IAEA had these under full surveillance until later being denied the ability to observe North Korean power plants.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). |url=http://www.iaea.org/index.html |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |access-date=November 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025084033/http://www.iaea.org/index.html |archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> Under normal operation, the reactor can produce about 6&nbsp;kg of plutonium per year although the reactor would need to be shut down and the fuel rods extracted to begin the plutonium separation process. Hence, plutonium separation stages alternate with plutonium production stages. Reprocessing (also known as separation) is known to have taken place in 2003 for the first core and 2005 for the second core.
* Two [[Magnox]] reactors (50&nbsp;[[MWe]] and 200&nbsp;MWe), under construction at Yongbyon and [[Taechon]]. If completed, 50&nbsp;MWe reactor would be capable of producing 60&nbsp;kg of plutonium per year, enough for approximately 10 weapons and 200&nbsp;MWe reactor 220&nbsp;kg of plutonium annually, enough for approximately 40 weapons. Construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the [[Agreed Framework]], and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly.<ref>Busch, Nathan E. (2004).

GlobalSecurity.org.</ref> Faced with diplomatic pressure after [[UN Security Council Resolution 825]] and the threat of American military [[air strike]]s against the reactor, North Korea agreed to dismantle its plutonium program as part of the [[Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Agreed Framework]] in which South Korea and the United States would provide North Korea with [[light water reactor]]s and [[fuel oil]] until those reactors could be completed.

Because the light water reactors would require [[enriched uranium]] to be imported from outside North Korea, the amount of reactor fuel and waste could be more easily tracked, making it more difficult to divert nuclear waste to be reprocessed into plutonium. However, the Agreed Framework was mired in difficulties, with each side blaming the other for the delays in implementation; as a result, the light water reactors were never finished. In late 2002, after fuel aid was suspended, North Korea returned to using its old reactors.

In 2006, there were eight sites identified as potential test explosion sites for current (and future) tests according to a statement by the South Korean Parliament. These sites are distinguished from a number of other nuclear materials production facilities in that they are thought to be most closely identified with a military, or potentially military purpose:<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ko:북한내 핵실험 가능 추정지역 최소 8곳 |work=BreakNews |date=October 6, 2006 |access-date=November 1, 2009 |url=http://www.breaknews.com/sub_read.html?uid=50691&section=section1 |trans-title=Minimum of eight nuclear test in North Korea can be estimated |language=ko |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927143849/http://www.breaknews.com/sub_read.html?uid=50691&section=section1 |archive-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

==== Highly enriched uranium program ====
North Korea possesses uranium mines containing an estimated 4 million tons of high-grade uranium ore.<ref>[https://fas.org/nuke/guide/dprk/nuke/ Nuclear Weapons Program – North Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016162520/http://fas.org/nuke/guide/dprk/nuke/ |date=October 16, 2015}} History section paragraph 1.

Prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] of Pakistan allegedly, through Pakistan's former top scientist, [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], supplied key data, stored on CDs, on uranium enrichment and information to North Korea in exchange for [[Missile#Technology|missile technology]] around 1990–1996, according to U.S. [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officials. President [[General Pervez Musharraf|Pervez Musharraf]] and Prime minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] acknowledged in 2005 that Khan had provided [[Zippe-type centrifuge|centrifuges]] and their designs to North Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4180286.stm |title=Khan 'gave N Korea centrifuges' |work=BBC News |date=August 24, 2005 |access-date=March 1, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531181150/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4180286.stm |archive-date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> In May 2008, Khan, who had previously confessed to supplying the data on his own initiative, retracted his confession, claiming that the Pakistan Government forced him to be a "scapegoat". He also claimed that North Korea's nuclear program was well advanced before his visits to North Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4964884&page=1 |title=ABC News: ABC Exclusive: Pakistani Bomb Scientist Breaks Silence |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC News (USA) |date=May 30, 2008 |access-date=March 1, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001083025/https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4964884&page=1 |archive-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

Highly enriched uranium (HEU) program was publicized in October 2002 when the United States asked North Korean officials about the program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2335231.stm |title=N Korea 'admits nuclear programme |access-date=October 5, 2006 |date=October 17, 2002 |work=BBC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822055919/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2335231.stm |archive-date=August 22, 2006}}</ref> Under the Agreed Framework, North Korea explicitly agreed to freeze plutonium programs (specifically, its "graphite moderated reactors and related facilities"). The agreement also committed North Korea to implement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, in which both Koreas committed not to have enrichment or reprocessing facilities. The United States argued North Korea violated its commitment not to have enrichment facilities.

In December 2002, claiming North Korean non-compliance, the United States persuaded the KEDO Board to suspend fuel oil shipments, which led to the end of the Agreed Framework. North Korea responded by announcing plans to reactivate a dormant nuclear fuel processing program and power plant north of Pyongyang. North Korea soon thereafter expelled [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations inspectors]] and announced a unilateral "withdrawal" from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

In 2007, a Bush administration official assessed that, while there was still a "high confidence" that North Korea acquired materials that could be used in a "production-scale" uranium program, there is only a "mid-confidence" level such a production-scale uranium (rather than merely plutonium) program exists.<ref name=nyt-uranium-program>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/washington/01korea.html |title=U.S. Had Doubts on North Korean Uranium Drive |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 1, 2007 |first1=David E. |last1=Sanger |first2=William J. |last2=Broad |date=March 1, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416015348/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/washington/01korea.html |archive-date=April 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=wp-uranium-program>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/28/AR2007022801977.html|title=New Doubts on Nuclear Efforts by North Korea|work=The Washington Post|date=March 1, 2007|access-date=March 1, 2007|first=Glenn|last=Kessler|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411105831/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/28/AR2007022801977.html|archive-date=April 11, 2007}}</ref>

====Defense Intelligence Agency====
On August 8, 2017, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported recent analysis completed the previous month by the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] which concluded that North Korea had successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit in missiles and could have up to 60 nuclear warheads in its inventory.<ref name=wp-20170808>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/north-korea-now-making-missile-ready-nuclear-weapons-us-analysts-say/2017/08/08/e14b882a-7b6b-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html |title=North Korea now making missile-ready nuclear weapons, U.S. analysts say |first1=Joby |last1=Warrick |first2=Ellen |last2=Nakashima |first3=Anna |last3=Fifield |newspaper=Washington Post |date=August 8, 2017 |access-date=August 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817235008/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/north-korea-now-making-missile-ready-nuclear-weapons-us-analysts-say/2017/08/08/e14b882a-7b6b-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2017  }}</ref>

By 2019 the DIA estimated that North Korea had accrued a stockpile of 65 weapons' worth of fissile material and that the country was producing as much as twelve weapons' worth of fissile material annually. U.S. intelligence also assessed that North Korea had built around 30 fissile material cores for use in nuclear weapons, including four-to-six two-stage thermonuclear weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Panda|first=Ankit|title=Kim Jong Un and the Bomb - Survival and Deterrence in North Korea|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2020}}</ref>

====Siegfried S. Hecker====
On August 7, 2017, [[Siegfried S. Hecker]], former director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] who has visited North Korea nuclear facilities many times on behalf of the U.S., estimated that North Korea's stockpile of plutonium and highly enriched uranium was probably sufficient for 20 to 25 nuclear weapons. He assessed that North Korea had developed a miniaturized warhead suitable for medium-range missiles, but would need further tests and development to produce a smaller and more robust warhead suitable for an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) and re-entry into the atmosphere. He considered the warhead as the least developed part of North Korea's plans for an ICBM.<ref name=cisac-20170807>{{cite web |url=https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/news/hecker-how-deal-north-korea |title=Hecker: Talk to North Korea to avert a nuclear disaster |author=Elisabeth Eaves, Siegfried S.

== Chemical and biological weapons ==
North Korea began to develop its own [[chemical industry]] and [[chemical weapon]] (CW) program in 1954, immediately following the end of the [[Korean War]]. However, substantial progress was not made until the 1960s, when [[Kim Il-sung]] "issued a 'Declaration for Chemicalization' whose aim was to further develop an independent chemical industry capable of supporting various sectors of its economy, as well as support chemical weapons production" and established North Korea's [[Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau]].<ref name="NTICW">[http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/chemical/ North Korea: Chemical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224150425/http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/chemical/ |date=February 24, 2017}} [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (last updated December 2016).</ref>

=== History ===
In the 1960s, DPRK first received shipments of short-range ballistic missiles from its main ally, the Soviet Union. The first weapons of this kind to be delivered were the tactical [[2K6 Luna|FROG-series]].<ref name=rand-2012>{{cite report|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR1268.html |title=Characterizing the North Korean Nuclear Missile Threat |first=Markus |last=Schiller |publisher=RAND Corporation |id=TR-1268-TSF |isbn=978-0-8330-7621-2 |year=2012 |access-date=January 19, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205010548/http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR1268.html |archive-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> In the late 1970s or early 1980s, the DPRK received several longer range [[Scud]]-B missiles from Egypt (which in turn received those missiles from the [[USSR]], Bulgaria and Poland). The USSR had refused to supply Scuds to North Korea, but North Korea has produced missiles based on its design.<ref name=rand-2012 /> A local production basis was established, and the first modified copy was named [[Hwasong-5]]. With time, more advanced types of missiles were developed. Eventually North Korea equipped itself with [[ballistic missile]]s, capable of reaching Japan. In the 1990s, North Korea sold medium-sized nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan in a deal facilitated by China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVjhy7I2lDAC&pg=PA263 |title=Asian Strategic And Military Perspective |author=Ravi Shekhar Narain Singh |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-8170622451 |year=2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102194756/https://books.google.com/books?id=LVjhy7I2lDAC&pg=PA263 |archive-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref>

North Korea's ability to deliver weapons of mass destruction to a hypothetical target is somewhat limited by its missile technology. In 2005, North Korea's total range with its [[Rodong-1|Nodong]] missiles was estimated as 900&nbsp;km with a 1,000&nbsp;kg payload.<ref name=rand-2012 /> That is enough to reach South Korea, and parts of Japan, Russia, and China. The [[Hwasong-10]] is a North Korean designed [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]] with range capabilities of up to 2,490&nbsp;km (1,550&nbsp;mi), and could carry a nuclear warhead.

In an online interview published in 2006, the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Defense]]'s analyst Hideshi Takesada argued that North Korea's desire of unification is similar to [[North Vietnam]], and warned of the possibility of North Korea's compulsory merger with South Korea by threats of nuclear weapons, taking advantage of any possible decrease in the U.S. military presence in South Korea, after North Korea deploys several hundred mobile ICBMs aimed at the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excite-webtl.jp/world/english/web/?wb_url=http%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.nikkeibp.co.jp%2Farticle%2Ftopics%2F20060907%2F109414%2F&wb_lp=JAEN&wb_dis=2&wb_submit=+%96%7C+%96%F3+ |title=Nikkei Interview Article Computer Translation |publisher=Excite-webtl.jp |access-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref> In 2016, Israeli analyst [[Uzi Rubin]] said that the missile program had demonstrated "remarkable achievements".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/pro/remarkable-achievements-north-korean-missile-programs-are-far-from-bluff/ |title=Remarkable achievements: North Korean missile programs are far from bluff |first=Uzi |last=Rubin |work=NK News |date=August 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118093348/https://www.nknews.org/pro/remarkable-achievements-north-korean-missile-programs-are-far-from-bluff/ |archive-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

==International responses==
{{see also|Sanctions against North Korea|List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea|Agreed Framework|Six-party talks}}
[[File:President Trump Meets with Chairman Kim Jong Un (48164732021).jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], North Korean Chairman [[Kim Jong-un]], and South Korean President [[Moon Jae-in]] in the demilitarized zone in 2019]]
In the 1990s, the United States negotiated the [[Agreed Framework]] to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons program while pursuing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This broke down when North Korea's clandestine uranium enrichment program came to light in 2002, after which China convened the [[Six-party talks]] to negotiate a step-by-step process to denuclearization. The Six-party talks stalled after multiple North Korean nuclear and missile tests, leading to increased international [[Sanctions against North Korea]], including a series of [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea|sanctions resolutions]] imposed by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. In 2018, Presidents [[Moon Jae-in]] of South Korea and [[Donald Trump]] of the United States held a series of summits with Kim Jong-un which led to declarations in favor of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

==International Inspections==
On October 31, 2018, lawmaker Kim Min-ki of South Korea's ruling [[Democratic Party of Korea]] issued a statement revealing that officials from South Korea's National Intelligence Service had observed several of North Korea's nuclear and missile test sites and that they were now ready for the upcoming international inspections.<ref name=oct31observe>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/north-korea-reportedly-readies-nuclear-missile-sites-for-inspectors.html</ref> Kim also stated that the now inactive North Korean [[Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site]] and the [[Sohae]] Satellite launching ground were included in these observations.<ref name=oct31observe /> The visit by the intelligence officials was in tandem with the September 2018 Pyongyang Agreement, which saw North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un agree to close Sohae and allow international experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad.<ref name=oct31observe /> The international experts will also be allowed to witness the dismantling of other North Korean nuclear and missile test sites as well.<ref name=oct31observe /> Yongbyon, the main nuclear facility in North Korea, has also been inactive during the past year as well, but has not yet completely closed.<ref name=oct31observe />
