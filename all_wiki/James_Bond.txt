The '''''James Bond''''' series focuses on a fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] agent created in 1953 by writer [[Ian Fleming]], who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], [[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Jeffery Deaver]], [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] and [[Anthony Horowitz]]. The latest novel is ''[[Forever and a Day (novel)|Forever and a Day]]'' by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2018. Additionally [[Charlie Higson]] wrote a series on [[Young Bond|a young James Bond]], and [[Samantha Weinberg|Kate Westbrook]] wrote three novels based on the [[The Moneypenny Diaries|diaries of a recurring series character]], [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]].

The character—also known by the code number 007—has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over [[US$]]7.04&nbsp;billion in total, making it the [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|sixth-highest-grossing film series]] to date, which started in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] as Bond. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been twenty-four films in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series]]. The most recent Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), stars [[Daniel Craig]] in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (a 1967 [[Parody|spoof]] starring [[David Niven]]) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', both starring Connery). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9&nbsp;billion,<ref>{{cite web|last=Adejobi|first=Alicia|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spectre-movie-james-bond-brand-worth-13bn-off-back-monster-box-office-dvd-sales-1525914|title=Spectre movie: James Bond brand worth £13bn off the back of monster box office and DVD sales|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=27 October 2015|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> making ''James Bond'' one of the [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].

The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received [[Academy Award]] nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]]. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as "[[Bond girl]]s".

== Publication history ==
=== Creation and inspiration ===
{{Main|James Bond (literary character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}
Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]]. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] and [[30 Assault Unit]] during the Second World War, admitting that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war".<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" /> Among those types were his brother, [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] and [[Greece in World War II|Greece]] during the war.<ref name="PF Obit (1971)">{{cite news|title=Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer|newspaper= The Times|date=20 August 1971|page=14}}</ref> Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]] and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale]].<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" />

The name James Bond came from that of the American [[ornithologist]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive [[field guide]] ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".<ref>{{cite news |title=James Bond, Ornithologist, 89; Fleming Adopted Name for 007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/17/obituaries/james-bond-ornithologist-89-fleming-adopted-name-for-007.html |access-date=22 August 2019 |newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> He further explained that:

{{Quote|text= When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.|sign= Ian Fleming|source=''[[The New Yorker]]'', 21 April 1962<ref name="Hellman (1962)">{{cite web |last= Hellman |first=Geoffrey T. |title= Bond's Creator |url= https://www.newyorker.com/archive/1962/04/21/1962_04_21_032_TNY_CARDS_000268062 |id= section "Talk of the Town" |work= The New Yorker |access-date=9 September 2011 |author-link=Geoffrey T. Hellman|page=32|date= 21 April 1962}}</ref>}}

On another occasion, Fleming said: "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=112}}

[[File:Hoagy Carmichael - 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hoagy Carmichael]]—Fleming's view of James Bond]]
Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and himself{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}} and in [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." Likewise, in [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']], [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is "certainly good-looking&nbsp;... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}}

Fleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,<ref name="Cook (2004)">{{cite news |last=Cook |first=William |title=Novel man |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=28 June 2004|page=40}}</ref> with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" />

It was not until the penultimate novel, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] in cinemas and [[Sean Connery]]'s depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=205}} In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in ''[[The Times]]'', Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]], and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of [[Vaud]], Switzerland.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=59}} Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]'s fictional biography of Bond, ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'', gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,{{sfn|Pearson|2008|p=21}} while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=27}}

[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=208}}]]
Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author<ref name="Lycett (DNB)">{{cite ODNB|last= Lycett |first=Andrew|title=Fleming, Ian Lancaster (1908–1964) (subscription needed)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33168|accessdate=7 September 2011|authorlink=Andrew Lycett|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33168|year=2004}}</ref> and had told a friend, "I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories."<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)">{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title= Bond – the real Bond|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=36|date=5 April 2008}}</ref> On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, ''Casino Royale'', at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=4}} where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1|loc=ch 1}}

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) [[William Plomer]] to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], an established travel writer.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books—''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''—published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.

In 1954 [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1954}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=y}}) to adapt his novel [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']] into a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|one-hour television adventure]] as part of its ''[[Climax!]]'' series.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=14}} The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred [[Barry Nelson]] as "Card Sense" James Bond and [[Peter Lorre]] as Le Chiffre.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=11}} The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for "Combined Intelligence", while the character [[Felix Leiter]]—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed "Clarence Leiter".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=101}}

In 1973 a [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]: The British Hero'' featured [[Christopher Cazenove]] playing a number of such title characters (e.g. [[Richard Hannay]] and [[Bulldog Drummond]]). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from

[[File:McLusky007.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John McLusky's rendition of James Bond]]
In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=6}} After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=316}} To aid the ''Daily Express'' in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, [[John McLusky]], however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too "outdated" and "pre-war" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}} The first strip, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=7}}

Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's ''Colonel Sun''; the works were written by [[Henry Gammidge]] or Jim Lawrence with [[Yaroslav Horak]] replacing McClusky as artist in 1966.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the ''Daily Express'' and ''[[Sunday Express]]'' until May 1977.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}}

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']]'s release in October 1962, a [[comic book]] adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' anthology series.{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}} It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |author-link=Mark Evanier |publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |access-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021094626/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |archive-date=21 October 2011 }}</ref>{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}}

=== Role-playing game ===
From 1983 to 1987, a licensed [[tabletop role-playing game]], ''[[James Bond 007 (role-playing game)|James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', was published by [[Victory Games (Avalon Hill)|Victory Games]] (a branch of [[Avalon Hill]]) with it being designed by [[Gerard Christopher Klug]].

{{Main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}

=== Guns ===
For the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a [[Beretta 418]]{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=160}} calling it "a lady's gun—and not a very nice lady at that!"<ref>{{cite news|title=Bond's unsung heroes: Geoffrey Boothroyd, the real Q|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/5320024/Bonds-unsung-heroes-Geoffrey-Boothroyd-the-real-Q.html|access-date=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 May 2009}}</ref> Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his [[Beretta]] for a [[.32 ACP|7.65mm]] [[Walther PP]]K and this exchange of arms made it to ''Dr. No''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the [[Berns-Martin]] triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in ''Dr. No'', M introduces him to Bond as "the greatest small-arms expert in the world".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Bond also used a variety of [[rifle]]s, including the [[Savage Model 99]] in "For Your Eyes Only" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in "The Living Daylights".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the [[Colt Detective Special]] and a long-barrelled [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45 Army Special]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}}

The first Bond film, ''Dr. No'', saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=94}} which Bond used in eighteen films.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}} In ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the [[Walther P99]] [[semi-automatic pistol]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}}
[[File:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Aston Martin DB5]] as seen in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.]]

=== Vehicles ===
In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey [[Bentley 4½ Litre|Bentley {{frac|4|1|2}} Litre]] with an [[Amherst Villiers]] [[supercharger]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=62–63}} After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in ''Moonraker'', Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}} During ''Goldfinger'', Bond was issued with an [[Aston Martin DB Mark III]] with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}}

The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Aston Martin V8 Vantage]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} during the 1980s, the [[V12 Vanquish]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} and [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=182}} during the 2000s, as well as the [[Lotus Esprit]];{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=202}} the [[BMW Z3]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} [[BMW 750iL]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} and the [[BMW Z8]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a [[Citroën 2CV]] to a [[AEC Routemaster|Routemaster]] Bus, amongst others.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=175}}

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]], first seen in ''Goldfinger'';{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=180}} it later featured in ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', ''Casino Royale'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''Spectre''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|pp=180–181}}<ref name="Obs: french">{{cite news|last=French|first=Philip|title=Skyfall – review|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review|date=28 October 2012|author-link=Philip French|location=London|page=32}}</ref> The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,1&nbsp;million to an unnamed European collector.<ref>{{cite news|title=James Bond car sold for over £1m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4633986.stm|access-date=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2006}}</ref> In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/8092441/James-Bond-Aston-Martin-DB5-sells-for-2.6m.html|title=James Bond Aston Martin DB5 sells for 拢2.6m|author=Andrew English|date=28 October 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped [[attaché case]] in ''From Russia, with Love'', although this situation changed dramatically with the films.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Tricia|title=James Bond's "Pussy" and Anglo-American Cold War Sexuality|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=September 2005|volume=28|issue=3|pages=309–317|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00215.x}}</ref> However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films ''Dr. No'' and ''From Russia with Love'' had an effect on the novel ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=234}}

For the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=112}} ''Dr. No'' provided no spy-related gadgets, but a [[Geiger counter]] was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in ''From Russia with Love'', which he described as "a classic 007 product".<ref name="Davey">{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Andy|title=Left to his own devices|format=abridged from print copy|journal=[[Design Week]]|date=3 October 2002|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/left-to-his-own-devices/1103407.article|access-date=7 November 2011}}</ref> The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=169}}

{{Quote box|quote="If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!"|source=—Q, to Bond, ''Licence to Kill''|width = 20em||align =left}}
Davey noted that "Bond's gizmos follow the [[zeitgeist]] more closely than any other&nbsp;... nuance in the films"<ref name="Davey" /> as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films.<ref name="Davey" /> It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie [[autogyro]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|pp=200–201}} a [[Jet pack#Bell Textron Rocket Belt|jet pack]]{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=128}} and the exploding attaché case,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=221}} the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices,<ref name="Davey" /> including Scaramanga's golden gun,{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=77}} Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoes,{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=41}} Oddjob's steel-rimmed bowler hat{{sfn|Black|2005|p=117}} and Blofeld's communication devices in his agents' vanity case.<ref name="Davey" />

Cinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of ''Dr. No'' in 1962,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=21}} with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moniot|first=Drew|title=James Bond and America in the Sixties: An Investigation of the Formula Film in Popular Culture|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|date=Summer 1976|volume=28|issue=3|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|jstor=20687331|pages=25–33}}</ref> The first parody was the 1964 film ''[[Carry On Spying]]'', which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind ([[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtry]]) and Daphne Honeybutt ([[Barbara Windsor]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Angelini|first=Sergio|title=Carry On Spying (1964)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/466477/|work=BFI Screenonline|publisher=British Film Institute|access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref> One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the [[Harry Palmer]] series, whose first film, [[The Ipcress File (film)|''The Ipcress File'']] was released in 1965.

Following the release of the film ''Dr. No'' in 1962, the line "Bond&nbsp;... James Bond", became a [[catch phrase]] that entered the [[lexicon]] of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in ''Dr. No'' that the "signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever".{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=6}} In 2001, it was voted as the "best-loved one-liner in cinema" by British cinema goers,<ref>{{cite news|title=James Bond tops motto poll|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1383350.stm|access-date=4 November 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 June 2001}}</ref> and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the [[American Film Institute]] as part of their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|100 Years Series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Years Series: "Movie Quotes" |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070844/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> The 2005 [[American Film Institute]]'s '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|third greatest film hero]].<ref>{{cite web|title=100 years series: 100 heroes and villains |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=American Film Industry |access-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807135547/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archive-date=7 August 2011  }}</ref> He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters: 11.
