[[File:Parliament building Finland.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Eduskunta]]'', the parliament of Finland as the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], had universal suffrage in 1906 ([[Universal suffrage#Dates by country|several nations and territories can present arguments]] for being the first with [[universal suffrage]])]]
'''Liberal democracy''', also referred to as '''Western democracy''',  is a [[political ideology]] and a [[form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[classical liberalism]]. It is characterised by [[elections]] between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], a [[market economy]] with [[private property]], and the equal protection of [[human rights]], [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s for all people. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either codified (such as in the United States)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harpin |first1=Russell |title=Liberalism, Constitutionalism, and Democracy |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford}}</ref> or uncodified (such as in the United Kingdom), to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world.

A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms as it may be a [[constitutional monarchy]] (such as [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Politics of Japan|Japan]], [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Politics of Norway|Norway]], [[Politics of Spain|Spain]] and the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]) or a [[republic]] (such as [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], [[Politics of France|France]], [[Politics of Germany|Germany]],  [[Politics of India|India]], [[Politics of Italy|Italy]], [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Politics of Mexico|Mexico]], [[Politics of Poland|Poland]], [[Politics of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Politics of South Korea|South Korea]], and the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]). It may have a [[parliamentary system]] (such as [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Germany|Germany]], [[Politics of India|India]], [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], [[Politics of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Politics of Italy|Italy]], [[Politics of Singapore|Singapore]] and the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]), a [[presidential system]] (such as [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Politics of South Korea|South Korea]] and the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]) or a [[semi-presidential system]] (such as [[Politics of France|France]], [[Politics of Poland|Poland]], [[Politics of Russia|Russia]], [[Politics of Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[Politics of Romania|Romania]]).

Liberal democracies usually have [[universal suffrage]], granting all [[adult]] citizens the right to vote regardless of [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sex]], property ownership, race, age, sexuality, gender, income, social status, or religion. However, historically some countries regarded as liberal democracies have had a more [[Suffrage#Forms of exclusion from suffrage|limited franchise]]. Even today, some countries considered to be liberal democracies do not have truly universal suffrage as those in the United Kingdom serving long prison sentences are unable to vote, (a policy which has been ruled a human rights violation by the [[European Court of Human Rights]]).<ref>[https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Prisoners_vote_ENG.pdf Factsheet – Prisoners' right to vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807231112/https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Prisoners_vote_ENG.pdf |date=7 August 2020 }} European Court of Human Rights, April 2019.</ref> [[Voter identification laws|Many nations]] require positive identification before being allowed to vote. The decisions made through elections are made not by all of the citizens but rather by those who are members of the electorate and who choose to [[Voter participation|participate]] by voting.

The liberal democratic constitution defines the democratic character of the state. The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government. Liberal democracy emphasises the separation of powers, an [[independent judiciary]] and a system of checks and balances between branches of government. Liberal democracies are likely to emphasise the importance of the state being a ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', i.e. a state that follows the principle of [[rule of law]]. Governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed [[laws]] adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure. Many democracies use [[federalism]], also known as vertical separation of powers, in order to prevent abuse and increase public input by dividing governing powers between municipal, provincial and national governments (e.g. Germany, where the [[Bundestag|federal government]] assumes the main legislative responsibilities and the federated ''[[Länder of Germany|Länder]]'' assume many executive tasks).{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Origins ==
{{see also|History of liberalism}}
{{liberalism sidebar|ideas}}
Liberal democracy traces its origins—and its name—to the European 18th-century, also known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. At the time, the vast majority of European states were [[Monarchy|monarchies]], with political power held either by the [[monarch]] or the [[aristocracy]]. The possibility of democracy had not been a seriously considered political theory since [[classical antiquity]] and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people. It was further believed that democracy was contrary to [[human nature]], as human beings were seen to be inherently evil, violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their destructive impulses. Many European monarchs held that their power had been [[divine right of kings|ordained by God]] and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to [[blasphemy]].

These conventional views were challenged at first by a relatively small group of Enlightenment [[intellectual]]s, who believed that human affairs should be guided by [[reason]] and principles of liberty and equality. They argued that [[all people are created equal]] and therefore political authority cannot be justified on the basis of "noble blood", a supposed privileged connection to God or any other characteristic that is alleged to make one person superior to others. They further argued that governments exist to serve the people—not vice versa—and that laws should apply to those who govern as well as to the governed (a concept known as [[rule of law]]).

Some of these ideas began to be expressed in England in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139991384|pages=37–39|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|quote=Britain pioneered the system of liberal democracy that has now spread in one form or another to most of the world's countries|access-date=6 June 2020|archive-date=30 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630231313/https://books.google.com/books?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage|url-status=live}}</ref> There was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none|archive-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018101349/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|url-status=live}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16|archive-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925053248/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|url-status=live}}</ref> and passage of the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 and [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] in 1679 established certain liberties for subjects.

After the [[English Civil War]]s (1642–1651) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689, which codified certain rights and liberties.

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

By the late 18th century, leading philosophers of the day had published works that spread around the European continent and beyond. These ideas and beliefs inspired the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]], which gave birth to the ideology of [[liberalism]] and instituted forms of government that attempted to apply the principles of the Enlightenment philosophers into practice. Neither of these forms of government was precisely what we would call a liberal democracy we know today (the most significant differences being that voting rights were still restricted to a minority of the population and slavery remained a legal institution) and the French attempt turned out to be short-lived, but they were the prototypes from which liberal democracy later grew. Since the supporters of these forms of government were known as liberals, the governments themselves came to be known as liberal democracies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

When the first prototypical liberal democracies were founded, the liberals themselves were viewed as an extreme and rather dangerous fringe group that threatened international peace and stability. The conservative [[monarchism|monarchists]] who opposed liberalism and democracy saw themselves as defenders of traditional values and the natural order of things and their criticism of democracy seemed vindicated when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control of the young [[French First Republic|French Republic]], reorganised it into the [[first French Empire]] and proceeded to conquer most of Europe. Napoleon was eventually defeated and the [[Holy Alliance]] was formed in Europe to prevent any further spread of liberalism or democracy. However, liberal democratic ideals soon became widespread among the general population and over the 19th century traditional monarchy was forced on a continuous defensive and withdrawal. The [[dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]] became laboratories for liberal democracy from the mid 19th century onward. In Canada, responsible government began in the 1840s and in Australia and New Zealand, parliamentary government elected by [[male suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]] was established from the 1850s and [[female suffrage]] achieved from the 1890s.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey (2004), ''A Very Short History of the World'', Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0143005599}}</ref>

Reforms and revolutions helped move most European countries towards liberal democracy. Liberalism ceased being a fringe opinion and joined the political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of liberal democracy and made it their own. The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy became more and more a fringe view and liberal democracy became more and more mainstream. By the end of the 19th century, liberal democracy was no longer only a "liberal" idea, but an idea supported by many different ideologies. After [[World War I]] and especially after [[World War II]], liberal democracy achieved a dominant position among theories of government and is now endorsed by the vast majority of the political spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Although liberal democracy was originally put forward by Enlightenment liberals, the relationship between democracy and liberalism has been controversial since the beginning and was problematized in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|publisher=MIT Press|year=1985|isbn= 978-0262192408|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 8 (chapter 1)}}</ref> In his book ''Freedom and Equality in a Liberal Democratic State'', Jasper Doomen posited that freedom and equality are necessary for a liberal democracy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Freedom and Equality in a Liberal Democratic State|last=Doomen|first=Jasper|publisher=Bruylant|year=2014|isbn= 978-2802746232|location=Brussels|pages=88, 101}}</ref> The research institute [[Freedom House]] today simply defines liberal democracy as an electoral democracy also protecting [[civil liberties]].

== Rights and freedoms ==
In practice, democracies do have limits on certain freedoms. There are various legal limitations such as [[copyright]] and laws against [[defamation]]. There may be limits on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine [[human rights]] and on the promotion or justification of [[terrorism]]. In the United States more than in Europe, during the [[Cold War]] such restrictions applied to [[Communism|communists]]. Now they are more commonly applied to organisations perceived as promoting terrorism or the incitement of group hatred. Examples include [[anti-terrorism legislation]], the shutting down of [[Hezbollah]] satellite broadcasts and some laws against [[hate speech]]. Critics claim that these limitations may go too far and that there may be no due and fair judicial process.
The common justification for these limits is that they are necessary to guarantee the existence of democracy, or the existence of the freedoms themselves. For example, allowing free speech for those advocating mass murder undermines the right to life and security. Opinion is divided on how far democracy can extend to include the enemies of democracy in the democratic process. If relatively small numbers of people are excluded from such freedoms for these reasons, a country may still be seen as a liberal democracy. Some argue that this is only quantitatively (not qualitatively) different from autocracies that persecute opponents, since only a small number of people are affected and the restrictions are less severe, but others emphasise that democracies are different. At least in theory, opponents of democracy are also allowed due process under the rule of law.

However, many governments considered to be democratic have restrictions upon expressions considered anti-democratic, such as [[Holocaust denial]]{{citation needed|date=April 2011|reason=Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic, not anti-democratic}} and hate speech, including prison sentences, ofttimes seen as anomalous for the concept of free speech. Members of political organisations with connections to prior totalitarianism (typically formerly predominant communist, [[Fascism|fascist]] or National Socialists) may be deprived of the vote and the privilege of holding certain jobs. [[Discrimination|Discriminatory]] behaviour may be prohibited, such as refusal by owners of public accommodations to serve persons on grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. For example, in Canada a printer who refused to print materials for the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives was fined $5,000, incurred $100,000 in legal fees and was ordered to pay a further $40,000 of his opponents' legal fees by the Human Rights Tribunal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Business Ordered to Duplicate Homosexual Activist |publisher=Concerned Women for America|url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128171655/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archive-date=28 November 2008}}</ref>

Other rights considered fundamental in one country may be foreign to other governments. For instance, the constitutions of Canada, India, Israel, Mexico and the United States guarantee freedom from [[double jeopardy]], a right not provided in other legal systems. Also, legal systems that use politically elected court jurors, such as [[law of Sweden|Sweden]], view a (partly) politicised court system as a main component of accountable government, distinctly alien to democracies employing [[trial by jury]] designed to shield against the influence of politicians over trials. Similarly, many Americans consider [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to keep and bear arms]] to be an essential feature to safeguard the [[right to revolution]] against a potentially abusive government, while other countries do not recognise this as fundamental (the United Kingdom, for example, [[gun politics in the United Kingdom|having strict limitations]] on the gun ownership by individuals).

== Preconditions ==
Although they are not part of the system of government as such, a modicum of [[individual rights|individual]] and [[economic freedom]]s, which result in the formation of a significant [[middle class]] and a broad and flourishing [[civil society]], are often seen as pre-conditions for liberal democracy (Lipset 1959).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

For countries without a strong tradition of democratic majority rule, the introduction of free elections alone has rarely been sufficient to achieve a transition from dictatorship to democracy; a wider shift in the political culture and gradual formation of the institutions of democratic government are needed. There are various examples—for instance, in [[Latin America]]—of countries that were able to sustain democracy only temporarily or in a limited fashion until wider cultural changes established the conditions under which democracy could flourish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One of the key aspects of democratic culture is the concept of a "[[loyal opposition]]", where political competitors may disagree, but they must tolerate one another and acknowledge the legitimate and important roles that each play. This is an especially difficult cultural shift to achieve in nations where transitions of power have historically taken place through violence. The term means in essence that all sides in a democracy share a common commitment to its basic values. The ground rules of the society must encourage tolerance and civility in public debate. In such a society, the losers accept the judgment of the voters when the election is over and allow for the [[peaceful transition of power|peaceful transfer of power]]. The losers are safe in the knowledge that they will neither lose their lives nor their liberty and will continue to participate in public life. They are loyal not to the specific policies of the government, but to the fundamental legitimacy of the state and to the democratic process itself.

Freedom House considers many of the officially democratic governments in Africa and the former Soviet Union to be undemocratic in practice, usually because the sitting government has a strong influence over election outcomes. Many of these countries are in a state of considerable flux.

Officially non-democratic forms of government, such as single-party states and dictatorships, are more common in East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.

Most recently, the Freedom House 2019 report has noted a fall in the number of countries with liberal democracies, citing declines in 'political rights and civil liberties' over the 13 years from 2005 to 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World: Democracy in Retreat |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019 |website=freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=7 December 2019 |archive-date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205180803/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Proportional vs. plurality representation ===
[[Plurality voting system]] award seats according to regional majorities. The political party or individual candidate who receives the most votes, wins the seat which represents that locality. There are other democratic electoral systems, such as the various forms of [[proportional representation]], which award seats according to the proportion of individual votes that a party receives nationwide or in a particular region.

One of the main points of contention between these two systems is whether to have representatives who are able to effectively represent specific regions in a country, or to have all citizens' vote count the same, regardless of where in the country they happen to live.

Some countries, such as [[Politics of Germany|Germany]] and [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]], address the conflict between these two forms of representation by having two categories of seats in the [[lower house]] of their national legislative bodies. The first category of seats is appointed according to regional popularity and the remainder are awarded to give the parties a proportion of seats that is equal—or as equal as practicable—to their proportion of nationwide votes. This system is commonly called [[mixed member proportional representation]].

[[Politics of Australia|Australia]] incorporates both systems in having the [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system applicable to the [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]] and [[proportional representation]] by state in the [[Australian Senate|upper house]]. This system is argued to result in a more stable government, while having a better diversity of parties to review its actions.

=== Presidential vs. parliamentary systems ===
A [[presidential system]] is a [[system of government]] of a [[republic]] in which the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is elected separately from the [[legislature|legislative]]. A [[parliamentary system]] is distinguished by the [[executive branch of government]] being dependent on the direct or indirect support of the [[parliament]], often expressed through a [[vote of confidence]].

The presidential system of democratic government has been adopted in Latin America, Africa and parts of the former Soviet Union, largely by the example of the United States. [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional monarchies]] (dominated by elected parliaments) are present in Northern Europe and some former colonies which peacefully separated, such as Australia and Canada. Others have also arisen in Spain, East Asia and a variety of small nations around the world. Former British territories such as South Africa, India, Ireland and the United States opted for different forms at the time of independence. The parliamentary system is widely used in the [[European Union]] and neighboring countries.

== Issues and criticism ==
{{further|Criticism of democracy}}

=== Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie ===
{{main|Democracy in Marxism}}
[[Marxism|Marxists]], [[communists]], as well as some [[socialism|socialists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] argue that liberal democracy under [[Capitalism|capitalist ideology]] is constitutively [[social class|class]]-based and therefore can never be democratic or [[Participatory democracy|participatory]]. It is referred to as [[bourgeois]] democracy because ultimately politicians fight only for the rights of the bourgeoisie.

According to [[Karl Marx]], representation of the interests of different classes is proportional to the influence which a particular class can purchase (through bribes, transmission of propaganda through mass media, economic blackmail, donations for political parties and their campaigns and so on). Thus, the public interest in so-called liberal democracies is systematically corrupted by the wealth of those classes rich enough to gain the appearance of representation. Because of this, multi-party democracies under capitalist ideology are always distorted and anti-democratic, their operation merely furthering the class interests of the owners of the means of production.

The bourgeois class becomes wealthy through a drive to appropriate the [[surplus value|surplus-value]] of the creative labours of the working class. This drive obliges the bourgeois class to amass ever-larger fortunes by increasing the proportion of surplus-value by exploiting the working class through capping workers' terms and conditions as close to poverty levels as possible. Incidentally, this obligation demonstrates the clear limit to bourgeois freedom even for the bourgeoisie itself. Thus, according to Marx parliamentary elections are no more than a cynical, systemic attempt to deceive the people by permitting them, every now and again, to endorse one or other of the bourgeoisie's predetermined choices of which political party can best advocate the interests of capital. Once elected, this parliament, as a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, enacts regulations that actively support the interests of its true constituency, the bourgeoisie (such as bailing out Wall St investment banks; direct socialisation/subsidisation of business—GMH, US/European [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]; and even wars to guarantee trade in commodities such as oil).

[[Vladimir Lenin]] once argued that liberal democracy had simply been used to give an illusion of democracy while maintaining the dictatorship of the [[bourgeoisie]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

====Campaign costs====

In Athenian democracy, some public offices were [[random]]ly allocated to citizens, in order to inhibit the effects of plutocracy. Aristotle described the law courts in Athens which were selected by lot as democratic<ref>Aristotle, Politics 2.1273b</ref> and described elections as oligarchic.<ref>Aristotle, Politics 4.1294b</ref>

The cost of political campaigning in representative democracies favors the rich, a form of [[plutocracy]] where only a very small number of wealthy individuals can actually affect government policy in their favor and toward [[plutonomy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Hal|title=Marx on Democratic Forms of Government|date=1974|journal=The Socialist Register|volume=11|url=https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5326/2227|access-date=22 October 2018|archive-date=5 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805130248/https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5326/2227|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other studies predicted that the global trend toward [[plutonomy|plutonomies]] would continue, for various reasons, including "capitalist-friendly governments and tax regimes".<ref> Kapur, Ajay, Niall Macleod, Narendra Singh: "Plutonomy: Buying Luxury, Explaining Global Imbalances", Citigroup, Equity Strategy, Industry Note: October 16, 2005. p. 9f.</ref> They do, however, also warn of the risk that, since "political enfranchisement remains as was—one person, one vote, at some point it is likely that labor will fight back against the rising profit share of the rich and there will be a political backlash against the rising wealth of the rich."<ref> Kapur, Ajay, Niall Macleod, Narendra Singh: "Revisiting Plutonomy: The Rich Getting Richer", Citigroup, Equity Strategy, Industry Note: March 5, 2006. p. 10.</ref>

Liberal democracy has also been attacked by some [[Democratic socialism|socialists]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Democracy|journal=Left Party in Germany|url=https://www.linksfraktion.de/themen/a-z/detailansicht/demokratie/|access-date=15 December 2017|archive-date=16 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216091214/https://www.linksfraktion.de/themen/a-z/detailansicht/demokratie/|url-status=live}}</ref> as a dishonest farce used to keep the masses from realizing that their will is irrelevant in the political process. Stringent [[Campaign finance reform|campaign finance laws]] can correct this perceived problem.

In 2006, United States economist [[Steven Levitt]] argues in his book ''[[Freakonomics]]'' that campaign spending is no guarantee of electoral success. He compared electoral success of the same pair of candidates running against one another repeatedly for the same job, as often happens in United States Congressional elections, where spending levels varied. He concludes:
:A winning candidate can cut his spending in half and lose only 1 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, a losing candidate who doubles his spending can expect to shift the vote in his favor by only that same 1 percent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cta5AAAAIAAJ&q=%22A+winning+candidate+can+cut+his+spending+in+half+and+lose+only+1+percent+of+the+vote.+Meanwhile,+a+losing+candidate+who+doubles+his+spending+can+expect+to+shift+the+vote+in+his+favor+by+only+that+same+1+percent%22|first1=Steven|last1=Levitt|author-link1=Steven Levitt|first2=Stephen J.|last2=Dubner|author-link2=Stephen J.

However, Levitt's response were also criticised as they miss the socialist point of view, which is that citizens who have little to no money at all are blocked from political office entirely. This argument is not refuted merely by noting that either doubling or halving of electoral spending will only shift a given candidate's chances of winning by 1 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mandle|first1=Jay|title=How Freakonomics Gets Campaign Financing Wrong, January 2006|url=http://www.democracymatters.org/money-on-my-mind-2/how-freakonomics-gets-campaign-financing-wrong/|access-date=15 December 2017|archive-date=16 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034534/http://www.democracymatters.org/money-on-my-mind-2/how-freakonomics-gets-campaign-financing-wrong/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 18 2014, Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page's study concluded "Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism."<ref>Gilens, M., & Page, B.

====Authoritarianism====

Liberal democracy has been also challenged as a concept and practice by author and researcher [[Peter Baofu]].<ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/baofu-peter-1962 Baofu, Peter 1962] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220235918/https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/baofu-peter-1962 |date=20 February 2019 }}. Encyclopedia.com.</ref> Baofu contends that under some conditions a liberal democracy can be more authoritarian than authoritarian regimes. He suggests that liberal democracy "is neither authoritarian nor liberal democratic" and instead it should be described as "authoritarian-liberal-democratic". Baofu maintains that both authoritarianism and liberal democracy do not have to be "mutually exclusive opposites".<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Baofu|title= The Rise of Authoritarian Liberal Democracy|publisher=Cambridge Scholar Publishing| year=2007|pages=3–4}}{{ISBN?}}</ref> Other authors have also analysed the authoritarian means that liberal democracies use in order to defend economic liberalism and the power of political elites.<ref>See for example, Renato Cristi, ''Carl Schmitt and authoritarian liberalism: strong state, free economy'', Cardiff : Univ. of Wales Press, 1998; Michael A. Wilkinson, 'Authoritarian Liberalism as Authoritarian Constitutionalism', in Helena Alviar García, Günter Frankenberg, ''Authoritarian constitutionalism: comparative analysis and critique'', Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2019.</ref>

=== Media ===
Critics of the role of the media in liberal democracies allege that [[concentration of media ownership]] leads to major distortions of democratic processes. In ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] argue via their [[Propaganda Model]]<ref>Edward S. Herman [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/199607--.htm "The Propaganda Model Revisited"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106195120/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/199607--.htm |date=6 January 2012 }}, ''Monthly Review'', July 1996, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website</ref> that the corporate media limits the availability of contesting views and assert this creates a narrow spectrum of elite opinion. This is a natural consequence, they say, of the close ties between powerful [[corporation]]s and the media and thus limited and restricted to the explicit views of those who can afford it.<ref>James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] ''[[Power Without Responsibility: the Press and Broadcasting in Britain]]'', London: Routledge, 1997, p. 1</ref>

Media commentators also point out that the influential early champions of the media industry held fundamentally anti-democratic views, opposing the general population's involvement in creating policy.<ref>Noam Chomsky and Gabor Steingart [http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081010.htm "The United States Has Essentially a One-Party System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128113437/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081010.htm |date=28 January 2010 }}, ''Der Spiegel Online'', 10 October 2008, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website</ref> [[Walter Lippmann]] writing in ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925) sought to "put the public in its place" so that those in power would be "free of the trampling and roar of a bewildered herd"<ref>Lippmann cited by Henry Beissel [http://thehumananimal.com/usa/?p=381 "Mutation or Demise: The Democratization of Democracy"] ''Living with Democracy'', #155, Winter 2005, as reproduced on the ''Humanist Persrpectives'' website</ref> while [[Edward Bernays]], originator of public relations, sought to "regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies".<ref>[http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html Propaganda by Edward Bernays (1928)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319141306/http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html |date=19 March 2010 }}. Historyisaweapon.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-29.</ref>

Defenders responding to such arguments assert that constitutionally protected [[freedom of speech]] makes it possible for both for-profit and non-profit organisations to debate the issues. They argue that media coverage in democracies simply reflects public preferences and does not entail censorship. Especially with new forms of media such as the Internet, it is not expensive to reach a wide audience, if there is an interest for the ideas presented.

=== Limited voter turnout ===
{{details|Voter turnout}}
Low voter turnout, whether the cause is disenchantment, indifference or contentment with the status quo, may be seen as a problem, especially if disproportionate in particular segments of the population. Although turnout levels vary greatly among modern democratic countries and in various types and levels of elections within countries, at some point low turnout may prompt questions as to whether the results reflect the will of the people, whether the causes may be indicative of concerns to the society in question, or in extreme cases the [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of the electoral system.

[[Get out the vote]] campaigns, either by governments or private groups, may increase voter turnout, but distinctions must be made between general campaigns to raise the turnout rate and partisan efforts to aid a particular candidate, party or cause.

Several nations have forms of [[compulsory voting]], with various degrees of enforcement. Proponents argue that this increases the legitimacy—and thus also popular acceptance—of the elections and ensures political participation by all those affected by the political process and reduces the costs associated with encouraging voting. Arguments against include restriction of freedom, economic costs of enforcement, increased number of invalid and blank votes and random voting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |title=International IDEA &#124; Compulsory Voting |publisher=Idea.int |access-date=2008-10-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612191446/http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |archive-date=12 June 2009 }}</ref>

Other alternatives include increased use of [[absentee ballots]], or other measures to ease or improve the ability to vote, including [[electronic voting]].

=== Ethnic and religious conflicts ===
For historical reasons, many states are not culturally and ethnically homogeneous. There may be sharp ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. In fact, some groups may be actively hostile to each other. A democracy, which by definition allows mass participation in decision-making, theoretically also allows the use of the political process against 'enemy' groups.

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the partial [[democratisation]] of Soviet bloc states was followed by wars in the former [[Yugoslavia]], in the [[Caucasus]] and in Moldova. Nevertheless, some people believe that the fall of communism and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars and the number of [[refugees]] and displaced people (worldwide, not in the countries of the former sovietic bloc).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} However, this trend can be attributed to the end of Cold War and the natural exhaustion of said conflicts, many of which were fueled by the Soviet Union and the United States<ref>{{cite web |authors=Monty G.

In her book ''[[World on Fire (book)|World on Fire]]'', [[Yale Law School]] professor [[Amy Chua]] posits that "when free market democracy is pursued in the presence of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash. This backlash typically takes one of three forms. The first is a backlash against markets, targeting the market-dominant minority's wealth. The second is a backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority. The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed against the market-dominant minority itself".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chua |first=Amy |author-link=Amy Chua |title=World on Fire |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year= 2002 |isbn=0385503024|title-link=World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability }}</ref>

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
A persistent [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws (as described in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[The Man Versus the State|The Man Versus The State]]''). This is seen as pernicious in several ways. New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties. Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding. This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power. The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal [[natural law]]—although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates. Supporters of democracy point to the complex bureaucracy and regulations that has occurred in dictatorships, like many of the former communist states.

The bureaucracy in liberal democracies is often criticised for a claimed slowness and complexity of their decision-making. The term "[[red tape]]" is a synonym of slow bureaucratic functioning that hinders quick results in a liberal democracy.

=== Short-term focus ===
By definition, modern liberal democracies allow for regular changes of government. That has led to a common criticism of their short-term focus. In four or five years the government will face a new election and it must think of how it will win that election. That would encourage a preference for policies that will bring short term benefits to the electorate (or to self-interested politicians) before the next election, rather than unpopular policy with longer term benefits. This criticism assumes that it is possible to make long term predictions for a society, something [[Karl Popper]] has criticised as [[historicism]].

Besides the regular review of governing entities, short-term focus in a democracy could also be the result of collective short-term thinking. For example, consider a campaign for policies aimed at reducing environmental damage while causing temporary increase in unemployment. However, this risk applies also to other political systems.

[[Anarcho-capitalist]] [[Hans-Herman Hoppe]] explained short-termism of the democratic governments by the rational choice of currently ruling group to over exploit temporarily accessible resources, thus deriving maximal economic advantage to the members of this group. He contrasted this with [[hereditary]] [[monarchy]], in which a monarch has an interest in preserving the long-term capital value of his property (i.e. the country he owns) counterbalancing his desire to extract immediate revenue. He argues that the historical record of levels of taxation in certain monarchies (20–25%)<ref>{{cite book |author=Bartlett, Robert |author-link=Robert Bartlett (historian) |title=England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075–1225 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=2000 |isbn=0198227418 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/englandundernorm00bart_0/page/165 165–68] |url=https://archive.org/details/englandundernorm00bart_0/page/165 }} 25% tax in England in the 12th century</ref> and certain liberal democracies (30–60%) seems to confirm this contention.<ref>''Democracy: The God That Failed'' (Transaction Publishers, 2001) Paperback {{ISBN|0765808684}}</ref>

=== Majoritarianism ===
{{main|Majority rule|Tyranny of the majority}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
The [[tyranny of the majority]] is the fear that a direct democratic government, reflecting the majority view, can take action that oppresses a particular minority. For instance, a minority holding wealth, property ownership or power (see [[Federalist No. 10]]), or a minority of a certain racial and ethnic origin, class or nationality. Theoretically, the majority is a majority of all citizens. If citizens are not compelled by law to vote, it is usually a majority of those who choose to vote. If such of group constitutes a minority, then it is possible that a minority could in theory oppress another minority in the name of the majority. However, such an argument could apply to both [[direct democracy]] or [[representative democracy]]. In comparison to a direct democracy where every citizen is forced to vote, under liberal democracies the wealth and power is usually concentrated in the hands of a small privileged class who have significant power over the political process (see [[inverted totalitarianism]]). Several ''de facto'' dictatorships also have compulsory, but not "free and fair" voting in order to try to increase the legitimacy of the regime, such as [[North Korea]].<ref name=pk>{{cite web |title=DPRK Holds Election of Local and National Assemblies |work=[[People's Korea]] |url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/195th_issue/2003081602.htm |access-date=2008-06-28 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FXQ2bRBM?url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/195th_issue/2003081602.htm |archive-date=31 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=parlunion4>{{cite web | title=The Parliamentary System of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea | publisher=Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments (ASGP) of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] | work=Constitutional and Parliamentary Information | url=http://www.asgp.co/sites/default/files/documents//CJOZSZTEPVVOCWJVUPPZVWPAPUOFGF.pdf | access-date=2010-10-01 | page=4 | archive-date=3 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303054935/http://www.asgp.info/Resources/Data/Documents/CJOZSZTEPVVOCWJVUPPZVWPAPUOFGF.pdf | url-status=live }}</ref>

Possible examples of a minority being oppressed by or in the name of the majority:
* Those potentially subject to [[conscription]] are a minority possibly because of socioeconomic reasons.
* The minority who are wealthy often use their money and influence to manipulate the political process against the interests of the rest of the population, who are the minority in terms of income and access.
* Several European countries have introduced bans on personal religious symbols in state schools. Opponents see this as a violation of rights to freedom of religion and supporters see it as following from the separation of state and religious activities.
* Prohibition of [[pornography]] is typically determined by what the majority is prepared to accept.
* The private possession of various [[weapons]] (i.e. [[Baston (weapon)|batons]], [[nunchakus]], [[brass knuckles]], [[pepper spray]], [[firearm]]s and so on) is criminalized in several democracies (i.e. the United Kingdom, Belgium and others), with such criminalization motivated by attempts to increase safety in the society, to reduce general violence, instances of homicide or perhaps by moralism, classism and/or paternalism.
* [[recreational drug use|Recreational drug, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol use]] is too often [[War on Drugs|criminalised]] or otherwise suppressed by majorities. In the United States, this happened originally for racist, classist, religious or paternalistic motives.<ref name="repealing">{{cite book |title=Repealing National Prohibition |author=David E.

The hallucinogen in the cacti, which the Indians interpreted as putting them in communion with their God, rendered them, said the distraught missionaries, "Resistant to all our moral suasions".  The missionaries had recourse to the state legislature and cactus eating was forbidden.  Between the turn of the century and the First World War these laws were generalised to all states of the Union and to all substances, including alcohol.  The Americans adopted prohibition in response to a strong religious lobby for whom all intoxicants were direct competitors for the control over the minds of men.}}</ref>
* Society's treatment of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] is also cited in this context. Homosexual acts were widely criminalised in democracies until several decades ago and in some democracies they still are, reflecting the religious or sexual mores of the majority.
* The Athenian democracy and the early United States had [[slavery]].
* The majority often taxes the minority who are wealthy at [[progressive tax|progressively higher rates]], with the intention that the wealthy will incur a larger tax burden for social purposes.
* In prosperous western representative democracies, the poor form a minority of the population and may not have the power to use the state to initiate redistribution when a majority of the electorate opposes such designs. When the poor form a distinct [[underclass]], the majority may use the democratic process to in effect withdraw the protection of the [[State (polity)|state]].
* An often quoted example of the "tyranny of the majority" is that [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power by "legitimate" democratic procedures. The [[Nazi Party]] gained the largest share of votes in the democratic [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933. Some might consider this an example of "tyranny of a minority" since he never gained a majority vote, but it is common for a [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] to exercise power in democracies, therefore the [[rise of Hitler]] cannot be considered irrelevant. However, his regime's large-scale human rights violations took place after the democratic system had been abolished. Furthermore, the [[Weimar Constitution]] in an [[Enabling Law|"emergency" allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election]].

Proponents of democracy make a number of defenses concerning "tyranny of the majority". One is to argue that the presence of a [[constitution]] protecting the rights of all citizens in many democratic countries acts as a safeguard. Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a [[supermajority]] of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or sometimes a [[referendum]]. These requirements are often combined. The [[separation of powers]] into [[legislative branch]], [[executive branch]] and [[judicial branch]] also makes it more difficult for a small majority to impose their will. This means a majority can still legitimately coerce a minority (which is still ethically questionable), but such a minority would be very small and as a practical matter it is harder to get a larger proportion of the people to agree to such actions.

Another argument is that majorities and minorities can take a markedly different shape on different issues. People often agree with the majority view on some issues and agree with a minority view on other issues. One's view may also change, thus the members of a majority may limit oppression of a minority since they may well in the future themselves be in a minority.

A third common argument is that despite the risks majority rule is preferable to other systems and the tyranny of the majority is in any case an improvement on a tyranny of a minority. All the possible problems mentioned above can also occur in nondemocracies with the added problem that a minority can oppress the majority. Proponents of democracy argue that empirical statistical evidence strongly shows that more democracy leads to less internal violence and mass murder by the government. This is sometimes formulated as [[Rummel's Law]], which states that the less democratic freedom a people have, the more likely their rulers are to murder them.

The political stability of liberal democracies depends on strong economic growth, as well as robust state institutions that guarantee free elections, the [[rule of law]], and individual liberties.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-012050|title=Democratic Stability: A Long View|year=2020|last1=Carugati|first1=Federica|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=23|pages=59–75|doi-access=free}}</ref>

One argument for democracy is that by creating a system where the public can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis for government, democracy aims at reducing political uncertainty and instability and assuring citizens that however much they may disagree with present policies, they will be given a regular chance to change those who are in power, or change policies with which they disagree. This is preferable to a system where political change takes place through violence.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

One notable feature of liberal democracies is that their opponents (those groups who wish to abolish liberal democracy) rarely win elections. Advocates use this as an argument to support their view that liberal democracy is inherently stable and can usually only be overthrown by external force, while opponents argue that the system is inherently stacked against them despite its claims to impartiality. In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations, who could get themselves elected into power. However, the actual number of liberal democracies that have elected dictators into power is low. When it has occurred, it is usually after a major crisis has caused many people to doubt the system or in young/poorly functioning democracies. Some possible examples include [[Adolf Hitler]] during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Napoleon III]], who became first President of the [[Second French Republic]] and later Emperor.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

=== Effective response in wartime ===
By definition, a liberal democracy implies that power is not concentrated. One criticism is that this could be a disadvantage for a state in [[war]]time, when a fast and unified response is necessary. The legislature usually must give consent before the start of an offensive military operation, although sometimes the executive can do this on its own while keeping the legislature informed. If the democracy is attacked, then no consent is usually required for defensive operations. The people may vote against a [[conscription]] army.

However, actual research shows that democracies are more likely to win wars than non-democracies. One explanation attributes this primarily to "the transparency of the [[polity|polities]], and the stability of their preferences, once determined, democracies are better able to cooperate with their partners in the conduct of wars". Other research attributes this to superior mobilisation of resources or selection of wars that the democratic states have a high chance of winning.<ref>Ajin Choi, (2004). "Democratic Synergy and Victory in War, 1816–1992". ''International Studies Quarterly'', Volume 48, Number 3, September 2004, pp. 663–82 (20). {{doi|10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00319.x}}</ref>

Stam and [[Dan Reiter|Reiter]] also note that the emphasis on individuality within democratic societies means that their soldiers fight with greater initiative and superior leadership.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Reiter |last=Dan |author2=Stam, Allan C. |year=2002 |title=Democracies at War |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691089485 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/democraciesatwar00danr/page/64 64–70] |url=https://archive.org/details/democraciesatwar00danr/page/64 }}</ref> Officers in dictatorships are often selected for political loyalty rather than military ability. They may be exclusively selected from a small class or religious/ethnic group that support the regime. The leaders in nondemocracies may respond violently to any perceived criticisms or disobedience. This may make the soldiers and officers afraid to raise any objections or do anything without explicit authorisation. The lack of initiative may be particularly detrimental in modern warfare. Enemy soldiers may more easily surrender to democracies since they can expect comparatively good treatment. In contrast, Nazi Germany killed almost 2/3 of the captured Soviet soldiers and 38% of the American soldiers captured by North Korea in the [[Korean War]] were killed.

=== Better information on and corrections of problems ===
A democratic system may provide better information for policy decisions. Undesirable information may more easily be ignored in dictatorships, even if this undesirable or contrarian information provides early warning of problems. [[Anders Chydenius]] put forward the argument for [[freedom of the press]] for this reason in 1776.<ref name=luoma>{{cite web|last=Luoma|first=Jukka|title=Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition|access-date=26 November 2007|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Self-censorship+has+always+encouraged+censorship/1135218861212|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120112003/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Self-censorship+has+always+encouraged+censorship/1135218861212|archive-date=20 November 2007}}</ref> The democratic system also provides a way to replace inefficient leaders and policies, thus problems may continue longer and crises of all kinds may be more common in autocracies.<ref name=carnegiecouncil1>{{cite web|title=The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace |work=Carnegie Council |url=http://carnegiecouncil.org/viewMedia.php/prmTemplateID/9/prmID/5129 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628061201/http://carnegiecouncil.org/viewMedia.php/prmTemplateID/9/prmID/5129 |archive-date=28 June 2006}}</ref>

=== Corruption ===
{{OR section|date=May 2019}}
Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]]: (long term) democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption.<ref>Daniel Lederman, Normal Loaza, Rodrigo Res Soares, (November 2001). [https://ssrn.com/abstract=632777 "Accountability and Corruption: Political Institutions Matter"]. ''World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2708''. {{SSRN|632777}}. Retrieved 19 February 2006.</ref> [[Freedom of information legislation]] is important for [[accountability]] and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]].

=== Terrorism ===
{{globalize|date=January 2014}}
Several studies{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} have concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate [[political freedom]], meaning countries transitioning from autocratic governance to democracy. Nations with strong autocratic governments and governments that allow for more political freedom experience less terrorism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |access-date=2008-10-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919050732/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |archive-date=19 September 2015 }}</ref>

=== Economic growth and financial crises ===
Statistically, more democracy correlates with a higher gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) per capita.

However, there is disagreement regarding how much credit the democratic system can take for this. One observation is that democracy became widespread only after the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the introduction of [[capitalism]]. On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution started in England which was one of the most democratic nations for its time within its own borders, but this democracy was very limited and did not apply to the colonies which contributed significantly to the wealth.

Several statistical studies support the theory that a higher degree of economic freedom, as measured with one the several [[Index of Economic Freedom|Indices of Economic Freedom]] which have been used in numerous studies,<ref>Free the World. [http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKMGqbq3?url=http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |date=20 March 2011 }}. Retrieved 19 February 2006.</ref> increases [[economic growth]] and that this in turn increases general prosperity, reduces poverty and causes [[democratisation]]. This is a statistical tendency and there are individual exceptions like Mali, which is ranked as "Free" by [[Freedom House]], but is a [[Least Developed Country]], or Qatar, which has arguably the highest GDP per capita in the world, but has never been democratic. There are also other studies suggesting that more democracy increases economic freedom, although a few find no or even a small negative effect.<ref>{{cite web|first=Niclas|last= Bergren|date=2002 |url = http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |title=The Benefits of Economic Freedom: A Survey |url-status=unfit |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628093441/http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |archive-date=28 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>John W.

Retrieved 19 February 2006.</ref> One objection might be that nations like Canada and Sweden today score just below nations like Chile and Estonia on economic freedom, but that Canada and Sweden today have a higher GDP per capita. However, this is a misunderstanding as the studies indicate effect on economic growth and thus that future GDP per capita will be higher with higher economic freedom. Also according to the index, Canada and Sweden are among the world's nations with the highest economic freedom rankings, due to factors such as strong [[rule of law]], strong [[property rights]] and few restrictions against [[free trade]]. Critics might argue that the Index of Economic Freedom and other methods used does not measure the degree of capitalism, preferring some other definition.

Some argue that economic growth due to its empowerment of citizens will ensure a transition to democracy in countries such as Cuba. However, other dispute this and even if economic growth has caused democratisation in the past, it may not do so in the future. Dictators may now have learned how to have economic growth without this causing more political freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|first1 = Bruce|last1 = Bueno de Mesquita|first2 = George W.|last2 = Downs|date = September–October 2005|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2005-09-01/development-and-democracy|title = Development and Democracy|journal = Foreign Affairs|publisher = Council on Foreign Relations|access-date = 22 October 2018|archive-date = 22 October 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181022234013/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2005-09-01/development-and-democracy|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1= Joseph T.|last1= Single|first2= Michael M.|last2= Weinstein|first3= Morton H.|last3= Halperin|date= 28 September 2004|url= https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html|title= Why Democracies Excel|work= New York Times|access-date= 2 March 2017|archive-date= 13 November 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161113004700/http://www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html|url-status= live}}</ref>

A high degree of oil or mineral exports is strongly associated with nondemocratic rule. This effect applies worldwide and not only to the Middle East. Dictators who have this form of wealth can spend more on their security apparatus and provide benefits which lessen public unrest. Also, such wealth is not followed by the social and cultural changes that may transform societies with ordinary economic growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ross, Michael Lewin |title=Does Oil Hinder Democracy? |journal=World Politics |year=2001 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=325–61 |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0011|s2cid=18404 }}</ref>

A 2006 meta-analysis found that democracy has no direct effect on economic growth. However, it has strong and significant indirect effects which contribute to growth. Democracy is associated with higher human capital accumulation, lower [[inflation]], lower political instability and higher [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]]. There is also some evidence that it is associated with larger governments and more restrictions on international trade.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Doucouliagos, H., Ulubasoglu, M |title=Democracy and Economic Growth: A meta-analysis |journal=School of Accounting, Economics and Finance Deakin University Australia |year=2006}}</ref>

If leaving out [[East Asia]], then during the last forty-five years poor democracies have grown their economies 50% more rapidly than nondemocracies. Poor democracies such as the Baltic countries, Botswana, Costa Rica, Ghana and Senegal have grown more rapidly than nondemocracies such as Angola, Syria, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe.<ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/>

Of the eighty worst financial catastrophes during the last four decades, only five were in democracies. Similarly, poor democracies are half likely as nondemocracies to experience a 10 percent decline in GDP per capita over the course of a single year.<ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/>

=== Famines and refugees ===
Prominent economist [[Amartya Sen]] has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a large scale [[famine]].<ref>[[Amartya Sen]], (1999). [http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/jod/10.3sen.html "Democracy as a Universal Value"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427050621/http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/jod/10.3sen.html |date=27 April 2006 }}. ''Journal of Democracy'', 10.3, 3–17. Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> Refugee crises almost always occur in nondemocracies. Looking at the volume of refugee flows for the last twenty years, the first eighty-seven cases occurred in autocracies.<ref name=carnegiecouncil1/>

=== Human development ===
Democracy correlates with a higher score on the [[Human Development Index]] and a lower score on the human poverty index.

Democracies have the potential to put in place better education, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, access to drinking water and better health care than dictatorships. This is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of GDP on health and education, as instead the available resources are managed better.<ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/>

Several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with GDP per capita, rise of the public sector or income inequality.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Franco, Álvaro, Carlos Álvarez-Dardet and Maria Teresa Ruiz |title=Effect of democracy on health: ecological study (required) |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7480 |pages=1421–23 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1421 |pmid=15604165 |pmc=535957}}</ref>

=== Democratic peace theory ===
{{main|Democratic peace theory}}
Numerous studies using many different kinds of data, definitions and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The original finding was that liberal democracies have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that democracies have few [[militarized interstate dispute]]s causing less than 1,000 battle deaths with one another, that those militarized interstate disputes that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths and that democracies have few [[civil wars]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hegre, Håvard, Tanja Ellington, Scott Gates, and Nils Petter Gleditsch |title=Towards A Democratic Civil Peace?

=== Mass murder by government ===
American professor [[Rudolph Rummel]] claimed that democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by the government.<ref>[[R. J. Rummel]], ''Power Kills''. 1997.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Similarly, they have less [[genocide]] and [[politicide]].<ref>Harff, Barbara (2003) ''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust?]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030201259/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ |date=30 October 2007 }}</ref>

=== The threat of populism ===
Populism as an ideology is not fundamentally undemocratic, but is anti-liberal, it is based around conflict between 'the people' and 'the elites', with the ideology siding with 'the people'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mudde|first=Cas|date=2013|title=Are Populists Friends or Foes of Constitutionalism?|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fc657de0-ab0c-4911-8d2b-646101599b65|journal=The Social and Political Foundations of Constitutions|via=ORA}}</ref> It is therefore a form of majoritarianism, threatening some of the core principles of liberal democracy such as the rights of the individual. Populism is a particular threat to the liberal democracy because it exploits the weaknesses of the liberal democratic system. A key weakness of liberal democracies highlighted in 'How Democracies Die',<ref>{{Cite book|title=How democracies die|last=Levitsky, Steven|others=Ziblatt, Daniel|isbn=978-0241381359|location=London|oclc=1084729957}}</ref> it is the conundrum that suppressing populist movements or parties is illiberal, however, if populist movements or parties are not stopped then they are likely to dominate the political landscape as they tend to tap into emotion rather than rational thinking. Furthermore, for liberal democracy to be effective, a degree of compromise is required<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-pluralism : the populist threat to liberal democracy|last=Galston, William A. (William Arthur)|others=Hunter, James Davison, Owen, John M. (John Malloy)|isbn=978-0300235319|location=New Haven|oclc=1026492265|year=2018}}</ref> as protecting the rights of the individual take precedence if they are threatened by the will of the majority, majoritarianism is so ingrained in the populist ideology that this core value of a liberal democracy is under threat. This therefore brings into question how effectively liberal democracy can defend itself from populism.
