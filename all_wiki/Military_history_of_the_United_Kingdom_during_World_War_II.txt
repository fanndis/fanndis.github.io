The '''military history of the United Kingdom in World War II''' covers the [[World War II|Second World War]] against the [[Axis powers]], starting on 3 September 1939 when Britain and France, followed by most of Britain's [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]], declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] in response to the [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany. [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister and head of a coalition government in May 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies and the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in the first year of the war leading to the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort. Germany's planned invasion of the UK was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the [[Battle of Britain]], and by its marked inferiority in naval power. Subsequently, urban areas in Britain suffered heavy bombing during [[the Blitz]] in late 1940 and early 1941.

By August 1941, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] had drafted the [[Atlantic Charter]] to define goals for the post-war world. In December, the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]] including an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor]]. Britain and America declared war on Japan opening the [[Pacific War]]. Churchill formed a [[Special Relationship]] with the United States and won their agreement to a [[Europe first]] grand strategy for the war. The [[Declaration by United Nations]] drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington in December 1941 formalised the [[Allies of World War II]].

There were eventual hard-fought victories in the [[North African campaign]], led by General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], and the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] in 1943. British forces played major roles in the production of [[Ultra]] signals intelligence, the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]] of Germany, and the [[Normandy landings]] of 1944, which led to the [[liberation of Europe]] on 8 May 1945, achieved with its allies the United States, the Soviet Union and other Allied countries. The [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was the longest continuous military campaign of the War. In the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asian theatre]], the [[Eastern Fleet]] conducted strikes in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the British Army led the [[Burma campaign]] against Japan, which was finally successful from late-1944 to mid-1945. The [[British Pacific Fleet]] took part in the [[Battle of Okinawa]] and the final naval strikes on Japan. British scientists [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|contributed to the Manhattan Project]] which led to the [[surrender of Japan]], announced on 15 August 1945.

==Background==
{{see also|Statement Relating to Defence|British Army during the Second World War}}
Although the UK had increased military spending and funding prior to 1939 in response to the increasing strength of [[Nazi Germany|Germany under the Nazi Party]], its forces were still weak by comparison, especially the [[British Army]]. Only the [[Royal Navy]]  – at the time the largest in the world<ref>"Royal Navy in 1939 and 1945". Naval-history.net. 8/7/11</ref> – was of a greater strength than its German counterpart. The British Army only had nine [[Division (military)|divisions]] available for war, whereas Germany had seventy-eight and France eighty-six.<ref>N.H. Gibbs, ''Grand Strategy:  Volume 1 Rearmament Policy'' [[History of the Second World War]] (1976) HMSO</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Nonetheless, "Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system."<ref name="Edgerton2012">{{Cite web|title=Britain's War Machine|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/55731/britain-s-war-machine/9780141026107.html|last=Edgerton|first=David|date=2012|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|title=Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources and Experts in the Second World War|url=https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1114|website=Reviews in History|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> After becoming Prime Minister in 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] engaged industry, scientists and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.<ref name="Edgerton2012" /> Much of the scientific work that led to [[Technology during World War II|technology that determined the outcome of the war]], such as [[radar]], was done before 1940,<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1919-02-15|title=Work Done by 1,500,000 Horses in France during the War|journal=Scientific American|volume=87|issue=2250supp|pages=105|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican02151919-105bsupp|issn=0036-8733}}</ref> and shared with the Americans that year through the [[Tizard Mission]] which led to extensive [[Allied technological cooperation during World War II|Allied technological cooperation]]. The [[Manhattan Project]], however, was undertaken during the war beginning in 1942, to which the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British contribution]] included the [[Tube Alloys]] work since 1941.

==Beginning of the conflict==
Anticipating the [[Causes of World War II#Specific developments|outbreak of another world war]], the [[Polish Navy]] implemented the [[Peking Plan]] in late August and early September 1939, moving three modern destroyers, {{ORP|Burza||2}}, {{ORP|Błyskawica||2}}, and {{ORP|Grom|1936|2}} to Britain; the ships served alongside (and under the command of) the Royal Navy for the remainder of the war.
[[File:Declaration of war naval message.jpg|thumb|upright| The message sent to ships of the Royal Navy informing them of the outbreak of war.]]
[[File:Hrh Princess Elizabeth in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, April 1945 TR2832.jpg|thumb|right|Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] April 1945]]
On 3 September, the UK and France declared war on Germany as obliged by the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]]. The declaration was made 24 hours after the UK had issued an ultimatum to Germany to withdraw all German forces from [[Poland]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|fall of Poland]], the Royal Navy was strengthened by the arrival of two Polish submarines {{ORP|Orzeł|1938|2}} and {{ORP|Wilk|1929|2}}. The Polish Navy in the United Kingdom was then supplemented with leased British ships.

The British Army immediately began dispatching the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to support France. At first only regular troops from the pre-war Army made up its numbers. In 1940, however, men of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) divisions being mobilized in the UK were sent. In the end, the BEF had [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I]], [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II]] and [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] under its command, controlling 200,000 men. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) also sent significant forces to France at the start of hostilities. Some were [[French Army]] cooperation squadrons to help with matters like reconnaissance for the [[French Army]]. Others were [[Hawker Hurricane]] squadrons from [[RAF Fighter Command]]. Separately, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] sent the [[Advanced Air Striking Force]], composed of squadrons flying the [[Fairey Battle]] and other machines that did not have the range to reach Germany from the UK.<ref>J.R.M. Butler, ''Grand Strategy: Sept. 1939 – June 1941'' (1957)pp 151–74</ref>

During the [[Phoney War]], the RAF carried out small bombing raids and a large number of [[propaganda]] leaflet raids (code-named "Nickels") and the Royal Navy imposed a coastal blockade on Germany.

==Western and northern Europe, 1940 and 1941==

===Norwegian campaign===
{{main|Norwegian campaign}}
[[File:Ruinsofnamsos.jpg|thumbnail|right|British troops during the [[Namsos Campaign]].]]
[[Norway]] loomed large in German strategy because of the great [[iron ore]] deposits in northern [[Sweden]] and the long seacoast that would preclude a blockade of the sort that hurt Germany in the First World War. Predicting correctly that the UK would make a preemptive move against neutral Norway to stop the flow of ore from [[Narvik]], [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered an invasion to begin on 9 April 1940. The [[Wehrmacht]] succeeded in their mission, landing a large force at vital strategic points in Norway. British land forces were quickly sent to Norway, landing in the centre at [[Åndalsnes]] and at [[Namsos Campaign|Namsos]] and in the north of the country at Narvik. The [[Luftwaffe]] deterred landings farther south.<ref>J.R.M. Butler, ''Grand Strategy: Sept. 1939 – June 1941'' (1957) pp 119–50</ref>

British troops made amphibious landings at [[Namsos Campaign|Namsos]] during April 1940 in an effort to stop the Germans advancing North. The British Forces' attacks south were stopped and they were soon surrounded in the [[Namsos (town)|town of Namsos]]. The British were faced with attacks from the Luftwaffe and increasing difficulty with landing fresh troops and supplies from the sea.<ref>Steinkjer Encyclopedia: [http://www.steinkjerleksikonet.no/index.php?artikkel=79 Bombing Sunday] {{in lang|no}}</ref> [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|General De Wiart]] was given orders to evacuate his forces on 28 April. All British troops were evacuated by 4 May 1940.

In central Norway, Royal Navy aircraft-carriers and RAF fighter squadrons could not keep the established bases secure, and the British had to evacuate them. In the north, the Germans were [[Battles of Narvik|driven out of Narvik]] after they had captured it. However, as Luftwaffe aircraft came into range with the German advances, it was again found to be impossible to sustain bases in the face of aerial threat. British forces in Narvik were withdrawn as well.<ref>[[François Kersaudy]], ''Norway 1940'' (1998)</ref>

As a consequence of the loss of Norway and Denmark, the Royal Navy commenced a pre-emptive [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|occupation of the Faroe Islands]] on 12 April 1940.

On 10 May 1940, the Royal Navy [[Invasion of Iceland|occupied Iceland]] to install naval and air bases on this Atlantic island.<ref>Donald F. Bittner, ''The Lion and the White Falcon: Britain and Iceland in the World War II Era'' (1983)</ref>

===The Battle of France===
{{main|Battle of France}}

Following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force was sent to the Franco-Belgian border in mid-September. The first deployment was completed by 11 October 1939 at which point 158,000 men had been transported to France.<ref name="atkin1990">{{cite book | title=Pillar of Fire: Dunkirk 1940 | publisher=Birlinn Limited | author=Atkin, Ronald | year=1990 | location=Edinburgh | pages=16–17, 58 | isbn=1-84158-078-3}}</ref> Over the next few months, troops, materials and vehicles continued to arrive in France and Belgium and by 13 March 1940 the BEF had doubled in size to 316,000 men.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britains Armies in France Doubled|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 1940|page=8}}</ref>

This period leading up to 10 May 1940 was known as the [[Phoney War]], as there was little combat apart from minor clashes of [[reconnaissance]] patrols. The Allied generals believed that time was on their side, and hoped to weaken Germany by [[blockade]] before going on the offensive.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HP3-9NNz71sC&pg=PA43&dq=british+expeditionary+force+1940&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0StUK3QLcSAhQeP9YGoAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=british%20expeditionary%20force%201940&f=false Thomas B. Buell, John N. Bradley, John H. Bradley, ''The Second World War: Europe and the Mediterranean''] Square One Publishers 2002, {{ISBN|0-7570-0160-2}} (pp.43-44)</ref>

On 10 May the stalemated Phoney War ended with a sweeping German invasion of the [[Benelux]]. German troops entered France through the [[Ardennes]] on 13 May. Most Allied forces were in [[Flanders]], anticipating a re-run of the [[World War I]] [[Schlieffen Plan]]. The push by the German Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides and cut off from their supply depots by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] on 21 May. The BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the [[Channel ports]] were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend [[Boulogne]] and [[Calais]], but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May (see [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)]] and [[Siege of Calais (1940)]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/siege_calais_1940.html|title=Siege of Calais, 23-26 May 1940|website=www.historyofwar.org}}</ref> Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to [[Dunkirk]], the only viable port remaining, to facilitate evacuation. In total, 338,226 troops were pulled off the beaches, of which 230,000 were British. However, almost all the army's equipment had been abandoned in France — many soldiers were unable to bring even their rifles.<ref>Doug Dildy and Howard Gerrard, ''Dunkirk 1940: Operation Dynamo'' (2010)</ref>

Despite failing to destroy the BEF, the Germans had succeeded in cutting off British formations from reaching the evacuation at Dunkirk. They were; the Saar Force, chiefly composed of the [[British 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (World War II)|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]], most of the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]], and an improvised force called [[Beauman Division]]. Churchill and the Chiefs-of-Staff originally decided to form a "Second BEF" that would help defend the rest of France but [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|General Alan Brooke]] managed to persuade them that the remaining forces faced annihilation if they tried to fight on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/LondonGazette/37573.html|title=HyperWar: London Gazette No. 37573|website=www.ibiblio.org}}</ref> Churchill ordered that all British troops should be evacuated from France without delay. From 15 to 25 June 191,870 allied troops (144,171 of them British) and a large amount of their equipment were rescued from eight major sea ports on the southwest coast of France in ''Operation Ariel''.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-21.html Ellis, L. F. (1954) The War in France and Flanders 1939–1940. HMSO London] (p.305)</ref> The only serious setback was the bombing of the troopship [[RMS Lancastria|''Lancastria'']] off [[St Nazaire]], resulting in the deaths of about 4,000 of those on board; the exact number has never been established.<ref>The Sinking of the Lancastria, Jonathan Fenby, 2005 Simon & Schuster UK Ltd, p.247</ref>

As a result of the Germans' [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics and superior German communications, the [[Battle of France]] was shorter than virtually all prewar Allied thought could have conceived, with France surrendering after six weeks. The UK and its Empire were left to stand alone.<ref>J.R.M. Butler, ''Grand Strategy: Sept. 1939 – June 1941'' (1975) pp 175–206</ref> When France fell the position changed drastically. A combination of the French, German and Italian navies could potentially deny the UK command of the Atlantic and starve the country into submission. Unable to discover whether the terms of the French surrender would permit Germany the use of French warships, it was decided that their use must be denied to the enemy. Those that had taken refuge in British ports were simply taken over (many volunteered to join the British). See below for details of how the British neutralized the [[French Mediterranean Fleet]].<ref>J.R.M. Butler, ''Grand Strategy: Sept. 1939 – June 1941''</ref>

During the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned, to be replaced by [[Winston Churchill]], who had opposed negotiation with Hitler all along.

==The war at sea==
The Royal Navy was far more powerful than the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''.<ref>Corelli Barnett, ''Engage the Enemy More Closely: The Royal Navy in the Second World War'' (1991)</ref> Its main roles were to keep:
* the North Atlantic open, despite German submarine and anti-convoy actions
* the Mediterranean open to the Allies and closed to the Germans and Italians
* routes open through the Indian Ocean to India and Australia

The Japanese Navy was stronger than the German naval forces, however, and in the Pacific it confronted primarily the United States Navy while dealing sharp blows to the Royal Navy in 1941–42 in the area from Singapore to Ceylon.<ref>S. W. Roskill, ''The White Ensign: British Navy at War, 1939–1945'' (1960)</ref>

===Opening moves===
[[File:Admiral Graf Spee Flames.jpg|thumb|''Admiral Graf Spee'' in flames after being scuttled in the [[Rio de la Plata]] Estuary off Montevideo, Uruguay.]]
At the start of the war the British and French expected to have command of the seas, as they believed their navies were superior to those of Germany and Italy. The British and French immediately began a [[blockade of Germany (1939-1945)|blockade of Germany]], which had little effect on German industry. The [[Kriegsmarine|German navy]] began to attack British shipping with both surface ships and [[U-boat]]s, sinking {{SS|Athenia}} within hours of the declaration of war. The German ''[[Deutschland-class cruiser|Panzerschiff]]'' {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} was cornered in the [[Battle of the River Plate]] by the [[Royal Navy|British]] and [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]] navies and its captain scuttled her.<ref>Barnett, ''Engage the Enemy More Closely: The Royal Navy in the Second World War'' (1991) ch2</ref><ref>Roskill, ''The White Ensign: British Navy at War, 1939–1945'' (1960) ch 3</ref>

===Battle of the Atlantic===
{{main|Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)}}
The Battle of the Atlantic was the contest between merchant ships, usually in convoys, and the German submarine force. The battle ebbed and flowed, until the Allies gained a decisive advantage in 1943 using destroyers, destroyer escorts, air surveillance, new depth charges, and [[Ultra]] intelligence that revealed the location of German [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]].<ref>Barnett, ''Engage the Enemy More Closely: The Royal Navy in the Second World War'' (1991) pp 194–6</ref><ref>Montgomery C. Meigs, ''Slide Rules and Submarines: American Scientists and Subsurface Warfare in World War II'' (2002)</ref>

====First 'Happy Time'====
[[File:Gunners with 4 inch rounds HMS Vivien 1940 IWM A 1770.jpg|thumb|Gunners of {{HMS|Vivien}} displaying anti-aircraft rounds, 11 November 1940.]]
With the [[fall of France]] in June 1940, ports such as [[Brest, France]] were quickly turned into large submarine bases from which British trade could be attacked. This resulted in a huge rise in sinkings of British shipping. The period between the fall of France and the British containment of the threat was referred to as the [[First Happy Time]] by the [[U Boat]] commanders.

By 1941 the United States and Canada were taking an increasing part in the war. British forces had [[Invasion of Iceland|occupied Iceland]] shortly after Denmark fell to the Germans in 1940, the US was persuaded to provide forces to relieve British troops on the island. American warships began escorting convoys to [[Iceland]], and had several hostile encounters with [[U-boats]]. The [[United States Navy]] also helped escort the main Atlantic convoys.

More American help came in the form of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] in September 1940. Fifty old American destroyers were handed over to the Royal Navy in exchange for [[99-year lease]]s on certain British bases in the western hemisphere. Although plagued with mechanical problems, these old ships performed anti-submarine patrols in 1941–42.<ref>Daniel S. Greenberg, "U.S. Destroyers For British Bases – Fifty Old Ships Go To War," ''U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings,'' Nov 1962, Vol. 88 Issue 11, pp 70–83</ref>

In addition, personnel training in the RN improved as the realities of the battle became obvious. For instance, the training regime of Vice Admiral [[Gilbert O. Stephenson]] is credited in improving personnel standards to a significant degree.

====Second 'Happy Time'====
{{main|Second Happy Time}}
The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 and the subsequent German declaration of war on the United States made it a global war. German [[U-boats]] conducted a highly successful campaign against traffic along the American east coast. A proportion of the ships sunk were en route to assembly points for convoys to the UK. German sailors called this the "[[second happy time]]". It came to an end when a convoy system operated along the coast and adequate anti-submarine measures were employed.

====Success against the U-boats====
[[File:HMS Kite depth charge attack 1944 IWM A 21989.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Kite|U87|6}} conducting a depth charge attack, 1944.]]
The institution of an interlocking convoy system on the American coast and in the [[Caribbean Sea]] in mid-1942 created an enormous drop in attacks in those areas. Attention shifted back to the Atlantic convoys. Matters were serious, but not critical throughout much of 1942.

The winter weather provided a respite in early 1943, but in the spring, large "wolf packs" of U-boats attacked convoys and scored big successes without taking large losses in return. However, in May 1943 a sudden turnaround happened. Two convoys were attacked by large wolf packs and suffered losses. Yet unlike earlier in the year the attacking submarines were also mauled. After those battles merchant ship losses plummeted and [[U-boat]] losses rocketed, forcing [[Karl Dönitz]] to withdraw his forces from the Atlantic. They were never again to pose the same threat. What had changed was a sudden convergence of technologies. The large gap in the middle of the Atlantic that had been unreachable by aircraft was closed by long range [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft. Centimetric [[radar]] came into service, greatly improving detection and nullifying German radar warning equipment. The introduction of the [[Leigh Light]] enabled accurate attacks on U-boats re-charging their batteries on the surface at night. With convoys securely protected there were enough resources to allow escort carrier groups to aggressively hunt U-boats.<ref>David Syrett, ''The defeat of the German U-boats: the Battle of the Atlantic'' (1994) p 263</ref>

====Arctic convoys====
{{main|Arctic convoys of World War II}}

The Arctic convoys travelled from the US and the UK to the northern ports of the [[Soviet Union]] – [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Murmansk]].

85 Allied merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost. The Germans committed significant naval and air assets and lost one [[battlecruiser]], at least 30 [[U-boats]], and a large number of aircraft.<ref>Arnold Hague, ''The allied convoy system 1939–1945: its organization, defence and operation'' (2000)</ref> Particularly during the winter of 1941–2, meaningful material aid was provided to the Soviet Union via the Arctic route.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hill |first=Alexander |year=2007 |title= British Lend Lease Aid and the Soviet War Effort, June 1941-June 1942|jstor= 30052890 |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=773–808 |doi=10.1353/jmh.2007.0206 |s2cid=159715267 }}</ref>

===The Mediterranean===
{{main|Battle of the Mediterranean}}
[[File:Bombs falling astern of HMS Ark Royal A2298.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} under attack from Italian aircraft during the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]], 27 November 1940.]]
The Royal Navy and [[Italian Navy]] battled for three years for control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Kriegsmarine]] also took part in the campaign, primarily by sending U-Boats into the Mediterranean, but latterly by controlling the few remaining [[Axis powers|Axis]] naval forces after the Italian surrender.

At the outset of the war, the area was numerically dominated by the British and [[French navy|French]] navies, and Italy was initially a neutral power astride communications in the centre of the area. The situation changed vastly with the fall of France and the declaration of war by Italy. While the [[British Mediterranean Fleet]] based at [[Alexandria]] controlled the eastern end of the Mediterranean, there was a need to replace French naval power in the west. To do this [[Force H]] was formed at [[Gibraltar]]. The British Government was still concerned that the remaining French ships would be used by the Axis powers. Consequently, they took steps to neutralise it.

At Alexandria, relations between the French and British commanders, Admirals [[René-Émile Godfroy]] and [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], were good. The French squadron there was impounded in the port. In the western basin things did not go so smoothly. The bulk of the French fleet was at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] in [[North Africa]]. Force H steamed there to confront the French with terms. Those terms were all rejected and so the French fleet was attacked and heavily damaged by Force H. The [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government broke off all ties with the British as a result. (See [[destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir]].)

====Battle of Taranto====

The Italian battle fleet dominated the centre of the Mediterranean and so the Royal Navy hatched a plan to cripple it. On 11 November 1940, the Royal Navy crippled or destroyed three Italian [[battleships]] in port by using [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] borne aircraft, the obsolescent [[Fairey Swordfish]], in the [[Battle of Taranto]]. As a result, the Italian fleet was withdrawn from [[Taranto]] and never again based in such a forward position. The Japanese used lessons from this battle in planning their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.<ref>Thomas P. Lowry and John W. G. Wellham, ''The Attack on Taranto: Blueprint for Pearl Harbor'' (2000)</ref>

====Battle of Matapan====
The first fleet action of the war in the Mediterranean was the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]. It was a decisive Allied victory, fought off the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] coast of [[Greece]] from 27 March to 29 March 1941 in which Royal Navy and [[Royal Australian Navy]] forces, under the command of the British Admiral Cunningham, intercepted those of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'', under Admiral [[Angelo Iachino]]. The Allies sank the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[Italian cruiser Fiume|''Fiume'']], [[Italian cruiser Zara|''Zara'']] and [[Italian cruiser Pola|''Pola'']] and the [[destroyer]]s ''Vittorio Alfieri'' and ''Giosue Carducci'', and damaged the battleship [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']]. The British lost one torpedo plane and suffered light damage to some ships.<ref>[[S. W. C. Pack]], ''The Battle of Matapan'' (1968)</ref>

====Yugoslavia, Greece, and Crete====
{{main|Greco-Italian War|Invasion of Yugoslavia|Battle of Greece|Battle of Crete|Balkans Campaign (World War II)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-161-0317-26, Balkan, Griechenland, britischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Destroyed British cruiser tank in Greece.]]

Germany launched its [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] on 6 April 1941, winning a quick victory but delaying the much larger planned invasion of Russia ([[Operation Barbarossa]]).

The [[Battle of Greece]] (also known as to the Wehrmacht as "Operation Marita", or ''Unternehmen Marita'') pitted Greek and [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces against German, Italian and Bulgarian forces. On 2 March 1941, the British launched [[Operation Lustre]], the transportation of troops and equipment to Greece. Twenty-six troopships arrived at the port of [[Piraeus]] and more than 62,000 Commonwealth troops landed in Greece. The Commonwealth forces comprised the [[6th Australian Division]], the [[New Zealand 2nd Division]], and the [[British 1st Armoured Brigade]]. On 3 April, during a meeting of British, Yugoslav, and Greek military representatives, the Yugoslavs promised to block the [[Struma River|Strimon valley]] in case of a German attack across their territory. During this meeting, Papagos laid stress on the importance of a joint Greco-Yugoslavian offensive against the Italians as soon as the Germans launched their offensive against Yugoslavia and Greece.

In the aftermath of the German invasion of Greece, only the island of [[Crete]] remained in Allied hands in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] area. The Germans invaded in a combined operation and forced the evacuation of the British forces. Of more than 40,000 Allied soldiers, fewer than 20,000 managed to escape. The evacuation was also costly to the Royal Navy. It lost 4 cruisers and 6 destroyers sunk during the evacuation. Admiral Cunningham was determined that the "navy must not let the army down"; when Army generals feared he would lose too many ships Cunningham remarked "It takes three years to build a ship, it takes three centuries to build a tradition".<ref>G.

====Malta====
{{main |Siege of Malta (World War II)}}
[[File:Operation Pedestal, August 1942 A11200.jpg|thumb|Convoy on its way to Malta under heavy air attack during Operation Pedestal, 11 August 1942.]]
[[Malta]], which lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, proved a standing thorn in the side of the Axis. It lay in a perfect strategic position to intercept Axis supplies destined for North Africa. For a time it looked as if Axis aircraft flying from bases in Italy would starve Malta into submission. The turning point in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]] came in August 1942, when the British sent a very heavily defended convoy code named [[Operation Pedestal]]. Despite the sinking of about half of the ships sent, the convoy managed to deliver enough food and aviation fuel to enable Malta to hold out until the siege was lifted. With the aid of [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]], Malta-based aircraft and submarines sank crucial Axis shipping to North Africa immediately before the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] of October–November 1942. Following Allied territorial gains in Libya and [[Operation Torch|in the Western Mediterranean]], the siege was lifted. For the fortitude and courage of the Maltese during the siege, the island was awarded the [[George Cross]] by King George VI in early 1942.

====Large-scale invasions====
In late 1942 [[Operation Torch]], the first large Allied combined operation, was launched. The British and Americans landed in force invading French North Africa, but far enough west that the Germans were able to invade Tunisia (owned by France) and make it their base of operations.<ref>Michael Howard, ''Grand Strategy. Vol. IV: August 1942 – September 1943'' (1972) pp 337–56</ref>

Torch was followed by [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] the invasion of [[Sicily]], and [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of southern Italy. Again the naval forces escorted the invasion fleet and heavy cover was provided against Italian interference. In the aftermath of Avalanche, the Italian surrender was announced and the British naval forces escorted the Italian fleet to Malta under the terms of the surrender. The main threat to Allied shipping around Italy during these invasions was not the Italian fleet but German guided weapons which sunk or damaged a number of Allied units.<ref>Michael Howard, ''Grand Strategy. Vol. IV: August 1942 – September 1943'' (1972) pp 359–71</ref>

After the surrender of the Italian fleet, naval operations in the Mediterranean became relatively mundane, consisting largely of supporting ground troops by bombardment, anti-submarine missions, covert insertions of agents on enemy coast and convoy escort.

====Aegean sweep====
The one major exception to mundane missions occurred in late 1944. Due to their garrisons on the various islands of the Aegean, the Germans had maintained control over the Aegean Sea long after they had lost other areas of the Mediterranean to Allied control. In late 1944, that changed as an Allied carrier task force moved into the area. Composed entirely of [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]], the task force wreaked havoc with German shipping in the area and re-asserted Allied dominance over the last remaining area of the Mediterranean still controlled by the Germans.

===Operation Overlord and the Normandy landings===
[[File:D-day - British Forces during the Invasion of Normandy 6 June 1944 A23916.jpg|thumb|250px|right|{{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} bombarding German defensive positions off Normandy, 6 June 1944.]]
[[Normandy Landings|The invasion of Normandy]] was the greatest amphibious assault yet. Over 1,000 fighting ships and some 5,000 other ships were involved. The sheer number of vessels involved meant that nearly all of the major ports of the United Kingdom were at capacity immediately preceding the assault.

The five assault divisions crossed the channel in five great assault groups, there were two task forces, the Anglo-Canadian Eastern Task Force and the American Western Task Force. Coastal Command secured the western flank of the invasion route against interference by German [[U-Boats]] from the western French ports. The surface forces assisted by protecting the assault convoys from the small German surface forces in the area. [[Operation Overlord]] saw an enormous minesweeping operation, with hundreds of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] clearing and maintaining channels. The bombardment forces were on an enormous scale, with eight battleships taking part in the assault. The formidable defences of the [[Atlantic Wall]] were difficult to contend with, and many duels between the heavy ships and shore batteries were fought during the invasion.

On the whole the assault went well, although disaster came nearest to occurring for the Americans at Omaha Beach. There the naval forces provided crucial backup for the assaulting forces, with [[destroyer]]s coming in very close to the beach to blast the German defences. British losses to enemy attack both during the initial assault and the building of the bridgehead were comparatively small. Virtually no ships were sunk by German naval surface forces as this force was largely destroyed prior to the invasion.

Two of the ports used by the German light forces were heavily bombed by the Allied air forces. The larger German ships based in France, three destroyers from [[Bordeaux]] were defeated in a destroyer action well to the west of the main assault area. Larger problems were caused by U-boats and especially [[Naval mine|mines]], but the U-boats were hunted down and the mines swept effectively enough to make the invasion a success.

===The East===

====Indian Ocean disaster====
[[File:Dorsetshire&Cornwall.jpg|thumb|British heavy cruisers [[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|''Dorsetshire'']] and [[HMS Cornwall (56)|''Cornwall'']] under Japanese air attack and heavily damaged on 5 April 1942]]
Though the [[Indian Ocean]] was a backwater during [[World War II]], there were several vital operations in that area. British convoys running through the western [[Indian Ocean]] were vital for supplying Allied forces in [[North Africa]]. They faced a small but consistent threat from both German and Japanese "surface raiders" and [[submarines]]. Tankers sailing from the oil terminals of [[Iran]] also had to run the same gauntlet.

The major operations in the [[Indian Ocean]] took place in early 1942 and 1944/45.

British forces in the [[Singapore]] region were reinforced by the battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and battlecruiser [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] in December 1941. However, on 10 December those two ships were sunk by Japanese aircraft, with [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] becoming the first battleship in history to be sunk strictly by airpower while at sea and fighting back.

Japanese forces captured [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] (now [[Malaysia]]), [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] forcing the remaining British warships to withdraw to [[Trincomalee]], Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), and in February 1942, they were reconstituted into the [[British Eastern Fleet]]. On paper, the fleet looked impressive, boasting five [[battleship]]s and three aircraft carriers. However, four of the battleships were old and obsolete and one of the [[aircraft carrier]]s was small and virtually useless in a fleet action as the new fleet commander, Admiral [[James Somerville (admiral)|James Somerville]], noted.

Following successes over American forces in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], the main Japanese carrier force made its one and only [[Indian Ocean raid|foray into the Indian Ocean]] in April 1942. [[Chuichi Nagumo|Nagumo]] took the main force after the British fleet and a subsidiary raid was made on shipping in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The weight and experience of this Japanese force far outweighed that available to the Royal Navy. During these attacks, two British [[heavy cruiser]]s, {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} and {{HMS|Cornwall|56|6}}, the aircraft carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']], and the Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}} were sunk by [[Aichi D3A]] ''Val'' dive bombers.

Fortuitously, or by design, the main British fleet did not make contact with the Japanese and thus remained available for future action.

====Indian Ocean retreat====
Following those attacks, the British fleet retreated to [[Kilindini]] in [[East Africa]], as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the [[Indian Ocean]] was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships.

One exception was [[Operation Ironclad]], a campaign launched when it was feared that Vichy French [[Madagascar]] might fall into Japanese hands, to be used as a submarine base. Such a blow would have been devastating to British lines of communication to the [[Far East]] and [[Middle East]], but the Japanese never contemplated it. The French resisted more than expected, and more operations were needed to capture the island, but it did eventually fall.

====Indian Ocean strike====
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A27166.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman Avenger]] from {{HMS|Indefatigable}} forming up for raid on a Japanese oil refinery in Sumatra, January 1945.]]
It was only after the war in Europe was coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again after the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944. The success of [[Operation Overlord]] in June meant even more craft from the Home Fleet could be sent, including precious [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assault shipping.

During late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area, a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in [[Sumatra]] to prepare British carriers for the upcoming operations in the Pacific. For the first attack, the United States lent {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}. The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the Allied blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for [[Sydney]] to become the British Pacific Fleet.

After the departure of the main battle forces, the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of [[Burma]], including landings on [[Ramree]], [[Akyab]] and near [[Rangoon]].

====Blockade of Japan====
British forces consistently played a secondary but significant role to American forces in the strangling of Japan's trade. The earliest successes were gained by mine laying. The Japanese [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare.

British submarines also operated against Japanese shipping, although later in the war. They were based in Ceylon, [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] and finally the [[Philippines]]. A major success was the sinking of several Japanese cruisers.

==The North African desert, Middle East, and Africa==

[[File:6 inch howitzers Tobruk Jan 1941 AWM 005610.jpeg|thumb|British 6 inch howitzers in action at Tobruk during Operation Compass, 23 January 1941.]]
On 13 September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army crossed the border from the Italian colony of [[Libya]] into [[Egypt]], where British troops were protecting the [[Suez Canal]]. The [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Italian invasion]] carried through to [[Sidi Barrani]], approximately 95&nbsp;km inside Egypt. The Italians then began to [[Trench#Military engineering|entrench]]. At this time there were only 30,000 British available to defend against 250,000 Italian troops. The Italian decision to halt the advance is generally credited to them being unaware of the British strength, and the activity of British naval forces operating in the Mediterranean to interfere with Italian supply lines. There were Royal Navy seaports at [[Alexandria]], [[Haifa]], and [[Port Said]]. Following the halt of the Italian Tenth Army, the British used the [[Western Desert Force]]'s [[Jock column]]s to harass their lines in Egypt.

===The Offensive===
On 11 November 1940, the Royal Navy crippled or destroyed three Italian battleships in the [[Battle of Taranto]].

Then, on 8 December 1940, [[Operation Compass]] began. Planned as an extended raid, a force of British, Indian and Australian troops succeeded in cutting off the Italian troops. Pressing their advantage home, General [[Richard O'Connor]] pressed the attack forwards and succeeded in reaching [[El Agheila]] (an advance of 500 miles), capturing tens of thousands of enemy troops. The Italian army was virtually destroyed, and it seemed that the Italians would be swept out of [[Libya]]. However, at the crucial moment, [[Winston Churchill]] ordered that the advance be stopped and troops dispatched to defend [[Greece]]. Weeks later the first German troops were arriving in North Africa to reinforce the Italians.

===Iraq, Syria and Persia===
{{See also|Anglo-Iraqi War|Syria-Lebanon campaign|Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran}}
[[File:A Fordson Armoured Car of No. 2 Armoured Car Company RAF waits outside Baghdad, while negotiations for an armistice take place between British officials and the rebel government during the Iraqi Revolt, May 194 CM923.jpg|thumb|An Armoured Car of No. 2 Armoured Car Company RAF waits outside Baghdad, while negotiations for an armistice take place between British officials and the rebel government, May 1941.]]
In May 1941, to add to British troubles in the area, there was a [[Iraq coup (1941)|coup d'état]] against the pro-British government in [[Iraq]]. A pro-German [[Rashid Ali al-Kaylani|ruler]] took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around [[Basra]] and at [[RAF Habbaniya|Habbaniya]] north east of [[Baghdad]]. Basra was too well defended for the Iraqis to consider taking. However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated in the middle of enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.

When Iraqi forces came to Habbaniya, they surrounded the base and gave warning that any military activity would be considered as hostile, leading to an attack. However, the RAF training aircraft took off and bombed the Iraqi forces, repelling them from the base. Columns were then set out from Habbaniya, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Basra to capture Baghdad, and put an end to the coup. They succeeded at relatively low cost, but there was a disturbing development during the campaign.

A [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft was shot down over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. The nearest Axis bases were on [[Rhodes]], and so the aircraft had to stage through somewhere to be able to get to Iraq. The only possible place was [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled [[Syria]]. This overtly hostile action could not be tolerated. Consequently, after victory in Iraq, British forces invaded Syria and [[Lebanon]] to remove the Vichy officials from power there. Vigorous resistance was put up by the French against British and Australian forces moving into Lebanon from Palestine. However, pressure there eventually overwhelmed, and when this combined with an advance on [[Damascus]] from Iraq, the French surrendered.

The final major military operation in the war in the [[Middle East]] took place shortly thereafter. The [[Soviet Union]] desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent around the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] convoy route to [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]], but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from the United States to [[Vladivostok]] in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through [[Persia]] (now [[Iran]]). The [[Shah]] of Persia was somewhat pro-German, and so would not allow this. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Persia. The Shah was deposed (removed from power) and his son put on the throne.

===Ethiopia===
[[File:KAR soldiers collecting arms at Wolchefit Pass.jpg|thumb|Men of the King's African Rifles collecting surrendered arms at [[Uolchefit|Wolchefit]] Pass, after the last Italians had ceased resistance in Ethiopia]]
{{See also|East African Campaign (World War II)}}

The Italians declared war on 10 June 1940 and in addition to the well known campaigns in the western desert, a front was opened against them in [[Africa]]. This front was in and around the [[Italian East Africa]]n colonies: [[Ethiopia]], [[Italian Somaliland]], and [[Eritrea]].

As in [[Egypt]], British forces were massively outnumbered by their Italian opponents. However, unlike Libya, Ethiopia was isolated from the Italian mainland, and the Italians were thus cut off from resupply.

The first offensive moves of the [[Military campaign|campaign]] fell to the Italians. They attacked in three directions, into [[Sudan]], [[Kenya]] and [[British Somaliland]]. Only in the [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] did they enjoy full success. The British garrison in Somaliland was outnumbered, and after a couple of weeks of fighting had to be evacuated to [[Aden]]. In Sudan and Kenya, the Italians conquered only some small areas around border villages.

After their offensives petered out, as in Egypt, the Italians adopted a passive attitude and waited for the inevitable British counter-attack. Attention then shifted to the naval sphere.

The Italians had a small naval squadron based at [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]], called the [[Red Sea Flotilla]]. This was a threat to the British convoys heading up the [[Red Sea]]. It consisted of a few destroyers and submarines. However, the squadron was not used aggressively and mostly acted as a "[[fleet in being]]". As supplies of fuel decreased, its opportunities for action also decreased. The Italians made one major attempt to attack a convoy, and they were roundly defeated in doing so. Following that attack, most of the surface ships of the squadron were sunk, and the submarines that escaped travelled around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to return to Italy.

British forces were thin on the ground in East Africa, and the two nations that made the greatest contribution to victory on land were [[South Africa]] and [[British India|India]]. South Africa provided much needed airpower and troops. The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] made up the mainstay of the British ground forces. In the end, two Indian divisions saw combat in [[Ethiopia]].

Another important aspect of the campaign to retake Ethiopia was [[irregular military|irregular forces]]. Major [[Orde Wingate]], later to gain fame in [[Burma]] with the [[Chindits]] was a major mover behind the Ethiopian "patriots" as they were referred to by the British. The irregulars, formed into the [[Gideon Force]], disrupted Italian supply lines and provided vital intelligence to British forces.

The regular push to take Ethiopia began once reinforcements arrived from Egypt. The arrival of the first Australian division in North Africa had allowed the release of the [[Indian 4th Infantry Division]] to be sent to East Africa. Along with the [[Indian 5th Infantry Division]], it quickly took the offensive from Sudan, the Indian divisions were supported by a thrust from Kenya. An amphibious assault on [[British Somaliland]] was staged from Aden. The three thrusts converged on the Ethiopian capital of [[Addis Ababa]], which fell early in May 1941.

The Italians made a final stand around the town of [[Amba Alagi]], before they were finally defeated. Amba Alagi fell in mid-May 1941. The last significant Italian forces surrendered at [[Gondar]] in November 1941, receiving full military honors.

After December 1941, some Italians launched a limited [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] and Eritrea that lasted until the middle of 1943 when Italy left the war, (see [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Armistice with Italy]]).

===War in the Western Desert===
[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb|British infantry near El Alamein during the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], 17 July 1942.]]
After Rommel's first offensive, a reorganisation of British command took place. In November 1941, the [[British Eighth Army]] was activated under Lieutenant General Sir [[Alan Cunningham]]. Its first offensive failed disastrously as German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] blunted the thrust.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} British operational doctrine failed to encourage the effective use of [[tank]]s – a prerequisite{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} for successful modern desert warfare. Cunningham was relieved of command and Major General [[Neil Ritchie]] was put in his place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, a second British offensive in late 1941 turned Rommel's flank and led to the relief of [[Tobruk]]. Again [[Cyrenaica]] fell into British hands, this time the advance went as far as [[El Agheila]]. However outside events again intervened to impede British efforts; as the British attack reached El Agheila Japan attacked in the [[Far East]]. That meant that reinforcements that had been destined for the Middle East went elsewhere. This was to have disastrous effects.

Rommel took the offensive again in January 1942. He had been instructed by his high command to only conduct a limited offensive against British positions. However, he disobeyed orders and exploited the British collapse.

An operation had been planned to take [[Malta]], and thus reduce its strangulation of Rommel's supply lines. However, with his new offensive, Rommel was consuming [[materiel]] meant for the Malta attack. It came down to a choice of attacking Malta or supporting Rommel; Rommel's attack won out. At the time Malta seemed neutralised, but this mistake was to come to haunt the Axis later.

Confusion in British ranks was horrendous as attempts to shore up the position failed time and again. After the [[Battle of Gazala]], Rommel not only drove the British out of [[Libya]], and somewhat into Egypt, but he pushed deep into the protectorate. [[Tobruk]] fell quickly, and there was no repeat of the epic siege that Rommel's last advance had produced. A prepared defensive line at [[Mersa Matruh]] was outflanked, and disaster beckoned. Ritchie was dismissed as Eighth Army commander and [[Claude Auchinleck]], the Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]], came forward to take command of it himself. After Matruh there was only one more defensive position before [[Cairo]] itself; [[El Alamein]].

Auchinlek managed to stop Rommel with the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].

A new command team arrived in the Middle East, with Lieutenant General Sir [[Bernard Montgomery]] assuming command of the Eighth Army. Rommel tried to break through again during the [[Battle of Alam Halfa]], but his thrust was stopped. Montgomery then began preparations for a great breakthrough offensive that would result in the pursuit of Axis forces all the way to [[Tunisia]].

===Operation Torch and El Alamein===
[[File:Sherman tanks of 9th Queen's Royal Lancers during the Battle of El Alamein, 5 November 1942. E18972.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of 9th Queen's Royal Lancers during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], 5 November 1942]]
8 November 1942 saw the first great amphibious assault of [[World War II]]. In [[Operation Torch]], an Anglo-American force landed on the shores of [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]]. However, even in Algeria, despite having a large British content, the allies maintained the illusion that this was an American operation in order to reduce possible resistance by the French.

After the attack by [[Force H]] on the French fleet at [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1940, anti-British feeling ran high among the French. This had been exacerbated by later British operations against Vichy-controlled territories at [[Dakar]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], and the invasion of [[Madagascar]]. It was feared that any British attack on French soil would lead to prolonged resistance. Ironically, the attack which saw the greatest resistance was that wholly American landing in Morocco. A full scale naval battle was fought between French and American ships, and ground fighting was also heavy.

The resistance did not last long. The French surrendered and then shortly afterward joined the Allied cause. One of the main reasons for the quick switch of sides was because the Germans had moved into unoccupied France, ending the Vichy regime, shortly after the North African garrisons had surrendered.

Once resistance in Algeria and Morocco was over, the campaign became a race. The Germans were pouring men and supplies into [[Tunisia]], and the Allies were trying to get sufficient troops into the country quickly enough to stop them before the need for a full-scale campaign to drive them out occurred.

Just before [[Operation Torch]], the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] was being fought in Egypt. The new commander of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Sir [[Bernard Montgomery]], had the opportunity to conclusively defeat the Panzerarmee Afrika under [[Erwin Rommel]], since Rommel was at the end of enormously stretched supply lines, the British were close to their supply bases, and [[Rommel]] was about to be attacked from the rear by Torch.

The Second Battle of [[El Alamein]] saw enormous use made of [[artillery]]. Rommel's forces had laid large numbers of [[Land mine|mines]] in the desert, and the terrain of the area prevented his position being outflanked, and British naval forces were not powerful enough to land a significant force directly behind Rommel to cut his supply lines directly at the same time as Operation Torch. Consequently, the German lines had to be attacked directly. However, that did not mean that Montgomery did not try to use feint and deception in the battle. "Dummy tanks" and other deceptions were used liberally to try to fool the Germans where the stroke would fall.

The main attack went in, but it was turned back by the extensive minefields. Montgomery then shifted the axis of advance to another point to throw the Germans off balance. What had formerly been a spoiling attack was developed into the new major thrust. Through a grinding battle of attrition, the Germans were thrown back.
[[File:Winston Churchill au théâtre de Carthage, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]] in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman]] amphitheatre of ancient Carthage to address 3,000 British and American troops, June 1943]]

After El Alamein, Rommel's forces were pursued through the western desert for the last time. [[Cyrenaica]] was retaken from Axis forces, and then [[Tripolitania]] was won for the first time. Rommel's forces, apart from small rearguard actions to hold up Montgomery's men, did not turn and fight again until they were within the [[Mareth Line]] defences of southern Tunisia.

===Battle for Tunisia===
{{main|Tunisia Campaign}}
As British forces swept west through Libya and Anglo-American forces closed in from Algeria, the Axis began to pour reinforcements into Tunisia. A new command under Colonel General [[Jurgen von Arnim]] was set up, von Arnim was a confirmed enemy of Rommel, and so German command relations did not get off to a good start.

Rommel turned to face Montgomery's forces who had caught up with the Panzerarmee Afrika at last at the [[Mareth Line]]. The Mareth Line was a series of old French border defences against Italian forces from Libya. Rommel took them over and improved them greatly. It took a major effort for British forces to break through. However, by this time Rommel had left Africa, never to return.

It was decided that First Army should make the main thrust to destroy Axis formations in Africa. II Corps was moved from the south to north of the front, and the [[French XIX Corps]] took up station on the right wing of the First Army. The Eighth Army was to make a subsidiary thrust along the coast to pin down Axis forces.

The final offensive began at the end of March 1943, and by May, Axis forces had surrendered. 250,000 men were taken prisoner, a number comparable to the [[battle of Stalingrad]].

==The Italian campaign==
{{main|Italian Campaign (World War II)}}
The [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] was the name of Allied operations in and around Italy, from [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars#Italy and the Second World War (1940-1945)|1943 to the end of the war]]. Joint Allied Forces Headquarters [[AFHQ]] was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre, and it planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the campaign on the Italian mainland until the surrender of German forces in Italy in May 1945.

===Invasion of Sicily===
{{main|Allied invasion of Sicily}}

On 10 July 1943, Sicily was invaded. The operation, named Operation Husky, was directed from Malta. British forces attacked on the eastern flank of the landing, with the British Eighth Army's XXX Corps coming ashore at [[Cape Passero]] and XIII Corps at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. The Eighth Army's job was to advance up the east coast of Sicily. Originally British forces were to have the main role in the attack on the island but, when their advance slowed, the [[Seventh United States Army|American Seventh Army]] on the west side of the island swept around the enemy flank instead. The local sicilians were also reported to have greatly supported the advancing Americans to defeat the fascists.

[[File:The British Army in Sicily 1943 NA5752.jpg|thumb|left|[[Universal Carrier|Universal carrier]]s of the 2nd Battalion, [[Wiltshire Regiment]] pass through Pedara, Sicily, 9 August 1943.]]

The Eighth Army eventually battered its way past the German defences and enveloped [[Mount Etna]]; by this time the Germans and Italians were retreating. By 17 August all the Axis forces had evacuated the island, and [[Messina]] was captured that day.

===Surrender of Italy===
{{main|Armistice with Italy|Allied invasion of Italy}}
[[File:The British Army in Italy 1943 NA6301.jpg|thumb|left|British Troops coming ashore from landing ships at Reggio, 3 September 1943.]]
After operations in Sicily, the Italian Government was teetering on the brink of collapse. Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] was ousted by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] and, on orders of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], Mussolini was taken into custody. Peace feelers were put out to the Allies. However, the invasion of Italy still proceeded.

On 3 September 1943, the first attacks were made directly across the Straits of Messina by Eighth Army in [[Operation Baytown]]. V and XIII Corps carried out that attack. Montgomery's forces leap-frogged up the toe of Italy over the next few days. A subsidiary landing, [[Operation Slapstick]], was also made on 9 September at the Italian naval base of [[Taranto]] by the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]].

Also on 3 September, King Victor Emmanuel and Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]] secretly signed an [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice with the Allies]]. On 8 September, the armistice was made public and a government was set up in southern Italy. What was known as the "Badoglio Government" joined the Allies against the Axis.

The main attack, [[Operation Avalanche]], was delivered on 9 September at [[Salerno]]. Salerno was chosen for the site of the attack because it was the furthest north that the single-engined fighters based in Sicily could realistically provide cover. Escort carriers also stood off shore to supplement the cover given by land-based aircraft. A subsidiary landing, [[Operation Slapstick]], was also made on the same day at the Italian naval base of [[Taranto]] by the British 1st Airborne Division, landed directly into the port from warships. News of the Italian surrender was broadcast as the troop convoys were converging on Salerno.

The Germans reacted extremely quickly to the Italian surrender. They disarmed the Italian troops near their forces and took up defensive positions near Salerno. Italian troops were disarmed throughout Italy and Italian-controlled areas in what was known as [[Operation Achse|Operation Axis]] (''[[Operation Achse]]'').

The [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landings at Salerno]] were made by the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]]. It consisted of the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] landing on the right flank and the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] landing on the left. Initial resistance was heavy, however heavy naval and air support combined with the approach of Eighth Army from the south eventually forced the Germans to withdraw. By 25 September a line from [[Naples]] to [[Bari]] was controlled by Allied forces.

Further relatively rapid advances continued over the next few weeks, but by the end of October, the front was stalled. The Germans had taken up extremely powerful defensive positions on the [[Winter Line]]. There the front would remain for the next six months.

About two months after his ouster, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Unternehmen Eiche|Operation Oak]] (''[[Unternehmen Eiche]]''). He set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] in northern Italy.

[[File:British 4.2 inch mortar fining Cassino 12-05-1944 IWM NA 14735.jpg|thumb|British 4.2 inch mortar of 307th Battery, 99th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, in action during the Battle of Monte Cassino, 12 May 1944.]]

The linchpin of the Winter Line position was the town and monastery of [[Monte Cassino]]. The extremely powerful position dominated a key route to [[Rome]] and thus it had to be captured. British forces (the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th]] and [[56th (London) Division|56th]] divisions) on the left flank of Fifth Army tried to cross the [[Garigliano|Garigliano River]] and were also driven back, as was a joint French-American attempt.

With no sign of a breakthrough it was decided to attempt to outflank the Winter Line with an amphibious landing behind it. [[Battle of Anzio|Operation Shingle]] involved [[Battle of Anzio|landings at Anzio]] on the West coast on 23 January 1944. The assaulting formations were controlled by the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]], but as with Salerno, there was a substantial British component to the assault force. The [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] and [[2nd Special Service Brigade|2nd Commando Brigade]] formed the left flank of the assault.

Again, like Salerno, there were serious problems with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General [[John P. Lucas]], did not exploit as aggressively as he might have done and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans, but the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.

After the initial attack and after the German counter-attack had been repulsed, the Anzio beachhead settled down to stalemate. The attempt at outflanking the Winter Line had failed. It was May before a breakout from the beachhead could be attempted.

===Breakthrough to Rome===

NA15297.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Men of 'D' Company, 1st Battalion, [[Green Howards]], part of [[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]] of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], occupy a captured German communications trench during the breakout at Anzio, Italy, 22 May 1944.]]

By May 1944, U.S. VI Corps had been reinforced to a strength of seven divisions. In the Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino (also known as [[Operation Diadem]]), a concerted attack was made at both Anzio and the Winter Line. The German defences finally cracked.

The front had been reorganised. V Corps was left on the Adriatic, but the rest of Eighth Army was moved over the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to concentrate more forces to take Rome. The front of Fifth Army was thus considerably reduced. X Corps also moved to Eighth Army as the complicated arrangement of British forces under American command was removed. Several battles for Cassino followed, contested by Indian, New Zealand and Polish forces. In the end, Cassino lost its pivotal position as operations elsewhere on the front managed to turn its flanks. These included a brilliant demonstration of mountain warfare by the [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943-1944)|French Expeditionary Corps]].

British forces were not well handled during Diadem. [[Oliver Leese]], the commander of Eighth Army, made an enormous mistake by sending the heavily mechanised XIII Corps up the [[Liri Valley]] towards Rome. An enormous traffic jam developed. There was also controversy over the handling of American forces. VI Corps had originally been supposed to interpose itself on the route to Rome and cut off the German forces retreating from the Winter Line. However, Clark decided instead to advance on Rome, and ordered only a comparatively token force into a blocking position and ordered the rest of the Corps to head for Rome. The Germans brushed aside the blocking force and thus a major part of their formations escaped encirclement. A total of 25 divisions (roughly a tenth of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]]) escaped, and this led to the war in Italy dragging on until 1945. Speculation surrounds this whole episode and many in the Allied command felt that Mark Clark had disobeyed direct orders for his own glory and contributed to the war's extension. If he had cut off those forces as had been planned and ordered, they could have been destroyed in the same way as was achieved in France, and the German resistance in Italy would have collapsed. The Allies could have advanced up the spine of Italy and invaded Austria and southern Germany. This was the plan of the British, one not supported by the Americans, and as such Mark Clark's actions may have been politically motivated, or driven by Washington. It is true that Mark Clark was not punished for his change of route, even though other commanders were for less.

Rome fell on 5 June, and the pursuit continued well beyond the city, into northern Italy.

===The Gothic Line and victory in Italy===
{{main|Gothic Line}}
[[File:A Churchill tank halts near infantry of the 1st London Irish Rifles near Tanara during the advance to the River Po, Italy, 23 April 1945. NA24460.jpg|thumb|A [[Churchill tank]] halts near infantrymen of the 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], part of [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th Brigade]] of [[56th (London) Division]], near Tanara, Italy, April 1945]]
By the end of August 1944, Allied forces had reached [[Pisa]] and [[Pesaro]] on each coast. As with the previous year, the advance then slowed greatly. The composition of the forces in Italy had changed again with the withdrawal of the French forces for the invasion of southern France, [[Operation Dragoon]]. The [[IV Corps (United States)|U.S. IV Corps]] had been activated to replace the French in Fifth Army. Eighth Army was composed of V, X and XIII Corps of the British forces, [[I Canadian Corps|Canadian I Corps]] and [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]]. However, during this period, XIII Corps was temporarily placed under the command of the U.S. Fifth Army.

Between August and December, the Eighth Army slowly progressed up the east coast. The Polish II Corps captured the important port-city of [[Ancona]], thus significantly shortening the allied supply line. The original aim had been to break through in the [[Po plain]] by the end of 1944, but that was nowhere near possible. December saw the line just south of [[Lake Comacchio]], with the Germans holding a salient to the west. Fifth Army was in the high passes of the Apennines.

After December, operations ground to a halt for the winter. The only major event that took place during this period was the removal of I Canadian Corps from the Italian front to reinforce [[Canadian 1st Army]] in France. The offensive was not renewed until April. The choice for the last offensive was whether the major blow should fall on the Fifth Army or the Eighth Army front. Eventually, it was settled that Eighth Army should make the major attack. A deception plan was hatched to convince the Germans that Fifth Army would launch the major attack, and a major logistical effort was required to move formations to their start lines.

On 2 April 1945, the attack was launched and the advance was again slow at first.

By 20 April, [[Bologna]] was in a salient held by the Germans, and Lake Comacchio was crossed by an amphibious attack. The Germans were close to breaking. In the next ten days, the German forces were either surrounded or pinned against the [[River Po]]. The Germans were reduced in large part to scattered bands and bereft of heavy equipment.

On 28 April, Mussolini and a group of fascist Italians were captured by [[Italian partisans]] while attempting to flee Italy. Mussolini and about fifteen other fascists were executed and their bodies taken to [[Milan]] for display.

On 29 April, Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] surrendered the Italian [[Army Group Liguria|LXXXXVII Army (''Liguria'')]], the army of Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]].

The progress in May was rapid. The American forces mopped up in the upper Po Valley and captured [[Genoa]], the Polish forces captured [[Bologna]], and the British forces cleared the lower Po and reached the Yugoslav and Austrian borders.

On 2 May, the German forces in Italy capitulated. This occurred shortly before the main German surrender on 8 May.

==The liberation of Europe==

===Operation Overlord===
{{main|Operation Overlord}}

[[File:D-day - British Forces during the Invasion of Normandy 6 June 1944 B5114.jpg|thumb|Troops of 3rd Infantry Division on Queen Red beach, Sword Beach, 6 June 1944.]]
The [[Normandy Landings|invasion of Normandy]], the largest amphibious assault in history, took place on 6 June 1944. All ground armies, US and British, were under the command of British General Montgomery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/a-whos-who-of-d-day|title=A Who's Who Of D-Day|website=Imperial War Museums}}</ref> The operation involved the landing of five assault divisions from the sea and three assault divisions by parachute and glider. Of those, one airborne and two seaborne divisions were British. The British airborne formation involved was [[British 6th Airborne Division|6th Airborne Division]], with the British seaborne divisions being the [[British 3rd Infantry Division|3rd Infantry Division]] landing at [[Sword Beach]] and [[British 50th Infantry Division|50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] and [[British 8th Armoured Brigade|8th Armoured Brigade]] on [[Gold Beach]]. [[No. 48 (Royal Marine) Commando|No.48 Commando]] landed with the [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] at [[Juno Beach|Juno]]; the remaining divisions were provided by the United States.<ref>See [http://www.canadaatwar.ca/content-14/wwii-canadians-on-d-day/ "Canadians on D-Day: June 6, 1944" ''Canada at War'', accessioned 19 April 2015]</ref>

The British formations were assigned to the eastern end of the beachhead. The 6th Airborne Division landed to secure the eastern flank of the assault forces. The first Allied units in action were the glider-borne troops that assaulted [[Pegasus Bridge]]. Beyond the main formations, various smaller units went ashore. Prominent among those were the [[British Commandos]].

The United Kingdom was the main base for the operation and provided the majority of the naval power. Nearly eighty percent of the bombarding and transporting warships were from the Royal Navy. Airpower for the operation was a more even divide. The United States contributed two air forces to the battle, the Eighth Air Force with strategic bombers, and the Ninth Air Force for tactical airpower. All the home commands of the RAF were involved in the operation. Coastal Command secured the English Channel against German naval vessels. Bomber Command had been engaged in reducing communications targets in France for several months to paralyse the movement of German reinforcements to the battle. It also directly supported the bombardment forces on the morning of the assault. Air Defence of the United Kingdom, the temporarily renamed Fighter Command, provided air superiority over the beachhead. The [[2nd Tactical Air Force]] provided direct support to the Empire formations.

The operation was a success. Both tactical{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and strategic surprise were achieved.

Most of the initial objectives for the day were not achieved, but a firm beachhead was established. It was gradually built up until offensive operations could begin in earnest. The first major success was the capture of [[Cherbourg]].
[[File:Britsoldiercaen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A soldier holding the arm of an elderly lady in a debris-strewn street, with ruined buildings in the background|A British soldier helps an old woman amongst the ruins of Caen after its liberation, 10 July 1944.]]
In the east, the first major British objective was [[Caen]], an extremely tough nut to crack. The battle for the city turned into a long drawn-out battle. It eventually fell in July.

====Controversies====
After the war Montgomery claimed that the battle for Normandy progressed largely as he had planned the operation at St. Paul's school in Fulham, London, supported by American generals, General Eisenhower, General Bradley and Australian war correspondent Chester Wilmott, amongst others. Eisenhower stated three years after the war in his memoirs, Crusade in Europe, that the plan ''"was never abandoned, even momentarily, throughout the campaign"''.<ref>American Experience in World War II: The United States in the European Theater edited by Walter L. Hixson p 149</ref> The basic plan was for the British to draw in, hold, and destroy German armor in the east, not acquiring territory, while the US forces in the lightly defended territory to the west built up their strength and brake out in [[Operation Cobra]].

Montgomery did not overly publicise some of the points of the plan for fear of lowering the morale of British troops, who would take on the brunt of the experienced German armored forces to allow American troops to break out.  Montgomery understood that high morale facilitated superior battlefield performance, especially in non-regular soldiers.<ref>Stephen Hart, "Montgomery, Morale, Casualty Conservation and 'Colossal Cracks': 21st Army Group's Operational Technique in North-West Europe, 1944–45," ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' Dec 1996, Vol. 19 Issue 4, foreword</ref> The mix of forces in the British and Canadian ranks indicated this with great emphasis on tanks and vehicles. Prime minister Churchill asked why there was so many vehicles in relation to infantry troops in the British armies, as vehicles required a larger logistical backup, which diverts men away from fighting duties. Montgomery told Churchill every vehicle is needed and that he would not allow him to interrogate his staff on the matter, otherwise he would resign. Churchill wept and left the room.<ref>Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1887-1976: A Selected Bibliography edited by Colin F. Baxter p 68-69</ref> Montgomery claimed that Eisenhower, although giving approval, did not fully understand the plan in detail as laid down in St. Paul's School.<ref>American Experience in World War II: The United States in the European Theater edited by Walter L. Hixson p 149 - 151</ref>  General Bradley fully understood and confirmed Montgomery's original plan and intentions, writing:
:"The British and Canadian armies were to decoy the enemy reserves and draw them to their front on the extreme eastern edge of the Allied beachhead. Thus, while Monty taunted the enemy at Caen, we [the Americans] were to make our break on the long roundabout road to Paris. When reckoned in terms of national pride, this British decoy mission became a sacrificial one, for while we tramped around the outside flank, the British were to sit in place and pin down the Germans. Yet strategically it fitted into a logical division of labors, for it was towards Caen that the enemy reserves would race once the alarm was sounded".<ref>Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1887-1976: A Selected Bibliography
edited by Colin F. Baxter p 68</ref>
Post war a number of Americans authors argued that Montgomery's generalship was flawed and that the battle had to be fought differently from planned because Montgomery promised more than he could deliver.
This was mainly based on that the British forces did not aggressively pursue territory.<ref>Stephen T. Powers, "The Battle of Normandy: The Lingering Controversy," ''Journal of Military History,'' July 1992, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp 455–471 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1985972 in JSTOR]</ref>  Author and military officer Stephen Hart analysed the 21st Army Group in 1992 and finds that Montgomery's emphasis on the reduction of casualties which would maintain morale and a higher fighting performance in non-regular soldiers, which most soldiers were, were the primary influences on his operational conduct. Hart concludes that Montgomery was the most competent British general in Europe for he understood Britain's war aims. His concern with his units' morale was legitimate, recognizing that the British had an infantry manpower problem as emphasis was on armoured vehicles to counter superior German armour. Both factors influenced his handling of the 21st Army Group. Hart destroys the [[myth]] that Montgomery was unnecessarily cautious.<ref>Stephen Hart, "Montgomery, Morale, Casualty Conservation and 'Colossal Cracks': 21st Army Group's Operational Technique in North-West Europe, 1944–45," ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' Dec 1996, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 132–153</ref>

===Breakout from Normandy===
[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B9528.jpg|thumb|British infantry aboard Sherman tanks wait for the order to advance, near [[Argentan]], 21 August 1944.]]
The British and Canadian forces largely destroyed German armour in the east of Normandy allowing the American forces to break out in late July 1944 in [[Operation Cobra]]. Allied forces began an envelopment of the German forces remaining in Normandy. Hitler ordered a counter-attack on the seemingly vulnerable strip of territory that the US forces controlled on the Normandy coast, linking the First and Third Armies.

As American forces swept round to the south, British, Canadian and Polish forces pinned and then pushed the Germans from the north. A German pocket formed to the south of the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] when the two allied forces met. Up to 150,000 German soldiers were trapped and around 60,000 casualties were inflicted.

As arranged before the Normandy invasion, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] took over as Ground Forces Command from Montgomery on 1 September, while Montgomery continued to command the British 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units.<ref name="weigley">{{cite book|author=[[Russell Weigley|Weigley, Russell F.]]|title=Eisenhower's Lieutenants|publisher=Bloomington, IN: [[Indiana University Press]]|year=1981|isbn=0-253-13333-5|page=253}}</ref>

Following the Normandy battle there was little German resistance left in the west. British forces swept north entering Belgium on 2 September 1944,<ref>European journal of American Studies, 'A Modern Liberation'. Belgium and the start of the American Century 1944-1946 by Peter Schrijvers</ref> while American forces swept east. [[Paris]] fell at the end of August 1944 to brigadier general Charles de Gaulle's Free French troops and American forces. By the end of September much of France had been liberated.

Logistical difficulties then caught up with the Allies as all supplies had to be transported from Normandy. Because of thinly-stretched supply lines, the American fast broad-front advance could not be sustained, grinding to a halt in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and [[Belgium]]. Heated discussions then took place over the next phase of Allied strategy.

===Riviera invasion===
[[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern France in August 1944 was carried out almost entirely by American and Free French troops, though British naval forces took part in bombardment duties and air protection of the beachhead. The only British land forces to take part were the [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Independent Parachute Brigade]]. They landed without much opposition, and rapidly took their objectives. The quick success of the operation allowed them to be withdrawn from the line and redeployed to Greece where they were urgently needed to help quell the civil war.

===Operation Market Garden===
{{main|Operation Market Garden}}
[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU950.jpg|thumb|The crew of a Cromwell tank is welcomed by Dutch civilians in [[Eindhoven]], 19 September 1944.]]
Montgomery and Eisenhower had long been debating the merits of a broad front attack strategy versus concentrating power in one area and punching through German lines. Eisenhower favoured the former, and Montgomery the latter. However, in late 1944, logistic problems meant that the former was temporarily out of the question. Montgomery conceived [[Operation Market Garden]] to implement a narrow front strategy. The idea was to land airborne forces in the Netherlands to take vital bridges over the country's various rivers. Armoured formation would then relieve the airborne forces and advance quickly into Germany.<ref>Stephen Badsey, ''Arnhem 1944: Operation Market Garden'' (1993)</ref>

American paratroops were dropped at intermediate points north of Allied lines, with the [[British 1st Airborne Division]] and [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]] at the tip of the salient at [[Arnhem]]. All the bridges were captured on the 1st day except the Nijmegen bridge, which caused a near two day delay, the plan then began to run into serious trouble. The relief forces of [[Brian Horrocks|Lieutenant General Horrock's]] [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] had to advance up a single good road. Being unable to progress past Nijmegen, congestion along the road emerged. The Germans reacted quickly to attack the road from both sides. Consequently, XXX Corps had to seize the bridge which the US 82nd paratroopers failed to do, which took a great deal longer than expected to progress through to Arnhem. By the time XXX Corps reached Arnhem the British 1st Airborne had capitulated on the bridge.<ref>http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/nijmegen-the-bridges-to-nowhere/</ref>

The 1st Airborne Division [[Battle of Arnhem|held the Arnhem bridge for four days]], and had a large force over the river for a total of nine days, before finally withdrawing in a daring night escape back over the Rhine. Of the more than 10,000 men who flew into the Arnhem operation, only about 2,000 returned. 1st Airborne Division was essentially finished as a fighting formation for the duration of the war without having achieved the original objective.

In the aftermath of the attack, the salient's flanks were expanded to complete the closing up to the Rhine in that section of the front.

===Walcheren===
Following Market Garden, the great port of [[Antwerp]] had been captured. However, it lay at the end of a long river estuary, and so it could not be used until its approaches were clear. The southern bank of the [[Scheldt]] was cleared by Canadian and Polish forces relatively quickly, but the thorny problem of the island of [[Walcheren]] remained.

Walcheren guarded the northern approaches to Antwerp and thus had to be stormed. The dikes and dunes were bombed at three locations, [[Westkapelle (Netherlands)|Westkapelle]], [[Veere]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], in order to inundate the island. In the last great amphibious operation of the war in Europe, [[British Commandos]] and Canadian troops captured the island in the late autumn of 1944, clearing the way for Antwerp to be opened and for the easement of the critical logistical problems the Allies were suffering.

===Battle of the Bulge===
{{main|Battle of the Bulge}}
[[File:A 6th Airborne Division sniper on patrol in the Ardennes, wearing a snow camouflage suit, 14 January 1945. B13676.jpg|thumb|A 6th Airborne Division sniper on patrol in the Ardennes, 14 January 1945.]]
After December 1944, the strategy was to complete the conquest of the Rhineland and prepare to break into Germany proper en masse. However, what happened next completely caught the Allied staffs by surprise.<ref>Nigel Hamilton, ''Monty: The Field-Marshal 1944–1976'' (1986)</ref>

The Germans launched their last great offensive in December, resulting in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. In an attempt to repeat their 1940 success, German forces were launched through the Ardennes. Again they encountered weak forces holding the front, as the American formations there were either new to the war or exhausted units on a quiet sector of the front rehabilitating. There were however also some important differences to 1940 which resulted in the German offensive ultimately failing. They were facing enormously strong Allied airpower unlike in 1940 when they had ruled the skies. The opening of the offensive was timed for a spell of bad weather, aimed at removing the threat of the Allied airpower, but the weather cleared again relatively soon.

Most of the forces that took part in the Battle of the Bulge were American. Some great feats of staff work resulted in the [[US Third Army|Third Army]] and [[US Ninth Army|Ninth Army]], essentially altering their facing by ninety degrees to contain the salient. However, the salient created by the German attack meant that First and Ninth Armies were cut off from 12th Army Group Headquarters, so they were shifted to the command of 21st Army Group for the duration of the battle meaning the British army group had an important controlling role. The British XXX Corps also took part in the battle in a backstop role to contain any further German advances.

By the end of January, the salient had effectively been reduced back to its former size, and the temporarily aborted mission of liberating the Rhineland recommenced. First Army returned to 12th Army Group, but Ninth Army remained under the control of 21st Army Group for the time being.

===Crossing the Rhine and final surrender===
{{main|Operation Plunder}}
[[File:The Liberation of Bergen-belsen Concentration Camp, April 1945 BU4195.jpg|thumb|The liberation of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], April 1945 ]]
The penultimate preliminary operation to close up to the [[Rhine]] in the British section was the clearing of the [[Roer Triangle]] (codename [[Operation Blackcock]]). The XIII Corps removed German forces from the west bank of the [[Roer]] during the second half of January 1945.

Following the reaching of the Roer, Second Army shifted to the mission of pinning German forces opposing it. Ninth Army in [[Operation Grenade]] and First Army in [[Operation Veritable]] began a great pincer movement to destroy the remaining German forces west of the Rhine. The only British forces to take part in the main part of this offensive was XXX Corps, which was part of First Army.

By 5 March 1945, the Canadian, British, and American forces had closed up to the Rhine in all but a small salient on their sectors of the front. That salient was reduced by five days later.

On 23 March, the operations to cross the Rhine in the north began. The British Second and [[U.S. Ninth Army|U.S. Ninth]] Armies took the lead. Ninth Army, on the south flank, took part in the great encirclement of German forces in the [[Ruhr]]. The [[U.S. First Army]] on the right crossed the Rhine in early April and then swung left to liberate the north of the Netherlands. Second Army drove straight across the North German plain, reaching the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] on 1 April and the [[Weser]] on 4 April. After the closing of the Ruhr pocket on that day, Ninth Army reverted to the command of 12th Army Group.
On 15 April the British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen.

By 18 April, First Army had reached the coast in much of the [[Netherlands]], isolating the German forces there. Second Army reached the [[Elbe]] the next day. The only moves in the Netherlands that the Canadian and Polish forces made for the remainder of the war were reducing a small amount of the coast of the [[IJsselmeer]] that had not been captured and liberating a small amount of territory around [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Most of German [[Frisia]] also fell to Canadian and Polish forces. British units reached the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] on 2 May, and then halted as they had reached the agreed line of meeting Soviet forces. The war came to an end on 7 May, and British forces reoriented to the task of occupying Germany itself.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''World at arms: a global history of World War II''</ref>

==The Far East==
{{main|South-East Asian theatre of World War II}}

The South-East Asian Theatre of World War II included the campaigns in Hong Kong, [[British Raj|India]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indochina]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]]. On 8 December 1941, the conflict in this theatre began when the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaya from bases located in China and [[French Indochina]].<ref>David White, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yQPvXYoo8X8C&pg=PA331#v=onepage&q&f=false The Everything World War II Book: People, Places, Battles, and All the Key Events], Adams Media, 2010, p. 331</ref> Action in this theatre officially ended on 9 September 1945 with the surrender of Japan.

===Disaster in Malaya and Singapore===
[[File:Bosbritsurrendergroup.jpg|thumb|Surrendering troops of [[the Suffolk Regiment]] held at gunpoint by Japanese infantry in Singapore]]
{{main|Japanese Invasion of Thailand|Battle of Malaya|Battle of Singapore|Battle of Hong Kong}}
The outbreak of war in the Far East found the United Kingdom critically overstretched. British forces in the area were weak in almost all arms. On 8 December 1941, the Japanese launched invasions of Thailand, Malaya and Hong Kong.

On 10 December 1941, the first major setback to British power in the region was the sinking of [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] by Japanese land-based planes. The sinking of these ships was triply significant. It represented the loss of the last Allied capital ships in the Pacific left after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] disaster. The ''Prince of Wales'' and the ''Repulse'' were the only Allied modern or 'fast' battleships to be sunk in the entire war. It was the first time that a battleship had been sunk by enemy aircraft while underway at sea.<ref>Martin Middlebrook and Patrick Mahoney, ''Battleship: the sinking of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse'' (1979)</ref>

Reverses in the air and on the ground soon followed. Japanese forces had naval superiority, and they used it to make outflanking amphibious landings as they advanced down the Malayan peninsula towards [[Singapore]]. Japanese assaults from the ground and air soon made the forward landing grounds that much of the RAF's only real hope of defending Singapore from the air rested upon untenable. The RAF took a toll of Japanese forces, but there were never enough aircraft to do anything more than delay the Japanese offensive. [[Indian Army|Indian]], British, and [[Australian Army|Australian]] army forces in Malaya were larger in numbers than the other services. But they were equally ill-prepared and ill-led. They were committed in numbers both too small and too poorly positioned to counter the Japanese tactic of outflanking strongpoints through the jungle. Over a period of several weeks, the Allied ground forces steadily gave ground.

In early 1942, Singapore was critically unprepared for the assault that came. It had been neglected during the famine years for defence of the 1930s. It had then suffered during the war as British efforts were focused on defeating Germany and Italy. The colony was run by a Governor who did not want to "upset" the civilian population. Military neglect was exacerbated when he refused to allow defensive preparations before the Japanese arrived.<ref>Louis Allen, ''Singapore 1941–1942'' (1993)</ref>

Following Japanese landings on Singapore, intense fighting occurred over several days. But the poorly led and increasingly disorganised Allied forces were steadily driven into a small pocket on the island.

On 15 February 1942, General [[Arthur Percival]] surrendered the 80,000 strong garrison of Singapore. This was the largest surrender of personnel under British leadership in history. Many of the troops saw little or no action. The civilian population then suffered a brutal Japanese occupation. Some aircraft escaped to [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]], but those islands also fell to the Japanese within a short time. British forces were forced back to [[British Raj|India]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]].

===Burma Campaign===
{{main|Burma Campaign}}

The Burma Campaign pitted forces from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], [[China]], and [[United States]] forces against the forces of the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Indian National Army]].

In Burma, Commonwealth ground forces came primarily from the United Kingdom, British India (which included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), East Africa, West Africa and Nepal (Gurkhas).<ref>Raymond Callahan, ''Burma, 1942–1945'' (1979)</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Christopher Bayly & Timothy Harper, ''Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945''; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Harvard University Press, 2005, p294.</ref> The British Commonwealth air and naval units and personnel deployed were primarily from the UK, India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.

====Forced out of Burma====
In Burma, the Japanese attacked in January, 1942 – shortly after the outbreak of war. However, they did not begin to make real progress until the fall of Malaya (31 January 1942) and of Singapore (February, 1942). After that, Tokyo could transfer large numbers of aircraft to the Burma front to overwhelm the Allied forces.

The first Japanese attacks were aimed at taking [[Rangoon]], the major port in Burma, which offered the Allies many advantages of supply. It had at first been defended relatively successfully, with the weak RAF forces reinforced by a squadron of the famous American Volunteer Group, better known as the [[Flying Tigers]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger1.htm |title= History: The Flying Tigers – American Volunteer Group – Chinese Air Force |year=1998 |work=AVG}}</ref> However, as the Japanese attack developed, the amount of warning the Rangoon airfields could get of attack decreased, and thus they became increasingly untenable.

By the start of March, Japanese forces had cut the British forces in two. Rangoon was evacuated and the port demolished. Its garrison then broke through the Japanese lines thanks to an error on the part of the Japanese commander. The British commander in Burma, Lieutenant General Sir [[Thomas Hutton]] was removed from command shortly before Rangoon fell. He was replaced by Sir [[Harold Alexander]].

With the fall of Rangoon, a British evacuation of Burma became inevitable. Supplies could not be moved to maintain fighting forces in Burma on a large scale, since the ground communications were dreadful, sea communications risky in the extreme (along with the fact that there was only one other port of any size in Burma besides Rangoon) and air communications out of the question due to lack of transport aircraft.

Besides the Japanese superiority in training and experience, command problems beset the Burma campaign. The [[1st Burma Division]] and [[17th Infantry Division (India)|Indian 17th Infantry Division]] at first had to be controlled directly by the [[Burma Army (1937-1942)|Burma Army]] headquarters under Hutton. Burma was also swapped from command to command during the early months of the war. It had been the responsibility of [[India Command|GHQ India]] since 1937, but in the early weeks of the war, it was transferred from India to the ill-fated ABDA Command ([[ABDACOM]]). ABDA was based in Java, and it was simply impossible for Wavell, the Supreme Commander of ABDA, to keep in touch with the situation in Burma without neglecting his other responsibilities. Shortly before ABDA was dissolved, responsibility for Burma was transferred back to India. Interactions with the Chinese proved problematic. [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the leader of Nationalist China, was a poor strategist, and the Chinese Army suffered from severe command problems, with orders having to come directly from Chiang himself if they were to be obeyed. The ability of many Chinese commanders was called into question. Finally, the Chinese Army was lacking in the ancillary services which allow a force to fight a modern war.

The problems with the Chinese were never satisfactorily resolved. However, after the dissolution of ABDA, India retained control of operations in Burma until the formation of [[South East Asia Command]] in late 1943. The problems of a lack of corps headquarters were also solved. A skeleton force known as [[Burcorps]] was formed under Lieutenant General Sir [[William Slim]], later to gain fame as the commander of the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth Army]].

Burcorps retreated almost constantly, and suffered several disastrous losses, but it eventually managed to reach India in May 1942, just before the monsoon broke. Had it still been in Burma after the monsoon broke, it would have been cut off, and likely destroyed by the Japanese. The divisions making up Burcorps were withdrawn from the line for long refit periods.

Operations in Burma over the remainder of 1942 and in 1943 were a study of military frustration. The United Kingdom could only just maintain three active campaigns, and immediate offensives in both the Middle East and Far East proved impossible due to lack of resources. The Middle East won out, being closer to home and a campaign against the far more dangerous Germans.

During the 1942–1943 dry season, two operations were mounted. The first was a small scale offensive into the [[Arakan State|Arakan]] region of Burma. The Arakan is a coastal strip along the [[Bay of Bengal]], crossed by numerous rivers. The First Arakan offensive largely failed due to difficulties of logistics, communications and command. The Japanese troops were also still assigned almost superhuman powers by their opponents. The second attack was much more controversial; that of the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]], better known as the [[Chindits]].

Under the command of Major General [[Orde Wingate]], the Chindits in 1944 penetrated deep behind enemy lines in an attempt to gain intelligence, break communications and cause confusion. The operation had originally been conceived as part of a much larger offensive, which had to be aborted due to lack of supplies and shipping. Almost all of the original reasons for mounting the Chindit operation were then invalid. Nevertheless, it was mounted anyway.<ref>Shelford Bidwell, ''The Chindit war: Stilwell, Wingate, and the campaign in Burma, 1944'' (1980)</ref>

Some 3,000 men entered Burma in many columns. They caused damage to Japanese communications, and they gathered intelligence. However, they suffered dreadful casualties, with only two thirds of the men who set out on the expedition returning. Those that returned were wracked with disease and quite often in dreadful physical condition. The most important contributions of the Chindits to the war were unexpected. They had had to be supplied by air. At first it had been thought impossible to drop supplies over the jungle. Emergency situations that arose during the operation necessitated supply drops in the jungle, proving it was possible. It is also alleged by some that the Japanese in Burma decided to take the offensive, rather than adopt a purely defensive stance, as a direct result of the Chindit operation. Whatever the reason for this later change to the offensive, it was to prove fatal for the Japanese in Burma.

====Kohima and Imphal====
[[File:The British Army in Burma 1944 SE134.jpg|thumb|180px|British troops marching through the jungle, 1944]]
As the 1943–44 dry period dawned, both sides were preparing to take the offensive. The [[British Fourteenth Army]] struck first, but only marginally before the Japanese.

In Arakan, a British advance began on the XV Corps front. However, a Japanese counter-attack halted the advance and threatened to destroy the forces making it. Unlike during previous operations, the British forces stood firm, and were supplied from the air. The resulting [[Battle of Ngakyedauk Pass]] saw a heavy defeat handed to the Japanese. With the possibility of aerial supply, their infiltration tactics, relying on units carrying their own supplies and hoping to capture enemy victuals were fatally compromised.<ref>T. R. Moreman, ''The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941–45: fighting methods, doctrine and training for jungle warfare'' (Frank Cass, 2005)</ref>

On the central front, IV Corps advanced into Burma, before indications that a major Japanese offensive was building caused it to retreat on Kohima and Imphal. Forward elements of the corps were nearly cut off by Japanese forces, but eventually made it back to India. As they waited for the storm to break, the British forces were not to know that the successful defence of the two cities would be the turning point of the entire campaign in south East Asia. HQ XXXIII Corps was rushed forward to help control matters at the front and the two corps settled down for a long siege.

The Japanese threw themselves repeatedly against the defences of the two strong points, in the battles of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]], but could not break through. At times the supply situation was perilous, but never totally critical. It came down to a battle of attrition, and the British forces could simply afford to fight that kind of battle for longer. In the end, the Japanese ran out of supplies, and suffered large casualties. They broke and fled back into Burma, pursued by elements of Fourteenth Army.

====Burma retaken====
[[File:SE 003071 Shermans driving on Meiktila.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks and trucks advancing on Meiktila, March 1945.]]
The recapture of Burma took place during late 1944 and the first half of 1945. Command of the British formations on the front was rearranged in November 1944. 11th Army Group was replaced with [[Allied Land Forces South East Asia]] and XV Corps was placed directly under ALFSEA.

Some of the first operations to recapture Burma took place in Arakan. To gain bases for the aircraft necessary to supply Fourteenth Army in its attack through the heart of the country, two offshore islands, [[Akyab]] and [[Ramree]], had to be captured. Akyab was virtually undefended when British forces came ashore, so it effectively provided a rehearsal of amphibious assault doctrine for the forces in theatre. However, Ramree was defended by several thousand Japanese. The clearing of the island took several days, and associated forces on the mainland longer to clear out. Following these actions, XV Corps was greatly reduced in numbers to free up transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army.

Fourteenth Army made the main thrust to destroy Japanese forces in Burma. The Army had IV and XXXIII Corps under its command. The plan envisaged that XXXIII Corps would reduce [[Mandalay]]  and act as a diversion for the main striking force of IV Corps, which would take [[Meiktila]] and thus cut the Japanese communications. The plan succeeded extremely well, and Japanese forces in Upper Burma were effectively reduced to scattered and unorganised pockets. Slim's men then advanced south towards the Burmese capital.

Following the taking of Rangoon in May 1945 some Japanese forces remained in Burma, but it was effectively a large mopping up operation.
[[File:Japanese surrender Penang.jpg|left|thumb|A Japanese officer signs the surrender of [[Penang]] aboard [[HMS Nelson (28)|HMS ''Nelson'']] on 2 September 1945.]]

==== Malaya ====
The next major campaign was planned to be the liberation of Malaya. This was to involve an amphibious assault on the western side of Malaya codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. The dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945 forestalled Zipper, though some of its landings took place after the Japanese capitulation of 15 August 1945 as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya. Under [[Operation Jurist]], [[Penang]] was retaken on 2 September 1945, while the Japanese garrison in [[Singapore]] formally surrendered on 12 September under [[Operation Tiderace]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/25/a4109825.shtml|title=BBC – WW2 People's War – Operation Jurist and the end of the War|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> The rest of Malaya was liberated over the following weeks.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia|last=Bayly; Christopher Alan|first=Harper, Timothy Norman|publisher=Harvard University|year=2007|isbn=9780674021532|location=United States|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenwarsfre00bayl}}</ref>

{{main|Operation Iceberg|Operation Downfall}}

In their final actions of the war, substantial British naval forces took part in the [[Battle of Okinawa]] (also known as [[Operation Iceberg]]) and the final naval strikes on Japan. The [[British Pacific Fleet]] operated as a separate unit from the American task forces in the Okinawa operation. Its job was to strike airfields on the chain of islands between [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and Okinawa, to prevent the Japanese reinforcing the defences of Okinawa from that direction. British forces made a significant contribution to the success of the invasion.

During the final strikes against Japan, British forces operated as an integral part of the American task force.

Only a small British naval force was present for Japan's surrender. Most British forces had been withdrawing to base to prepare for [[Operation Downfall|Operation Coronet]], the second part of the massive invasion of Japan.

===Battle of Britain: 1940===
{{main|Battle of Britain}}
[[File:Spitfires camera gun film shows tracer ammunition.jpg|thumb|left|Shots from a Supermarine Spitfire Mark I hitting a Luftwaffe [[Heinkel He 111]] (left) on its starboard quarter.]]

The "Battle of Britain" in the Autumn of 1940 involved German plans for an invasion called ''[[Operation Sea Lion]]''. First the Luftwaffe began operations to destroy the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). At first the Germans focused on RAF airfields and radar stations. However, when the RAF bomber forces (quite separate from the fighter forces) attacked Berlin, Hitler swore revenge and diverted the Luftwaffe to attacks on London. Using the Luftwaffe's limited resources to attack civilians instead of airfields and radar proved a major mistake. The success the Luftwaffe was having in rapidly wearing down the RAF was squandered, as the civilians being hit were far less critical than the airfields and radar stations that were now ignored. London was not a factory city and British aircraft production was not impeded; indeed it went up. The last German daylight raid came on 30 September; the Luftwaffe realized it was taking unacceptable losses and broke off the attack; occasional blitz raids hit London and other cities from time. In all some 43,000 civilians were killed. The Luftwaffe lost 1733 planes, the British, 915. The British victory resulted from more concentration, better radar, and better ground control.<ref>Stephen Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy: The Definitive History of the Battle of Britain'' (2010)</ref>

===Strategic bombing theory===
The British had their own very well-developed theory of strategic bombing, and built the long-range bombers to implement it.<ref>Tami Davis Biddle, "British and American Approaches to Strategic Bombing: Their Origins and Implementation in the World War II Combined Bomber Offensive," ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' March 1995, Vol. 18 Issue 1, pp 91–144</ref> Before 1944, however, the main German industrial targets were out of range, so the RAF bombers concentrated on military and transportation targets in France and Belgium.<ref>Richard J. Overy, ''The Air War, 1939–1945'' (1981)</ref><ref>Tami Davis Biddle, "Bombing By The Square Yard: Sir Arthur Harris At War, 1942–1945," ''International History Review,'' vol 9#1 1999, pp 626–664</ref>  The Allies won air supremacy in Europe in 1944.<ref>Charles F. Brower, ''World War II in Europe: the final year'' (1988) p, 126</ref> That meant that Allied supplies and reinforcements would get through to the battlefront, but not the enemy's. It meant the Allies could concentrate their strike forces wherever they pleased, and overwhelm the enemy with a preponderance of firepower. This was the basic Allied strategy, and it worked. Air superiority depended on having the fastest, most maneuverable fighters, in sufficient quantity, based on well-supplied airfields, within range. The RAF demonstrated the importance of speed and maneuverability in the [[Battle of Britain]] (1940), when its fast [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters easily riddled the clumsy Stukas as they were pulling out of dives. The race to build the fastest fighter became one of the central themes of World War II.

===Expansion of the RAF===

The RAF underwent rapid expansion following the outbreak of war against Germany in 1939. This was aided by the Ottawa Agreement (also known as the Riverdale Agreement, after its chair, [[Arthur Balfour, 1st Baron Riverdale|Lord Riverdale]]) that same year, between the governments of the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As a result, under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] the training and operational postings of half of all aircrews from the RAF, [[RCAF]], [[RAAF]] and [[RNZAF]] were integrated: a total of 167,000 personnel were trained under the plan, mostly in Canada. There were parallel arrangements between the UK and South Africa. Under [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV]] of the agreement, 67 "Article XV squadrons" were formed in the name of other Commonwealth air forces, within RAF operational commands. In addition, many RAF squadrons included individual Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African aircrews.

Another 43 squadrons were formed during the war out of aircrews from [[occupied Europe]]an countries, comprising designated [[Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain|Polish]], [[Free French Air Force|French]], [[Free Norwegian forces#Air Force|Norwegian]], [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|Czechoslovakian]], [[Free Dutch Forces|Dutch]], [[Hellenic Air Force#Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930–1950)|Greek]], [[Free Belgian forces#Belgians in the Royal Air Force|Belgian]] and [[Yugoslav government-in-exile#Armed forces|Yugoslavian]] units. Two "[[Eagle Squadrons]]" were formed from American volunteers when the US was neutral (1939–1941), as well as [[No. 164 Squadron RAF|one made up of Argentinean nationals]].

===Combined bomber offensive===
{{main|RAF Bomber Command}}
The combined bomber offensive was born out of the need to strike back at Germany during the years when the United Kingdom had no forces on the continent of Europe. Initially the bomber forces available for attacks were small, and the rules of engagement were so restricted that any attacks that were made were mostly ineffective. However, once France had fallen in the summer of 1940 that began to change.<ref>Malcolm Smith, "The Allied Air Offensive," ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 13 (Mar 1990) 67–83</ref><ref>Charles Messenger, ''Bomber" Harris and the Strategic Bombing Offensive, 1939–1945''
(1984),</ref><ref>Richard G. Davis, ''Bombing the European Axis Powers: A Historical Digest of the Combined Bomber Offensive, 1939–1945'' (2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.maxwell.af.mil/au/aul/aupress/catalog/books/Davis_B99.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614204932/http://www.maxwell.af.mil/au/aul/aupress/catalog/books/Davis_B99.htm |archivedate=14 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>Max Hastings,  ''Bomber Command'' (1979)</ref>

During and after the Battle of Britain, bomber forces pounded the invasion fleets assembling in channel ports. However, they also flew a raid against Berlin after German bombs had fallen on London. The attack on Berlin by Bomber Command so enraged Hitler that he ordered the deliberate and systematic targeting of British cities in revenge. Throughout 1941, the size of the raids launched by Bomber Command slowly grew. However, due to the German defences raids could only generally be flown at night, and the navigational technology of the time simply did not allow even a large city to be accurately located.

The entry of America into the war in December 1941 did not initially change much. However, what did alter matters was the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Bomber Command in early 1942. Harris was a zealous advocate of the area bombing of German cities. He put a new fire and drive into the operations of Bomber Command. During the summer of 1942, the first 1,000 bomber raids were launched on German cities. However, at that time, such large numbers of aircraft could only be put over the target by stripping training units of their aircraft temporarily.

Other important advances occurred in the technical field. The first navigation aid, [[GEE (navigation)|GEE]], was introduced to help pilots to find their targets. [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|Window]], small metal strips dropped from aircraft, was introduced to help confuse the German radars. Planes also got their own radar, the [[H2S radar]] system. It provided a radar map of the ground beneath the aircraft, allowing navigation with more accuracy to cities like Berlin which were at that time beyond the effective range of systems like Gee. However, probably the most important innovation to improve targeting accuracy was tactical, not technical. It was the introduction of the pathfinder system. Pathfinders were groups of specially trained aircrews who flew ahead of the main raid and marked the target. Their use greatly improved the accuracy and destructiveness of raids.

By early 1943, American forces were beginning to build up in large numbers in the UK. Bomber Command was joined in its bombing efforts by the [[Eighth Air Force]]. Where Bomber Command operated by night, the Eighth flew by day. Raids were often coordinated so that the same target was hit twice within 24 hours. Hamburg was the victim of one of the most destructive air raids in history during 1943. The city was easy to find using radar, being located on the distinctively shaped Elbe estuary. It was devastated in a large raid that ignited a [[firestorm]] and killed some 50,000 people.

The destruction of Hamburg was not to be repeated during the rest of 1943 and 1944. During that winter, Berlin was attacked a large number of times, with heavy losses being sustained by Bomber Command. A further force also joined the fray, with the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] and [[No. 205 Group RAF]] beginning to fly from Italy. During early 1944, the emphasis began to change. As the invasion of France drew closer, the independent role of the bomber forces was considerably reduced, and eventually were placed under the direction of General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Harris and his American counterparts fought hard against being placed under Eisenhower, but they eventually lost.

Bomber Command heavily bombed targets in France and helped to paralyse the transport system of the country in time for the launching of Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944. Following Overlord, further direct support was provided to the troop, but Harris eventually succeeded in detaching his command from Eisenhower's control. The striking of German cities resumed.

By the winter of 1944, the power of the British and American bomber forces had grown enormously. It was now routine for 1,000 bomber raids to be mounted by both American and British forces flying from the UK. American forces flying from Italy could also put several hundred aircraft above a target. Accuracy had improved, but it was still nowhere near good enough for 'precision bombing' in the modern sense of the term. Precision was not a single building, it was at best a district of a city. The RAF and American AAF dropped two million tons of high explosives bombs on 60 German cities, killing more than half a million citizens (many of them prisoners forced to work in German munitions factories), and leaving 80,000 airmen dead.<ref>Randall Hansen, ''Fire and Fury: The Allied Bombing of Germany, 1942–1945'' (2009)</ref>

As the amount of territory controlled by German forces decreased, the task of Bomber Command became somewhat easier, as more friendly territory was overflown during missions. The German night fighter defences were also reducing in strength due to the crippling of Germany's fuel supplies by American bombing of [[synthetic oil]] plants. There remained one last great controversy during the war which would blacken the name of Bomber Command and surpass the firestorm of Hamburg in both destruction and casualties.

In February 1945, as Soviet forces closed in on the German city of [[Dresden]], which had been largely spared of heavy bombing raids due to its historic status, they asked for attacks to be made on the extensive transport links around the population centre. Bomber Command and American forces obliged, subjecting the city to a [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|series of extremely heavy raids]]. About 25,000 were killed in those raids, and questions were asked whether they were necessary so late in the war, or whether it was an effort to foreclose the "[[stab in the back]]" rumours of the sort the Nazis had exploited in the 1920s.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''The Storm of War: A New History of the Second World War'' (2011) p. lxviii</ref>

Bomber Command was destined to play no further large part in the war. A large number of RAF bombers were being prepared for deployment to [[Okinawa]] as Japan surrendered. Therefore, it was only at the hands of American strategic bombers and British and American carrier aircraft that Japan [[Air raids on Japan|received attacks]]. There was to be no far eastern equivalent of the combined bomber offensive of Europe.
