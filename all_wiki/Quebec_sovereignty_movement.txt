The '''Quebec sovereignty movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement souverainiste du Québec}}) is a [[political movement]] as well as an [[ideology]] of values, concepts and ideas that advocates independence for the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]].

Several diverse political groups coalesced in the late 1960s in the formation of the [[Parti québécois]], a provincial political party. Since 1968 the party has appealed for constitutional negotiations on the matter of provincial sovereignty, in addition to holding two provincial referendums on the matter. The first, [[1980 Quebec referendum|which occurred in 1980]], asked whether [[Quebec]]kers wished to open constitutional negotiations with the federal government (and other provinces) for the intended purpose of establishing a "sovereignty-association" pact between the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. Approximately 60% of Quebec's voting public rejected the idea put forth by Parti québécois leader [[René Lévesque]]. The matter was dropped by the party for most of the 1980s, especially after the [[patriation]] of the [[Canadian constitution]] without the consent of the Parti québécois government, and the creation of the federal [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which enshrined the protection of the French language and French-Canadian culture in Canada. In 1995, after two failed attempts by the [[Meech Lake Accord|Mulroney government]] to secure Quebec's ratification of amendments to the constitution, the Parti québécois held a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]], though on this occasion the question was whether one wished for the independence of the province of [[Quebec]] from the rest of [[Canada]]. The response was again in the negative, though this time by a far closer margin, with 50.58% against the proposal.

Though the Parti Québécois has long spearheaded the sovereignty movement, it is not alone. Other minority provincial political parties, such as [[Option nationale]] and [[Québec solidaire]], also supported sovereignty, but were not always supportive of the Parti québécois (the two parties merged in 2017). On the federal level, another party, the [[Bloc québécois]], also support the independence of the province. The [[Quebec Liberal Party]], Quebec's other primary political party until the 2018 provincial elections, is opposed to increasing political sovereignty for the province, but has also been historically at odds, on occasion, with various Canadian federal governments. Thus, the Quebec politic scene was effectively divided into two camps, principally opposed over the sovereignty issue, until 2018 (on that year the Coalition avenir Québec, an autonomist party, took power). Quebec sovereignty is politically opposed to the competing ideology of [[Canadian federalism]].

Most groups within this movement seek to gain independence through peaceful means, using negotiation-based diplomatic intervention, although fringe groups have advocated and used violent means. The overwhelming number of casualties came from attacks by the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ), a militant organization which perpetrated a bombing and armed robbery campaign from 1963 to 1970, culminating in the [[October Crisis]] and the death of Deputy Premier [[Pierre Laporte]]. Since this time all mainstream sovereignist groups have sworn off violence, while extremist nationalist groups, though in the minority, support violent actions in the name of liberating Quebec from Canadian sovereignty.

The primary mainstream political vehicle for the movement is the [[Parti Québécois]], which has governed Quebec on multiple occasions. In 2012 it was elected to a minority government, in which its leader, [[Pauline Marois]], became the first female [[Premier of Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/04/parti-quebecois-win-quebec-election-2012/|title=Parti Québécois wins Quebec election 2012|work=National Post|date=5 September 2012|access-date=5 September 2012|author=Alexander Panetta}}</ref><ref>Rita Devlin Marier, [http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/canada-politics-quebec-idINL1E8KPK1R20120925 New Quebec government could have problems over tax hike plans], [[Reuters]], September 25, 2012.</ref> However, only eighteen months later, the PQ was defeated by the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]] in the [[2014 Quebec general election|2014 election]].

==Terminology==
In practice, "separatist" and "{{Not a typo|sovereignist}}" are terms used to describe individuals wanting the province of Quebec to separate from Canada to become a country of its own; supporters of the movement generally prefer the latter term. The term "independentist" is preferred by some supporters. Also in practice, the term "Federalist" was used to define people who stood with and agreed with confederation in other words agreeing that Quebec should not be an independent country.

==Reasons for sovereignty==
Justifications for Quebec's sovereignty are historically nationalistic in character, claiming the [[Culture of Quebec|unique culture]] and [[French language|French-speaking]] majority (78% of the provincial population) are threatened with assimilation by either the rest of Canada or, as in Metropolitan France, by Anglophone culture more generally, and that the best way to preserve language, identity and culture is via the creation of an independent political entity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/quebec_e.php |title=Statistics on Official Languages in Quebec |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pq.org/souverainete/pourquoi |title=Pourquoi faire la souveraineté? |access-date=22 September 2010|language=fr}}</ref> Other distinguishing factors, such as religious differences (given the Catholic majority in Quebec), are also used to justify either separation or nationalist social policies advocated by the Parti Québécois.

The historical justification is that Quebec should be independent by virtue of New France having been conquered by the British in 1763 and subsequently relinquished to the British in exchange for Guadeloupe. It argues that the people of Quebec are the descendants of a conquered people who are due their national sovereignty. This perspective was popular in the 1950s and 1960s {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} when European countries were giving up their colonies in the name of independence throughout much of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.

Eight of the other Canadian provinces are overwhelmingly (greater than 95%) [[English language|English-speaking]], while [[New Brunswick]] is officially bilingual and about one-third Francophone. Another rationale is based on resentment of [[anti-Quebec sentiment]].<ref>Carens, Joseph H., ed. (1995), Is Quebec Nationalism Just?: Perspectives from Anglophone Canada, Montreal, [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]. ({{ISBN|0773513426}})</ref> With regard to the creation of the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} movement, language issues were but a sub-stratum of larger cultural, social and political differences. Many scholars point to historical events as framing the cause for ongoing support for sovereignty in Quebec, while more contemporary politicians may point to the aftermath of more recent developments like the ''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]]'' of 1982, the [[Meech Lake Accord]] or the [[Charlottetown Accord]].

==Overview==

===Background===
[[File:Quebec langues.png|thumb|right|Linguistic map of Quebec. Blue means a large French majority, green a small French majority, yellow a small English majority, red a large English majority]]

Tension between the francophone, [[Catholic]] population of Quebec and the largely [[English language|anglophone]], [[Protestant]] population of the rest of Canada has been a central theme of [[Canadian history]], shaping the early territorial and cultural divisions of the country that persist to this day.<ref name="georgetown1">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027124041/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Supporters of sovereignty for Quebec believe that the current relationship between Quebec and the rest of Canada does not reflect Quebec's best social, political and economic development interests. Moreover, many subscribe to the notion that without appropriately recognizing that the people of Quebec are culturally distinct, Quebec will remain chronically disadvantaged in favour of the [[English-Canadian]] majority. There is also the question of whether the French language can survive within the geographic boundaries of Quebec and where French-Canadian society and culture fits into what is an increasingly multicultural country. Separatists and Independentists are generally opposed to some aspects of the federal system in Canada and do not believe it can be reformed in a way that could satisfy the needs of Quebec's French-speaking majority. A key component in the argument in favour of overt political independence is that new legislation and a new system of governance could best secure the future development of modern Québécois culture. Additionally, there is wide-ranging debate about defence, monetary policy, currency, international-trade and relations after independence and whether a renewed federalism would give political recognition to the Quebec nation (along with the other 'founding' peoples, including Canadian [[First Nations]], the [[Inuit]], and the British) could satisfy the historic disparities between these cultural "nations" and create a more cohesive and egalitarian Canada.

Several attempts at reforming the federal system in Canada have thus far failed because of, particularly, the conflicting interests between Quebec's representatives and the other provincial governments' representatives. There is also a degree of resistance throughout Quebec and the rest of Canada to re-opening a constitutional debate, in part because of the nature of these failures—not all of which were the result simply of {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} and federalists not getting along. To cite one case, in a recent round of constitutional reform, [[Elijah Harper]], an aboriginal leader from Manitoba, was able to prevent ratification of the agreement in the [[Manitoba Legislature|provincial legislature]], arguing that the accord did not address the interests of Canada's aboriginal population. This was a move to recognize that other provinces represent distinct cultural entities, such as the aboriginal population in Canada's Prairies or the people of Newfoundland (which contains significant and culturally distinct French-Canadian, English-Canadian, Irish-Canadian and Aboriginal cultures- and many more).

===Contemporary politics===
Perhaps the most significant basis of support for Quebec's sovereignty movement lies in more recent political events. For practical purposes, many political pundits use the political career and efforts of [[René Lévesque]] as a marker for the beginnings of what is now considered the contemporary movement, although more broadly accepted consensus appears on the contemporary movement finding its origins in a period called the [[Quiet Revolution]].

René Lévesque, architect of the first referendum on sovereignty, claimed a willingness to work for change in the Canadian framework after the [[Quebec federalist ideology|federalist]] victory in the referendum of 1980. This approach was dubbed {{lang|fr|le beau risque}} ("the beautiful risk"), and it led to many ministers of the Lévesque's government to resign in protest. The 1982 [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] did not solve the issue in the point of view of the majority of {{Not a typo|sovereignists}}. The constitutional amendment of 1982 was agreed to by representatives from 9 of the 10 provinces (with René Lévesque abstaining). Nonetheless, the constitution is integral to the political and legal systems used in Quebec.

There are numerous possible reasons the 'Yes' campaign went down to defeat: The economy of Quebec suffered measurably following the election of the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} [[Parti Québécois]] and continued to during the course of the campaign. The [[Canadian dollar]] lost much of its value and, during coverage of the dollar's recovery against US currency, there were repeated citations of the referendum and political instability caused by it cited as cause for the fall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Some suggest there were promises of constitutional reform to address outstanding political issues between the province and the federal government, both before and since, without any sign of particularly greater expectation those promises would be filled to any greater or lesser degree. There remains no conclusive evidence that the sovereignty movement derives significant support today because of anything that was promised back in the 1970s.

Proponents of the sovereignty movement sometimes suggest that many people in Quebec feel "bad" for believing the constitutional promises that the federal government and Pierre Trudeau made just before the 1980 Quebec referendum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trudeau promises a renewed Confederation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/a-la-prochaine-fois-the-1980-quebec-referendum/trudeau-promises-a-renewed-confederation.html|publisher=CBC Digital Archives}}</ref> Those were not delivered on paper or agreed upon in principle by the federal government or the other provincial governments. But, one conclusion that appears to be universal is that one event in particular—dubbed "the night of long knives"—energized the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} movement during the 1980s. This event involved a "back-room" deal struck between Trudeau, representing the federal government, and all of the other provinces, save Quebec. It was here that Trudeau was able to gain agreement on the content of the constitutional amendment, while the separatist Premier René Lévesque was left out. And it may well be that a certain number of Quebecers did and may even now feel "bad" both about the nature of that deal and how Trudeau (a Quebecer himself) went about reaching it.

Regardless of Quebec government's refusal to approve the 1982 constitutional amendment because the promised reforms were not implemented, the amendment went into effect. To many in Quebec, the 1982 constitutional amendment without Quebec's approval is still viewed as a historic political wound. The debate still occasionally rages within the province about the best way to heal the rift and the sovereignty movement derives some degree of support from a belief that healing should take the form of separation from Canada.

{{quote|I also criticized the unilateral repatriation [sic] of 1982, concluding that even in their moments of greatest mistrust, the Québécois never imagined that the pact of 1867 could ever be changed without their consent. Hence the impression they had in 1982 of a breach of trust, of a violation of the national bond's integrity. The descendants of [[George-Étienne Cartier]] did not expect this from the descendants of [[John A. Macdonald]]. Perceived as trickery in Quebec, the repatriation [sic] of 1982 has placed a time bomb in the political dynamics of this country".|Lucien Bouchard, former leader of the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} federal political party, the Bloc Québécois (p.&nbsp;224, ''On the Record'')}}

The failure of the Meech Lake Accord—an abortive attempt to redress the above issues—strengthened the conviction of most {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} politicians and led many federalist ones to place little hope in the prospect of a federal constitutional reform that would satisfy Quebec's purported historical demands (according to proponents of the sovereignty movement). These include a constitutional recognition that Quebecers constitute a [[distinct society]], as well as a larger degree of independence of the province towards federal policy.

{{quote|In Montreal, June 25, I walked along rue Sherbrooke to Olympic Stadium, submerged in the immense river of white and blue that seemed unstoppable on its march to sovereignty. Three days earlier, Bourassa, former minister of federalism, had hurriedly changed his tune: "English Canada must understand that... Quebec is, today and forever, a distinct society, free and able to assume its destiny and its development."|Lucien Bouchard (p.&nbsp;251, ''On the Record'')}}

The contemporary sovereignty movement is thought to have originated from the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, although the desire for an independent or autonomous French-Canadian state has periodically arisen throughout Quebec's history, notably during the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|1837 Lower Canada Rebellion]]. Part of Quebec's continued historical desire for sovereignty is caused by Quebecers' perception of a singular English-speaking voice and identity that is dominant within the parameters of [[Canadian identity]]. (This is a point contested in other parts of Canada, particularly in places such as Manitoba, which has a significant French-speaking population and where, in the 1990s, that population tried to assert francophone language rights in schools. The separatist Parti Québécois-led government of Quebec offered up comment actually taking the side of the Manitoba government, which was opposing granting those rights. Speculation persists that the Quebec government opposed this assertion of francophone identity outside of the province because of the impact it would have on the assertion of anglophone language rights within its own borders.)

For a majority of Quebec politicians, whether {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} or not, the problem of Quebec's political status is considered unresolved to this day. Although Quebec independence is a political question, cultural concerns are also at the root of the desire for independence. The central cultural argument of the {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} is that only sovereignty can adequately ensure the survival of the [[French language]] in North America, allowing Quebecers to establish their [[nationality]], preserve their [[cultural identity]], and keep their [[collective memory]] alive (see [[Language demographics of Quebec]]).

{{quote|At the same time, a brutal gesture by the Saskatchewan legislature brought the first language crises to my doorstep. The legislature precipitously abrogated the only law guaranteeing linguistic rights to the French population. It was revenge for a recent Supreme Court decision that had confirmed the constraining power of the law requiring all provincial laws to be available in French. To avoid having to translate all their laws, Grant Devine's government moved to repeal the act. The French community reacted with indignation and asked for federal intervention".|Lucien Bouchard (p.&nbsp;186, ''On the Record'')}}

===Legal and constitutional issues===
It has been argued by Jeremy Webber and Robert Andrew Young that, as the office is the core of authority in the province, the secession of Quebec from Confederation would first require the abolition or transformation of the post of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec; such an amendment to the [[constitution of Canada]] could not be achieved without, according to Section 41 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', the approval of the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and all other provincial legislatures in Canada.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Young| first=Andrew| title=The secession of Quebec and the future of Canada| publisher=McGill-Queen's Press| year=1998| location=Montreal| page=[https://archive.org/details/secessionofquebe0000youn_o5e7/page/215 215]| url=https://archive.org/details/secessionofquebe0000youn_o5e7| url-access=registration| isbn=978-0-7735-1530-7| ref=CITEREF_Young_1998}}</ref> Others, such as J.

==Arguments against sovereignty==
In a series of letters throughout the 1990s, [[Stéphane Dion]] (the federal Intergovernmental Affairs Minister at the time) laid out an argument against sovereignty.

It has also been argued by prominent Quebecers ({{Not a typo|sovereignists}} and ex-{{Not a typo|sovereignists}}, including former Quebec premier [[Lucien Bouchard]]) that sovereignty politics has distracted Quebecers from the real economic problems of Quebec, and that sovereignty by itself cannot solve those problems. In 2005 they published their position statement, "[[Pour un Québec lucide]]", ("For a lucid Quebec") which details the problems facing Quebec.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pourunquebeclucide.com/cgi-cs/cs.waframe.index?lang=2 |title=? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325055746/http://www.pourunquebeclucide.com/cgi-cs/cs.waframe.index?lang=2 |archive-date=March 25, 2006 }}</ref>

Many federalists oppose the Quebec sovereignty movement for economic and political reasons but many also oppose sovereignty on other grounds. For example, since the 1995 referendum, in regards to the declaration of [[Jacques Parizeau]] who blamed the loss on "[[money and the ethnic vote]]", many federalists considered the sovereignty movement as an expression of [[ethnic nationalism]].

Some arguments against sovereignty claim that the movement is illegitimate because of its [[Eurocentrism]] which alienates many among Canada's [[First Nations]], as well as the [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples and their sympathizers.<ref>A Clash of Quiet Revolutions: Quebecers meet Native Nationalism. - http://http-server.carleton.ca/~gfrajkor/zine97/group3/quebec.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084216/http://http-server.carleton.ca/~gfrajkor/zine97/group3/quebec.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}; Quebec’s “territorial integrity” against First Nations, The Red Flag, http://theredflag.ca/node/62 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621033821/http://theredflag.ca/node/62 |date=June 21, 2013 }}; {{cite journal |last=Taiaiake |first=Alfred |title=Then and Now, For the Land |journal=Socialist Studies: The Journal of the Society for Socialist Studies |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2010 |pages=93–95 }}</ref> The sentiment is summed up by a quotation from a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] from Akwsasne: "How can Quebec, with no economic base and no land base, ask to become sovereign? How can Quebec be a nation when they have no constitution? We have had a constitution since before the American revolution." Here the argument expresses the claim that the Mohawk nation has a more legitimate claim to distinct nationhood on the basis of traditional lands and a constitution predating confederation (and the creation of Quebec and a Québécois identity) and thus should be afforded the right of self-determination.<ref>Mark van der Maas, "Claims to Identity in Determining Resources for Indigenous Social Movements in Canada", {{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/ethnicstudies/vanderMaas.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041924/http://www.utoronto.ca/ethnicstudies/vanderMaas.pdf |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }} (pg. 12)</ref>

Similarly, the [[Cree]] have also asserted for many years that they are a separate people with the right to self-determination recognized under international law. They argue that no annexation of them or their territory to an independent Quebec should take place without their consent, and that if Quebec has the right to leave Canada then the Cree people have the right to choose to keep their territory in Canada. Cree arguments generally do not claim the right to secede from Canada; rather, the Cree see themselves as a people bound to Canada by treaty (see the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]]), and as citizens of Canada.<ref name="PRB">Parliamentary Research Branch (PRB) of the Library of Parliament, "ABORIGINAL PEOPLES AND THE 1995 QUEBEC REFERENDUM: A SURVEY OF THE ISSUES" http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp412-e.htm#A {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126032403/http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/bp412-e.htm#A |date=January 26, 2016 }}.

Additionally, those in favour Canadian federalism denounce Quebec separation as a '[[Balkanization]]' of Canada.

==Sovereignty-association==
{{See also|Mouvement Souveraineté-Association}}

The history of the relations between French and British descendants in Canada has been marked by periodic tension. After colonizing Canada from 1608 onward, France lost it to Great Britain at the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, in which France ceded control of [[New France]] (except for the two small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]) to Great Britain, which returned some of France's West Indian islands, in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].

Under British rule, [[French Canadians]] struggled to maintain their culture, notably outside of Quebec (where they became a minority) but within the province as well, as much of the province's economy was dominated by British settlers. The cause of Québécois nationalism, which waxed and waned over two centuries, gained prominence from the 1960s onward. The use of the word "sovereignty" and many of the ideas of this movement originated in the 1967 [[Mouvement Souveraineté-Association]] of René Lévesque. This movement ultimately gave birth to the Parti Québécois in 1968.

Sovereignty-association ({{lang-fr|links=no|souveraineté-association}}) is the combination of two concepts:

# The achievement of sovereignty for the Quebec state.
# The creation of a political and economic association between this new independent state and Canada.

It was first presented in Lévesque's political manifesto, [[An Option for Quebec|''Option Québec'']].

The Parti Québécois defines sovereignty as the power for a state to levy all its taxes, vote on all its laws, and sign all its treaties (as mentioned in the [[1980 Quebec referendum#Question|1980 referendum question]]).

The type of association between an independent Quebec and the rest of Canada was described as a monetary and customs union as well as joint political institutions to administer the relations between the two countries. The main inspiration for this project was the then-emerging [[European Community]]. In [[An Option for Quebec|''Option Québec'']] Lévesque expressly identified the EC as his model for forming a new relationship between sovereign Quebec and the rest of Canada, one that would loosen the political ties while preserving the economic links.  The analogy, however, is counterproductive, suggesting Lévesque did not understand the nature and purpose of the European Community nor the relationship between economics and politics that continue to underpin it.  Advocates of European integration had, from the outset, seen political union as a desirable and natural consequence of economic integration.<ref>Dennis Swann (1992) The Economics of the Common Market, p ix  {{ISBN|0140144978}}</ref>

The hyphen between the words "sovereignty" and "association" was often stressed by Lévesque and other PQ members, to make it clear that both were inseparable. The reason stated was that if Canada decided to boycott Quebec exports after voting for independence, the new country would have to go through difficult economic times, as the barriers to trade between Canada and the United States were then very high. Quebec would have been a nation of 7&nbsp;million people stuck between two impenetrable protectionist countries. In the event of having to compete against Quebec, rather than support it, Canada could easily maintain its well-established links with the United States to prosper in foreign trade.

Sovereignty-association as originally proposed would have meant that Quebec would become a politically independent state, but would maintain a formal association with Canada — especially regarding economic affairs. It was part of the 1976 {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} platform which swept the Parti Québécois into power in that year's provincial elections – and included a promise to hold a [[referendum]] on sovereignty-association. René Lévesque developed the idea of sovereignty-association to reduce the fear that an independent Quebec would face tough economic times. In fact, this proposal did result in an increase in support for a sovereign Quebec: polls at the time showed that people were more likely to support independence if Quebec maintained an economic partnership with Canada. This line of politics led the outspoken [[Yvon Deschamps]] to proclaim that what Quebecers want is an independent Quebec inside a strong Canada, thereby comparing the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} movement to a spoiled child that has everything it could desire and still wants more.

In 1979 the PQ began an aggressive effort to promote sovereignty-association by providing details of how the economic relations with the rest of Canada would include [[free trade]] between Canada and Quebec, common tariffs against imports, and a common currency. In addition, joint political institutions would be established to administer these economic arrangements. But the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} cause was hurt by the refusal of many politicians (most notably the premiers of several of the other provinces) to support the idea of negotiations with an independent Quebec, contributing to the Yes side losing by a vote of 60 percent to 40 percent.

This loss laid the groundwork for the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]], which stated that Quebec should offer a new economic and political partnership to Canada before declaring independence. An English translation of part of the [[Act Respecting the Future of Quebec|Sovereignty Bill]] reads, "We, the people of Quebec, declare it our own will to be in full possession of all the powers of a state; to levy all our taxes, to vote on all our laws, to sign all our treaties and to exercise the highest power of all, conceiving, and controlling, by ourselves, our fundamental law."

This time, the {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} lost in a very close vote: 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, or only 53,498 votes out of more than 4,700,000 votes cast. However, after the vote many within the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} camp were very upset that the vote broke down heavily along language lines. Approximately 90 percent of English speakers and allophones (mostly immigrants and first-generations Quebecers whose native language is neither French or English) Quebecers voted against the referendum, while almost 60 percent of Francophones voted Yes. [[Quebec premier]] [[Jacques Parizeau]], whose government supported sovereignty, attributed the defeat of the resolution to "[[money and the ethnic vote|money and ethnic votes]]." His opinion caused an outcry among English speaking Quebecers, and he resigned following the referendum.

An inquiry by the director-general of elections concluded in 2007 that at least $500,000 was spent by the federalist camp in violation of Quebec's election laws. This law imposes a limit on campaign spending by both option camps. Parizeau's statement was also an admission of failure by the Yes camp in getting the newly arrived Quebecers to adhere to their political option.

Accusations of an orchestrated effort of 'election engineering' in several polling stations located in areas with large numbers of non-francophone voters, which resulted in unusually large proportions of rejected ballots, were raised following the 1995 referendum.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Afterward, testimony by PQ-appointed polling clerks indicated that they were ordered by PQ-appointed overseers to reject ballots in these polling stations for frivolous reasons that were not covered in the election laws.

While opponents of sovereignty were pleased with the defeat of the referendum, most recognized{{examples|date=August 2012}} that there were still deep divides within Quebec and problems with the relationship between Quebec and the rest of the country.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Quebec independence movement}}

===Precursor ideas and events===
{{Further|Quebec nationalism}}
[[File:L'Assemblée des six comtés à Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, en 1837 by Charles Alexander 1891.tif|thumb|right|The [[Patriotes Rebellion|1837 Patriotes Rebellion]] was the first attempt by French Canadians to overthrow British dominance since the [[Seven Years' War|1760 conquest]].]]
Sovereigntism and sovereignty are terms that refer to the modern movement in favour of the political independence of Quebec. However, the roots of Quebec's desire for [[self-determination]] can be traced back as far as the [[Patriotes Rebellion]], the [[Alliance Laurentienne]] of 1957, the writings of [[Lionel Groulx]] in the 1920s, the [[Francoeur Motion]] of 1917, and [[Honoré Mercier]]'s flirtation with this idea (especially in his historic speech of 1893).

===Emergence===
The Quiet Revolution in Quebec brought widespread change in the 1960s. Among other changes, support for Quebec independence began to form and grow in some circles. The first organization dedicated to the independence of Quebec was the Alliance Laurentienne, founded by [[Raymond Barbeau]] on January 25, 1957.

On September 10, 1960, the [[Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale]] (RIN) was founded, with [[Pierre Bourgault]] quickly becoming its leader. On August 9 of the same year, the Action socialiste pour l'indépendance du Québec (ASIQ) was formed by [[Raoul Roy]]. The "independence + socialism" project of the ASIQ was a source of political ideas for the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ).

On October 31, 1962, the Comité de libération nationale and, in November of the same year, the Réseau de résistance were set up. These two groups were formed by RIN members to organize non-violent but illegal actions, such as vandalism and civil disobedience. The most extremist individuals of these groups left to form the FLQ, which, unlike all the other groups, had made the decision to resort to violence in order to reach its goal of independence for Quebec. Shortly after the November 14, 1962, [[1962 Quebec general election|Quebec general election]], RIN member [[Marcel Chaput]] founded the short-lived [[Parti républicain du Québec]].

In February 1963, the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) was founded by three Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale members who had met each other as part of the Réseau de résistance. They were [[Georges Schoeters]], [[Raymond Villeneuve]], and [[Gabriel Hudon]].

In 1964, the RIN became a provincial political party. In 1965, the more conservative [[Ralliement national]] (RN) also became a party.

During this period, the [[Estates General of French Canada]] are organized. The stated objective of these Estates General was to consult the French-Canadian people on their constitutional future.

The historical context of the time was a period when many former European colonies, such as [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Senegal]], [[Algeria]], and [[Jamaica]], were becoming independent. Some advocates of Quebec independence saw Quebec's situation in a similar light; numerous activists were influenced by the writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Albert Memmi]], and [[Karl Marx]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In June 1967, French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], who had granted independence to Algeria, shouted "{{lang|fr|[[Vive le Québec libre]]!}}" during a speech from the balcony of [[Montreal]]'s city hall during a state visit to Canada. In doing so, he deeply offended the federal government, and English Canadians felt he had demonstrated contempt for the sacrifice of Canadian soldiers who died on the battlefields of France in two world wars. The visit was cut short and de Gaulle left the country.

Finally, in October 1967, former [[Parti libéral du Québec|Liberal]] cabinet minister [[René Lévesque]] left that party when it refused to discuss sovereignty at a party convention. Lévesque formed the [[Mouvement souveraineté-association]] and set about uniting pro-sovereignty forces.

He achieved that goal in October 1968 when the MSA held its only national congress in [[Quebec City]]. The RN and MSA agreed to merge to form the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ), and later that month Pierre Bourgault, leader of the RIN, dissolved his party and invited its members to join the PQ.

Meanwhile, in 1969 the FLQ stepped up its campaign of violence, which would culminate in what would become known as the [[October Crisis]]. The group claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Montreal Stock Exchange, and in 1970 the FLQ kidnapped British Trade Commissioner [[James Cross]] and Quebec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]]; Laporte was later found murdered.

===The early years of the Parti Québécois===
Jacques Parizeau joined the party on September 19, 1969, and [[Jérôme Proulx]] of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] joined on November 11 of the same year.

In the [[1970 Quebec general election|1970 provincial election]], the PQ won its first seven seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]]. René Lévesque was defeated in Mont-Royal by the Liberal [[André Marchand (politician)|André Marchand]].

===The referendum of 1980===
{{Main|1980 Quebec referendum}}

In the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 election]], the PQ won 71 seats — a majority in the National Assembly. With voting turnouts high, 41.4 percent of the electorate voted for the PQ. Prior to the election, the PQ renounced its intention to implement sovereignty-association if it won power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/parti-québécois-first-elected-35-years-ago-today-1.726446|title=Parti Québécois first elected 35 years ago today|date=15 November 2011|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>

On August 26, 1977, the PQ passed two main laws: first, the law on the financing of political parties, which prohibits contributions by corporations and unions and set a limit on individual donations, and second, the [[Charter of the French Language]].

On May 17 PQ [[National Assembly of Quebec|Member of the National Assembly]] [[Robert Burns (Quebec)|Robert Burns]] resigned, telling the press he was convinced that the PQ was going to lose its referendum and fail to be re-elected afterwards.

At its seventh national convention from June 1 to 3, 1979, the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} adopted their strategy for the coming referendum. The PQ then began an aggressive effort to promote sovereignty-association by providing details of how the economic relations with the rest of Canada would include free trade between Canada and Quebec, common tariffs against imports, and a common currency. In addition, joint political institutions would be established to administer these economic arrangements.

Sovereignty-association was proposed to the population of Quebec in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. The proposal was rejected by 60 percent of the Quebec electorate.

In September, the PQ created a national committee of Anglophones and a liaison committee with ethnic minorities.

The PQ was returned to power in the [[1981 Quebec general election|1981 election]] with a stronger majority than in 1976, obtaining 49.2 per cent of the vote and winning 80 seats. However, they did not hold a referendum in their second term, and put sovereignty on hold, concentrating on their stated goal of "good government".

[[René Lévesque]] retired in 1985 (and died in 1987). In the [[1985 Quebec general election|1985 election]] under his successor [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]], the PQ was defeated by the Liberal Party.

===The referendum of 1995===
{{Main|1995 Quebec referendum}}

The PQ returned to power in the [[Quebec general election, 1994|1994 election]] under Jacques Parizeau, this time with 44.75% of the popular vote. In the intervening years, the failures of the Meech Lake Accord and [[Charlottetown Accord]] had revived support for sovereignty, which had been written off as a dead issue for much of the 1980s.

Another consequence of the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] was the formation of the [[Bloc Québécois]] (BQ), a {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} federal political party, under the leadership of the charismatic former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] federal cabinet minister Lucien Bouchard. Several PC and Liberal members of the federal parliament left their parties to form the BQ. For the first time, the PQ supported pro-sovereigntist forces running in federal elections; during his lifetime Lévesque had always opposed such a move.

The [[Union Populaire]] had nominated candidates in the [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]] and [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980 federal elections]], and the [[Parti nationaliste du Québec]] had nominated candidates in the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]], but neither of these parties enjoyed the official support of the PQ; nor did they enjoy significant public support among Quebecers.

In the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]], which featured the collapse of Progressive Conservative Party support, the BQ won enough seats in Parliament to become [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].

At the Royal Commission on the Future of Quebec (also known as the Outaouais Commission) in 1995, the [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada]] made a presentation in which the party leader, [[Hardial Bains]], recommended to the committee that Quebec declare itself as an independent republic.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mlpc.ca/briefs/19950210quebec.html| last=Bains| first=Hardial| title=Brief to the Outaouais Commission on the Future of Quebec| publisher=Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada| date=10 February 1995| access-date=8 February 2009| quote=I propose that the preamble of such a Constitution should read as follows: We, the people of Quebec... hereby declare the formation of the Republic of Quebec....| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407035715/http://www.mlpc.ca/briefs/19950210quebec.html| archive-date=April 7, 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref>
[[File:Quebec referendum,1995 - Results By Riding (Simple Map).svg|350px|thumb|left|1995 Referendum results by constituency]]
Parizeau promptly advised the Lieutenant Governor to call a new referendum. The [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]] question differed from the 1980 question in that the negotiation of an association with Canada was now optional. The open-ended wording of the question resulted in significant confusion, particularly amongst the 'Yes' side, as to what exactly they were voting for. This was a primary motivator for the creation of the ''Clarity Act''' (see below).

The "No" campaign won, but only by a very small margin — 50.6% to 49.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/en/tableaux/Referendum_1995_8481.asp |title=I'm voting |date=September 13, 2010 |publisher=Le Directeur Général des Elections du Québec |access-date=22 September 2010|language=fr}}</ref> As in the previous referendum, the English-speaking ([[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]]) minority in Quebec overwhelmingly (about 90%) rejected sovereignty, support for sovereignty was also weak among [[allophone (Canadian usage)|allophone]]s (native speakers of neither English nor French) in immigrant communities and first-generation descendants. The lowest support for Yes side came from Mohawk, Cree and Inuit voters in Quebec, some first Nations chiefs asserted their right to self-determination with the [[Cree]] being particularly vocal in their right to stay territories within Canada. More than 96% of the Inuit and Cree voted No in the referendum. However, The [[Innu]], [[Attikamek]], [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] nations did partially support Quebec sovereignty. In 1985, 59 per cent of Quebec's Inuit population, 56 per cent of the Attikamek population and 49 per cent of the Montagnais population voted in favour of the Sovereignist Parti Québécois party. That year, three out of every four native reservations gave a majority to the Parti Québécois party.<ref>Drouilly Pierre, L'année politique au Québec 1997-1998 _Les tendances du vote 1985-1995 Université du Québec à Montréal, 1999</ref>

By contrast almost 60 percent of [[francophone]]s of all origins voted "Yes". (82 per cent of Quebecers are Francophone.) Later inquiries into irregularities determined that abuses had occurred on both sides: some argue that some "No" ballots had been rejected without valid reasons, and the October 27 "No" rally had evaded spending limitations because of out-of-province participation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgeq.gouv.qc.ca/en/pdf/publications/dge_6350.3_v.a.pdf |title=I'm voting |date=September 13, 2010 |publisher=Le Directeur Général des Elections du Québec |access-date=22 September 2010}}</ref> An inquiry by "Le Directeur général des élections" concluded in 2007 that the "No" camp had exceeded the campaign spending limits by $500,000.

===Quebec general election, 1998===
Expecting Bouchard to announce another referendum if his party won the [[1998 Quebec general election]], the leaders of all other provinces and territories gathered for the [[Calgary Declaration]] in September 1997 to discuss how to oppose the sovereignty movement. Saskatchewan's [[Roy Romanow]] warned "It's two or three minutes to midnight". Bouchard did not accept his invitation; organizers did not invite Chrétien. Experts debated whether Quebec was a "distinct society" or "unique culture".<ref name="turner19970920">{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-20-mn-34188-story.html |title=Provinces Brainstorm on Issue of Quebec Secession |last=Turner |first=Craig |date=1997-09-20 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2019-07-08 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

The Parti Québécois won re-election despite losing the popular vote to Jean Charest and the Quebec Liberals. In the number of seats won by both sides, the election was almost a clone of the previous 1994 election. However, public support for sovereignty remained too low for the PQ to consider holding a second referendum during their second term. Meanwhile, the federal government passed the ''[[Clarity Act]]'' to govern the wording of any future referendum questions and the conditions under which a vote for sovereignty would be recognized as legitimate. Federal Liberal politicians stated that the ambiguous wording of the 1995 referendum question was the primary impetus in the bill's drafting.

While opponents of sovereignty were pleased with their referendum victories, most recognized that there are still deep divides within Quebec and problems with the relationship between Quebec and the rest of Canada.

===''Clarity Act'', 1999===
In 1999, the [[Parliament of Canada]], at the urging of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], passed the ''[[Clarity Act]]'', a law that, amongst other things, set out the conditions under which the [[Queen-in-Council|Crown-in-Council]] would recognize a vote by any province to leave Canada. It required a majority of eligible voters for a vote to trigger secession talks, not merely a plurality of votes. In addition, the act requires a clear question of secession to initiate secession talks. Controversially, the act gave the House of Commons the power to decide whether a proposed referendum question was considered clear, and allowed it to decide whether a clear majority has expressed itself in any referendum. It is widely considered by {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} as an illegitimate piece of legislation, who asserted that Quebec alone had the right to determine its terms of secession. However, the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed when the matter was referred to that body, ruling that the Act is constitutional and, just as Canada is divisible, so is Quebec, a ruling that has significant implications for linguistic and ethnic minorities within Quebec, the bulk of whom have traditionally opposed secession. Chrétien considered the legislation among his most significant accomplishments.

==Present==
{{Update|section|date=January 2018}}

===Modernization===
"Sovereignty-Association" is nowadays more often referred to simply as "sovereignty". However, in the 1995 Quebec referendum, in which the sovereignty option was narrowly rejected, the notion of some form of economic association with the rest of Canada was still envisaged (continuing use of the Canadian dollar and military, for example) and was referred to as "Sovereignty-Partnership" ({{lang-fr|links=no|souveraineté-partenariat}}). It remains a part of the PQ program{{when|date=March 2015}} and is tied to national independence in the minds of most Quebecers. This part of the PQ program has always been controversial, especially since Canadian federal politicians usually refuse the concept.

In 2003, the PQ launched the {{lang|fr|Saison des idées}} ("Season of ideas") which is a public consultation aiming to gather the opinions of Quebecers on its sovereignty project. The new program and the revised sovereignty project was adopted at the 2005 Congress.

In the [[2003 Quebec general election|2003 election]], the PQ lost power to the Liberal Party. However, in early 2004, the Liberal government of Paul Martin had proved to be unpopular, and that, combined with the federal [[Liberal Party sponsorship scandal]], contributed to a resurgence of the BQ. In the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal elections]], the Bloc Québécois won 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 33 previously. However, in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal elections]] the BQ lost three seats and in the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal elections]] lost two additional seats, bringing their total down to 49, but was still the most popular federal party in Quebec up until the [[2011 Canadian federal election]], when the BQ was devastated by the federalist [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], with the Bloc at a total of four seats and the loss of official party status in the Commons (compared to the NDP's 59 seats, Conservatives' five seats, and the Liberals' seven seats in Quebec).

Polling data by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid]] in June 2009 showed the support for Quebec separation was very weak at the time and separatism unlikely to occur in the near future. Polling data showed that 32% of Quebecers believe that Quebec had enough sovereignty and should remain part of Canada, 28% thought they should separate, and 30% say they believe that Quebec does need greater sovereignty but should remain part of Canada.<ref name="Angus Reid 2009">{{Cite web| title = Separation from Canada Unlikely for a Majority of Quebecers| publisher = [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid]]| date = June 9, 2009| url = http://www.docstoc.com/docs/32029410/Separation-from-Canada-Unlikely-for-a-Majority-of-Quebecers| access-date = November 7, 2010}}</ref> However the poll did reveal that a majority (79%) of Quebecers still desired to achieve more autonomy. The number one area of autonomy that those polled had hoped for was with regard to culture at 34%, the next highest areas of autonomy cherished were the economy at 32%, taxation at 26%, and immigration and the environment at 15% each.<ref name="Angus Reid 2009"/>

The 2009 Angus Reid poll also revealed some effects of the ''Clarity Act'' in which they asked two questions, one a straightforward question for a separate nation, and the other a more muddled version on separation similar to the one posed in the 1995 referendum. The data on the questions revealed as follows to the first hard line question of "Do you believe that Quebec should become a country separate from Canada?" 34% replied yes, 54% said no, and 13% were unsure.<ref name="Angus Reid 2009"/> To the less clear question of "Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within a scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec?" support for separation increased to 40% yes, the no vote still led with 41%, and the unsure increased to 19%.<ref name="Angus Reid 2009"/> The most startling revelation of the poll was in the fact that only 20% or 1 in 5 polled believed that Quebec would ever separate from Canada.<ref name="Angus Reid 2009"/>

2011 was considered a watershed year for the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} movement. In the aftermath of the 2011 federal election, [[Léger Marketing]] and pro-{{Not a typo|sovereignist}} newspaper [[Le Devoir]] conducted a poll on the question.<ref name="Sondage Léger Marketing-Le Devoir - L'appui à la souveraineté ne fléchit pas">{{cite news|last=Dutrisac|first=Robert|title=Sondage Léger Marketing-Le Devoir - L'appui à la souveraineté ne fléchit pas|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/323376/sondage-leger-marketing-le-devoir-l-appui-a-la-souverainete-ne-flechit-pas|access-date=March 24, 2011|newspaper=Le Devoir|date=March 14, 2011}}</ref> When asked whether they would vote Yes or No in the event of a referendum, 41% of the respondents said they would vote Yes. In 2011, the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} movement splintered, with several new parties being formed by disaffected politicians, with some politicians dissatisfied with slow progress towards independence, and others hoping to put the sovereignty question on the backburner. Leadership by PQ leader [[Pauline Marois]] was divisive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/08/16/new-movement-quebec-sovereignty-manifesto-pq_n_928289.html|title=New Movement For Quebec: Prominent Sovereigntists Publish Manifesto, Slam PQ As Spent Force|date=16 August 2011|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>

==Allies and opponents==

===Provincial===
The separatist movement draws from the left and right spectrum; a sizeable minority of more [[Canadian conservatism|conservative]] Quebecers supporting the PQ's political agenda because of the sovereignty issue, despite reservations about its [[social democracy|social democratic]] political agenda.

Right and Left must be interpreted within the provincial context; Liberal Party politics generally coincide with those of other [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties, while PQ politics are more [[social democratic]] in orientation. There is no mass conservative movement in Quebec's political culture on the provincial level, due notably to strong government interventionism and [[Keynesianism]] shared by all parties since the 1960s (the so-called "Quebec Consensus" since the Quiet Revolution), and the province's [[Catholic]] heritage.

There are, of course, quite a few exceptions. Notable examples include:

* the conservative but [[nationalist]] [[Action Démocratique du Québec]] supporting the Yes side in the 1995 Quebec referendum. They now support [[Quebec Autonomism]]: a decentralized view of the [[Canadian Confederation]], and accept the 1995 "No" verdict;
* the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada building links with the {{Not a typo|sovereignist}} in the 1980s;

Sovereignty has very little support among Quebec Anglophones, immigrant communities, and aboriginal First Nations. About 60% of Francophones voted "Yes" in 1995, and with the exception of weak "Yes" support from [[Haiti]]an, [[Arab]] and [[Latin American]] communities, most non-Francophones massively voted "No" (see [[Demolinguistics of Quebec]]). The opponents of the sovereignty movement view the project as ethnically exclusive, based on its rejection by non-Francophones. This position is sometimes disputed by the PQ, which claims its goal is all-embracing and essentially civic in nature.

====Partitionism====
{{Main|Partition of Quebec}}

There is an undercurrent of feeling amongst "ethnic" and "anglo" voters that sometimes surfaces as a desire to separate from Quebec. This would create a new province of Canada, from the southwestern and southern portions of the province (comprising half of Montreal, parts of the [[Outaouais]], the [[Eastern Townships]]).

This feeling is exemplified by the statement — "If Canada is divisible, then so is Quebec" made by federalists in 1995 or "If Quebec can separate from Canada, then we can separate from Quebec".<ref name="Partition splits">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/partition-splits-quebec-leaders-1.678646 | title=Partition splits Quebec leaders | date=7 March 2007 | publisher=[[CBC News]] | access-date=21 January 2016}}</ref> In contemporary times most mainstream political parties in Quebec deny or refuse to comment on the idea that Quebec can be divided up. During the [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 Quebec election]], federalist and [[Liberal Party of Quebec]] leader Jean Charest said that "All of these things are hypothetical questions...I do not think that Quebec is divisible. And if ever we were to go there, and end up in that situation, I know the question would be asked."<ref name="Partition splits"/>

However, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in favour of the legality in partitioning Quebec, determining that Quebec is in fact divisible according to the same logic, legalities, and democratic tests that render Canada divisible. A panel of Quebec civil servants, at the request of the ruling Parti Québécois at the time, wrote a report arguing that International law guarantees the territorial integrity of Quebec<ref>Thomas Franck et al., ''The Territorial Integrity of Quebec in the Event of the Attainment of Sovereignty'', Report prepared for the Quebec Department of International Relations (1992)</ref> should Quebec become an independent state.

====Cree separation====
{{Further|The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples}}

There was a feeling amongst the Cree of Northern Quebec, that should the province separate, they would remain part of Canada, and would force the province to return to its pre-1912 boundaries, and re-establish the Ungava district of the Northwest Territories, or a new territory or province created in its place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Rest of Canada===
The other nine provinces of Canada have generally been opposed to Quebec sovereignty.  Aside from marginal movements, the only major secessionist movement in English Canada has been the [[Anti-Confederation Party|Maritimes Anti-Confederation movement]] immediately after Confederation occurred.

In general, francophones outside Quebec oppose sovereignty or any form of national recognition for Quebec, while non-francophones, particularly the anglophone minority in Montreal, also have remained opposed. After polling heavily on the subject, marketing firm president Mark Leger concluded: “These numbers surprise me, they’re so clear across the country.... You look at Francophones outside Quebec, it’s the same result.... Overall, outside the French in Quebec, all the other groups across the country are against this notion.” The exact question of the November 2006 poll was, "Currently, there is a political debate on recognizing Quebec as a nation. Do you personally consider that Quebecers form a nation or not?" Canadians from every region outside Quebec, non-Francophone Quebecers (62 per cent), Francophone Canadians outside Quebec (77 per cent) all rejected the idea.<ref name="rejSov">{{Cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=d95acc63-c7fc-4e57-90b2-f06e4086c218&k=32289| title=Canadians and Liberals reject Quebec nationhood: poll | author=Les Perreaux | publisher=[[Canada.com]] | date=November 28, 2006 | access-date=2007-01-23}}</ref>

===France===
In [[France]], although openness and support is found on both sides of the [[political spectrum]], the French political right has traditionally been warmer to {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} (like [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], who [[Vive le Québec libre speech|shouted his support]] of independence in Montreal in 1967) than the French left (like former President [[François Mitterrand]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}).

This used to be a paradoxical phenomenon because of the Parti Québécois and most {{Not a typo|sovereignists}} being to the political left and supporters of Quebec remaining a province tend to be politically on the right. [[Michel Rocard]] (who became [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister of the French Republic]]) has been one of the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialists]] that broke that so-called rule the most, maintaining a close and warm relationship with Quebec {{Not a typo|sovereignists}}. More recently, [[Ségolène Royal]], a leader of the French Socialist Party, indicated support{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} for "Quebec sovereignty" but it was seemingly a reflexive answer to an "out of the blue" question from a Quebec journalist in Paris. On a later visit to Quebec City she gave a more nuanced position, mentioning a Parliamentary motion recognizing the Québécois as a nation, but also describing 400 years of oppression and resistance of francophones in Canada.

The French Foreign Office motto concerning Quebec's national question is "''non-ingérence et non-indifférence''" ("no interference and no indifference"), which epitomizes the official position of the French State. In other words, while the Quebec people vote to stay within Canada, France will officially support the Canadian Confederation the way it is.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bastien|first=Frédéric|year=1998|title=À la demande du Québec : la diplomatie québécoise de la France de 1969 à 1980 (Note)|journal=Études internationales|volume=29| issue =  3|pages=551–575|doi=10.7202/703918ar|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Quebec sovereignty movement in fiction==
* [[Richard Rohmer]]'s novel ''Separation'' (1976) was turned into a TV-movie for [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] Television in 1977. In the movie, the Parti Québécois has formed the government of Quebec but Premier Gaston Belisle has repeatedly put off its promise to hold a referendum. International politics forces Belisle's hand.
* In the mid-1980s, a second movie, ''Quebec-Canada 1995'', depicts a meeting between the president of Quebec and the prime minister of Canada to discuss a crisis involving Quebec military occupations of parts of Ontario and New Brunswick. Canada's armed forces are stretched thin with peacekeepers in such varied places as the [[Falkland Islands]] (with "Lady Goosegreen" being [[Margaret Thatcher]]).
* [[William Weintraub]]'s satirical 1979 novel ''The Underdogs'' provoked controversy by imagining a future Quebec in which English-speakers were an oppressed minority, complete with a violent resistance movement. One planned stage version was cancelled before its premiere.
* [[Clive Cussler]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is set against a fictional attempt at secession in the late 1980s. Rights to newly discovered oil resources in [[Ungava Bay]], discovered as Quebec moves to secede, clash with the ramifications of a rediscovered secret treaty negotiated between the U.K. and U.S. governments during [[World War I]].
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes both real and fictional Québécois separatist movements as integral to the plot. In the story, the United States has merged with Canada and Mexico to form the Organization of North American Nations (ONAN). Wheelchair-bound Quebec separatists use a video so entertaining it leads to death to accomplish their goals of both Quebec independence and the end of the ONAN.
* In the ''[[Southern Victory Series]]'' of [[alternate history]] novels by [[Harry Turtledove]], Quebec becomes a separate nation during the [[Great War (series)|First Great War]] (an alternative World War I), in which the United States defeats Canada, the United Kingdom and the other Entente Powers (including the [[Confederate States of America]]); upon its founding, the Republic is officially recognised only by the United States, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, Poland, Ukraine, Italy and the Netherlands. Since the United States organized this separation to weaken Anglophone Canada (and the UK by extension) and to aid in the post-war occupation of Canada, the Republic of Quebec operated as a [[client state]] of the United States, rather than being truly independent. This is later demonstrated in the series when Québécois soldiers release their US counterparts from occupation duties in Canada during the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]], allowing the United States to focus its military efforts against the Confederacy. The Republic of Quebec in this alternate timeline is in a similar geopolitical situation to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917–18)|Kingdom of Poland]], a German puppet state created as part of [[Mitteleuropa]].
* In [[DC Comics]], the villain (and sometimes hero) [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] is initially a Québécois freedom fighter, who resorts to acts of terrorism.
* In ''[[Marvel Comics]]'', the superhero [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] was part of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) in his youth.
* In ''[[Axis Powers Hetalia]]'', Canada's nightmare features an independent Quebec.
* Margaret Atwood's 1979 novel ''Life Before Man'' is set in Toronto in the late 1970s and several characters watch and sometimes comment upon the elections and sovereignist movement in Quebec. The sovereignist movement and its struggles are metaphorically linked to the difficulties the characters in the novel have with separating their own personal relationships.
* In the roleplaying game ''[[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]]'' there are references made to a separatist Quebec nation who in return for independence helped the then formed 'Confederated States of America' take control of Canada.
* In the novel ''[[Babylon Babies]]'' by the French-born Canadian cyberpunk writer [[Maurice Dantec]], loosely adapted as the film [[Babylon A.D.]], Quebec is independent and referred to as the "Free Province of Quebec".
* In the roleplaying game ''[[Shadowrun]]'', Quebec exists as a sovereign nation alongside the United Canadian American States and the Confederated American States.
* In the film ''[[Die Hard]]'', Hans Gruber, the terrorist leader, demands, as a ruse, the release of imprisoned members of the fictional group Liberté du Québec. (Presumably meant to be a fictional version of the [[Front de libération du Québec|FLQ]].)
* In [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]]' science fiction series, starting with ''Starfish'', Quebec has attained sovereignty and is an energetic/economic superpower within North America.
* In the alternate history novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'', co-authored by [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and Harry Turtledove, the [[American Revolution]] never occurs, resulting in the creation of the North American Union, a dominion of the British Empire. En route to the Six Nations, Thomas Bushell and Samuel Stanley of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Royal American Mounted Police]] discuss the nearby province of Quebec. Stanley muses that, being culturally French, the Québécois people would want to split off from the N.A.U. to become part of the Franco-Spanish Holy Alliance.
* In the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer to the Max]]", Homer Simpson is invited to an exclusive garden party by Trent Steel, a successful businessman whom he meets as a result of changing his name to Max Power. President [[Bill Clinton]], a guest at the garden party, is called away to deal with Quebec 'getting the [[nuclear weapon|bomb]]'.
*In ''[[The Critic]]'' episode "L.A. Jay", in a dream sequence, Jay Sherman, at his [[Oscars|Oscar acceptance speech]] says he supports independence for Quebec, cutting to a room of Québécois saying "Viva la Sherman! Viva la Quebec!" which is Spanish for "Long live Sherman! Long live Quebec!"
