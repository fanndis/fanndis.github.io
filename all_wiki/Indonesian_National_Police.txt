The '''Indonesian National Police'''  ({{lang-id|'''Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia'''}}, literally ''State Police of the Republic of Indonesia'', abbreviated as '''POLRI''') is the national [[police]] force of [[Indonesia]]. Founded on 1 July 1946, it was formerly a part of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|country's military]] since 1962. The police were formally separated from the military on 1 April 1999 in a process which was formally completed on 1 July 2000.<ref>{{citation | title= Indonesian police split from military | work= Reuters | publisher= [[CNN]] | date= 1 April 2009 | url= http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9904/01/indonesia.police/index.html | accessdate= 18 September 2009 }}</ref>

The organisation is now independent and is under the direct auspices of the [[President of Indonesia]], while the Armed Forces is under the [[Ministry of Defense (Indonesia)|Ministry of Defense]]. The Indonesian National Police is responsible for law enforcement and policing duties all over Indonesia. The organisation is widely known for its corruption, violence and incompetence.<ref name="Davies">{{citation | title= Indonesia’s secret police weapon| publisher= Inside Indonesia|last = Davies  | first = Sharyn Graham  | last2 = Meliala | first2 = Adrianus| last3 = Buttle| first3 = John | edition= Jan-Mar 2013 | url= http://www.insideindonesia.org/indonesia-s-secret-police-weapon | accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref>

The Indonesian National Police also takes part in international [[United Nations]] missions, and after special training, provided security for the [[United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]] mission to protect internally-displaced people in [[Darfur]].<ref>{{citation | title= Sudan Focus: United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) introduces Community Policing in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in Khartoum | work= UN Police Magazine |page=16|edition=5| publisher= [[United Nations]] | date= July 2010 | url= https://police.un.org/sites/default/files/unpolmag_05.pdf| accessdate= 30 April 2019 }}</ref>

The strength of the Indonesian National Police stood at approximately 387,470 in 2011 and the number is increasing every year. It also includes up-to 12,000 [[water police]] (''Polair'') personnel and an estimated 40,000 People's Security (''KAMRA'') trainees who serve as a police auxiliary and report for three weeks of basic training each year.

The headquarters of the Indonesian National Police is located in [[Kebayoran Baru]].

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Groepsportret van het corps van de veldpolitie Poedjon te Malang. TMnr 60005899.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''veldpolitie'' in [[Malang]], [[East Java]] (c. 1930)]]

While Indonesia was under [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial]] rule, police duties were performed either by military establishments or the colonial police known as the ''veldpolitie,'' or ''field police''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polri.go.id/|title=Website Resmi Polri|website=www.polri.go.id|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] during [[World War II|WW II]] brought changes when the Japanese formed various armed organisations to support their war effort. This led to militarily trained youths being armed with confiscated Dutch arms to perform police duties.

After the Japanese occupation, the national police became an armed organisation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The Indonesian police was established on 19 August 1945 (under the title of the National Police Agency (''Badan Kepolisian Negara'')) and its units fought in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] against the invading Dutch forces. The police also participated in suppressing the 1948 communist revolt in [[Madiun]]. In 1962, the police was brought under the control of the Commander of the National Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence, becoming the Indonesian Police Forces (''Angkatan Kepolisian'').  Following the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]], the police played a vital role when they actively supported the people's movement to dismantle the Japanese army, and to strengthen the defence of the newly created Republic of Indonesia. The police were not combatants who were required to surrender their weapons to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. During [[Indonesian National Revolution|the revolution of independence]], the police gradually formed into what is now known as ''Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia'' (Polri) or the Indonesian National Police.  In April 1999, the police force officially regained its independence and now is separate from the armed forces proper.

1 July, which is marked as National Police Day (''Hari Bhayangkara''), honours the anniversary of the 1946 Cabinet resolution placing the INP as a national agency subordinated directly to the government of the Republic and thus responsible to the President (formerly the Prime Minister).

==Corruption==
In the eyes of the people, the National Police force is "corrupt, brutal, and inept".<ref name="Davies"/> Even becoming a police officer can be expensive, with applicants having to pay up to Rp90 million, according to Indonesia Police Watch head, Neta Saputra Pane.<ref>{{citation | title= Indonesia pays a high price for its corrupt heart| publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]|last = Allard| first = Tom| date= 10 May 2010 | url= https://www.smh.com.au/world/indonesia-pays-a-high-price-for-its-corrupt-heart-20100507-ujo2.html | accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref>

In April 2009, angry that the [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] (KPK) had tapped his phone while investigating a corruption case, Indonesian Police chief detective [[Susno Duadji]] compared the KPK to a gecko ({{lang-id|cicak}}) fighting a crocodile ({{lang-id|buaya}}) meaning the police. Susno's comment, as it turned out, quickly backfired because the image of a ''cicak'' standing up to a ''buaya'' (similar to [[David and Goliath]] imagery) immediately had wide appeal in Indonesia. A noisy popular movement in support of the ''cicak'' quickly emerged.  Students staged pro-''cicak'' demonstrations, many newspapers ran cartoons with ''cicaks'' lining up against an ugly ''buaya'', and numerous TV talk shows took up the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' topic with enthusiasm. As a result, references to ''cicaks'' fighting a ''buaya'' have become a well-known part of the political imagery of Indonesia.<ref>Antagonism between the KPK and the police, with memories of the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' clash, remained deeply embedded in the relationship between the KPK and the police after the clash. See, for example, references to the clash in 2012 in Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/18/doubts-over-kpk-inquiry-police-bank-accounts.html Doubts over KPK inquiry into police bank accounts'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2012.</ref>

In June 2010, the Indonesian news magazine [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo]] published a report on "fat bank accounts" held by senior police officers containing billions of rupiah. When the magazine went on sale in the evening groups of men said by witnesses to be police officers, went to newsstands with piles of cash to try to buy all the copies before they could be sold.<ref>{{citation | title= Fat Bank Accounts of POLRI Chief Candidates| publisher= [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo]] | date=  26 July 2013 | url= http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2013/07/26/080499977/Fat-Bank-Accounts-of-POLRI-Chief-Candidates | accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | title= The disappearing magazine and Indonesian media freedom | publisher= [[Financial Times]]|last = Deutsch| first = Anthony | date= 29 June 2010 | url= http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/06/29/indonesias-media-is-free-but-constantly-tested/ | accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref>

When KPK investigators tried to search Polri headquarters in 2010 as part of an investigation into Djoko Susilo, then the head of Korlantas (police corps of traffic), they were detained, and only released following the intervention of the president, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]. Following a trial, Djoko was jailed for 18 years. Two years later, the KPK began investigating another senior police officer, Budi Gunawan, who was subsequently nominated for the post of National Police Chief. The KPK then named Budi a suspect and his nomination was withdrawn. However, he was later sworn in as deputy police chief. The police subsequently took revenge by charging three KPK commissioners with criminal offenses.<ref>{{citation | title= Joko Widodo's support wanes as Indonesia's anti-corruption agency KPK rendered toothless | publisher= [[The Age]]|last = Butt| first = Simon  | last2 = Lindsey| first2 = Tim | date= 11 April 2015 | url= http://www.theage.com.au/comment/joko-widodos-support-wanes-as-indonesias-anticorruption-agency-kpk-rendered-toothless-20150401-1mdawv.html| accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | title= Budi Gunawan sworn in as deputy police chief | publisher= [[The Jakarta Post]]| date= 22 April 2015 | url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/04/22/budi-gunawan-sworn-deputy-police-chief.html | accessdate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref>

An official admission of violence by police officers came in 2016 when Chief Gen. Badrodin Haiti admitted that officers of the [[Detachment 88]] anti-terror unit were responsible for the death in custody of terrorist suspect Siyono, who died of heart failure after being kicked hard enough in the chest to fracture his ribs. The [[National Commission on Human Rights (Indonesia)|Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights]] stated in March 2016 that at least 121 terror suspects had died in custody since 2007<ref>{{citation| title= Police Negligence Admission only Tip of the Iceberg: Amnesty International| author= Eko Prasetyo| publisher= [[The Jakarta Globe]]| date= 22 April 2016| url= http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/police-negligence-admission-tip-iceberg-amnesty-international/| accessdate= 22 April 2016| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160423124242/http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/police-negligence-admission-tip-iceberg-amnesty-international/| archive-date= 23 April 2016| url-status= dead}}</ref>

[[Amnesty International]] called in June 2019 for an investigation of "credible evidence" of a range of grave violations by police, who it alleged were responsible for 10 unlawful killings in the aftermath of the re-election of president Joko Widodo.<ref>{{citation | title= Amnesty wants impartial probe of Indonesia police violence| author = AP | publisher= [[federalnewsnetwork.com]] | date= 26 June 2019| url= https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-news/2019/06/amnesty-wants-impartial-probe-of-indonesia-police-violence/ | accessdate= 13 September 2019}}</ref>

In July 2020, the Indonesian [[Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence]] (KontraS) issued a report detailing police brutality over the preceding year that resulted in 304 deaths and 1,627 injuries in 921 violent incidents. The report also mentioned arbitrary arrests of people demonstrating legally, and acts of discrimination towards [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|ethnic Papuans]].<ref>{{citation| title= Rights groups highlight cases of police brutality on National Police’s 74th anniversary| author1= Alya Nurbaiti| author2= Tri Indah Oktavianti| publisher= [[The Jakarta Post]]| date= 1 July 2020| accessdate= 5 July 2020| url= https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/01/rights-groups-highlight-cases-of-police-brutality-on-national-polices-74th-anniversary.html}}</ref>

==Rank structure==
In the early years, the Indonesian Police used European police style ranks like "[[inspector]]" and "[[commissioner]]". When the police were amalgamated with the military structure during the 1960s, the ranks changed to a military style such as "Captain", "Major" and "Colonel".
In the year 2000, when the Indonesian Police conducted the transition to a fully independent force out of the armed forces, they used British style police ranks like "Inspector" and "[[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]]". In 2001, the Indonesian Police have returned to Dutch style ranks like "[[Brigadier]]" and "Inspecteur" just like in the early years with some ''Indonesianized'' elements within the ranking system. The ranks are comparable with the [[Indonesian military ranks|armed forces' rank system]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesia Company Laws and Regulations Handbook : Volume 1 Strategic Information and Basic Laws |publisher=International Business Publications USA |isbn=1-5145-0900-8 |page=99}}</ref>
