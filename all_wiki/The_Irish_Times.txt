Though formed as a [[Protestant Irish nationalists|Protestant nationalist]] paper, within two decades and under new owners it had become the voice of [[Unionism in Ireland|British unionism in Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Irish Times: A History|first=Mark|last=O'Brien|publisher=[[Four Courts Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84682-123-3}}</ref> It is no longer marketed as a unionist paper; it presents itself politically as "liberal and [[progressivism|progressive]]",<ref name=TerranceBrown>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Terrance|title=The Irish Times: 150 Years of Influence|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781472919069|pages=448}}</ref> as well as promoting [[neoliberalism]] on economic issues.<ref>McCabe, Conor, ''Sins of the Father: Tracing the Decisions That Shaped the Irish Economy'' (Dublin, 2011), p. 179.</ref> The editorship of the newspaper from 1859 until 1986 was controlled by the [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] Protestant minority, only gaining its first nominal [[Irish Catholic]] editor 127 years into its existence.

The paper's most prominent columnists include writer and arts commentator [[Fintan O'Toole]] and [[satirist]] [[Miriam Lord]]. The late [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] was once a columnist. Senior international figures, including [[Tony Blair]] and [[Bill Clinton]], have written for its [[op-ed]] page. Its most prominent columns have included the political column ''Backbencher'', by [[John Healy (Irish journalist)|John Healy]], ''Drapier'' (an anonymous piece produced weekly by a politician, giving the 'insider' view of politics), ''Rite and Reason'' (a weekly religious column, edited by [[Patsy McGarry]], the 'religious affairs' editor) and the long-running ''An Irishman's Diary''. ''An Irishman's Diary'' was written by [[Patrick Campbell, 3rd Baron Glenavy|Patrick Campbell]] in the forties (under the pseudonym 'Quidnunc'); by Seamus Kelly from 1949 to 1979 (also writing as  'Quidnunc'); and more recently{{when|date=January 2013}}<!-- 2000's --> by [[Kevin Myers]]. After Myers' move to the rival ''[[Irish Independent]]'', ''An Irishman's Diary'' has usually been the work of Frank McNally. On the sports pages, [[Philip Reid (author)|Philip Reid]] is the paper's golf correspondent.

One of its most popular columns was the biting and humorous ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' satire column written, originally in [[Irish language|Irish]], later in English, by [[Myles na gCopaleen]], the pen name of Brian O'Nolan (Brian Ó Nualláin) who also wrote books using the name [[Flann O'Brien]]. ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' is an [[anglicised]] spelling of the Irish words ''crúiscín lán'', meaning 'full little jug'. ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' made its debut in October 1940, and appeared with varying regularity until O'Nolan's death in 1966.

==History==
===Origins===
The first appearance of a newspaper using the name ''The Irish Times'' occurred in 1823, but this closed in 1825. The title was revived—initially as a thrice-weekly publication but soon becoming a daily—by a 22-year-old army officer, [[Lawrence E. Knox]] (later known as Major Lawrence Knox), with the first edition being published on 29 March 1859. It was founded as a moderate Protestant newspaper, reflecting the politics of Knox, who envisaged it as a "new conservative daily newspaper".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Geoghegan |first1=Patrick M |editor1-last=McGuire |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=James |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Knox, Laurence Edward}}. [https://www.irishtimes.com/archive/a-profile-of-laurence-knox Reproduced] on the ''Irish Times'' website. Retrieved 8 May 2019.</ref> Its headquarters were at 4 Lower Abbey Street in Dublin. Its main competitor in its early days was the Dublin ''[[Daily Express (Dublin)|Daily Express]]''.

===The Arnotts===
After Knox's death in 1873, the paper was sold to the widow of Sir [[John Arnott]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]], a former [[Lord Mayor of Cork]] and owner of [[Arnotts (Ireland)|Arnotts]], one of [[Dublin]]'s major [[Department store]]s. The sale, for £35,000, led to two major changes. Its headquarters was shifted to 31 Westmoreland Street, remaining in buildings on or near that site until 2005. Its politics also shifted dramatically, becoming predominantly [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionist]] in outlook, and it was closely associated with the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]]. The paper, along with the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' and various regional papers, called for the execution of the leaders of the failed [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]].<ref name=easter_rising>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/newspapers/na04.shtml|title=Sir John Maxwell's Position|work=The Irish Times|date=10 May 1916|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=30 June 2008}}</ref>

Though the paper became a publicly listed company in 1900, the family continued to hold a majority shareholding until the 1960s (even after the family lost control, the great-grandson of the original purchaser was the paper's London editor). The last member of the Arnott family to sit on the paper's board was Sir Lauriston Arnott, who died in 1958.

The editor during the 1930s, [[R. M. Smyllie]], had strong [[anti-fascist]] views: he angered the Irish Catholic hierarchy by opposing [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Later, ''The Irish Times'', like other national newspapers, had problems with Irish Government censorship during World War II. The Times was largely pro-Allied and was opposed to the [[Éamon de Valera]] government's policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Irish Media: A Critical History Since 1922|first=John|last=Horgan|author-link=John Horgan (academic)|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2001|pages=38–45}}</ref>

===The Irish Times Trust===
In 1974, ownership was transferred to a non-charitable<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/about-us/the-irish-times-trust|title=The Irish Times Trust|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> trust, The Irish Times Trust. The former owner, Major [[Thomas Bleakley McDowell|Thomas McDowell]], was made "president for life" of the trust which runs the paper and  was paid a large dividend.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/times-exowner-leaves-836413m-2029316.html|title='Times' ex-owner leaves €13m|work=Irish Independent|first=Liam|last=Collins|date=24 January 2010|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> However several years later the articles of the Trust were adjusted, giving Major McDowell 10 preference shares and one more vote than the combined votes of all the other directors should any move be made to remove him.<ref name="mcdowell-tax-liability">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mcdowell-had-pound30000-tax-liability-512202.html|title=McDowell had £30,000 tax liability|work=Irish Independent|first=Liam|last=Collins|date=23 December 2001|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> Major McDowell died in 2009.
The Trust was set up in 1974 as "a company limited by guarantee" to purchase The Irish Times Limited and to ensure that ''The Irish Times'' would be published as an independent newspaper with specific editorial objectives. (See below).

The Trust is regulated by a legal document, the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and controlled by a body of people (the Governors) under company law. It is not a charity and does not have charitable status. It has no beneficial shareholders and it cannot pay dividends. Any profits made by ''The Irish Times'' cannot be distributed to the Trust but must be used to strengthen the newspaper, directly or indirectly.

The Trust is composed of a maximum of 11 Governors. The Trust appoints Governors who are required to be "representative broadly of the community throughout the whole of Ireland".

As of June 2012, Ruth Barrington is the chair of the trust, and the governors are Tom Arnold, David Begg, Noel Dorr, Margaret Elliott, Rosemary Kelly, Eoin O'Driscoll, Fergus O'Ferrall, Judith Woodworth, Barry Smyth, and Caitriona Murphy.

===Recent history===
{{update|section|date=October 2017}}
In 1969, the longest-serving editor of ''The Irish Times'', [[Douglas Gageby]], was allegedly called a "white nigger" by the company chairman (a former Irish British army officer), because of the newspaper's coverage of Northern Ireland at the outset of [[the Troubles]], which was upsetting the British government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-times-major--mcdowell-called-his-editor--a-white-nigger-488144.html|title=Irish Times' Major McDowell called his editor a 'white nigger'|work=Irish Independent|first=Charlie|last=Mallon|date=26 January 2003|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/white-nigger-denial-poses-a-real-dilemma-488276.html|title='White nigger' denial poses a real dilemma|work=Irish Independent|first=Ronan|last=Fanning|date=2 February 2003|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref>

The paper established its first bureau in Asia when foreign correspondent [[Conor O'Clery]] moved to Beijing in 1996.<ref>[http://www.ucd.ie/asia/oclery.htm China the Emerging Power: Prospects for Sino-Irish Relations] Conor O'Clery lecture, Centre for Asian Studies, University College Dublin, 2000. "...I first arrived [in Beijing] to establish the first Irish Times bureau in Asia in 1996."</ref>

The paper suffered considerable financial difficulty in 2002 when a drop in advertising revenue coincided with a decision by the company to invest its reserves in the building of a new printing plant. None of the journalists were laid off, but many took a voluntary redundancy package when the paper was greatly restructured. Some foreign bureaux were closed and it also stopped publishing 'colour' pages devoted to Irish regions, with regional coverage now merged with news. The paper's problems stemmed partly from internal strife which led to Major McDowells's daughter, Karen Erwin, not being made chief executive.<ref name="mcdowell-tax-liability"/> The reorganisation had the desired effect; after posting losses of almost €3 million in 2002, the paper returned to profit in 2003.

[[John Waters (columnist)|John Waters]], a columnist who spoke out about the perceived vast salaries of the editor, managing director and deputy editor, was sacked and re-hired a week later, in November 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-real-story-behind-the-times-rich-list-497097.html|title=The real story behind the Times Rich List|work=[[Irish Independent]]|first1=Liam|last1=Collins|first2=Jody|last2=Corcoran|date=30 November 2003|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> Former editor [[Geraldine Kennedy]] was paid more than the editor of the UK's top non-tabloid newspaper ''The Daily Telegraph'', which has a circulation of about nine times that of ''The Irish Times''. Later, columnist [[Fintan O'Toole]] told the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'': "We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double-standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-times-staff-revolt-at-editor-and-directors-indefensible-salaries-471014.html|work=Irish Independent|title=Irish Times staff revolt at editor and directors' 'indefensible' salaries|date=7 August 2005|access-date=25 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=287121|title=Irish Times staff revolt at editor and directors' 'indefensible' salaries|website=Boards.ie|access-date=20 May 2011}}</ref>

In January 2005, the paper was due to run a front-page story on the [[Provisional IRA]]'s denial of involvement in the [[Northern Bank robbery]], one of Europe's largest ever, and a column by [[Kevin Myers]], which said that the Provisional IRA were responsible.{{clarify|post-text=What?|date=March 2012}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/bank-heist-is-snooze-to-the-irish-times-462931.html|title=Bank heist is snooze to the 'Irish Times'|work=Irish Independent|first=Jim|last=Cusack|date=9 January 2005|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> Myers asked for clarification of the decision from the editor, and later left the paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/myers-shocked-at-spiking-of-column-on-ira-by-irish-times-462776.html|title=Myers shocked at spiking of column on IRA by 'Irish Times'|work=Irish Independent|first=Jim|last=Cusack|date=2 January 2005|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref>

The following May, the paper launched a new international edition, which was available in London and southeast England at the same time as other daily newspapers (previously, copies of the Irish edition were flown from Dublin to major cities in Britain on passenger flights, arriving around lunchtime). It was printed at the Newsfax plant in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], and uses the ''[[Financial Times]]'' distribution network.

The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] fined ''The Irish Times'' in 2008 after it admitted breaking market abuse rules.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0411/financial-business.html|title=Financial Regulator fines Irish Times|work=[[RTÉ Business]]|date=11 April 2008|access-date=1 July 2009}}</ref>

In 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the paper to pay €600,000 in costs despite winning its case about the importance of protecting journalistic sources, and called its destruction of evidence "reprehensible conduct".<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1127/1224259547062.html|title='Irish Times' ordered to pay legal costs in full|work=The Irish Times|date=27 November 2009|first=Mary|last=Carolan|access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref>

The newspaper has been criticized for its perceived support of the British Army. An article in ''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]'' magazine examined an article in ''The Irish Times'' published in August 2010 on Irish nationals serving in the British Army.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0731/1224275874706.html|work=The Irish Times|title=The fighting Irish|date=7 July 2010|access-date=22 October 2010}}</ref> According to ''The Phoenix'', the article romanticized the war in [[Afghanistan]] and was little more than a recruitment advertisement for the [[British Army]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-28/issue-16/contents.pdf|title=Irish Times for Queen and Country|work=[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]|date=13 August 2010|access-date=22 October 2010}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The magazine accused the editor [[Geraldine Kennedy]] and the Irish Times board of violating the Defence Act which prohibits any kind of advertising for recruitment for a foreign army and article 15.6.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] which states "The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas".

On 9 September 2011, the paper published a pseudonymous article by Kate Fitzgerald.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0909/1224303758047.html|title=Employers failing people with mental health issues|work=Irish Times|date=9 September 2011|access-date=19 December 2011}}</ref> Unknown to the paper, she had taken her life on 22 August 2011.

In September 2019, the paper reprinted an article from the ''[[New York Times]]'' by [[William Broad]]. The article claimed that "the blossoming anxiety over professed health risks of [[5G]] [fifth generation wireless technology] 'can be traced to a single scientist and a single chart'". A complaint to the Office of the Press Ombudsman of the Press Council of Ireland was filed by Professor Tom Butler of the [[University College Cork]].

In 1895, the paper moved from its original offices on [[Abbey Street|Middle Abbey Street]] to [[D'Olier Street]] in the centre of Dublin. "D'Olier Street" became a [[Metonymy|metonym]] of ''The Irish Times'' which in turn was personified as "The Old Lady of D'Olier Street". In October 2006, the paper relocated to a new building on nearby [[Tara Street]].<ref>Alison Healy, [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/iconic-irish-times-clock-back-where-it-belongs-1.940966 "Iconic Irish Times clock back where it belongs"], ''Irish Times'', September 27, 2008</ref>

==Online==
In 1994, ''The Irish Times'' established a website called Irish-times.ie; it was the first newspaper in Ireland  and one of the first 30 newspapers in the world to do so. The company acquired the [[domain name]] ''Ireland.com'' in 1997, and from 1999 to 2008, used it to publish its online edition. It was freely available at first but charges and a registration fee were introduced in 2002 for access to most of the content. A number of blogs were added in April 2007 written by Jim Carroll, Shane Hegarty, and Conor Pope. On 30 June 2008, the company relaunched Ireland.com as a separate lifestyle portal and the online edition of the newspaper was now published at irishtimes.com. It was supplied free of charge,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0630/1214764288069.html|title='The Irish Times' free online at irishtimes.com|date=30 June 2008|work=The Irish Times|access-date=30 June 2008}}</ref> but a subscription was charged to view its archives.

Inside, it usually contains eight to twelve pages of Irish news, called "Home News", covering the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It devotes several pages to important stories such as the publication of government reports, government budgets, important courts cases, and so on.

World News contains news from its correspondents abroad and from news wires and services such as Reuters, the Guardian Service, and the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post service. The paper has correspondents in London, Paris, Brussels, and Washington.
