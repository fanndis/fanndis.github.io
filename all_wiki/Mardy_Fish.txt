==Tennis career==

===Juniors===
As a junior, Fish compiled a 58–25 singles win/loss record (32–19 in doubles), reaching as high as No. 14 in the world in 1999 (and No. 19 in doubles).

===2000–2005===
Fish turned professional in 2000 at the age of 18. He spent his first few years as a pro playing in the Challenger and Futures circuits. He earned his first title on the [[ATP Tour]] in 2002 playing [[Doubles (tennis)|doubles]] in the [[U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], with [[Andy Roddick]].

Fish's career improved significantly in 2003, when he won his first ATP singles title and reached the biggest final of his career in [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]]. His singles victory came near the end of the season, when he defeated [[Robin Söderling]] to win the [[Stockholm Open]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. In addition, he defeated fifth-seeded and former world no. 1 [[Carlos Moyà]] at the [[2003 Australian Open]] in the second round, 3–6, 7–6, 6–4, 4–6, 6–2. He finished the year ranked no. 20 in the world.

Fish played well in 2004, reaching the finals at the [[SAP Open]] in [[San Jose, California]] and in the [[Gerry Weber Open]] in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle]], Germany. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], Fish earned a [[silver medal]] having defeated [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] and [[Fernando González]] to reach the final. He lost the final in five sets to [[Chile]]an [[Nicolás Massú]].

In 2005, Fish injured his left wrist. It eventually required two surgeries, and as a result, he only played 17 matches in the year.

===2006===
Fish was awarded a wildcard in April into the US Men's Claycourt Championships. He won the tournament, defeating eighth seed [[Juan Mónaco]], [[Rainer Schüttler]], [[Vince Spadea]], [[Tommy Haas]], and [[Jürgen Melzer]] in the final 3–6, 6–4, 6–3.

At [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Fish signaled his return to professional status as he reached the third round, defeating fellow American [[Robby Ginepri]] and Dutch player [[Melle van Gemerden]]. The night prior to his third-round match, he suffered from food poisoning. He could only play one set before retiring against Georgian [[Irakli Labadze]].

===2007===
Fish began 2007 by achieving his best finish at a Grand Slam. Fish reached the quarterfinals of the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], losing to his old roommate and doubles partner, [[Andy Roddick]]. Fish made waves on the first day of the tournament by knocking off [[Ivan Ljubičić]], the fourth seed, and had an easy win in the third round when his opponent [[Wayne Arthurs (tennis)|Wayne Arthurs]] retired in the opening set. Fish had few problems in his first four matches, but lost in straight sets to Roddick. As a result, he moved up by 17 places in the ATP rankings.

===2008===
Fish started off 2008 quite well at the [[Hopman Cup]], an exhibition event in Perth, Western Australia. Partnering with [[Serena Williams]], he won the title. Williams was ill and arrived after the start of the event, but [[Meghann Shaughnessy]] filled in for the first match. Fish won against Indian [[Rohan Bopanna]] and Australian [[Peter Luczak]], and received a walkover from Czech [[Tomáš Berdych]]. Although Fish lost the first doubles match, he and Williams were undefeated in two mixed doubles matches. They qualified as undefeated for the final, where they faced top-seeded Serbians [[Novak Djokovic]] and [[Jelena Janković]]. Although Fish lost in singles against Djokovic, the Americans again won the mixed doubles match to win the title.

Fish fell to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the third round of the Australian Open after a code violation caused him to lose his composure.

Fish then went on to make a quarterfinal showing at the [[2008 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships]], before losing to long-time friend and wild-card entry [[Robby Ginepri]].

At the [[2008 Pacific Life Open|Pacific Life Open]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], Fish defeated world no. 1 [[Roger Federer]] in the semifinals in what Fish described as "a great win,"<ref>[http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=48451 Pacific Life Open – March 22 – Mardy Fish] (interview transcript)</ref> after failing to beat the Swiss player in five previous matches.

Murray stayed on the court for a few minutes after the incident and said, "He only complained because I was gaining momentum", and "He wouldn't have complained when he was 3–0 up." The following day, Fish went on to win the third and final set in a 6–4, 1–6, 7–6 victory.

Fish has played nine seasons with [[World TeamTennis]] starting in 2004 when he debuted in the league with the [[Hartford FoxForce]], followed by two seasons with the [[Houston Wranglers]] in 2005 and 2006, two seasons with the [[Sacramento Capitals]] in 2012 and 2013, a season with the [[Washington Kastles]] in 2016, and most recently, three years with the [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] in 2017, 2018, and 2019. It was announced that he will be joining the [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] during the 2020 WTT season set to begin July 12 at [[The Greenbrier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wtt.com/2020/06/16/world-teamtennis-adds-stars-tiafoe-puig-raonic-bouchard-sock-as-rosters-set-for-2020/ |title=World TeamTennis Adds Stars Tiafoe, Puig, Roanic, Bouchard, & Sock As Rosters Set For 2020 |website=WTT.com |date=June 16, 2020 }}</ref>

==Equipment and playing style==
Fish endorsed the [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] BLX Six. One 95 18 by 20 racquet with a hybrid of Wilson Natural Gut and Luxilon ALU Power strings. His grip of choice was Wilson Pro [[Overgrip]]. He wears TravisMathew apparel.<ref>http://www.travismathew.com/team/mardy-fish/#.VWNP2s6e5FI</ref>

His biggest weapons were his strong serve and reliable backhand, and he often won points at net with adept volleying. His most reliable shot was his two-handed backhand, which he could flatten out effectively to end points. His forehand was more inconsistent, though it improved toward the end of his career. In 2010, he dropped over 30 pounds, from 203 to 170. This enabled Fish to become much fitter, faster and maintain longer rallies.

==Personal life==
Fish's father, Tom, is a tennis instructor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/usa-tennis/athletes/Mardy-Fish|title=Mardy Fish|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}</ref>

Fish married Stacey Gardner, a California attorney and "Briefcase Model" on NBC's ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', in a Jewish wedding ceremony in September 2008 (Gardner is Jewish).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/columns/story?columnist=harwitt_sandra&id=3744819|title=Sandra Harwitt: Plenty to remember off the court in 2008|publisher=ESPN|date=December 12, 2008|access-date=August 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name="people1">{{cite news|last=Cedenheim|first=Pernilla|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20229473,00.html|title=Tennis Ace Mardy Fish Gets Hitched – Weddings|work=People|date=September 29, 2008|access-date=August 8, 2011}}</ref> Fish's friend and fellow tennis player [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] served as groomsman.<ref name="people1" /> He is also good friends with [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Bob and Mike Bryan]].

Fish went to [[Vero Beach High School]] with country music star [[Jake Owen]] and remains good friends.  The two have repeatedly done charity events together in Vero Beach to raise money for their favorite charities.

Fish is a fan of the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Travis Bridell|title=Edina's Mardy Fish Retires from Professional Tennis|url=http://minnesotaconnected.com/arts-entertainment/sports/edinas-mardy-fish-retires-from-professional-tennis_764117/|publisher=Minnesota Connected|date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

Fish has a group of fans called "The Fishheads" who travel with him and cheer him on during matches:<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/26/sports/tennis-notebook-fish-s-fans-add-flavor-to-first-round-victory.html Fish's Fans Add Flavor To First-Round Victory – NYTimes], August 26, 2003</ref>
<blockquote>
The setting was center court at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, and the crowd filled only half the seats as Mardy Fish took the court for the second match of the day. But as Fish methodically made his way through a straight-set victory, an odd, and somewhat comical, sight emerged in the otherwise sedate setting.

Perched high in the cheap seats, relatively speaking, were a raucous band of shirtless fans, each one with a letter that collectively spelled out, ''Go Fish.'' Their heads were adorned with rubber fish heads and there were fins attached to their hands that they slapped together enthusiastically for each point scored by Fish.
</blockquote>

Fish is regarded as one of the best celebrity golfers. He is annually among the favorites at the [[American Century Championship]] in Lake Tahoe, winning the tournament in 2020. He won the Diamond Resorts Invitational in Orlando in both 2016 and 2018.
