==Early life==
Schorr was born in the [[Bronx, New York]], the son of [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants Tillie Godiner and Gedaliah Tchornemoretz.<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref>''Staying Tuned: A Life in Journalism: Daniel Schorr''. {{ISBN|978-0-671-02088-0}}<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> He began his journalism career at the age of 13, when he came upon a woman who had jumped or fallen from the roof of his apartment building. After calling the police, he phoned [[The Bronx Home News|the ''Bronx Home News'']] and was paid $5 for his information.<ref name="WP">{{cite news | author = Philip Hilts | title = Daniel Schorr Had A Secret; Then he passed it on-and all hell broke loose | work = The Washington Post | date = 1976-03-28}}</ref>

He attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] in the [[West Bronx]], where he worked on the ''Clinton News'', the school paper. He graduated from [[City College of New York]] in 1939 while working for the ''Jewish Daily Bulletin''. During World War II, Schorr served in [[United States Army Military Intelligence|Army Intelligence]] at [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]], and at [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[Texas]].

In January 1967, he married Lisbeth Bamberger,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lisbethschorr.org/ |title=Lisbeth B Schorr &#124; Welcome to my Website |publisher=Lisbethschorr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref> a graduate of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="WP"/>

== CBS News ==
Following several years as a [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]], in 1953 he joined [[CBS News]] as one of the recruits of [[Edward R. Murrow]] (becoming part of the later generation of [[Murrow's Boys]]). In 1955, with the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] thaw in the [[Soviet Union]], he received accreditation to open a CBS bureau in Moscow. In June 1957, he obtained an exclusive interview with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the Soviet Communist party chief. It aired on CBS's ''[[Face the Nation]]'', Schorr's first television interview. Schorr left the Soviet Union later that year, because of Soviet censorship laws. When he applied for a new visa, it was denied by the Soviets.<ref name="WP"/>

In January 1962, he aired the first examination of [[everyday life]] under [[communism]] in [[East Germany]], ''The Land Beyond the Wall: Three Weeks in a German City'', which ''[[The New York Times]]'' called a "journalistic coup".  After agreeing not to foster "propaganda" for the United States, Schorr was granted the rights to conduct the interviews in [[Rostock]].  By airing everyday life, Schorr painted a picture of the necessity for a Communist state to seal itself off from the West in order to survive.

President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] criticized Schorr's actions in an August 10, 1962 [[diplomatic cable]] for a [[checkbook journalism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/cables-from-the-berlin-wall-tell-a-tale-of-drama-d/?page=1 |title=Declassified cables from Berlin Wall tell tale of drama, dare |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref> story in which, "Schorr involved himself in a matter which was far beyond his private or journalistic responsibilities and proceeded amateurishly in a matter filled with greatest danger for all concerned. As we anticipated, [the] other side turned out to be fully aware of the matter and laid a trap which could have resulted in [a] massacre [of] those involved." A meeting with the State Department over the matter recorded in a cable stated, "Schorr appeared chastened by fact that a plan which was to be his greatest achievement had failed. He did not give slightest appearance of being contrite."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/cables-from-the-berlin-wall-tell-a-tale-of-drama-d/?page=2 |title=Declassified cables from Berlin Wall tell tale of drama, dare |publisher=Washington Times |date=2014-10-10 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>

CBS executives were not amused when Schorr reported—incorrectly—that [[Barry Goldwater]] was said to "travel to Germany to join-up with the right-wing there", and visit "Hitler's one-time stomping ground" in [[Berchtesgaden]], immediately after he became the Republican nominee for president.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For obvious reasons, this did not fare well with Goldwater, who demanded an apology for the "CBS conspiracy" against his campaign for president.<ref name="WP"/>

Schorr took a close journalistic interest in the career of [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Hubert Humphrey]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==1970s==

[[File:Nixon-opponents-3.jpg|thumb|"A real media enemy": Schorr is listed on page three of [[Nixon's Enemies List]], compiled by [[Charles Colson]] and written by [[George T. Bell]].]]
Schorr attracted the anger of [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[White House]]. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings, it was revealed that Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as [[Nixon's Enemies List]], and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june01/schorr_5-29.html Staying Tuned], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''News Hour'', 2001-05-29. Retrieved 2008-06-23.</ref> Schorr won [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.

Schorr provoked intense controversy in 1976 when he received and made public the contents of the secret [[Pike Committee]] report on illegal [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and FBI activities.<ref name="NYTobit"/> Called to testify before [[United States Congress|Congress]], he refused to identify his source on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds, risking imprisonment. This did not mollify CBS executives, and Schorr ultimately resigned from his position at CBS in September 1976. Although scolded at first for his television report by former CIA director [[Richard Helms]],<ref>{{cite news | title = Helms Terms Newsman 'Killer' for Hint of Murders by C.I.A. | work= The New York Times | date = 1975-04-29}}</ref> Schorr was vindicated by the text of the report, which he had obtained from an undisclosed source and <!-- sold<ref name="ReferenceA"/> https://books.google.com/books?id=N__FoqcV32MC&pg=PA365&dq=sold&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gITdUvKkLoWMyAHy-IHQCw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=sold&f=false--> sent to ''[[The Village Voice]]''.<ref name="WP"/>

On May 14, 2006, on NPR's ''[[Weekend Edition]]'', Schorr mentioned a meeting at the White House that took place with colleague [[A. M. Rosenthal]] and president Gerald Ford. Ford mentioned that the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] had access to various CIA documents, including those referring to political assassinations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Remembering Journalist Abe Rosenthal | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5403716 | work = Weekend Edition Sunday | publisher = NPR | date = 2006-05-14}}</ref>

==Later work==
In 1977, Schorr was hired by [[Reese Schonfeld]] as a White House correspondent for ITNA (Independent Television News Association), a news agency serving independent television news stations in the U.S. In 1979, Schonfeld and [[Ted Turner]] brought Schorr to Cable News Network ([[CNN]]), where he was the first on-camera employee hired. He reported news and delivered commentary and news analysis on the fledgling CNN. His contract was not renewed in 1985, one of the two times he stated he was "fired".<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/schorrdanie/schorrdanie.htm Schorr, Daniel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He then took the position as Senior News Analyst at NPR, a position he held for decades up to the time of his death. In that position, he regularly commented on current events for programs including ''[[All Things Considered]]'' and ''[[Weekend Edition]]''. He also wrote a column for ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' for several decades.  Schorr was called "reliably liberal",<ref>{{cite news|last=Jaffe|first=Harry|title=No Bull Bill|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/6454.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=The Washingtonian|date=1 August 2008}}</ref> and was "widely regarded as a liberal" according to another source, though he regarded the label as inaccurate.<ref>{{cite news|last=Molotsky|first=Irvin|title=One Tough Bird, After All; How Public Broadcasting Survived the Attacks Of Conservatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/27/arts/one-tough-bird-after-all-public-broadcasting-survived-attacks-conservatives.html?pagewanted=print&src=pm|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 November 1997}}</ref>

In 1994, Schorr narrated the TV miniseries, ''Watergate''. In the late 1990s, he appeared briefly as a newscaster in three Hollywood movies: ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'' (1995), ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (1997), and ''[[The Siege]]'' (1998).  In ''The Game'', Schorr appeared as himself as an agent of an organization that interferes with the main character's life. He also appeared as himself in the [[docufiction]] film ''[[World War III (film)|World War Three]]'' that presented an alternative ending to the USA/USSR Cold War.

Schorr was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.

==Other==
Though not a fan of [[rock music]], Schorr became friends with composer [[Frank Zappa]] after the latter contacted him, asking for help with a [[voter registration]] drive. Schorr made an appearance with Zappa on February 10, 1988, where he sang "[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]" and "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]".<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128738162 NPR.org – "Daniel Schorr And Frank Zappa Were Friends. Really." ]</ref> Schorr delivered the eulogy on NPR after Zappa's death on December 4, 1993; he professed not to understand Zappa's lengthy discourses on [[music theory]], but he found a kindred spirit—a serious man with a commitment to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

About 20 years after Nixon's resignation, Schorr attended a dinner where Nixon spoke about the Soviet Union. After the dinner ended, Schorr walked up to Nixon and said, "Mr. Nixon, I'm not sure you'll remember me." Nixon replied, "Dan Schorr, damn near hired you once."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128725726 |title=NPR's 'Voice Of Experience,' Daniel Schorr, Dies |author= Michele Norris |author2= Robert Siegel |name-list-style= amp|date= 23 July 2010 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=NPR |accessdate= 2010-10-14}}</ref>

==Death==
Schorr died from an apparent "short illness" on July 23, 2010, at a [[Washington, D.C.]] hospital. He was 93 years old. Schorr's last broadcast commentary for [[NPR]] aired on Saturday, July 10, 2010 (on ''[[Weekend Edition]]'').<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name=wpobit>
