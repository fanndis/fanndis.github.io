{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
A '''weapon of mass destruction''' ('''WMD''') is a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Radiological weapon|radiological]], [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological agent|biological]], or any other [[weapon]] that can kill and bring significant harm to numerous humans or cause great damage to human-made structures (e.g., buildings), natural structures (e.g., mountains), or the [[biosphere]]. The scope and usage of the term has evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than technically. Originally coined in reference to [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] with [[Explosive material#Chemical|chemical explosives]] during [[World War II]], it has later come to refer to large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[Radiological warfare|radiological]], or [[nuclear warfare]].

==Early uses of this term==
The first use of the term "weapon of mass destruction" on record is by [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in 1937 in reference to the aerial [[Bombing of Guernica|bombardment]] of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]], Spain:<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica 1952">{{cite web | title=Weapon of mass destruction - weaponry | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | date=1952-11-01 | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/weapon-of-mass-destruction | access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

At the time, [[nuclear weapons]] had not been developed. Japan conducted research on [[biological weapons]] (see [[Unit 731]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/japan/bw/ |title=Biological Weapons Program – Japan |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727172723/http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/japan/bw/ |archive-date=27 July 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> and [[chemical weapons]] had seen wide battlefield use in [[World War I]].

Following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] that ended [[World War II]] and during the [[Cold War]], the term came to refer more to non-[[conventional weapon]]s. The application of the term to specifically nuclear and [[radiological weapons]] is traced by [[William Safire]] to the Russian phrase "Оружие массового поражения" – ''oruzhiye massovogo porazheniya'' (weapon of mass destruction).<ref name="Safire 1998 NYT"/>

[[William Safire]] credits James Goodby (of the [[Brookings Institution]]) with tracing what he considers the earliest known English-language use soon after the nuclear bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] (although it is not quite verbatim): a communique from a 15 November 1945, meeting of [[Harry Truman]], [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Mackenzie King]] (probably drafted by [[Vannevar Bush]], as Bush claimed in 1970) referred to "weapons adaptable to mass destruction."<ref name="Safire 1998 NYT"/>

Safire says [[Bernard Baruch]] used that exact phrase in 1946 (in a speech at the United Nations probably written by [[Herbert Bayard Swope]]).<ref name="Safire 1998 NYT">{{cite web | last=Safire | first=William | title=On Language; Weapons of Mass Destruction | website=The New York Times | date=1998-04-19 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/magazine/on-language-weapons-of-mass-destruction.html | access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> The phrase found its way into the very first resolution the United Nations General assembly adopted in January 1946 in London, which used the wording "the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other weapons adaptable to mass destruction."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/ |title=UNODA – Nuclear Weapons Home |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=14 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606182235/http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/ |archive-date=6 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The resolution also created the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (predecessor of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]]).<ref name="UN_ARES1I">{{UN document |docid=A-RES-1(I) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=1 |resolution_number=1 |accessdate=2010-06-18|date=24 January 1946|title=Establishment of a Commission to Deal with the Problems Raised by the Discovery of Atomic Energy}}</ref>

An exact use of this term was given in a lecture "[[nuclear reaction|Atomic Energy]] as an Atomic Problem" by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. He delivered the lecture to the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] and the [[State Department]], on 17 September 1947; it is reprinted in ''The Open Mind'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1955).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

<blockquote>It is a very far reaching control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field, which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another, which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack, and presumably therefore before any attack with weapons of mass destruction, and which would go a long way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers.<ref name="Pais Crease 2007 p. 158">{{cite book | last1=Pais | first1=A. | last2=Crease | first2=R.P. | title=J.

The term was also used in the introduction to the hugely influential U.S. government document known as [[NSC 68]] written in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68.htm |title=NSC-68 United States Objectives and Programs for National Security |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024031912/http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68.htm |archive-date=24 October 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

An early use of the exact phrase in an [[international treaty]] is in the [[Outer Space Treaty]] of 1967, but the treaty provides no definition of the phrase,<ref>{{citation|title=Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Art.

===Evolution of its use===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "weapons of mass destruction" was primarily a reference to nuclear weapons. At the time, in the [[Western world#Modern political|West]] the euphemism "[[Strategic nuclear weapon|strategic weapons]]" was used to refer to the American nuclear arsenal. However, there is no precise definition of the "strategic" category, neither considering range nor [[nuclear weapon yield|yield of the nuclear weapon]].<ref name=e>{{cite book|title=Tactical nuclear weapons : emergent threats in an evolving security environment.|year=2003|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-57488-585-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7VOWkKMTjsC&q=Defensive%20Use%20of%20Tactical%20Nuclear%20Weapons&pg=PA7|edition=1.|editor=Brian Alexander, Alistair Millar|accessdate=22 March 2011|page=7}}</ref>

Subsequent to [[Operation Opera]], the destruction of a pre-operational nuclear reactor inside Iraq by the Israeli Air Force in 1981, the Israeli prime minister, [[Menachem Begin]], countered criticism by saying that "on no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction against the people of Israel." This policy of pre-emptive action against real or perceived weapons of mass destruction became known as the [[Begin Doctrine]].<ref name="NTI/Isr">[http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/israel/nuclear/ Country Profiles -Israel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006135509/http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/israel/nuclear/ |date=2014-10-06 }}, [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (NTI), updated May, 2014</ref>

The term "weapons of mass destruction" continued to see periodic use, usually in the context of nuclear [[arms control]]; [[Ronald Reagan]] used it during the 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit]], when referring to the 1967 [[Outer Space Treaty]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/documents/reykjavik/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518185704/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/documents/reykjavik/ |archivedate=18 May 2008 |title=CNN Cold War – Historical Documents: Reagan-Gorbachev transcripts |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Reagan's successor, [[George H.W.

The end of the Cold War reduced U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, causing it to shift its focus to disarmament. With the 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]], Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs became a particular concern of the first [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush Administration]].<ref name="newyorkt">{{cite news|author=MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD1130F933A0575AC0A966958260 |title=Confrontation in the Gulf; U.S. Explores New Strategies to Limit Weapons of Mass Destruction – |location=IRAQ |work=The New York Times|date=30 September 1990 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Following the war, [[Bill Clinton]] and other western politicians and media continued to use the term, usually in reference to ongoing attempts to dismantle [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's weapons programs]].<ref name="newyorkt"/>

After the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, an increased fear of nonconventional weapons and [[asymmetric warfare]] took hold in many countries. The fear reached a crescendo with the 2002 [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] and the [[Niger uranium forgeries|alleged existence]] of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that became the primary justification for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]; however, American forces found none in Iraq. They found old stockpiles of chemical munitions including [[sarin]] and [[sulfur mustard|mustard agents]], but all were considered to be unusable because of corrosion or degradation.<ref>[http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,103631,00.html?ESRC=coastgnews.RSS ''Munitions Found in Iraq Meet WMD Criteria''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001050011/http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,103631,00.html?ESRC=coastgnews.RSS |date=1 October 2012 }}, Military.com, report filed by American Forces Press Service, 29 June 2006</ref> Iraq, however, declared a chemical weapons stockpile in 2009 which U.N. personnel had secured after the 1991 Gulf War.

==Definitions of the term==

===United States===

====Strategic definition====
The most widely used definition of "weapons of mass destruction" is that of [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]], [[biological weapons|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] (NBC) although there is no [[treaty]] or customary [[international law]] that contains an authoritative definition. Instead, international law has been used with respect to the specific categories of weapons within WMD, and not to WMD as a whole. While nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are regarded as the three major types of WMDs,<ref name = WMD>{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Laura|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/pawss/weapons-of-mass-destruction|website=Hampshire College|publisher=Hampshire College|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802093743/https://www.hampshire.edu/pawss/weapons-of-mass-destruction|archive-date=2 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> some analysts have argued that radiological materials as well as missile technology and delivery systems such as aircraft and ballistic missiles could be labeled as WMDs as well.<ref name=WMD/>

However, there is an argument that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong in the same category as chemical and "[[dirty bomb]]" radiological weapons, which have limited destructive potential (and close to none, as far as property is concerned), whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material, and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The NBC definition has also been used in official U.S. documents, by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nti.org/f_wmd411/f1a1_letter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402124051/http://nti.org/f_wmd411/f1a1_letter.html |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_presidential_documents&docid=pd14my01_txt-9.pdf |title=Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents Volume 37, Issue 19 (May 14, 2001) |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=14 May 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the [[CIA|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency]],<ref>[http://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2003.htm CIA Site Redirect{{spaced ndash}}Central Intelligence Agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011442/https://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2003.htm|date=4 October 2006}}</ref> the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/prolif97/message.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001050843/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/prolif97/message.html |archivedate=1 October 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/ptr20010110.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601034146/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/ptr20010110.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2006 }}</ref> and the [[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=gao&docid=f:d01582.pdf |title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: State Department Oversight of Science Centers Program |accessdate=5 August 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Other documents expand the definition of WMD to also include radiological or [[conventional weapon]]s. The [[US military|U.S. military]] refers to WMD as:
{{quote|Chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from the weapon.

The significance of the words ''separable and divisible part of the weapon'' is that missiles such as the [[Pershing II]] and the [[SCUD]] are considered weapons of mass destruction, while aircraft capable of carrying bombloads are not.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2004, the United Kingdom's [[Butler Review]] recognized the "considerable and long-standing academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase 'weapons of mass destruction{{'"}}. The committee set out to avoid the general term but when using it, employed the definition of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]], which defined the systems which Iraq was required to abandon:{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* "Nuclear weapons or nuclear-weapons-usable material or any sub-systems or components or any research, development, support or manufacturing facilities relating to [nuclear weapons].
* Chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research, development, support and manufacturing facilities.
* Ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and related major parts, and repair and production facilities."<ref>''[http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/butlerreview/report/index.asp Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction: Report of a Committee of Privy Counsellors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131809/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/butlerreview/report/index.asp |date=16 July 2011 }}'' (HC 898), London: The Stationery Office, 2004, §14.</ref>

Chemical weapons expert Gert G. Harigel considers only nuclear weapons true weapons of mass destruction, because "only nuclear weapons are completely indiscriminate by their explosive power, heat radiation and radioactivity, and only they should therefore be called a weapon of mass destruction". He prefers to call chemical and biological weapons "weapons of terror" when aimed against civilians and "weapons of intimidation" for soldiers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Testimony of one such soldier expresses the same viewpoint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/other/nbc.htm |title=A Soldier's Viewpoint on Surviving Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Attacks |publisher=Sightm1911.com |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901234629/http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/other/nbc.htm |archive-date=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> For a period of several months in the winter of 2002–2003, [[US Deputy Secretary of Defense|U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]] frequently used the term "weapons of mass terror", apparently also recognizing the distinction between the psychological and the physical effects of many things currently falling into the WMD category.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Gustavo Bell Lemus]], the Vice President of [[Colombia]], at 9 July 2001 [[United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms]] and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, quoted the [[Millennium Report]] of the [[Secretary General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], in which [[Kofi Annan]] said that [[small arms]] could be described as WMD because the fatalities they cause "dwarf that of all other weapons systems – and in most years greatly exceed the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/cab/smallarms/statements/colombiaE.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902003808/http://disarmament.un.org/cab/smallarms/statements/colombiaE.html |archivedate=2 September 2007 |title=Colombia |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>

An additional condition often implicitly applied to WMD is that the use of the weapons must be strategic. In other words, they would be designed to "have consequences far outweighing the size and effectiveness of the weapons themselves".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311090139/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1013136.ece What makes a weapon one of mass destruction? – Times Online]</ref> The strategic nature of WMD also defines their function in the military doctrine of [[total war]] as targeting the means a country would use to support and supply its war effort, specifically its population, industry, and natural resources.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Within U.S. [[civil defense]] organizations, the category is now '''Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)''', which defines WMD as:

===Nuclear weapons===
{{Main|List of countries with nuclear weapons}}
[[File:US nuclear warheads 1945-2002 graph.png|thumb|[[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear warheads]], 1945–2002]]
The only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war is the [[The United States and weapons of mass destruction|United States]], which [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped two atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II.

There are eight countries that have declared they possess nuclear weapons and are known to have tested a nuclear weapon, only five of which are members of the NPT. The eight are [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction|China]], [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]], [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Russia]], the [[The United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction|United Kingdom]], and the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|United States]].<ref>{{cite web |title=6. World nuclear forces |url=https://sipri.org/yearbook/2019/06/ |website=www.sipri.org}}</ref>
[[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel]] is considered by most analysts to have nuclear weapons numbering in the low hundreds as well, but maintains an official policy of nuclear ambiguity, neither denying nor confirming its nuclear status.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa]] developed a small nuclear arsenal in the 1980s but disassembled them in the early 1990s, making it the only country to have fully given up an independently developed nuclear weapons arsenal. [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Ukraine]] inherited stockpiles of nuclear arms following the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]], but relinquished them to the Russian Federation.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Countries where nuclear weapons are deployed through [[nuclear sharing]] agreements include Belgium, [[Germany and weapons of mass destruction|Germany]], Italy, the [[Netherlands and weapons of mass destruction|Netherlands]], and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/nato-nuclear-disarmament/|title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe {{!}} NATO Nuclear Weapons Policy {{!}} NTI|website=nti.org|access-date=2019-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107233042/https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/nato-nuclear-disarmament/|archive-date=7 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Chemical weapons===
{{main|Chemical warfare}}
{{CW Proliferation}}
Chemical weapons have been used around the world by various civilizations since ancient times. In the industrial era, they were used extensively by both sides during [[Chemical weapons in World War I|World War I]], and by the Axis powers during [[World War II]] (both in battle and in extermination camp [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]) though Allied powers also stockpiled them. Countries in Western Europe renounced the use of such weapons. As of 2018, a handful of countries have known inventories, and many are in the process of being safely destroyed under the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Nonetheless, proliferation and use in war zones remains an active concern, most recently the [[use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War]].

==Ethics and international legal status==
Some commentators classify some or all the uses of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons during wartime as a [[war crime]] (or [[crime against humanity]] if widespread) because they kill civilians (who are protected by the [[laws of war]]) indiscriminately or are specifically prohibited by international treaties (which have become more comprehensive over time).<ref>See [[List of weapons of mass destruction treaties]].</ref> Proponents of use say that specific uses of such weapons have been necessary for defense or to avoid more deaths in a protracted war.<ref>See [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] for various perspectives on the only combat use of nuclear weapons. The [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] sentenced some members of the Japanese army to jail terms for the use of biological and chemical weapons during World War II. The [[Halabja poison gas attack]] was determined a war crime by Dutch and Iraqi courts, resulting in the execution of [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]].</ref> The tactic of [[terror bombing]] from aircraft, and generally [[Aerial bombing of cities|targeting cities]] with [[area bombardment]] or saturation [[carpet bombing]] has also been criticized, defended, and prohibited by treaty in the same way; the destructive effect of conventional saturation bombing is similar to that of a nuclear weapon.<ref>See [[Aerial bombardment and international law]].</ref><ref>The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]] in particular has been referred to as mass murder: Volkery, Carsten.

==United States politics==
Due to the potentially indiscriminate effects of WMD, the fear of a WMD attack has shaped political policies and campaigns, fostered social movements, and has been the central theme of many films. Support for different levels of WMD development and control varies nationally and internationally. Yet understanding of the nature of the threats is not high, in part because of imprecise usage of the term by politicians and the media.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Blueprint abomb.JPG|thumb|210x210px|An atomic-bomb blueprint]]

Fear of WMD, or of threats diminished by the possession of WMD, has long been used to catalyze public support for various WMD policies. They include mobilization of pro- and anti-WMD campaigners alike, and generation of popular political support.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The term WMD may be used as a powerful [[buzzword]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thornwalker.com/ditch/dtw_wmd.htm |title=David T.

A television commercial called ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy]]'', promoting Democrat [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s 1964 [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|presidential candidacy]], invoked the fear of a nuclear war and was an element in Johnson's subsequent election.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines a weapon of mass destruction as: "a weapon that can cause widespread destruction or kill large numbers of people, especially a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=weapon+of+mass+destruction&submit.x=51&submit.y=20 |title=''American Heritage Dictionary'': "Weapon of mass destruction" |access-date=24 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904054206/https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=weapon+of+mass+destruction&submit.x=51&submit.y=20 |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In other words, it does not have to be nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC).

==Media coverage==
In 2004, the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) released a report<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cissm.umd.edu/documents/WMDstudy_full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-02 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022050812/http://www.cissm.umd.edu/documents/WMDstudy_full.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2004}} by Prof. Susan Moeller</ref> examining the media's coverage of WMD issues during three separate periods: [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapons tests]] by India and Pakistan in May 1998; the U.S. announcement of evidence of a [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear weapons program]] in October 2002; and revelations about [[Iran's nuclear program]] in May 2003. The CISSM report argues that poor coverage resulted less from political [[Media bias|bias among the media]] than from tired journalistic conventions. The report's major findings were that:{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
# Most media outlets represented WMD as a monolithic menace, failing to adequately distinguish between weapons programs and actual weapons or to address the real differences among chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological weapons.
# Most journalists accepted the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] formulation of the "[[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]" as a campaign against WMD, in contrast to coverage during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] era, when many journalists made careful distinctions between acts of terrorism and the acquisition and use of WMD.
# Many stories stenographically reported the incumbent administration's perspective on WMD, giving too little critical examination of the way officials framed the events, issues, threats, and policy options.
# Too few stories proffered alternative perspectives to official line, a problem exacerbated by the [[journalism|journalistic]] prioritizing of breaking-news stories and the "[[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]" style of storytelling.

The study focused on populations in two [[Coalition of the willing|coalition]] countries (Australia and the United States) and one opposed to the war (Germany). Results showed that U.S. citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD, even following disconfirmation; Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions. Dependence on the initial source of information led to a substantial minority of Americans exhibiting [[false memories|false memory]] that WMD were indeed discovered, while they were not. This led to three conclusions:
# The repetition of tentative news stories, even if they are subsequently disconfirmed, can assist in the creation of false memories in a substantial proportion of people.
# Once information is published, its subsequent correction does not alter people's beliefs unless they are suspicious about the motives underlying the events the news stories are about.
# When people ignore corrections, they do so irrespective of how certain they are that the corrections occurred.

A poll conducted between June and September 2003 asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq since the war ended. They were also asked which media sources they relied upon. Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news, and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Based on a series of polls taken from June–September 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/IraqMedia_Oct03/IraqMedia_Oct03_rpt.pdf |title=''Misperceptions, the Media and the Iraq War'' |accessdate=2009-10-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210232719/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/IraqMedia_Oct03/IraqMedia_Oct03_rpt.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2006}}, PIPA, 2 October 2003</ref>

In 2006, Fox News reported the claims of two Republican lawmakers that WMDs had been found in Iraq,<ref>
{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200499,00.html|title=Report: Hundreds of WMDs Found in Iraq|publisher=Fox News|date=22 June 2006|access-date=30 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424081106/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C200499%2C00.html|archive-date=24 April 2008|url-status=dead}}
</ref> based upon unclassified portions of a report by the [[National Ground Intelligence Center]]. Quoting from the report, Senator [[Rick Santorum]] said "Since 2003, coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent". According to David Kay, who appeared before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee to discuss these badly corroded munitions, they were leftovers, many years old, improperly stored or destroyed by the Iraqis.<ref>Kay, David. "House Armed Services Committee Hearing", 29 June 2006</ref> Charles Duelfer agreed, stating on NPR's ''Talk of the Nation'': "When I was running the ISG – the Iraq Survey Group – we had a couple of them that had been turned in to these IEDs, the improvised explosive devices. But they are local hazards. They are not a major, you know, weapon of mass destruction."<ref>Duelfer, Charles.

Later, wikileaks would show that WMDs of these kinds continued to be found as the Iraqi occupation continued.<ref>{{cite web |first=Noah |last=Shachtman |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/wikileaks-show-wmd-hunt-continued-in-iraq-with-surprising-results/ |title=WikiLeaks Show WMD Hunt Continued in Iraq – With Surprising Results |website=Wired.com |date=23 October 2010 |access-date=12 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324160659/http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/wikileaks-show-wmd-hunt-continued-in-iraq-with-surprising-results |archive-date=24 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Many news agencies, including Fox News, reported the conclusions of the [[CIA]] that, based upon the investigation of the [[Iraq Survey Group]], WMDs are yet to be found in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7634313|title=CIA's Final Report: No WMD Found in Iraq|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=25 April 2005|access-date=1 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,154574,00.html|title=Iraq WMD Inspectors End Search, Find Nothing|publisher=Fox News|date=26 April 2005|access-date=24 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805083349/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,154574,00.html|archive-date=5 August 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Public perceptions==
Awareness and opinions of WMD have varied during the course of their history. Their threat is a source of unease, security, and pride to different people. The anti-WMD movement is embodied most in [[nuclear disarmament]], and led to the formation of the British [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1957.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Anti-nuclear weapons protest, UK 1980.JPG|thumb|[[Nuclear disarmament|Anti-nuclear weapons]] protest march in Oxford, 1980]]

In order to increase awareness of all kinds of WMD, in 2004 the nuclear physicist and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Joseph Rotblat]] inspired the creation of The WMD Awareness Programme<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090626122429/http://www.wmdawareness.org.uk/ wmdawareness.org.uk]</ref> to provide trustworthy and up to date information on WMD worldwide.

In 1998 [[University of New Mexico]]'s [[Institute for Public Policy]] released their third report<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/usa/1998/980803-nuclear.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories – News Releases |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318022155/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/usa/1998/980803-nuclear.htm |archive-date=18 March 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> on U.S. perceptions – including the general public, politicians and scientists – of nuclear weapons since the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]]. Risks of nuclear conflict, proliferation, and terrorism were seen as substantial.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

While maintenance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was considered above average in importance, there was widespread support for a reduction in the stockpile, and very little support for developing and testing new nuclear weapons.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Also in 1998, but after the UNM survey was conducted, nuclear weapons became an issue in India's election of March,<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/chron.htm |title=17 Days in May – India Nuclear Forces |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824110510/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/chron.htm |archive-date=24 August 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> in relation to political tensions with neighboring [[Pakistan]]. Prior to the election the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) announced it would "declare India a nuclear weapon state" after coming to power.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

BJP won the elections, and on 14 May, three days after India tested nuclear weapons for the second time, a public opinion poll reported that a majority of Indians favored the country's nuclear build-up.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

On 15 April 2004, the [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) reported<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929024408/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2005 |title=The Pipa/Knowledge Networks Poll |date=29 September 2005 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> that U.S. citizens showed high levels of concern regarding WMD, and that preventing the [[Nuclear proliferation|spread of nuclear weapons]] should be "a very important U.S. foreign policy goal", accomplished through multilateral arms control rather than the use of military threats.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A majority also believed the United States should be more forthcoming with its biological research and its [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] commitment of nuclear arms reduction.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A Russian opinion poll conducted on 5 August 2005 indicated half the population believes new nuclear powers have the right to possess nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web |author=Russian public opinion on nuclear weapons |url=http://russianforces.org/eng/blog/archive/000580.shtml |title=Russian public opinion on nuclear weapons – Blog – Russian strategic nuclear forces |publisher=Russianforces.org |date=5 August 2005 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216073301/http://russianforces.org/eng/blog/archive/000580.shtml |archive-date=16 February 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> 39% believes the Russian stockpile should be reduced, though not fully eliminated.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Weapons of mass destruction in popular culture}}

Weapons of mass destruction and their related impacts have been a mainstay of [[popular culture]] since the beginning of the [[Cold War]], as both political commentary and humorous outlet. The actual phrase "weapons of mass destruction" has been used similarly and as a way to characterise any powerful force or product since the Iraqi weapons crisis in the lead up to the Coalition invasion of Iraq in 2003.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Radioactive weaponry/hazard symbol===
[[File:Radiation warning symbol.svg|left|65px|Radioactivity]]
[[File:Logo iso radiation.svg|thumb|right|2007 ISO [[radioactivity]] danger symbol.]]
The international radioactivity symbol (also known as [[trefoil]]) first appeared in 1946, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Radiation Laboratory. At the time, it was rendered as [[magenta]], and was set on a blue background.<ref name="Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)">{{cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)|access-date=13 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229090503/http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|archive-date=29 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

It is drawn with a central circle of radius ''R'', the blades having an internal radius of 1.5''R'' and an external radius of 5''R'', and separated from each other by 60°.<ref name="Biohazard and radioactive Symbol, design and proportions">{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |title=Biohazard and radioactive Symbol, design and proportions |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231181252/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |archivedate=31 December 2013 }}
</ref> It is meant to represent a radiating atom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Sign (Trefoil)|website=orau.org|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] found that the trefoil radiation symbol is unintuitive and can be variously interpreted by those uneducated in its meaning; therefore, its role as a hazard warning was compromised as it did not clearly indicate "danger" to many non-Westerners and children who encountered it. As a result of research, a new radiation hazard symbol (ISO 21482) was developed in 2007 to be placed near the most dangerous parts of radiation sources featuring a skull, someone running away, and using a red rather than yellow background.<ref>Linda Lodding, "[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf Drop it and Run! New Symbol Warns of Radiation Dangers and Aims to Save Lives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120125920/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf |date=20 January 2012 }}," ''IAEA Bulletin'' 482 (March 2007): 70–72.</ref>

The red background is intended to convey urgent danger, and the sign is intended to be used on equipment where very strong ionizing radiation can be encountered if the device is dismantled or otherwise tampered with. The intended use of the sign is not in a place where the normal user will see it, but in a place where it will be seen by someone who has started to dismantle a radiation-emitting device or equipment. The aim of the sign is to warn people such as scrap metal workers to stop work and leave the area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2007/radiationsymbol.html |title=IAEA news release Feb 2007 |access-date=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217075115/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html |archive-date=17 February 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Biological weaponry/hazard symbol===
[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|left|65px|Biohazard]]

Developed by Dow Chemical company in the 1960s for their containment products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Biohazard Symbol History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213165520/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/biosafetyresources/history-of-biohazard-symbol.htm|archivedate=13 February 2012}}</ref>

According to Charles Dullin, an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development:<ref name="Biohazard and radioactive Symbol, design and proportions"/>
