On January 16, 2020, Comcast announced that Peacock would [[soft launch]] for [[Xfinity]] cable and broadband customers on April 15, 2020, before launching nationally on July 15, 2020.<ref name="variety-peacock-pricing">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/nbc-peacock-pricing-launch-date-1203469722/|title=NBCU's Peacock Pricing and Launch Date Announced|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2020-01-16|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-date=2020-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713130207/https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/nbc-peacock-pricing-launch-date-1203469722/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Distribution==
Peacock has three tiers of service: Free, Premium, and Premium Plus. The Free tier has a subset of the content of the upper two tiers and targets its users with [[advertising]]. The middle tier, Peacock Premium, has the advertising as well but provides the full library of content. In both ad-supported tiers, commercials are limited to five minutes per hour. The upper tier, Peacock Premium Plus, provides the full library without ads. Peacock Free is available at no charge to all U.S. Internet users. Peacock Premium is available as a monthly subscription but also is included in some services from TV service providers including Xfinity and [[Cox Communications|Cox]]. Subscribers to Peacock Premium, whether subscribing directly or receiving service through a provider, can upgrade to the ad-free service, Peacock Premium Plus, for an additional monthly cost.<ref name="variety-peacock-pricing" />

On May 6, 2020, a distribution deal with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] was announced. As part of the deal, Peacock will be available on [[iOS devices]] and [[Apple TV]] on launch.  Furthermore, content from both Peacock tiers will be listed in the [[Apple TV app]] and users from Apple devices will have the ability to subscribe to Peacock Premium with an in-app purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NBC's Peacock streaming service will be available in the Apple TV app at launch|url=https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/06/nbc-peacock-apple-tv-integration/|last=Potuck|first=Michael|date=2020-05-06|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-13|archive-date=2020-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510054125/https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/06/nbc-peacock-apple-tv-integration/|url-status=live}}</ref> On July 20, the service became available on [[PlayStation 4]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=2020-07-14|title=Peacock’s Free Tier To Include 13,000 Hours Of Programming; Sony PlayStation Distribution Deal Widens Reach|url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/peacock-13000-hours-programming-free-tier-sony-playstation-distribution-deal-set-1202985118/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714155119/https://deadline.com/2020/07/peacock-13000-hours-programming-free-tier-sony-playstation-distribution-deal-set-1202985118/|archive-date=2020-07-14|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Deadline|language=en}}</ref>

The service is drawn primarily from the NBCUniversal library, including subsidiaries such as [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Universal Television]].
