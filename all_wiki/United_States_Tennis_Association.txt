The '''United States Tennis Association''' ('''USTA''') is the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[tennis in the United States]]. A not-for-profit organization with more than 700,000 members, it invests 100% of its proceeds to promote and develop the growth of tennis, from the grass-roots to the professional levels. The association was created to standardize rules and regulations and to promote and develop the growth of tennis in the [[United States]].

The USTA runs the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] which hosts the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] every year.

The USTA has leagues in most places for adults skill levels between beginner and pro. The USTA also hosts tournaments across the country every weekend for club players or professionals.

==History==
The USTA was previously known as the '''United States National Lawn Tennis Association''' (USNLTA) and was established in 1881 by a small group of tennis club members in [[New York City]]. In 1920 the word 'National' was dropped from the organization's name.<ref>{{cite web|title=USTA name changes: All for good grammar|url=http://www.usta.com/About-USTA/Organization/History/USTA_name_change/|publisher=USTA|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Warren Kimball}}</ref> In 1975, the word "Lawn" was officially dropped from the name.<ref>{{Cite web|title=USTA History|url=https://www.usta.com/en/home/about-usta/usta-history/national/usta-history.html|access-date=2020-08-15|website=www.usta.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Organization==
The USTA has 17 geographical sections with more than 700,000 individual members and 7,000 organizational members, and a professional staff. The USTA (B) is located in White Plains, NY. The (A) team is located at the National Campus located in Orlando, FL.<ref name="USTA" />

==NTRP Ratings==
The USTA (along with the USPTA) created the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP) or more commonly NTRP ratings to place players into various skill levels. NTRP ratings range from the beginner 1.5 with .5 increments all the way up to 7.0 or world-class players. NTRP ratings are used in the leagues and tournaments to help provide more compatible matches. At the end of each calendar year, the USTA calculates and publishes everyone's year-end rating online (http://tennislink.usta.com). Ratings are calculated using a computer algorithm that adjusts ratings based on how actual outcomes compare to expected outcomes for each match. Expected outcomes are determined based on the difference between the ratings in hundredths of the players on the court. How many matches you've won and if it was a singles or doubles match is not a part of the calculation. New players or anyone with an expired NTRP rating go through the self-rate process to determine their entry point. Specific answers to a series of questions allow the computer to provide a suggested rating for players to start.

==Programs==
The USTA hosts adult tournaments in most cities with populations over 150,000 people. Leagues for adults with ratings ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 are organized in the Spring and/or Fall. In most areas, the adult seasons consist of singles, doubles, and  [[mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] leagues in the Spring. Fewer cities have Fall leagues for singles and/or alternate league types such as "combo", "mixed combo", or "tri-level". 

In most states, there are between one and five tournaments each weekend. Adults with a 3.0 to 4.5 rating can usually play in these tournaments. 
 
Leagues include: 10 and under; Juniors; Adults 18-40; and Adults 40 or older. Anyone over 40 may request placement in the 18-40 league.

It was retired in 1989.
* Colonel James H. Bishop Award - The Colonel James H. Bishop Award was presented annually at a place and time determined by the USTA [[Junior Davis Cup]] Committee Chairman to that U.S. Junior Davis Cup squad member who, in the opinion of the chairman and the team captains, best exemplified the objectives of the Junior Davis Cup Program in regard to highest standards of character, conduct, sportsmanship, appearance, amateurism on and off the tennis court, and tennis accomplishment.

Another basis for the award was the help a player renders not only to players in the recipient's own class but also to a lesser class and to junior players as well.

* Sarah Palfrey Danzig Award - The Sarah Palfrey Danzig Trophy was awarded to that female player who, by character, sportsmanship, manners, spirit of cooperation and contribution to the growth of the game, ranks first in the opinion of the selection committee. Another basis of the award was the help a player renders not only to players of her own class but also to players of a lesser class and to junior players. The award was the result of a suggestion by the late Mrs. Danzig that it was fitting and proper that there should be an award for women comparable to and with the same criteria as the William M. Johnston Award for men. To that end, she gave one of her national championship cups to the International Lawn Tennis Club of the United States to be used for this purpose. The name of the winner was engraved on the trophy, and a silver tray suitably inscribed was given to the recipient as a memento of the award. Awarded from 1986 through 2006.
