The '''2011 England riots''', more widely known as the '''London Riots''', were a series of [[riot]]s between 6 and 11 August 2011. Thousands of people rioted in cities and towns across [[England]], which saw [[looting]], [[arson]], as well as mass deployment of police and the deaths of five people.

Protests started in [[Tottenham]], [[London]], following the [[Shooting of Mark Duggan|death of Mark Duggan]], a local man who was shot dead by police on 4 August.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14434318 |title=Riots in Tottenham after Mark Duggan shooting protest |work=BBC News |date=7 August 2011 |access-date=30 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119014842/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14434318 |archive-date=19 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several violent clashes with police followed Duggan's death, along with the destruction of police vehicles, a [[double-decker bus]] and many homes and businesses, thus rapidly gaining attention from the media. Overnight, looting took place in [[Tottenham Hale]] retail park and nearby [[Wood Green]]. The following days saw similar scenes in other parts of London, with the worst rioting taking place in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Brixton]], [[Walthamstow]], [[Peckham]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Battersea]], [[Croydon]], [[Ealing]], [[Barking, London|Barking]], [[Woolwich]], [[Lewisham]] and [[East Ham]].

From 8 to 10 August, other towns and cities in England (including [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Coventry]], [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[West Bromwich]], and [[Wolverhampton]]) saw what was described by the media as "copycat violence", with [[social media]] playing a role. By 10 August, more than 3,003 arrests had been made across England, with more than 1,984 people issued with criminal charges for various offences related to the riots.<ref>{{cite web |title=England rioters 'poorer, younger, less educated' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720 |website=BBC News |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=London riots: More than 3,000 arrested |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-15611395 |website=BBC News |date=7 November 2011 |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref><ref name=bbc15Aug/> Initially, courts sat for extended hours.

An estimated £200 million worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity – which in many cases was already struggling due to [[Great Recession|the recession]] – was significantly compromised.

The riots have generated significant ongoing debate among political, social, and academic figures about the causes and context in which they happened. Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline, and the unemployment that decline had brought.<ref name="cnn_figures">{{cite news|title=Britain's rioters count cost of unrest as order restored|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/12/uk.riots|publisher=CNN|date=12 August 2011|access-date=12 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114142822/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/12/uk.riots/|archive-date=14 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="bbc15Aug">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14532532|title=England's week of riots|work=BBC News|date=15 August 2011|access-date=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623205000/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14532532|archive-date=23 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful">{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Tottenham riots: a peaceful protest, then suddenly all hell broke loose|work=The Guardian|access-date=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927020437/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="guardian-06-duggan">{{cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as protesters riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 August 2011|location=London|date=6 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927035838/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the shooting, the media widely reported that a bullet was found embedded in a police radio, implying that Duggan fired on the police.<ref name=Laville07 /> Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed.

On 13 August, the IPCC stated that Duggan did not open fire: "It seems possible that we may have verbally led journalists to [wrongly] believe that shots were exchanged." The bullet that had lodged in an officer's radio is believed to have been an [[overpenetration]], having passed through Duggan's body.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mark-duggan-did-not-fire-his-weapon-at-police/story-e6frg6so-1226111938756 "Mark Duggan did not fire his weapon at police"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810030025/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mark-duggan-did-not-fire-his-weapon-at-police/story-e6frg6so-1226111938756 |date=10 August 2011 }}, ''[[The Australian]]'', 10 August 2011.</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20130111160854/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/193718.html "Media misled on Mark Duggan death"], [[Press TV]], 13 August 2011.</ref>

At lunchtime on 6 August, a meeting was called by police between local community leaders, councillors and members of police advisory groups. In this meeting, police were warned several times that there could possibly be another riot similar to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985 if local concerns regarding the death were not addressed.<ref name="channel4ex">{{Cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|publisher=Channel 4|location=London|access-date=16 September 2011|date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909072458/http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented|archive-date=9 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="bbcreport">{{Cite news|last=Stephenson|first=Wesley|title=Tottenham police 'could have stopped riots'|publisher=BBC|location=London|access-date=16 September 2011|date=25 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14646187|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908192257/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14646187|archive-date=8 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The crowd stayed in front of the police station hours longer than they originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time.

Throughout the rioting, many of the rioters failed to cover their faces. Some posed for pictures with stolen goods, posting them on social-networking sites.<ref name="Tom de Castella & Caroline McClatchey">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14463452|title=UK riots: What turns people into looters?|access-date=10 August 2011|work=BBC News|date=9 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810052413/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14463452|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although London employs [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras to monitor crime and large events, reports indicate that citizen footage contributed more to capturing looters in action than the police force.<ref name="London and England riots: CCTV Pictures">{{cite news|title=London and England riots: CCTV pictures of suspects are released by the police|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8690951/London-riots-CCTV-pictures-of-suspects-are-released-by-the-Metropolitan-Police.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|access-date=17 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519065116/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8690951/London-riots-CCTV-pictures-of-suspects-are-released-by-the-Metropolitan-Police.html|archive-date=19 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Beyond the CCTV, looters were filmed and photographed with their faces visible.

Several interactive maps were implemented in the [[Google Maps]] website that showed satellite views of what was happening in the streets during the rioting. James Cridland, the managing director of the free media resources, created a Google Map that tracked verified locations of rioting.
[[Channel 4 News]] also had similar maps that progressively tracked the damage in the streets as well.<ref name="Interactive Maps reveal satellite's view of UK Riots">{{cite web|last=Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Interactive maps reveal satellite's view of UK riots|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|access-date=27 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508151113/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|archive-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> News channels also were able to utilise this public service to capture live footage on the streets and inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.

===BlackBerry Messenger===
[[File:Croydon Riots 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Stand-off between rioters and police in Croydon]]
There were reports that the [[BlackBerry Messenger]] service was used by looters to organise their activities, and that inflammatory and inaccurate accounts of Mark Duggan's killing on social media sites may have incited disturbances.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-tottenham-duggan-blog#block-61 |title=London riots – live blog |author=Paul Lewis |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=10 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407091111/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-tottenham-duggan-blog#block-61 |archive-date=7 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/08/london-riots-facebook-twitter-blackberry |title=London riots: how BlackBerry Messenger played a key role |author=Josh Halliday |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=10 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105100518/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/08/london-riots-facebook-twitter-blackberry |archive-date=5 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=G8AUG2011/> One of the many messages shared between users was the following:

===Twitter===
Much like BBM, activity on social media shaped the London riots. During the Tottenham riots of 1985, citizens had to head into a public place to voice their message.<ref name="Adams">{{cite news|last=Adams, Lee|first=William|title=London Riots: Organized via Twitter and Smart phones?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2087337,00.html|work=Time|date=8 August 2011|access-date=29 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402122353/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2087337,00.html|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Yet, with access to [[Twitter]] as a communication medium, social media was used to rapidly spread messages of the riots.<ref name="Adams"/>

Radio 4 criticised Twitter's contribution to the riots through greed and criminality.<ref name="Williams">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Olivia|title=London Riots: Twitter That Caused Them?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/08/london-riots-twitter-that_n_920791.html|publisher=The Huffington Post- Canada|date=8 August 2011|access-date=29 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422041808/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/08/london-riots-twitter-that_n_920791.html|archive-date=22 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The Daily Telegraph'' described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence.<ref name="Williams"/> Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content.<ref name="Tonkin">{{cite journal |last=Tonkin |first=Emma |author2=Heather D.

During the riots, Twitter accounted for four out of every 170 UK Internet visits on Monday 8 August. In addition, citizens also used Twitter to band together, after the destruction.
The aftermath of the riots resulted in a disrupted city, yet Twitter was further used to maintain peace, with hashtags including "#riotcleanup".<ref name="Tonkin"/> Evidence shows that people were tweeting and re-tweeting news related to the riots, not original content.<ref name="Tonkin"/>

===Mobile phones===
Other than BlackBerry Messenger and social networking sites, mobile phone operators T-Mobile and Orange prioritised police requests for information about the phones that were used to plan the riots that hit British cities. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]], phone companies were required to hand over data about the locations calls were made from, the owners of phones, and lists of calls made to and from a particular handset.<ref name="garside1"/>

Bowes was attacked by members of a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish a fire that had been [[arson|deliberately started]] in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack inflicted severe head injuries which resulted in a coma. The assault was caught on [[CCTV]] and reportedly filmed on mobile phones by associates of the alleged assailant.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes. A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes' wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him.

The effects of [[black people|black culture]] were discussed by historian [[David Starkey]] in the edition of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' TV programme of 12 August. Starkey singled out the influence of black [[gangsta rap|gangster and rap culture]] on youths of all races, contrasting contemporary [[Multicultural London English|youth patois]] with the speech patterns of black Tottenham MP [[David Lammy]], who, Starkey asserted, "sounded white". The author [[Dreda Say Mitchell]] countered his argument by saying that there is no one single "black culture".<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|title='The whites have become black' says David Starkey|publisher=BBC|access-date=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815022708/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Theatrical===
[[Tricycle Theatre|The Tricycle Theatre]] in Kilburn presented a piece of new writing, ''[[The Riots (2011 play)|The Riots]]'' by [[Gillian Slovo]], which looked into the events over those days in August and the thoughts and opinions of a range of people directly involved and politicians. It transferred to the [[Bernie Grant Arts Centre]] in Tottenham, about 400 m from where the Mark Duggan protest took place, on 5 January 2012, and was due to run until 15 January.
The piece attempts to show a non-biased look into the events, allowing audience members to hear different views into why it happened and what could have and should now be done. The piece includes community leaders Stafford Scott and Martin Sylvester Brown, police constables on duty that night and a former resident of the Carpet-Right building, the burned remains now providing a highly poignant reminder of the events.
They are combined with the views of [[Diane Abbott]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Gove]] and Pastor Nims Obunge. It was received well by all critics, with 4 stars from all major press including ''The Guardian''.<ref>[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/23/the-riots-tricycle-review "The Riots – review"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312072545/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/23/the-riots-tricycle-review |date=12 March 2017 }}.

==Suggested contributory factors==
The causes of the 2011 England riots both immediate and long-term have been the subject of media and academic debate. Several speculations have emerged as to what the likely contributory factors might be for the riots; from [[socio-economic]] causes focusing on unemployment and spending cuts, as well as [[social media]], [[gang culture]] and criminal opportunism. The House of Commons Home Affairs select committee will begin examining the police response to the riots in late 2011.

Researchers who study the causes of political instability suggest that the critical common factor is the density of youths. A nation's extent of political unrest, i.e. its vulnerability to riot, war or regime change, is directly associated with the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds in its population.
They argue that communities with more than 20% of individuals in this age group run the greatest risk of more frequent and more intense political instability. They describe the phenomena as the "[[Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]", where the "bulge" refers to the fattening of the population pyramid just before the base of the youngest age groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |title=On riots and youth bulges |work=Significance Magazine |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415203106/http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |archive-date=15 April 2013}}</ref>

===Rioting for fun===

Other academics have pointed to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the [[carnivalesque]] atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the [[University of Birmingham]] noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’<ref>[http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxyd.bham.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/09627251.2012.670998 "Panic on the streets of Birmingham? Struggles over space and belonging in the Revanchist City"], in ''Justice Matters'', Vol. 87, No. 1 (2012).</ref>

===Gang culture===
In a ''[[Newsnight]]'' discussion on 12 August, historian [[David Starkey]] blamed black gangster culture, saying that it had influenced youths of all races.<ref name="autogenerated4"/> The BBC received nearly 700 complaints about his statement that the "whites have become black".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14542240 | work=BBC News | title=Hundreds complain about David Starkey's race comments | date=16 August 2011 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123211523/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14542240 | archive-date=23 November 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref> Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argued that gangs were constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural and economic roots of youth violence.<ref name="Cottrell-Boyce">{{cite journal|last=Cottrell-Boyce|first=Joseph|title=Ending Gang and Youth Violence: A Critique|journal=Youth Justice|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–206|doi=10.1177/1473225413505382|s2cid=147163053}}</ref>

===Criminal opportunism===
During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said: "I think this is about sheer criminality. That is what we have seen on the streets. The violence we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it."<ref>{{cite news|title=Rioting spirals out of control |date=8 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604014910/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2012 }}</ref> Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots "recreational violence".<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|title=UK riots: 16,000 police on London streets|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698|date=9 August 2011|work=TVNZ|access-date=9 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811182640/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698 |archive-date=11 August 2011}}</ref> A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9572763.stm |title= Rioters revel in thrill of seizing Manchester streets|publisher=BBC News - Newsnight |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref>

The BBC reported that the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police had stated that he thought that the motivation for rioters targeting the city centre was not anger, but greed.<ref name="greed">{{cite news |title=How rioting spread around England |work=BBC News |date=9 August 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14466477 |access-date=9 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810053922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14466477 |archive-date=10 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Moral decay at the top===
''Daily Telegraph'' columnist [[Peter Oborne]] suggested that moral decay is just as bad at the top of society as it is at the bottom, with the rich and powerful generating anger among the British population. He cited the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs' expenses scandal]], [[bankers' bonuses]], and [[News International phone hacking scandal|the phone hacking scandal]] as setting poor examples.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The moral decay of our society is as bad at the top as the bottom |last=Oborne |first=Peter |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 August 2011 |access-date=20 August 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325141128/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom/ |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In ''[[The Financial Times]]'' cartoonist Ingram Pinn depicted a Union Flag being broken through by a looter in a [[hoodie]] carrying a stolen box of Adidas trainers, preceded by two men in suits carrying piles of cash, one saying "MP's Expenses" and another "Banker's Bonus".<ref>[http://domesticempire.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/broken-britain-riots/ "Broken Britain Riots"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023004350/http://domesticempire.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/broken-britain-riots/ |date=23 October 2013 }}, 16 August 2011.</ref>

===Failure of the penal system===
[[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]], writing in ''The Guardian'', described the riots in part as "an outburst of outrageous behaviour by the criminal classes". He drew attention to the statistic that almost three-quarters of the adults who had been charged with offences related to the disorder already had a criminal record.
Clarke characterised this as the legacy of "a broken penal system", one that did not have a good record for preventing reoffending. He stated he is proposing radical new measures intended to focus on robust punishment and on delivering reductions in reoffending.<ref name=G5SEP2011>{{cite news |title=Punish the feral rioters, but address our social deficit too |author=Kenneth Clarke |date=5 September 2011 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/05/punishment-rioters-help |access-date=6 September 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175102/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/05/punishment-rioters-help |archive-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Mainstream media relationship with the communities===
A conference held in November 2012 and its subsequent report by Dr Leah Bassel of the [[University of Leicester]], entitled ''Media and the Riots – A Call For Action'', examined the relationship between mainstream media and communities affected by the riots. It criticised the portrayal of young people in the media coverage, particularly young black people who were disproportionately singled out as being involved. It also criticised the press in spreading misinformation from unreliable sources and in particular disinformation emanating from the police.<ref>Roy Greenslade, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/31/london-riots-universityofleicester "What the media did wrong in the riots – and how to put it right"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407090956/https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/31/london-riots-universityofleicester |date=7 April 2017 }}, Greenslade Blog, ''The Guardian'', 31 July 2012.</ref><ref>[[Marc Wadsworth]], [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/media-coverage-2011-riots-was-disgraceful "Media Coverage Of 2011 Riots 'Was Disgraceful'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021073034/http://voice-online.co.uk/article/media-coverage-2011-riots-was-disgraceful |date=21 October 2012 }}, ''The Voice'', 10 June 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.the-latest.com/riots-and-media-report "Special report about media and the riots"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402203648/http://www.the-latest.com/riots-and-media-report |date=2 April 2013 }}, The-Latest.com.</ref>

Its findings also indicate a consensus among the research participants, who were all from the "riot-hit areas", that the UK general public perceive them, and the wider communities in which they live, through media's "riot discourse".<ref name=":0" />
