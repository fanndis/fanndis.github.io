''Gorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks for Himself''. Threshold Editions. Page 55.</ref>

=== Private law practice ===
Instead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now [[Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick]]), where he focused on trial work.<ref name=WashPo19Feb/> After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like [[Perry Mason]].<ref name=WashPo19Feb/> He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.<ref name="record">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6gziQydtBwC&pg=PA289 |journal=[[Congressional Record|Congressional Record—Senate]]|title=Neil M.

In 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a [[brief (law)|brief]] denouncing [[class action lawsuit]]s by [[shareholder]]s. In the case of ''[[Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.

While managing the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division]], Gorsuch was tasked with all the "terror litigation" arising from the president's [[War on Terror]], successfully defending the [[extraordinary rendition]] of [[Khalid El-Masri]], fighting the disclosure of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charlie Savage|author-link=Charlie Savage|title=Neil Gorsuch Helped Defend Disputed Bush-Era Terror Policies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-torture-guantanamo-bay.html|access-date=March 20, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2017|page=A13}}</ref>

=== Freedom of religion ===
Gorsuch advocates a broad definition of [[religious freedom]] that is inimical to Church–State separation advocates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boston|first=Rob|title=Here Are the Top Ten Church–State Stories from 2017|date=December 29, 2017|website=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]]|url=https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/here-are-the-top-ten-church-state-stories-from-2017|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mystal|first=Elie|title=Religious Freedom or Religious Preference?

In ''Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius'' (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the ''[[en banc]]'' circuit found the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]]'s [[contraceptive mandate]] on a private business violated the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].<ref>[http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol127_hobby_lobby_v_sebelius.pdf "Recent Cases: Tenth Circuit Holds For-Profit Corporate Plaintiffs Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Substantial Burden on Religious Claim"], 127 Harv.

In ''[[Pleasant Grove City v. Summum]]'' (2007), he joined Judge [[Michael W. McConnell]]'s dissent from the denial of rehearing ''en banc'', taking the view that the government's display of a donated [[Ten Commandments]] monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11201980830835927462&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Summum v.

=== Administrative law ===
Gorsuch has called for reconsideration of ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In ''Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch'' (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frankel|first1=Allison|title=Is court deference to federal agencies unconstitutional? 10th Circuit judge thinks so.|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2016/08/24/is-court-deference-to-federal-agencies-unconstitutional-10th-circuit-judge-thinks-so|access-date=February 2, 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=August 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11495806271514705762&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Gutierrez-Brizuela v.

Alone, Gorsuch added a [[concurring opinion]], criticizing ''Chevron'' deference and ''[[National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services]]'' (2005) as an "abdication of judicial duty", writing that deference is "more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design".<ref name=adler>{{cite news|title=Should Chevron be reconsidered?

In ''United States v. Hinckley'' (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the [[Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act]] likely violates the [[nondelegation doctrine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=United States of America v.

=== Interstate commerce ===
Gorsuch has been an opponent of the [[dormant Commerce Clause]], which allows state laws to be declared [[unconstitutional]] if they too greatly burden [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the [[Oklahoma Water Resources Board]] from blocking water exports to Texas.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14230952523000160341&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Tarrant Regional Water Dist. v.

In 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's [[internet sales tax]].<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18239842970690567961&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&as_vis=1 ''Direct Marketing Ass'n v.

In ''Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel'' (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's [[Renewable portfolio standard|mandates for renewable energy]] did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2495362604998520278&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Energy and Environment Legal Institute v.

=== Campaign finance ===
In ''Riddle v. Hickenlooper'' (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Torres-Spelliscy|first1=Ciara|title=Neil Gorsuch Understands Campaign Finance — And That's The Problem|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/neil-gorsuch-understands-campaign-finance-and-thats-problem|access-date=June 15, 2020|work=[[Brennan Center for Justice]]|date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> Gorsuch added a concurrence where he noted that although the standard of review of [[campaign finance in the United States]] is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under [[intermediate scrutiny]].<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4536436223189820388&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Riddle v.

=== Civil rights ===
In ''[[Planned Parenthood]] v. [[Gary Herbert]]'' (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a rehearing ''en banc'' of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a [[Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy|video controversy]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Robert Barnes|title=Rulings offer glimpse into what kind of justice Gorsuch would be|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/rulings-offer-glimpse-into-what-kind-of-justice-gorsuch-would-be/2017/03/16/47e461be-081d-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html|access-date=March 20, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 18, 2017 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10813564172838744283&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v.

In ''A.M., on behalf of her minor child, F.M. v. Ann Holmes'' (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a [[New Mexico]] statute that makes it a [[misdemeanor]] to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal [[42 U.S.C. §&nbsp;1983]] (civil rights) action against school officials and the [[school resource officer]] who made the arrest, arguing that it was a [[false arrest]] that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed [[qualified immunity]] from suit.<ref name="fm">{{cite news|date=July 25, 2016|title=A.M., on behalf of her minor child, F.M. v.

=== Criminal law ===
In 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay [[restitution]] even after it missed a statutory deadline.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12419626530580981904&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''United States v.

In ''United States v. Games-Perez'' (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a [[felon]] owned a gun in violation of {{USC|18|922}}(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent. However, he filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: "The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in §§&nbsp;922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove [[mens rea]] here applies with full force."<ref>{{cite web|title=United States of America v. Miguel Games-Perez|url=http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/11/11-1011.pdf|publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]]|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> In the 2019 case ''[[Rehaif v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court overruled this decision with Gorsuch joining.

In 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5578655094963796612&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''United States v.

United States]]'' (2016).<ref name=bloombergJAN2/>

=== Death penalty ===
Gorsuch favors a strict reading of the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA).<ref name=scotusblog/> In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general [[Scott Pruitt]] to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a thirty-page dissent by Judge [[Mary Beck Briscoe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Court upholds death penalty in deadly 2003 Oklahoma crime spree|url=http://newsok.com/article/5447108|first=Robert|last=Boczkiewicz|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=September 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8895269800790580321&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Eizember v.

That ruling was upheld 5–4 by the Supreme Court in ''[[Glossip v.

[[John Finnis]], who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, stated that "The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources.

[[File:Justice Neil Gorsuch 2019.jpg|thumb|Gorsuch at the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] in 2019]]
Gorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in ''[[Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.]]'', 582 U.S. ___ (2017). Gorsuch and the Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that [[Banco Santander|Santander]] in this case is not a debt collector under the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] since they purchased the original defaulted car loans from [[Citigroup|CitiFinancial]] for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.<ref name=Opinion>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-349_c07d.pdf Henson v.

=== Freedom of speech ===
Gorsuch joined the majority in ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra]]'', and ''[[Janus v. AFSCME]]'', which both held unconstitutional certain forms of [[compelled speech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf|title=NIFLA v.

=== LGBT rights ===
In 2017, in ''[[Pavan v. Smith]]'', the Supreme Court "summarily overruled" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=June 26, 2017|title=Gay Couples Entitled to Equal Treatment on Birth Certificates, Justices Rule|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/gay-couples-entitled-to-equal-treatment-on-birth-certificates-justices-rule.html|access-date=June 16, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert|date=July 16, 2017|title=A Supreme Court mystery: Has Roberts embraced same-sex marriage ruling?|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/a-supreme-court-mystery-has-roberts-embraced-same-sex-marriage-ruling/2017/07/16/33cd522a-68d1-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html|access-date=June 16, 2020|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

In 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of ''[[Bostock v. Clayton County]]'', ''[[Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda|Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda]]'', and ''[[R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'', ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. Gorsuch argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating "for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex".<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 15, 2020|title=Justices rule LGBT people protected from job discrimination|url=https://apnews.com/ef3c19a79b65c060fd9e82b9dd87a1d9|access-date=June 16, 2020|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

Gorsuch dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice John Roberts in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] case ''Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives'' (2019), a case challenging the Donald Trump administration's ban on [[bump fire|bump stock]]s. Only Gorsuch and [[Clarence Thomas]] publicly dissented.<ref>[https://www.supreme-court.gov/orders/courtorders/040519zr_6k47.pdf] {{dead link|date=April 2019}}</ref>

=== Vagueness doctrine ===
In ''[[Sessions v. Dimaya]]'', the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] was [[unconstitutionally vague]]. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, as well as authoring a separate concurring opinion reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Justice Scalia's opinion in ''[[Johnson v. United States (2015)|Johnson]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Adam|last1=Liptak|access-date=April 17, 2018|title=Justice Gorsuch Joins Supreme Court's Liberals to Strike Down Deportation Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/politics/supreme-court-deportations-trump.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===Native American law===
In March 2019, Justice Gorsuch departed from his four fellow conservative justices, joining the four more liberal Justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5–4 majority in ''[[Washington State Dept. of Licensing v.

The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more.

In May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to the treaty rights of Native Americans, signing onto [[Sonia Sotomayor|Justice Sotomayor's]] opinion to reach a 5-4 decision in ''[[Herrera v. Wyoming]]''.  This case held that hunting rights in [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]], granted by the U.S. government to the Native American [[Crow people]] by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ablavsky |first1=Gregory |title=Opinion analysis: Court rejects issue preclusion in affirming Crow Tribe's treaty hunting right |url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/05/opinion-analysis-court-rejects-issue-preclusion-in-affirming-crow-tribes-treaty-hunting-right/ |website=SCOTUSblog |access-date=July 10, 2020 |language=en |date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>

== Legal philosophy ==
{{Conservatism in the United States}}
Gorsuch is a proponent of [[originalism]], the idea that the [[Constitution]] should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of [[textualism]], the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.<ref name=3judges>{{cite news |title=3 Judges Trump May Nominate For The Supreme Court |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/24/511493397/3-judges-trump-may-nominate-for-the-supreme-court |first=Nina |last=Totenberg |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name=contender>{{cite news |title=Judge Neil Gorsuch Emerges as Leading Contender for Supreme Court |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-neil-gorsuch-emerges-leading-contender-supreme-court/story?id=45005581 |first=Jonathan |last=Karl |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=January 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name=scalia>{{cite magazine |title=Neil Gorsuch: A Worthy Heir to Scalia |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444437/neil-gorsuch-antonin-scalia-supreme-court-textualist-originalist-heir |first=Ronesh |last=Ponnuru |magazine=[[National Review]] |date=January 31, 2017}}</ref> An editorial in the ''[[National Catholic Register]]'' opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward the [[natural law]] philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Kengor |url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/neil-gorsuch-and-natural-law |title=Neil Gorsuch and Natural Law |website=Ncregister.com |access-date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

In January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of ''[[The Week]]'' wrote that an "unexpected civil libertarian alliance" was developing between Gorsuch and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] "in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kristian |first1=Bonnie |title=The unexpected alliance of Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch |url=https://theweek.com/articles/816202/unexpected-alliance-sonia-sotomayor-neil-gorsuch |access-date=January 28, 2019 |magazine=The Week |date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

=== Judicial activism ===
[[File:LB1 9414.jpg|thumb|left|Gorsuch in 2019]]
In a 2016 speech at [[Case Western Reserve University]], Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.<ref name=supreme>{{cite news |title=How Neil Gorsuch could end up as Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court |first=Ariane |last=de Vogue |publisher=CNN |date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>

In a 2005 article published by ''[[National Review]]'', Gorsuch argued that "American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda" and that they are "failing to reach out and persuade the public". Gorsuch wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like [[gay marriage]], [[school vouchers]], and [[assisted suicide]], and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' "overweening addiction" to using the courts for social debate is "bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary".<ref name=confirmed/><ref>{{cite news |title=Liberals 'N' Lawsuits |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/213590/liberalsnlawsuits-joseph-6 |first=Neil |last=Gorsuch |work=[[National Review]] |date=February 7, 2005}}</ref>

=== States' rights and federalism ===
Gorsuch was described by Justin Marceau, a professor at the [[University of Denver]]'s [[Sturm College of Law]], as "a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power". Marceau added that the issue of [[states' rights]] is important since federal laws have been used to reel in "rogue" state laws in [[civil rights]] cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Neil Gorsuch: Elite credentials, conservative western roots land Denver native on SCOTUS list |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/11/neil-gorsuch-trump-scotus-list |first=Kevin |last=Simpson |work=[[The Denver Post]] |date=December 11, 2016}}</ref>

=== Assisted suicide ===
In July 2006, Gorsuch's book, ''[[The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia]]'', which was developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by [[Princeton University Press]].<ref name="dphil"/><ref name="DworkinEuthanasia">{{cite news |last1=Gerald Dworkin|author-link=Gerald Dworkin|title=The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia (review)|url=http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/philosophy/no-exit|access-date=March 20, 2017|publisher=[[The New Rambler]]|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Gorsuch 2009"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/03/neil-gorsuch-mentor-john-finnis-compared-gay-sex-to-bestiality|title=Oxford scholar who was mentor to Neil Gorsuch compared gay sex to bestiality|date=February 3, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2017|first1=Oliver|last1=Laughland|first2=Molly|last2=Redden|first3=Robert|last3=Booth|first4=Owen|last4=Bowcott|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], arguing that the U.S. should "retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong."<ref name=equipped>{{cite news|title=Neil Gorsuch naturally equipped for his spot on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/neil-gorsuch-naturally-equipped-for-his-spot-on-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/2017/01/28/91b00a46-e49b-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html|first=Robert|last=Barnes|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Gorsuch 2009">{{cite book|last=Gorsuch|first=N.M.|title=The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia|publisher=Princeton University Press|series=New Forum Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4008-3034-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwwqAgdREKoC|access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Dylan|title=I read Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's book.
