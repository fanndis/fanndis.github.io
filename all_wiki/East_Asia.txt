In business and economics, "East Asia" is sometimes used to refer to a wide geographical area covering ten [[Southeast Asia]]n countries in [[ASEAN]], [[Greater China]], Japan and Korea. However, in this context, the term "Far East" is used by the Europeans to cover ASEAN countries and the countries in East Asia. However, being a Eurocentric term, [[Far East]] describes the region's geographical position in relation to Europe rather than its location within Asia. Alternatively, the term "[[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific Region]]" is often used in describing East Asia, Southeast Asia as well as [[Oceania]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Observers preferring a broader definition of "East Asia" often use the term [[Northeast Asia]] to refer to China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, with [[Southeast Asia]] covering the ten [[ASEAN]] countries. This usage, which is seen in economic and diplomatic discussions, is at odds with the historical meanings of both "East Asia" and "Northeast Asia".<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher M.

| [[Taoism]]
| {{lang|zh|道教}}
|[[Zhang Daoling]], was consider the founder of Taoism by Taoists. He founded [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi, the earlist denomination of Taoism]]. Zhang Daoling reformed the Chinese folk religion from [[Szechuan]], into a real, organized, and regulated religion, in 125A.D.. [[Wang Chongyang]] founded the [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Denomination]]. Tale says Wang Chongyang met two Gods, [[Lü Dongbin]] and [[Han Zhongli]], during [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in 1159. He then get started to study Taosim himself. Three years later, he finished his studying, and founded Quanzhen. The new leader of Zhengyi need to be the son or paternal nephew of the previous leader, confirmed by the court of Zhengyi, in [[Mount Longhu]], [[Jiangxi]]. Also beginning from the Song Dynasty, the leaders of Zhengyi get started to be confirmed and titled by the Emperor of China.  In 1949, the 63th leader, Zhang Enfu, fled to Taiwan with [[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the [[Kuomintang]], died in 1969 in Taipei. The Kuomintang Authority titled his cousin Zhang Yuanxian as the 64th leader, while the Court of Zhengyi back in Jiangxi argued that the oracle already foreseen the leadership will end at the 63th generation. Zhang Yuanxian died in 2008, only left  a daughter as heir. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang Authority didn't confirmed the next leader. On the other hand,  in Mainland China, Zhang Enfu's second daughter's son, Lu Jintao, changes his surname to Zhang, and get in charge of the Court of Zhengyi currently. For the leader of Quanzhen, the last (18th) leader (1335-1362) was Wanyan Deming, titled by the Emperor of Yuan Dynasty. Wanyan Deming was a Jurchen Taoist, the Wanyan family was the imperial house of Jin Dynasty. There is no official leader pf Quanzhen after Wanyan Deming anymore.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
