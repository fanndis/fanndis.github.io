==Early life==
Ruslana was born on 24 May 1973 in [[Lviv]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] to [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] father Stepan Lyzhychko and [[Russians|Russian]] mother Nina Sapegina.<ref name="gazeta.ua">{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/post/137468|title=Руслана Лыжичко пошла в бабушку|publisher= Gazeta.ua|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CY2TuWiN?url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/post/137468|archivedate=29 November 2012}}</ref> She was raised in the [[Lviv Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]). Encouraged by her mother, Ruslana studied from the age of four at an experimental musical school and sang in different bands, including in the vocal-instrumental band Horizon, the band Orion and the children's ensemble Usmishka (Smile). With Usmishka, Ruslana performed at a large concert in the [[Ukraina Stadium|Druzhba Stadium]] in 1989. One of the headlining acts of that concert was [[Vasyl Zinkevych]], People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR, who noticed her talent. At the end of the concert, Zinkevych asked her to come on stage and declared in front of an audience of 15.000 spectators: "Remember this young singer, your compratiot. You will see: she will definitely become a real star."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mishchenko |first1=Maksym |title=Василь Зінкевич: "Я гордий, що у мене така творча донька" - "Високий замок", 19 травня |url=https://portal.lviv.ua/uncategorized/2004/05/20/133002 |website=Lviv Portal |accessdate=15 October 2020 |language=uk |date=20 May 2004}}</ref>. After finishing secondary school, Ruslana entered the [[Lviv Conservatory]] where she graduated as a classical pianist and symphonic orchestra conductor in 1995.<ref name="ruslana.ua">{{cite web|url= http://www.ruslana.ua/en/bio.php|title=Biography on Ruslana's official website|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>

==Musical career==

===Early career===
Ruslana started her career as the winner of the [[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk|Slavianski Bazaar]] song competition in Vitebsk, [[Belarus]] in 1996 with the song ''Oj, letili dyki husi''.<ref name="ruslana.ua"/> In the same year, she was among the nominees for the Ukrainian Singer of the Year award and the video for ''Dzvinkyi Viter'' (''Wind Bells'') was awarded Music Video of the Year. Since her early career, Ruslana's producer was Oleksandr Ksenofontov, whom she married in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukrfoto.net/people_12.html|title=Знаменитості України Лижичко Руслана Степанівна |website=ukrfoto.net|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1997, Ruslana began working on ''Christmas with Ruslana'' – the first [[L'viv]] Christmas television project of an All-Ukrainian scale including the video clip ''Ballad of a Princess'' which was the first animated music video made by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] singer.

Her first album ''[[Myt Vesny – Dzvinkyi Viter]]'' (''A Moment of Spring – Wind Bells''), released in 1998, received high praise from the critics.

Still, wider recognition did not come until 1998 with the song ''Svitanok'' (''Sunrise'') and the album ''Myt' Vesny – Dzvinkyj Viter Live''. ''Svitanok'' was the first Ukrainian big-budget music video. In 1998, Ruslana was awarded Person of the Year, the song ''Svitanok'' was awarded Song of the Year and its accompanying music video was awarded Music Video of the Year. In the second half of 1998, she organized a charity tour which had the aim of raising funds for the restoration of the old castles from Western Ukraine. The tour was a success and thanks to Ruslana's efforts, the [[Zolochiv Castle]] was restored.<ref>[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/culture/who-will-save-ukrainian-castles Who will Save Ukrainian Castles?]</ref>

In 1999, she worked on the Christmas musical ''Ostanne rizdvo 90th'' (''The Last Christmas of the 90s''), which won the Ukrainian ''Movie of the Year'' award. With the video clip to the song ''Znaju ya'' (''I Know''), which is about the ancient people of the [[Hutsuls]] living in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Carpathians]], Ruslana set new standards for modern video clip filming.

===Education===

In 1995, Ruslana graduated from the [[Lviv Conservatory]] as professional conductor and classical pianist. She was the student of one of the most prominent [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] composers and conductors, [[Mykola Kolessa]] who is regarded as 'the father of the Ukrainian conducting school'. She used to be a part of the student choir of the Lviv Music Academy.

====Wild Dances Project====
Ruslana's father is from the West-Ukrainian area of the [[Hutsuls]], the dwellers of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. They have a unique culture with an ancient and rich history that inspired Ruslana to create her concept album ''Wild Dances''. It combines powerful and permeating ethnic drums, trumpet sounds of the [[trembita]], an ancient [[Hutsul]] music instrument, with modern dance beats. The album was composed by Ruslana after an expedition to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in spring 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20043/4|title=Ruslana – the first Ukrainian pop singer to win a major European pop song contest|date=3 June 2004|publisher=Welcome to Ukraine|accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref>

{{main|Eurovision Song Contest 2004}}
Ruslana was internally selected by the [[National Television Company of Ukraine|NTU]] to represent [[Ukraine]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]].

[[File:Ruslana Ukrainian stamp 2005-2.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian stamp celebrating Ruslana's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest]]
Ruslana had been initially chosen to host the semi-final and the grand final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]].<ref name="ruslana">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/4368|title=Ruslana resigns as host|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=4 May 2005|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> However, the singer had to decline the offer due to her involvement in the organization of a big charity concert dedicated to the victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Therefore, Ruslana appeared at the event only as a guest star. She performed a medley of ''[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]'' and ''Heart on Fire'' at the opening ceremony being accompanied by the Zhyttia ballet and the Ukrainian drums ensamble ARS Nova. After interviewing the competitors in the [[green room]] she also performed her latest single ''[[The Same Star]]''.

{{main|Die Grand Prix Hitliste}}

The programme was viewed by a television audience of approximately six million people in Germany.<ref name="ruslana2">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6210|title=Ruslana – The best of Eurovision|author=Busa, Alexandru|publisher=esctoday|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=24 May 2006}}</ref>

===2008: Wild Energy & ''Grand Theft Auto IV''===

Ruslana's project ''Wild Energy'' was based on the science fiction novel by Maryna and Sergij Diachenko ''[[Wild Energy. Lana]]''. In a future city which experiences a global energy crisis, far more threatening than lack of oil and gas, people are lacking their will to live, their energy of the heart – the "fuel for people". Lana, one of the synthetic inhabitants, sets out to find the mystical energy source. After many adventures, she discovers that the wild energy comes from her own heart.
[[Wild Energy (album)|Wild Energy]] combines the art of music and video production, literature and social commitment in an extraordinary way. In June 2006 Ruslana presented the new single and video ''[[Wild Energy (song)|Wild Energy]]'' in a unique fantasy style. In this video clip, the singer develops from a synthetic blonde girl into her wild image.

In March 2008 Ruslana's Ukrainian album ''[[Amazonka]]'' was released in Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The English album ''[[Wild Energy (album)|Wild Energy]]'' was released by [[Warner Music]] in Canada and several European countries in autumn 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/10527/ruslana_sings_major_recording_deal_with_warner_records/|title=Ruslana signs major recording deal with Warner Records|date=15 February 2008|publisher=EscToday.com|accessdate=15 February 2008}}</ref>

On 13 May 2008, ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' broke the [[Guinness World Records]] for "Highest grossing video game in 24 hours" and "Highest Revenue Generated by an Entertainment Product in 24 Hours". It sold 3.6 million copies on day one generating $310 million in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/13/grand-theft-auto-iv-breaks-guinness-world-records-with-biggest-entertainment-release-of-all-time|title=Grand Theft Auto IV breaks Guinness World Records with biggest entertainment release of all-time|date=13 May 2008|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>

Together with the ''Zhyttia'' ballet, she performed three songs from her first international album: "[[Wild Dances]]", "[[Dance with the Wolves]]" and a bilingual version of "Play, Musician!". Her act was met with great enthusiasm by the Asian public who didn't know her until that moment. Even if she was supposed to receive only an award for her contribution to the cultural exchange between Ukraine and Asia in music, in the end she also won the main award of the festival, receiving the golden statue for the best artist of the Asia Song Festival 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4283|title=Ruslana conquered Asian hearts|date=22 September 2009|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, Ruslana was appointed as one of the judges of the Ukrainian version of ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' show. Her involvement in the project was featured on the Dutch TV where the original show of the series kicked off.

Also in 2011, her song ''[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]'' was used by the American gymnast [[Jordyn Wieber]] as the soundtrack for her floor exercise.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/7096506/jordyn-wieber-wins-world-gymnastics-all-title|title=Jordyn Wieber wins world all-around title|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=6 August 2013}}</ref> Wieber eventually became the 2011 [[2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Women's All-Around Champion]] and won the golden medal at the [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic team all-around|2012 Summer Olympics]] performing her floor exercise on Ruslana's song.<ref name="ESPN"/>

In April 2012 the new Ukrainian language album ''ЕЙ-форі-Я'' (''EY-fori-YA'') was released in Ukraine.

Despite its intercontinental rock and pop nature, the album ''EY-fori-YA'' and the three songs taken from it previously is based on Slavic rhythms. Ruslana integrated old Slavic circle dances, liturgies and elements of classic pieces of Russian composers including [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Tschaikowsky]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Rachmaninow]].<ref name="umka.com.ua"/>
The album is designed for flash mob type synchronous dances. In April/May 2012 she toured 11 Ukrainian cities with a unique show concept called ''OGO Show''. During these open-air events Ruslana appeared as lead dancer teaching the audience the moves. The audience doesn't consume passively, but is integrated into the show.<ref>[http://www.ogoshow.com.ua Ogoshow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803042756/http://ogoshow.com.ua/ |date=3 August 2012 }}</ref> More concept concerts followed within the framework of the ''EURO 2012'' public fan events.

(razom!)'', ''My Brother! (together!)''). The renaming of the album had become necessary because of the coincidental same name of the winning song of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]]. The Swedish singer [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] won the event with the song ''Euphoria'', one month after Ruslana had released her Ukrainian album and song of the same name.

===2014–2016: Eurovision juror===
In January 2014 her international album ''[[My Boo (Ruslana album)|My Boo! (Together!)]]'' was released digitally. For her subsequent album Ruslana intended to study again [[ethnic]] motifs as she regarded the [[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]] project as her most creative work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://show.obozrevatel.com/article/50138-ruslana-myi-s-muzhem-sozdanyi-drug-dlya-druga.htm|title=Ruslana: My s muzhem sozdany drug dlya druga|work=Obozrevatel.com|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> Due to her active involvement in the [[Euromaidan]] in Ukraine, Ruslana had to postpone her musical plans.

Ruslana was invited as music expert for Eurosong, the [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|Belgian selection for the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest]] in order to choose the best candidate to represent Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escflashmalta.com/index.php/music-news/international-music-news/item/3301-belgium-ruslana-joins-panel-for-eurosong-2014|title=Belgium: Ruslana Joins Panel for Eurosong 2014|work=ESCflashMalta.com|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>

On 9 and 10 October Ruslana held two concerts at the Manchester Ukrainian Cultural Centre 'Dnipro'. She originally planned on performing only one show however as the tickets sold out within hours, it was decided that she would perform a second concert the next day. Tickets for that show were also almost sold out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruslana.ua/ua/news.php?id=6253|title=Два надзвичайних живих концерти в Манчестері|accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>

For her final song, Ruslana performed along with the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus as well as the Zoloti Struny Youth Bandura Ensemble based in Toronto. Ruslana was a juror for the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Ukrainian national final]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]].

In October she played in London, in November she played in Paris and in December she played in Hanover (Hannover). In all of these concerts she spoke about the victory that Jamala brought for Ukraine, and how Ukraine would be opening up to the world again in May 2017.

=== 2017: It's Magical / Ya lyublyu ===
After her long-lasting creative break, which was caused by the dramatic and stormy events in Ukraine, Ruslana presented her new single "It's Magical / Я люблю" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|Eurovision]] Grand Finale in Kyiv on 13 May 2017. The new music style combines tender cradle songs with brisk exotic melodies and rhythms. The original, exotic manner of singing which forms the basis of the soundtrack Ruslana acquired on sometimes extreme expeditions into the Carpathian Mountains. The song was released in an English ("It's Magical") and a Ukrainian version ("Я люблю" / "Ya lyublyu" / "I Love").<ref>{{cite web|url= https://oikotimes.com/2017/05/18/ruslana-releases-brand-new-single-and-video-because-its-magical/ |title= Ruslana releases brand new single and video "It's Magical" |publisher=Oikotimes |date=2017-05-18 |accessdate=2017-05-21}}</ref>

The film production took place in a unique place, the Basalt quarry in the [[Rivne]] region. Director [[Oles Sanin]] created a thunderstorm in a realistic way for the video clip. The image of Ruslana in the chainmail in which she appears in the clip resembles her internal state. After all the events in her country and her extreme expeditions into the mountains, Ruslana feels like a kind of warrioress who is called to protect the most valuable: Love. In her song, video Ruslana wants to draw attention to the widespread deforestation in the Carpathians. Her aim is the preservation of the Carpathian primeval forests, their unique wildlife, and exceptional culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oikotimes.com/2017/05/18/ruslana-releases-brand-new-single-and-video-because-its-magical/ |title= Ruslana releases brand new single and video "It's Magical" |publisher=Oikotimes |date=2017-05-18 |accessdate=2017-05-21}}</ref>

In total Ruslana spent at least 100 days and 100 nights on the Maidan stage during the cold winter inspiring the crowds, giving speeches and singing the Ukrainian national anthem every hour day after day and night after and night, often sleeping just a couple of hours on the floor of the Trade Union building occupied by the protesters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ruslana at John Batchelor Show, 7.4.2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4X4r4OEDSU|accessdate=7 April 2014| date=7 April 2014}}</ref> As a symbol of people power, peace and freedom she established holding up flashlights while singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

When during the night of 30 November 2013 the riot police wanted to clear the occupied Maidan and started beating up peacefully sleeping activists Ruslana rushed for help and managed to seek shelter with about 100 students, some of them wounded, in a nearby monastery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Special police disrupts EuroMaidan|url= http://ukrainianweek.com/News/95319|accessdate=12 June 2014|newspaper=The Ukrainian Week|date=30 November 2013}}</ref> During another night in December 2013 when the riot police advanced again towards the square Ruslana did her utmost to deescalate the situation by talking to them from the stage repeating over and over again "Quiet!

From January 2014 Ruslana started to meet with key EU and U.S. politicians asking for support for Ukraine. Her first appearance in this role at the 495th Plenary Session of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] (EESC) and a meeting with [[José Manuel Barroso]], President of the European Commission, resulted in a resolution of the EESC to support the Ukrainian civil society and its democratic rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=The protest movement of Maidan in Kiev at the EESC|url=http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=president.en.my-news.30579|accessdate=25 January 2014|publisher=Website of the EESC}}</ref> In the following months Ruslana travelled to Stockholm, Paris, Warsaw, Brussels, Vienna, Strasbourg, Berlin, Munich, São Paulo, Washington D.C. and New York speaking to leading government officials demanding international support.

Her activism put herself in serious danger. She received numerous death threats on her phone, her car was followed and she couldn't live in her house for several weeks because it was constantly observed.
