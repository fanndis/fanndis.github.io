== History and leadership ==
The Legal Aid Society was founded in 1876 in New York to defend the individual rights of German immigrants who could not afford to hire a lawyer. A large donation from the Rockefeller Family in 1890 enabled the organization to expand its services and include individuals from every background.<ref name=":0" /> It was renamed the New York Legal Aid Society in 1890.<ref>''Law and Society'', Matthew Lippman, 2018</ref> The society is governed by a board of directors. On December 2, 2010, Richard J. Davis was elected chairman of the board.
