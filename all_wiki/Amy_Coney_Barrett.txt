In June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male [[Purdue University]] student ([[John Doe]]) who had been found guilty of [[sexual assault]] by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his [[Navy ROTC]] scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Doe v.

==== Employment discrimination====
In 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against [[AutoZone]]; the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., "sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods") violated [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act]]. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing ''[[en banc]]''. Three judges—Chief Judge [[Diane Wood]] and judges [[Ilana Rovner]] and [[David Hamilton (judge)|David Hamilton]]—voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a "[[Separate but equal|separate-but-equal]] arrangement". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5–3 decision.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=EEOC v.

In 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of ''Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation''. Smith was a Black employee who claimed [[racial discrimination]] upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a "stupid-ass [[nigger]]" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's [[Question of fact|fact]] that his discharge was related to "poor performance".<ref>{{cite news |title=A look at Judge Amy Coney Barrett's notable opinions, votes |url=https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-confirmation-hearings-discrimination-amy-coney-barrett-4380ef16b3da79836151bcaaa7eda224 |access-date=October 13, 2020 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=TERRY L.

==== Immigration ====
In June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial "[[public charge rule]]", which heightened the standard for obtaining a [[green card]].<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Cook County v. Wolf

On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under ''[[Chevron deference|Chevron]]'' Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]].<ref name=Thomsen>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/08/05/splitting-with-other-circuits-appeals-court-rules-for-trump-in-public-charge-case/ |title=Splitting With Other Circuits, Appeals Court Rules for Trump in 'Public Charge' Case |first=Jacqueline |last=Thomsen |date=August 5, 2020 |work=National Law Journal|access-date=September 21, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926001326/https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/08/05/splitting-with-other-circuits-appeals-court-rules-for-trump-in-public-charge-case/?slreturn=20200825201325|url-status=live}}</ref> The public charge issue is the subject of a [[circuit split]].<ref name=Thomsen/><ref>{{cite web |first=Camilo |last=Montoya-Galvez |title=Trump administration can enforce green card wealth test in most states, court rules |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-news-trump-administration-public-charge-rule-green-card-wealth-test/ |date=August 13, 2020 |website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=September 21, 2020|archive-date=August 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820002050/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-news-trump-administration-public-charge-rule-green-card-wealth-test/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2019, the court rejected a [[Yemen]]i citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a [[Consul (representative)|consular officer]]'s decision to twice deny her [[Travel visa|visa]] application under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]]. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.<ref name=Yafai>{{cite court|litigants=Yafai v. Pompeo

Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was [[Facial challenge|facially]] legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not "look behind the exercise of that discretion". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing ''[[en banc]]'' was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing ''en banc'' (joined by Judge [[Joel Flaum]]).<ref name=Yafai/><ref>{{cite web |title=Dissent Slams 7th Circ.'s Rehearing Denial For Yemeni Couple |url=https://www.law360.com/articles/1162851/dissent-slams-7th-circ-s-rehearing-denial-for-yemeni-couple|access-date=August 4, 2020 |work=Law360 |language=en}}</ref>

==== Abortion-related cases====
Barrett has never ruled directly on [[abortion]], but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or [[cremation]] of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the [[fetal]] remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite news |date=September 26, 2020 |title=Notable dissents from Judge Amy Coney Barrett |work=ABC 17 |url=https://www.abc17news.com/politics/national-politics/2020/09/26/notable-dissents-from-judge-amy-coney-barrett/ |access-date=September 30, 2020}}</ref>

==== Second Amendment ====
In March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Kanter v. Barr

In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/05/18/if-donald-trump-gets-another-supreme-court-pick |title=If Donald Trump gets another Supreme Court pick... |date=May 16, 2019 |work=[[The Economist]]|access-date=May 19, 2019 |issn=0013-0613|archive-date=May 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517210412/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/05/18/if-donald-trump-gets-another-supreme-court-pick|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume "that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to [[Consent search#Consent given by third parties|consent to a search]] of a male suspect's residence."

==== Qualified immunity ====
In January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied [[qualified immunity]] to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the [[probable cause]] [[affidavit]] that was used to obtain an [[arrest warrant]] for the plaintiff.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Rainsberger v.

In ''Howard v. Koeller'' (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a "[[Jailhouse informants|snitch]]" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagolawbulletin.com/7th-circuit-revives-first-amendment-case-of-prisoner-labeled-snitch-20181218 |title=Suit alleging prison officer called man a snitch revived |work=Chicago Daily Law Bulletin |language=en|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Howard v.

==== Environment ====
In ''Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'', 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge [[Amy J. St. Eve]], in a case brought by a property developer challenging the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|Corps]]' determination that a [[wetland]] {{convert|11|mi|abbr=on}} from the nearest [[Navigability#In the United States|navigable]] river was among the "[[waters of the United States]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11384829312322004633|title=Orchard Hill Bldg.

==== Coronavirus measures ====
In early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the [[Illinois Republican Party]]'s request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor [[J. B.

First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'"<ref name="CongOrg"/> For the purpose of "describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning," she refers<ref name="CongOrg"/> to a section of a law review article by Keith E. Whittington, "Originalism: A Critical Introduction",<ref name="Kwhitt"/> that reads, "Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways."<ref name="Kwhitt">{{cite journal |last1=Whittington |first1=Keith E. |title=Originalism: A Critical Introduction |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4927&context=flr |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |volume=82|issue=2|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|location=New York City|access-date=October 11, 2020 |date=November 2013}}</ref>

Textualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its "ordinary meaning": "The law is comprised of words—and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say." According to Barrett, "Textualism stands in contrast to [[purposivism]], a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century." If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, "purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. "It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Amy Coney |title=2019 Sumner Canary Memorial Lecture: Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal Analysis: Redux |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4873&context=caselrev |publisher=Case Western Reserve Law Review |location=Cleveland, Ohio|access-date=October 9, 2020 |date=September 2020}}</ref>

Barnett]], Barrett wrote: "The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Joseph |first1=Cameron |title=Trump Plans to Pick Amy Coney Barrett to Replace RBG on the Supreme Court |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kpne9/trump-has-reportedly-picked-amy-coney-barrett-to-replace-rbg-on-the-supreme-court |access-date=September 30, 2020 |work=[[Vice News]] |date=September 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name="majoritarian">{{cite journal |last1=Barrett |first1=Amy Coney |title=Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty |url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=concomm |date=January 3, 2017 |journal=Constitutional Commentary |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School|location=St. Paul, Minnesota}}</ref>

According to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, "[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it." Scalia insisted that "it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated."<ref name=cross>{{Cite journal |last=Cross |first=Jesse M. |date=Winter 2020 |title=Legislative History in the Modern Congress |url=https://harvardjol.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/05/J.-Cross_Legislative-History.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=93–94}}</ref><ref name=insiders>{{cite journal |last1=Barrett |first1=Amy Coney |year=2017 |title=Congressional Insiders and Outsiders |url=http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/publication/congressional-insiders-and-outsiders |journal=[[The University of Chicago Law Review]] |volume=2017 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=2193–2212 }}</ref>

=== Precedent ===
At her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, "Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-to-know-supreme-court-nominee-judge-amy-coney-barrett-51601154682|title=What to Know About Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's Supreme Court Nominee|first=Nicholas|last=Jasinski|website=barrons.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/barrett-could-be-most-conservative-justice-since-clarence-thomas|title=Barrett Could Be Most Conservative Justice Since Clarence Thomas|website=news.bloomberglaw.com}}</ref> she also said judges "must apply the law as written".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theweek.com/10things/939986/10-things-need-know-today-september-27-2020|title=10 things you need to know today: September 27, 2020|date=September 27, 2020|website=The Week}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/opinion/supreme-court-barrett-questions.html|title=Opinion &#124; Questions for Amy Coney Barrett|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse|date=October 8, 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref> She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Clip: Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Precedent and Stare Decisis |url=https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?17250 |publisher=C-SPAN |access-date=October 28, 2020 |date=October 13, 2020}}</ref>

In a 2013 article in ''Texas Law Review'' on the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'', Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered "[[superprecedent]]s"—cases the court would never consider overturning. They included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' ([[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporating]] the Fourth Amendment onto the states),<ref name="Barrett-2013">{{cite journal |last=Barrett |first=Amy C. |title=Precedent and Jurisprudential Disagreement |date=August 22, 2013 |url=http://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Barrett.pdf |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=1711, 1734–35|access-date=September 26, 2020|archive-date=July 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721112732/http://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Barrett.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> but specifically excluded ''Roe v. Wade'' (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as "superprecedent", a decision must have widespread support from not only [[jurist]]s but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the [[legal tender cases|constitutionality of paper money]]). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken "off of the court's agenda", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992) as evidence that ''Roe'' had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: "[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as ''Roe v. Wade'' has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed."<ref name="Barrett-2013"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fallon Jr. |first1=Richard H. |title=Constitutional Precedent Viewed through the Lens of Hartian Positivist Jurisprudence |journal=North Carolina Law Review |date=June 1, 2008 |volume=86 |issue=5 |page=1116 |url=https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.startpage.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4323&context=nclr |access-date=October 11, 2020}}</ref>

Concerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, "It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach."<ref name="Barrett-2013"/> She referenced a study by [[Michael Gerhardt]] which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than justices Scalia and [[Hugo Black]], both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which "do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling."<ref name="Barrett-2013"/>

=== Affordable Care Act ===
In 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with [[birth control]] coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it.<ref name=":7" />

Barrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] in ''[[National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius]]'' (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the [[Affordable Care Act]]'s [[individual mandate]]. She wrote in 2017: "Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power."<ref name="majoritarian" /><ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Who Is Amy Coney Barrett, Front-Runner For The Supreme Court Nomination? |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/24/915781077/conenator-who-is-amy-coney-barrett-front-runner-for-supreme-court-nomination|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925002352/https://www.npr.org/2020/09/24/915781077/conenator-who-is-amy-coney-barrett-front-runner-for-supreme-court-nomination|archive-date=September 25, 2020|access-date=September 25, 2020 |publisher=NPR |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite web |last=TODAY |first=Richard Wolf and Maureen Groppe USA |date=September 27, 2020 |title=On key issues: Statements and rulings by Amy Coney Barrett |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/on-key-issues-statements-and-rulings-by-amy-coney-barrett/article_853864c0-fbbc-11ea-9c8b-8b2b07717d56.html|access-date=September 27, 2020 |website=South Bend Tribune |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=After Justice Ginsburg's Loss, What A New Court Could Mean For The ACA |url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200920.954961/full/|access-date=September 25, 2020 |website=Health Affairs |language=en |doi=10.1377/hblog20200920.954961/full/|doi-broken-date=October 27, 2020|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922002224/https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200920.954961/full/|url-status=live}}</ref>
