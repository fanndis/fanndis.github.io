'''''Scientific American''''' (informally abbreviated '''''SciAm''''' or sometimes '''''SA''''') is an American [[popular science]] magazine. Many famous scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], have contributed articles to it. It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States (though it did not become monthly until 1921).

==History==
''Scientific American'' was founded by inventor and publisher [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus M. Porter]] in 1845<ref name="scientificamerican1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/pressroom/aboutus.cfm|title=Press Room|date=2009-08-17|magazine=Scientific American|access-date=2012-01-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119195853/http://www.scientificamerican.com/pressroom/aboutus.cfm |archive-date=January 19, 2012}}</ref> as a four-page weekly newspaper. Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. It also reported on a broad range of inventions including [[perpetual motion]] machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the [[universal joint]] which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a "this date in history" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology. It started as a weekly publication in August 1845 before turning into monthly in November 1921.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scientific American archives|url=https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=sciam|access-date=2020-07-21|website=onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu}}</ref>

Porter sold the publication to [[Alfred Ely Beach]] and [[Orson Desaix Munn]] a mere ten months after founding it. Until 1948, it remained owned by Munn & Company.<ref name="scientificamerican1"/> Under Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a "workbench" publication, similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of ''[[Popular Science (magazine)|Popular Science]]''.

In the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called ''The Sciences'', purchased the assets of the old ''Scientific American'' instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partners{{mdash}}publisher [[Gerard Piel]], editor [[Dennis Flanagan]], and general manager Donald H. Miller, Jr.{{mdash}}essentially created a new magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08821127.1989.10731208|title=Magazine Publishing and Popular Science after World War II|year=1989|last1=Lewenstein|first1=Bruce V.|journal=American Journalism|volume=6|issue=4|pages=218–234}}</ref> Miller retired in 1979, Flanagan and Piel in 1984, when Gerard Piel's son Jonathan became president and editor; circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948. In 1986, it was sold to the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]] group of Germany, which has owned it until the Springer-Nature merger.

In the fall of 2008, ''Scientific American'' was put under the control of [[Nature Publishing Group]], a division of Holtzbrinck.<ref name="FOLIO">{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Fell |title=Scientific American Editor, President to Step Down; 5 Percent of Staff Cut|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/scientific-american-editor-president-step-down-5-percent-staff-cut|publisher=FOLIO |access-date=2009-04-26|date=2009-04-23 }}</ref>

==International editions==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
''Scientific American'' published its first foreign edition in 1890, the Spanish-language ''La America Cientifica''. Publication was suspended in 1905, and another 63 years would pass before another foreign-language edition appeared: In 1968, an Italian edition, ''[[Le Scienze]]'', was launched, and a Japanese edition, ''{{ill|Nikkei Science|ja|日経サイエンス}}'', followed three years later. A new Spanish edition, ''Investigación y Ciencia'' was launched in Spain in 1976, followed by a French edition, ''{{ill|Pour la Science|fr|display=yes}}'', in France in 1977, and a German edition, ''{{ill|Spektrum der Wissenschaft|de|display=yes}}'', in Germany in 1978. A Russian edition ''V Mire Nauki'' was launched in the Soviet Union in 1983, and continues in the present-day Russian [[Federation]]. ''Kexue'' (科学, "Science" in Chinese), a simplified Chinese edition launched in 1979, was the first Western magazine published in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Founded in [[Chongqing]], the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to [[Beijing]] in 2001. Later in 2005, a newer edition, ''Global Science'' (环球科学), was published instead of ''Kexue'', which shut down due to financial problems. A traditional Chinese edition, known as ''{{ill|Scientist (magazine)|zh|科学美国人|lt=Scientist}}'', was introduced to [[Taiwan]] in 2002. The Hungarian edition ''Tudomány'' existed between 1984 and 1992. In 1986, an Arabic edition, ''{{ill|Oloom Magazine|ar|مجلة العلوم}}'', was published<!--where?-->. In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil.

Today, ''Scientific American'' publishes 18 foreign-language editions around the globe: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian (discontinued after 15 issues), Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.

From 1902 to 1911, ''Scientific American'' supervised the publication of the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', which during some of that period was known as ''The Americana''.

==First issue==
{{Wikisource|Scientific American/Series 1/Volume 1/Issue 1|''Scientific American'' issue 1}}
[[File:Scientific American - Series 1 - Volume 001 - Issue 01.pdf|thumb|PDF of first issue: ''Scientific American'' Vol. 1, No. 01 published August 28, 1845]][[File:SciAmer.gif|thumb|200px|Cover of the September 1848 issue]]

It originally styled itself "The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise" and "Journal of Mechanical and other Improvements". On the front page of the first issue was the engraving of "Improved Rail-Road Cars". The masthead had a commentary as follows:

{{quote|''Scientific American'' published every Thursday morning at No. 11 Spruce Street, New York, No. 16 State Street, Boston, and No. 2l Arcade Philadelphia, (The principal office being in New York) by Rufus Porter. Each number will be furnished with from two to five original Engravings, many of them elegant, and illustrative of New Inventions, Scientific Principles, and Curious Works; and will contain, in high addition to the most interesting news of passing events, general notices of progress of Mechanical and other Scientific Improvements; American and Foreign. Improvements and Inventions; Catalogues of American Patents; Scientific Essays, illustrative of the principles of the sciences of Mechanics, Chemistry, and Architecture: useful information and instruction in various Arts and Trades; Curious Philosophical Experiments; Miscellaneous Intelligence, Music and Poetry. This paper is especially entitled to the patronage of Mechanics and Manufactures, being the only paper in America, devoted to the interest of those classes; but is particularly useful to farmers, as it will not only appraise them of improvements in agriculture implements, But instruct them in various mechanical trades, and guard them against impositions. As a family newspaper, it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people, than five times its cost in school instruction. Another important argument in favor of this paper, is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete, (Old volumes of the ''New York Mechanic'', being now worth double the original cost, in cash.) Terms: The ''Scientific American'' will be furnished to subscribers at $2.00 per annum, – one dollar in advance, and the balance in six months. Five copies will be sent to one address six months for four dollars in advance. Any person procuring two or more subscribers, will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each.}}

The commentary under the illustration gives the flavor of its style at the time:
{{quote|There is perhaps no mechanical subject, in which improvement has advanced so rapidly, within the last ten years, as that of railroad passenger cars. Let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of '35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads, and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party, a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement. Some of the most elegant cars of this class, and which are of a capacity to accommodate from sixty to eighty passengers, and run with a steadiness hardly equaled by a steamboat in still water, are manufactured by Davenport & Bridges, at their establishment in Cambridgeport, Mass. The manufacturers have recently introduced a variety of excellent improvements in the construction of trucks, springs, and connections, which are calculated to avoid atmospheric resistance, secure safety and convenience, and contribute ease and comfort to passengers, while flying at the rate of 30 or 40 miles per hour.}}

Also in the first issue is commentary on Signor Muzio Muzzi's proposed device for aerial navigation.

==Scientific and political debate==
In April 1950, the U.S. [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] ordered ''Scientific American'' to cease publication of an issue containing an article by [[Hans Bethe]] that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear [[hydrogen bomb]]. Subsequent review of the material determined that the AEC had overreacted. The incident was important for the "new" ''Scientific American'''s history, as the AEC's decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be "[[book burning]] in a free society" when publisher Gerard Piel leaked the incident to the press.<ref>Lewenstein, B. V. (1987). 'Public Understanding of Science' in America, 1945–1965. Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, pp. 280–284</ref>

In its January 2002 issue, ''Scientific American'' published a series of criticisms of the [[Bjørn Lomborg]] book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. [[Cato Institute]] fellow [[Patrick J. Michaels]] said the attacks came because the book "threatens billions of taxpayer dollars that go into the global change kitty every year."<ref>[http://www.cato.org/dailys/01-17-02.html# Who Let the Dogs Out at Scientific American?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609064507/http://www.cato.org/dailys/01-17-02.html |date=2007-06-09 }}, Patrick J. Michaels, January 17, 2002</ref> Journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] called the criticism "disturbing" and "dishonest", writing, "The subhead of the review section, 'Science defends itself against ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'',' gives the show away: Religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism, but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts."<ref>[https://reason.com/2002/05/01/green-with-ideology-2/ Green with Ideology], Ronald Bailey, ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', May 2002</ref>

The May 2007 issue featured a column by [[Michael Shermer]] calling for a United States pullout from the [[Iraq War]].<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=13&articleID=E7327616-E7F2-99DF-38F214BFD77FE010 Bush's Mistake and Kennedy's Error], Michael Shermer, ''Scientific American'', May 2007</ref> In response, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' online columnist [[James Taranto]] jokingly called ''Scientific American'' "a liberal political magazine".<ref>[http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110010097 Sunk or Bunk?], James Taranto, ''[[Best of the Web Today]]'', May 18, 2007</ref>

The publisher was criticized in 2009 when it notified collegiate libraries that yearly subscription prices for the magazine would increase by nearly 500% for print and 50% for online access to $1500 yearly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/College-Library-Directors/48794/|title=College Library Directors Protest Huge Jump in 'Scientific American' Price|last=Howard|first=Jennifer |date=October 13, 2009|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2009-10-14}}</ref>

An editorial in the September 2016 issue of Scientific American attacked U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump for "anti-science" attitudes and rhetoric. This marked the first time that the publication forayed into commenting on U.S. presidential politics.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/donald-trump-s-lack-of-respect-for-science-is-alarming/|title=Donald Trump's Lack of Respect for Science Is Alarming|magazine=Scientific American|date=September 1, 2016|access-date=2017-03-23}}</ref>

==Presidential candidate endorsement==

In the October 2020 issue of the magazine, it endorsed [[Joe Biden]] for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], citing [[Donald Trump]]'s rejection of scientific evidence, especially during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]]. In the column reporting the endorsement, the magazine's editors said, "''Scientific American'' has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden/|title=Scientific American Endorses Joe Biden|magazine=Scientific American|date=September 5, 2020|access-date=2020-09-15}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2013, [[Danielle N. Lee]], a female scientist who blogged at ''Scientific American'', was called a "whore" in an email by an editor at the science website ''Biology Online'' after refusing to write professional content without compensation. When Lee, outraged about the email, wrote a rebuttal on her ''Scientific American'' blog, the editor-in-chief of ''Scientific American'', [[Mariette DiChristina]], removed the post, sparking an outrage by supporters of Lee.

Zivkovic said of the meeting, "within five minutes, it was clear  that SciAm wasn't a good match for her professional goals. [He] stayed for the coffee out of politeness, but found her offputting and uninteresting as a person. So much emphasis has been put on the subject matter of their conversation, but for [Zivkovic] this was no different than talking to an entomologist about insects: all the writing samples she sent we're related to sex and relationships. I was mortified to hear that she understood the conversation as inappropriate, 
and I did apologize, but not for harassment (there was none), for causing her any discomfort. As a naturalized American, I wasn't raised with all the subtleties that the American madonna/whore culture expouses. And I didn't understand how she could write and talk so freely about sex and yet be offended by our conversation, which was mild in comparison. My interest in her, sexually or otherwise, was zero."[http://monicacatherine.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/this-happened/ "This Happened"], October 14, 2013.
