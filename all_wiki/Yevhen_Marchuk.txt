(Gen. Ret.) '''Yevhen Kyrylovych Marchuk''' ({{lang-uk|Євге́н Кири́лович Марчу́к|translit=Jevhén Kyrýlovyč Marčúk}}), born on January 28, 1941, is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician. During his career, Marchuk was [[prime minister of Ukraine]], presidential candidate, secretary of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|National Security and Defense Council]], and [[Military of Ukraine|Defense Minister of Ukraine]]. Marchuk is affiliated with the Ukrainian ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'' newspaper, edited by his wife. He has been a general in the Army of Ukraine since March 23, 1994.

== Biography ==
Yevhen Marchuk was born soon before [[World War II]] into a peasant family in [[Central Ukraine]]. In 1963,<ref name=TapesMarchuk/> upon graduation from the [[Kirovohrad]] Pedagogical Institute, Marchuk was recruited by the [[KGB]] and steadily rose through the ranks of that organization. As an operative officer he served first in [[Kirovohrad Oblast]], then in the [[Ukrainian SSR|republican]] KGB branch in [[Kyiv]] as an intelligence and secret service officer, for a total of 31 years of service. Marchuk has admitted specializing in [[secret police]] functions. However, he claims to have been a humane lawful agent, secretly protecting some Ukrainian [[dissident]]s from harsh persecution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the early 1990s, Marchuk was one of the first high-level KGB officers who appeared to be loyal to the newly established Ukrainian independence and was one of the reformers of the Ukrainian Secret Service (later [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]]) serving as the first Chief of SBU. At first he was appointed the Ukrainian SSR Minister of National Security and Defence. That position held no actual power since local KGB, [[militsiya]], and the army were still subordinated to Moscow until 1991. The Soviet Union then collapsed, ending Marchuk’s service to the KGB, and he was able to participate fully in the Ukrainian independent government. He headed the SBU until 1994.<ref name=TapesMarchuk/>

After the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994 parliamentary elections]], Marchuk became head of the liberal Social Market Choice faction, whose members included former [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Kravchuk]].<ref name=Post>[http://www.taraskuzio.net/media13_files/donbas_clan.pdf Donbas moves back onto the national stage at last], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 14, 2002)</ref> Marchuk was appointed the acting [[Prime minister of Ukraine]] on March 1, 1995, holding the position of the [[First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine|first vice-Premier Minister]] in the cabinet of [[Vitaliy Masol]]. He was later promoted to the position of the Premier Minister on June 8, 1995. He formed his cabinet, which was confirmed on July 3, 1995. After being elected to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (December 1995), he resigned on May 27, 1996. Marchuk and Kravchuk became members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]] before the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998 elections]].<ref>[http://www.brama.com/ukraine-embassy/pre0721.html UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT FORMED ITS PERMANENT COMMITTEES], Embassy of Ukraine to the United States of America (July 21, 1998)</ref> From April to December 1998 he was the leader of the party. From July 1998 Marchuk headed a parliamentary committee in Social Policy and Labor.

When the SDPU(u) refused to back Marchuk in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999 presidential elections]], he left to create his own [[Social Democratic Union (Ukraine)|Social Democratic Union]].<ref name=Post/> He ran as an independent in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999 presidential election]], coming in fifth place with 8.13% of the vote in the first tour of the elections, and was appointed secretary of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|National Security and Defense Council]] by the re-elected [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Marchuk was secretary of the National Security and Defense Council from November 10, 1999, to June 25, 2003 (till June 2009 he stayed on as chairperson of the council's interagency commission on information policy).<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/43655/ Yushchenko appoints Bohatyriova to replace Marchuk as chair of National Security Council's interagency commission on information policy], [[Kyiv Post]] (June 19, 2009)</ref> Later, he was the [[Military of Ukraine|Defense Minister of Ukraine]] from June 2003 to September 2004.<ref name=TapesMarchuk>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/101374/ Marchuk says he had no face-to-face interrogations with Kuchma or Melnychenko], [[Kyiv Post]] (April 1, 2011)</ref>

During the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006 parliamentary elections]] Marchuk lead the [[electoral alliance]] (Electoral Bloc "Yevhen Marchuk" — "[[Unity (Ukraine)|Unity]]")<ref name="twosix">[http://www.yednist.org.ua/activity.asp?IdType=4&Id=597 "Unity" official site news December 16, 2005]</ref> (including his own party, Party of Freedom) which didn't make it into parliament, winning only 0.06% of the votes.<ref>[http://files.korrespondent.net/party/unite [[korrespondent]]]</ref>

=== Later career developments ===
In May 2008, Marchuk was appointed one of the personal advisors to [[Viktor Yushchenko|President Yushchenko]].<ref>[http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/7878.html Presidential Decree № 455/2008 on the appointment of E. Marchuk Adviser of President of Ukraine]</ref>

In June 2015 he was appointed by President [[Petro Poroshenko|Poroshenko]] a Ukrainian special representative in one of the subgroups of the [[Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine]].<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://ukranews.com/news/168686.Eks-zamglavi-Administratsii-Medvedchuk-budet-predstavlyat-Ukrainu-v-podgruppe-po-gumanitarnim-voprosam-trehstoronney-rabochey-gruppi.uk Medvedchuk will represent Ukraine in the subgroup of Humanitarian Affairs Tripartite Working Group 1852], [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (5 June 2015)</ref>
