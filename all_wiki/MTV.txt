{{MTV}}
'''MTV''' (originally an initialism of '''Music Television''') is an American cable [[Television channel|channel]], launched on August 1, 1981. Based in New York City, it serves as the [[Flagship#Broadcasting|flagship]] property of the [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]] division of [[ViacomCBS]], also headquartered in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/80sbackgroundcultu2/p/mtvprofile.htm|title=80Music.about.com|publisher=80Music.about.com|date=August 1, 1981|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref>

MTV was originally first tested on December 1, 1977 as '''Sight on Sound''', but was officially launched in 1981, and originally aired [[music video]]s as guided by television personalities known as "[[VJ (media personality)|video jockeys]]" (VJs),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/31/encore.mtv/index.html|title=CNN&nbsp;– MTV changed the music industry on August 1, 1981&nbsp;– July 31, 1998|accessdate=2010-05-13}}</ref> but in the years since its inception, the network significantly toned down its focus on music in favor of original [[reality television|reality]] programming targeting youths and young adults.

MTV has spawned numerous [[List of MTV channels|sister channels]] in the U.S. and affiliated channels internationally, some of which have gone independent, with approximately 90.6 million American households in the United States receiving the channel as of January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>

=== 1964–1977: Previous concepts ===
{{See also|Music video#History and development|Music television}}
Several earlier concepts for [[music television]] had been around since the early 1960s. [[The Beatles]] had used music videos to promote their records starting in the mid-1960s. The creative use of music videos within their 1964 film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]],'' particularly the performance of the song "[[Can't Buy Me Love]]", led MTV later to honor the film's director [[Richard Lester]] with an award for "basically inventing the music video".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/26/lester/singleton/ |title=Richard Lester: A hard day's life |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=June 26, 1999 |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126104727/http://www.salon.com/1999/06/26/lester/singleton/ |archivedate=November 26, 2012 }}</ref>

In his book ''The Mason Williams FCC Rapport'', author [[Mason Williams]] states that he pitched an idea to [[CBS]] for a television program that featured "video-radio", where disc jockeys would play [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] art pieces set to music. CBS rejected the idea, but Williams premiered his own musical composition "[[Classical Gas]]" on the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', where he was head writer. In 1970, Philadelphia-based [[disc jockey]] Bob Whitney created ''[[The Now Explosion]]'', a television series filmed in Atlanta and broadcast in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] to other local television stations throughout the United States. The series featured promotional clips from various popular artists, but was canceled by its distributor in 1971. Several music programs originating outside of the US, including Australia's ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' and the United Kingdom's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', which had initially aired music videos in lieu of performances from artists who were not available to perform live, began to feature them regularly by the mid-1970s.

In 1974, Gary Van Haas, vice president of Televak Corporation, introduced a concept to distribute a music video channel to record stores across the United States, and promoted the channel, named Music Video TV, to distributors and retailers in a May 1974 issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>Billboard Magazine, May 25, 1974</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3 |title=Billboard – Google Books |publisher= |date=May 25, 1974 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref> The channel, which featured video disc jockeys, signed a deal with US Cable in 1978 to expand its audience from retail to cable television. The service was no longer active by the time MTV launched in 1981.

=== 1977–1981: Pre-history ===
==== Pre-launch as "Sight on Sound" ====
In 1977, [[Warner Cable]], a division of [[Warner Communications]] and the precursor of [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] launched the first two-way interactive cable television system named [[QUBE]] in Columbus, Ohio. The QUBE system offered many specialized channels. One of these specialized channels was "Sight on Sound", a music channel that featured concert footage and music-oriented television programs. With the interactive QUBE service, viewers could vote for their favorite songs and artists. MTV was not the only channel run by Warner-Amex to be first tested before its launch; sister channel [[Nickelodeon]] was also first tested as Channel C-3, which only broadcasts the series ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'', before the channel was officially launched in 1979.

The original programming format of MTV was created by media executive [[Robert W. Pittman]], who later became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of MTV Networks.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/pittmanrobe/pittmanrobe.htm |title= The Museum Broadcast Communications – Bob Pittman |access-date= August 3, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113351/http://museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/pittmanrobe/pittmanrobe.htm |archive-date= February 3, 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Pittman had test-driven the music format by producing and hosting a 15-minute show, ''Album Tracks'', on New York City television station [[WNBC|WNBC-TV]] in the late 1970s.

Pittman's boss Warner-Amex executive vice president John Lack had shepherded ''[[PopClips]]'', a television series created by former [[The Monkees|Monkee]]-turned solo artist [[Michael Nesmith]], whose attention had turned to the music video format in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/music.cfm?id=854582006 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710150931/http://living.scotsman.com/music.cfm?id=854582006 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=Scotsman.com Living }}</ref> The inspiration for ''PopClips'' came from a similar program on New Zealand's [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] network named ''[[Radio with Pictures]]'', which premiered in 1976. The concept itself had been in the works since 1966, when major record companies began supplying the creator of [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] with promotional music clips to play on the air at no charge. Few artists made the long trip to New Zealand to appear live.

==== Original VJs and format ====

<!--  Commented out: [[File:Jjjackson-mtv.jpg|thumb|[[J.J. Jackson (media personality)|J.J. Jackson]], one of the original five [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] at MTV's debut]] -->
{{Further|List of MTV VJs}}
The original purpose of MTV was to be "[[music television]]", playing music videos 24/7, guided by on-air personalities known as [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]], or video jockeys. The original slogans of the channel were "You'll never look at music the same way again", and "On cable. In stereo."

MTV's earliest format was modeled after [[Album-oriented rock|AOR (album-oriented rock)]] radio; MTV underwent a transition to copy a full [[Top 40]] station in 1984. Fresh-faced young men and women were hired to host the channel's programming and to introduce music videos that were being played. The term VJ was coined, which was a play on the initialism DJ (disc jockey). Many VJs eventually became celebrities in their own right. The original five MTV VJs in 1981 were [[Nina Blackwood]], [[Mark Goodman]], [[Alan Hunter (VJ)|Alan Hunter]], [[J.J. Jackson (media personality)|J.J. Jackson]] and [[Martha Quinn]]. Initially, popular New York DJ [[Meg Griffin (DJ)|Meg Griffin]] was going to be a VJ, but decided against it at the last minute. The VJs were hired to fit certain demographics the channel was trying to obtain (Goodman was the affable every man, Hunter the popular jock, Jackson the hip radio veteran, Blackwood the bombshell vixen and Quinn the girl next door). Due to the uncertainty of how successful the channel would be, the VJs were told not to buy permanent residencies and to keep their second jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/CachedPage&c=FlexContent&cid=1086896302910|title=Sirius Satellite Radio: Big '80s|access-date=June 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209213943/http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius%2FCachedPage&c=FlexContent&cid=1086896302910|archive-date=February 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The VJs recorded intro and outro voiceovers before broadcast, along with music news, interviews, concert dates and promotions. These segments appeared to air live and debut across the MTV program schedule 24 hours a day and seven days a week, although the segments themselves were pre-taped within a regular work week at MTV's studios.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bernstein|first=Fred|title=A Hard Day's Night with MTV's Video Jocks|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086164,00.html|magazine=[[People Magazine]]|date=October 17, 1983|accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>

The earlier music videos that made up the volume of MTV's programming in the 1980s were promotional videos (or "promos", a term that originated in the United Kingdom) that record companies had commissioned for international use or concert clips from any available sources.

Rock bands and performers of the 1980s who had airplay on MTV ranged from [[New wave music|new wave]] to [[hard rock]] or [[heavy metal music|heavy metal bands]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2006|p=126}}</ref> such as [[Adam Ant]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[The Pretenders]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Eurythmics]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Eurythmics – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4207|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2000|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Culture Club]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Culture Club – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4002|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=1999|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Split Enz]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Ultravox]], [[Duran Duran]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Duran Duran – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4144|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Van Halen]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|author2=Prato, Greg|title=Van Halen – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p133911|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2002|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ratt]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|author2=Prato, Greg|title=Ratt – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5231|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2002|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Def Leppard]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Def Leppard – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4062|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> [[Metallica]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[The Police]], and [[The Cars]]. The channel also rotated the music videos of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who made a career out of parodying other artists' videos.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Weird Al Yankovic – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p140212|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> MTV also aired several specials by "Weird Al" in the 1980s and 1990s under the title ''[[Al TV]]''.

MTV also played [[classic rock]] acts from the 1980s and earlier decades, including [[David Bowie]], [[Dire Straits]] (whose 1985 song and video "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" both referenced MTV and also included the slogan "I want my MTV" in its lyrics), [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Billy Squier]], [[Aerosmith]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Moody Blues]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Daryl Hall & John Oates]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[The Who]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[ZZ Top]]; newly solo acts such as [[Robert Plant]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[David Lee Roth]], and [[Pete Townshend]]; [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] acts such as [[Asia (band)|Asia]], [[The Power Station (band)|The Power Station]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]], and [[Traveling Wilburys]], as well as forgotten acts such as [[Michael Stanley Band]], [[Shoes (band)|Shoes]], [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]], [[Ph.D. (band)|Ph.D.]], [[Rockpile]], [[Bootcamp (band)|Bootcamp]], [[Silicon Teens]] and [[Taxxi]]. The hard rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] publicly appeared without their trademark makeup for the first time on MTV in 1983. The first country-music video aired on MTV was "[[Angel of the Morning]]" by [[Juice Newton]], which first aired on MTV's premiere date. (Newton's video was the third video by a solo female artist to air on MTV, after [[Pat Benatar]] and [[Carly Simon]].)

During the earlier days of the channel, MTV occasionally let other stars take over the channel within an hour as "guest VJs". These guests included musicians such as [[Adam Ant]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Simon LeBon]] and [[Nick Rhodes]] of [[Duran Duran]], [[Tina Turner]]; and comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Martin Short]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[Steven Wright]]; as they chose their favorite music videos.

The 1983 film ''[[Flashdance]]'' was the first film in which its promoters excerpted musical segments from it and supplied them to MTV as music videos, which the channel then aired in regular rotation.<ref name="Litwak">{{Cite book|last1=Litwak|first1=Mark|title=Reel Power: The Struggle for Influence and Success in the New Hollywood|year=1986|publisher=William Morrow & Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-688-04889-7|page=245 }}</ref>

In addition to bringing lesser-known artists into view, MTV was instrumental in adding to the booming '80s dance wave. Videos' budgets increased, and artists began to add fully choreographed dance sections. [[Michael Jackson]]'s music became synonymous with dance. In addition to learning the lyrics, fans also learned his choreography so they could dance along. [[Madonna]] capitalized on dance in her videos, using classically trained jazz and breakdancers. Along with extensive costuming and makeup, Duran Duran used tribal elements, pulled from Dunham technique, in "[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]", and [[Kate Bush]] used a modern dance duet in "[[Running Up That Hill]]". MTV brought more than music into public view, it added to the ever-growing resurgence of dance in the early 1980s that has carried through to today.

In 1984, more record companies and artists began making video clips for their music than in the past, realizing the popularity of MTV and the growing medium. In keeping with the influx of videos, MTV announced changes to its playlists in the November 3, 1984, issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, that would take effect the following week. The playlist categories would be expanded to seven, from three (light, medium, heavy); including New, Light, Breakout, Medium, Active, Heavy and Power. This would ensure artists with hit records on the charts would be get the exposure they deserved, with Medium being a home for the established hits still on the climb up to the top 10; and Heavy being a home for the big hits{{snd}}without the bells and whistles{{snd}}just the exposure they commanded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Seideman|first1=Tony|title=Changes in MTV Playlist (expansion to seven categories)|year=1984|journal=Billboard|issue=November 3, 1984|page=42}}</ref>

In 1985, MTV spearheaded a safe-sex initiative as a response to the AIDS epidemic that continues to influence sexual health currently. In this light, MTV pushed teens to pay more attention to safe-sex because they were most likely more willing to hear this message from MTV than their parents. This showed that MTV was not always influencing youth negatively. Even though in other aspects, MTV was provocative, they had this campaign to showcase their positive influence on youths and safe sex{{snd}}a campaign that still is alive today: "[http://kff.org/its-your-sex-life/ Its Your Sex Life]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepub.viacom.com/sites/mtvpress/Shows/mtv-timeline|title=MTV Timeline|website=thepub.viacom.com|access-date=2016-04-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206065830/http://thepub.viacom.com/sites/mtvpress/Shows/mtv-timeline|archivedate=February 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==== Breaking the "color barrier" ====
[[File:Michael Jackson 1984.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Michael Jackson]], whose discography included music videos such as "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]"]]
During MTV's first few years on the air, very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel. The select few who were in MTV's rotation were [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Eddy Grant]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Joan Armatrading]], [[Musical Youth]], [[The Specials]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. The Specials, which had an integrated lineup of black and white vocalists and musicians, were also the  first people of color to perform on MTV, and the music video for their song "Rat Race" was played as the 58th video on the station's first day of broadcasting.<ref>Hoye, Jacob. MTV Uncensored. Pocket Books, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7434-2682-7}}.</ref>

MTV refused other black artists' videos, such as [[Rick James]]' "[[Super Freak]]", because they did not fit the channel's carefully selected [[Album-oriented rock|album-oriented rock format]] at the time. The exclusion enraged James; he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists' videos on the channel. Rock legend [[David Bowie]] also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ [[Mark Goodman]] in 1983.<ref name="FINDART1">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_110/ai_n16807343/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802013636/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_110/ai_n16807343/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-08-02 |title=Why it took MTV so long to play black music videos |work=Jet |year=2006 }}</ref> MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as had a few others outside the network. "The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the 'research{{' "}}, said Baker years later. "But the research was based on ignorance&nbsp;... we were young, we were cutting edge. We didn't have to be on the cutting edge of racism." Nevertheless, it was Baker who had personally rejected Rick James' video for ''Super Freak'' "because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece of crap. As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV."<ref>Marks, Craig & Tannebaum, Rob, I Want My MTV, Penguin Books, 2011, pp. 167–168</ref>

The network's director of music programming, Buzz Brindle, told an interviewer in 2006, "MTV was originally designed to be a rock music channel. It was difficult for MTV to find African American artists whose music fit the channel's format that leaned toward rock at the outset." Writers Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum noted that the channel "aired videos by plenty of white artists who didn't play rock." Andrew Goodwin later wrote, "[MTV] denied racism, on the grounds that it merely followed the rules of the rock business."<ref>Marks, Craig & Tannebaum, Rob, I Want My MTV, Penguin Books, 2011, pg. 166</ref> MTV senior executive vice president [[Les Garland]] complained decades later, "The worst thing was that 'racism' bullshit{{nbsp}}... there were hardly any videos being made by black artists. Record companies weren't funding them. ''They'' never got charged with racism." However, critics of that defense pointed out that record companies were not funding videos for black artists because they knew that they would have difficulty persuading MTV to play them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Izadi |first=Elahe |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/01/11/how-david-bowie-confronted-mtv-for-ignoring-black-artists-in-the-early-1980s/ |title=This is how David Bowie confronted MTV when it was still ignoring black artists |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref>

Before 1983, Michael Jackson also struggled to receive airtime on MTV.<ref name=blender>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1777 |title=Michael Jackson, "Billie Jean |accessdate=2007-04-11 |work=blender.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312182503/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1777 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> To resolve the struggle and finally "break the color barrier", the president of [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] at the time, [[Walter Yetnikoff]], denounced MTV in a strong, profane statement, threatening to take away MTV's ability to play any of the record label's music videos.<ref name=blender/><ref>The quote from [[Walter Yetnikoff]] reads, "I'm pulling everything we have off the air{{nbsp}}... I'm not going to give you any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy."</ref> However, Les Garland, then acquisitions head, said he decided to air Jackson's "[[Billie Jean]]" video without pressure from CBS.<ref name="FINDART1" /> This was contradicted by CBS head of Business Affairs David Benjamin in Vanity Fair.<ref name="VanityFair"/>

According to ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', Jackson's video for the song "Billie Jean" was "the video that broke the color barrier, even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Beets|first=Greg|title=Blow Up Your Video|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A82541|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=August 3, 2001|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> But change was not immediate. "Billie Jean" was not added to MTV's "medium rotation" playlist (two to three airings per day) until after it had already reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. In the final week of March, it was in "heavy rotation", one week before the MTV debut of Jackson's "[[Beat It]]" video. Prince's "[[Little Red Corvette]]" joined both videos in heavy rotation at the end of April. At the beginning of June, "[[Electric Avenue (song)|Electric Avenue]]" by Eddy Grant joined "Billie Jean", which was still in heavy rotation until mid-June. At the end of August, "[[She Works Hard for the Money]]" by Donna Summer was in heavy rotation on the channel. Herbie Hancock's "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" and Lionel Richie's "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]" was placed in heavy rotation at the end of October and the beginning of November respectively. In final week of November, Donna Summer's "[[Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)|Unconditional Love]]" was in heavy rotation. When Jackson's elaborate video for "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" was released late in the year, which raised the ambition bar for what a video could be, the network's support for it was total; subsequently, more pop and R&B videos were played on MTV.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-08-25-mtv_x.htm|title=Jackson ends black music prejudice on MTV|work=USA Today|first1=Edna|last1=Gundersen|date=August 25, 2005|accessdate=2010-05-13}}</ref>

Following Jackson's and Prince's breakthroughs on MTV, Rick James did several interviews where he brushed off the accomplishment as [[tokenism]], saying in a 1983 interview that was featured in an episode of ''[[Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus]]'' on James, that "any black artist that [had] their video played on MTV should pull their [videos] off MTV."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NhmAGKir40 |title=Rick James & Prince Part 2 tour bus tales |accessdate=June 1, 2020}}</ref>

Regardless of the timeline, many black artists had their videos played in "heavy" rotation the following year (1984). Along with [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Donna Summer]], other black artists such as Billy Ocean, [[Stevie Wonder]], Tina Turner, Lionel Richie, Ray Parker Jr, Rockwell, The Pointer Sisters, The Jacksons, Sheila E and Deniece Williams all had videos played in heavy rotation on MTV.

Eventually, videos from the emerging genre of [[rap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] also began to enter rotation on MTV. A majority of the rap artists appearing on MTV in the mid-1980s such as [[Run-DMC]], [[The Fat Boys]], [[Whodini]], [[LL Cool J]], and the [[Beastie Boys]] were from the [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]].

==== ''Video Music Awards'' ====
{{Main|MTV Video Music Awards}}
In 1984, the channel produced its first ''[[MTV Video Music Award]]s'' show, or VMAs. The first award show, in 1984, was punctuated by a live performance by Madonna of "[[Like A Virgin (song)|Like A Virgin]]". The statuettes that are handed out at the ''Video Music Awards'' are of the MTV moonman, the channel's original image from its first broadcast in 1981. Presently, the ''Video Music Awards'' are MTV's most watched annual event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/157435/|title=MTV's Video Music Award Sponsors Push Cross-Platform Integrations|access-date=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801102159/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/157435/|archive-date=August 1, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Special, annual events ====
{{further|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Special events|l1=List of MTV special events}}
MTV began its annual ''[[Spring Break]]'' coverage in 1986, setting up temporary operations in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], for a week in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. "Spring break is a youth culture event", MTV's vice president [[Doug Herzog]] said at the time. "We wanted to be part of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there are the kinds of people who watch MTV."<ref>{{cite news|title=MTV to Broadcast Spring Break Coverage Live|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|date=March 14, 1986|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-03-14/news/8601160380_1_tas--force-fort-lauderdale-spring|accessdate=June 22, 2012 }}</ref> The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location. The annual tradition continued into the 2000s, when it became de-emphasized and handed off to [[mtvU]], the spin-off channel of MTV targeted at college campuses.

The channel later expanded its beach-themed events to the summer, dedicating most of each summer season to broadcasting live from a beach house at different locations away from New York City, eventually leading to channel-wide branding throughout the summer in the 1990s and early 2000s such as ''Motel California'', ''Summer Share'', ''Isle of MTV'', ''SoCal Summer'', ''Summer in the Keys'', and ''Shore Thing''. MTV VJs hosted blocks of music videos, interview artists and bands, and introduced live performances and other programs from the beach house location each summer.<ref>{{cite news|title=MTV takes over beach|agency=Associated Press|date=July 22, 2000|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/072200/ent_0722000064.shtml|accessdate=June 22, 2012 }}</ref> In the 2000s, as the channel reduced its airtime for music videos and eliminated much of its in-house programming, its annual summer-long events came to an end.

MTV also held week-long music events that took over the presentation of the channel. Examples from the 1990s and 2000s include ''All Access Week'', a week in the summer dedicated to live concerts and festivals; ''Spankin' New Music Week'', a week in the fall dedicated to brand new music videos; and week-long specials that culminated in a particular live event, such as ''Wanna be a VJ'' and the ''Video Music Awards''.<ref>{{cite news|title=MTV lands acts for new music week|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 26, 1999|url=http://www.mcarchives.com/index.asp?id=97|accessdate=June 22, 2012 }}</ref>

At the end of each year, MTV takes advantage of its home location in New York City to broadcast live coverage on New Year's Eve in [[Times Square]]. Several live music performances are featured alongside interviews with artists and bands that were influential throughout the year. For many years from the 1980s to the 2000s, the channel upheld a tradition of having a band perform a [[cover song]] at midnight immediately following the beginning of the new year.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTV plans big New Year's Eve bash|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=December 2, 2003|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a12569/mtv-plans-big-new-years-eve-bash.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012 }}</ref>

==== Live concert broadcasts ====
Throughout its history, MTV has covered global benefit concert series live. For most of July 13, 1985, MTV showed the [[Live Aid]] concerts, held in London and Philadelphia and organized by [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Midge Ure]] to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. While the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network showed only selected highlights during primetime, MTV broadcast 16 hours of coverage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Live Aid: A Look Back At A Concert That Actually Changed The World|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504968/20050629/geldof_bob.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2010|date=June 29, 2005}}</ref>

Along with [[VH1]], MTV broadcast the [[Live 8]] concerts, a series of concerts set in the [[G8]] states and South Africa, on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live 8 Concerts Will Air on MTV, VH1|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504578/20050623/coldplay.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2010|date=June 23, 2005}}</ref> Live 8 preceded the [[31st G8 summit]] and the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. MTV drew heavy criticism for its coverage of Live 8. The network cut to commercials, VJ commentary, or other performances during performances. Complaints surfaced on the Internet over MTV interrupting the reunion of [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name="Stung"/> In response, MTV president Van Toeffler stated that he wanted to broadcast highlights from every venue of Live 8 on MTV and VH1, and clarified that network hosts talked over performances only in transition to commercials, informative segments or other musical performances.<ref name="Defends coverage">{{Cite news|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=MTV defends Live 8 coverage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-10/news/0507100389_1_mtv-and-vh1-van-toffler-mtv-networks-music-group|accessdate=June 8, 2010|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 10, 2005}}</ref> Toeffler acknowledged that "MTV should not have placed such a high priority on showing so many acts, at the expense of airing complete sets by key artists."<ref name="Stung">{{Cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=MTV Stung by Live 8 Criticism|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/07/business/fi-mtv7|accessdate=June 8, 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2005|author2=Gaither, Chris}}</ref> He also blamed the Pink Floyd interruption on a mandatory cable affiliate break.<ref name="Defends coverage"/> MTV averaged 1.4{{nbsp}}million viewers for its original July 2 broadcast of Live 8.<ref name="Stung"/> Consequently, MTV and VH1 aired five hours of uninterrupted Live 8 coverage on July 9, with each channel airing other blocks of artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTV, VH1 to Air Live 8 Performances Uninterrupted|publisher=MTV News|date=July 7, 2005|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1505406/20050707/story.jhtml|accessdate=June 2, 2007 }}</ref>

==== Formatted music series ====
{{further|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Music series 2|l1=List of MTV music programs}}
MTV had debuted ''[[Dial MTV]]'' in 1986, a daily top 10 music video countdown show for which viewers could call the [[toll-free telephone number]] 1-800-DIAL-MTV to request a music video. The show was replaced by ''MTV Most Wanted'' in 1991, which ran until 1996, and later saw a spiritual successor in ''Total Request Live''. The phone number remained in use for video requests until 2006.

1986 also brought the departures of three of the five original VJs, as J.J. Jackson moved back to Los Angeles and returned to radio, while Nina Blackwood moved on to pursue new roles in television.<ref name="departures">WESTBROOK, BRUCE.

Also in 1986, the channel introduced ''[[120 Minutes]]'', a show that featured low-rotation, [[alternative rock]] and other "underground" videos for the next 14 years on MTV and three additional years on sister channel [[MTV2]]. The program then became known as ''[[Subterranean (TV series)|Subterranean]]'' on MTV2. Eight years later, on July 31, 2011, ''120 Minutes'' was resurrected with [[Matt Pinfield]] taking over hosting duties once again and airing monthly on MTV2.

Another late night music video show was added in 1987, ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', which featured heavy metal music and news. Before its abrupt cancellation in 1995, it featured several hosts including [[Riki Rachtman]] and [[Adam Curry]]. A weekly block of music videos with the name ''Headbangers Ball'' aired from 2003 to 2011 on sister channel MTV2, before spending an additional two years as a web-only series on MTV2's website, until ''Headbangers Ball'' was discontinued once again in 2013. Mark Goodman and Alan Hunter departed the network in 1987.

In 1988, MTV debuted ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'', a hip hop/rap formatted program. MTV progressively increased its airing of hit rappers by way of this program, such as [[MC Hammer]], [[Vanilla Ice]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Salt-n-Pepa]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[MC Lyte]], and [[Sir-Mix-A-Lot]]. The channel also played R&B artists such as [[Janet Jackson]], [[New Edition]], [[En Vogue]], [[Bell Biv Devoe]], [[SWV]], [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]], [[New Kids on the Block]], and [[Boyz II Men]]. The program continued until August 1995; it was renamed to simply ''Yo!'' and aired as a one-hour program from 1995 to 1999. The concept was reintroduced as ''[[Direct Effect]]'' in 2000, which became ''[[Sucker Free]]'' in 2006 and was cancelled in 2008, after briefly celebrating the 20th anniversary of ''Yo! MTV Raps'' throughout the months of April and May 2008. Despite its cancellation on MTV, a weekly countdown of hip hop videos known as ''Sucker Free'' still airs on MTV2 through the present day.

In 1989, MTV began to premiere music-based specials such as ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', an acoustic performance show, which has featured dozens of acts as its guests and has remained active in numerous iterations on various platforms for over 20 years.

To further cater to the growing success of R&B, MTV introduced the weekly ''Fade to Black'' in the summer of 1991, which was hosted by [[Al B. Sure!]]. The show was reformatted into the better known ''MTV Jams'' the following year, which incorporated mainstream hip-hop into the playlist. [[Bill Bellamy]] became the new and ongoing host. The show became so successful it spawned its own Most Wanted spinoff titled ''Most Wanted Jams''.

==== First format evolution ====
In 1985, [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] bought [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], which owned MTV and [[Nickelodeon]], renaming the company [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] and beginning this expansion. Before 1987, MTV featured almost exclusively music videos, but as time passed, they introduced a variety of other shows, including some that were originally intended for other channels.

Non-music video programming began in the late 1980s, with the introduction of a music news show ''The Week in Rock'', which was also the beginning of MTV's news division, MTV News. Around this time, MTV also introduced a fashion news show, ''[[House of Style]]''; a dance show, ''[[Club MTV]]''; and a game show, ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. Despite these programs not being music video-based, ''Remote Control'' often included excerpts of music videos when some of the music-related questions were asked, [[House of Style]] occasionally included extremely short music video clips in interviews featured in some of the music-related segments on the show, and [[Club MTV]] often included music videos excerpts inbetween clips of the audience dancing to the song. All three shows were still largely based around the world of music, despite not being based around music videos.

Following the success of the ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]'', in an effort to branch out from music into movies and broader pop culture, MTV started the ''[[MTV Movie & TV Awards]]'' in 1992, which continues presently. MTV also created an award show for Europe after the success of the ''Video Music Awards''. The ''[[MTV Europe Music Award]]s'', or the EMAs, were created in 1994, ten years after the debut of the VMAs.

These new shows were just the beginning of new genres of shows to make an impact on MTV. As the format of the network continued to evolve, more genres of shows began to appear.

=== 1991–1997 ===
==== Alternative is mainstream ====
[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] led a sweeping transition into the rise of [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] music on MTV in 1991, with their video for "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]". By late 1991 going into 1992, MTV began frequently airing videos from their heavily promoted "[[Buzz Bin]]", such as Nirvana, [[Pearl Jam]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Tori Amos]], [[PM Dawn]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Björk]], and [[Gin Blossoms]]. MTV increased rotation of its weekly alternative music program ''[[120 Minutes]]'' and added the daily ''[[Alternative Nation]]'' to play videos of these and other underground music acts. Subsequently, grunge and alternative rock had a rise in mainstream cultures, while 1980s-style [[Glam metal|glam bands]] and traditional rockers were phased out, with a few exceptions such as [[Aerosmith]] and [[Tom Petty]]. Older acts such as [[R.E.M.]] and [[U2]] remained relevant by making their music more experimental or contemporary. MTV also played many hard rock acts such as [[Pantera]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and other death/heavy metal acts at the time period, which saw rotation especially in ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', a program equipped for the genre.

Over the next few years, more hit alternative rock acts were on heavy rotation, such as [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Beck]], [[Therapy?]], [[Radiohead]], and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. Other hit acts such as [[Weezer]], [[Collective Soul]], [[Blind Melon]], [[The Cranberries]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], and [[Silverchair]] followed in the next couple of years. Alternative bands that appeared on ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' included [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. Also at this time, MTV began promoting new [[pop punk]] acts, most successfully [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], and [[ska punk]] acts such as [[No Doubt]], [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], and [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]. Alternative singers that were more pop-oriented were also added to the rotation with success, such as [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Fiona Apple]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]].

==== Gangsta rap ====
In the early-mid 1990s, MTV added [[gangsta rap]]pers with a less pop-friendly sound to its rotation, such as [[Tupac Shakur]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Warren G]], [[Ice-T]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Nas]], and [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]]. In 1992, Dr Dre's [[G funk]] single "[[Nuthin' but a "G" Thang]]" became a crossover hit, with its humorous ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]''-influenced video becoming an MTV staple despite the network's historic orientation towards rock music.

==== Electronica ====
By 1997, MTV focused heavily on introducing [[electronica]] acts into the mainstream, adding them to its musical rotation, including [[The Prodigy]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Moby]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Pendulum (ambient band)|Pendulum]], [[Daft Punk]], [[The Crystal Method]], and [[Fatboy Slim]]. Some musicians who proceeded to experiment with electronica were still played on MTV including [[Madonna]], [[U2]], [[David Bowie]], [[Radiohead]], and [[Smashing Pumpkins]]. That year, MTV also attempted to introduce [[neo-swing]] bands, but they were not met with much success.

==== Rise of the directors ====
To accompany the new sounds that were appearing on MTV, a new form of music videos came about: more artistic, experimental, and technically-accomplished than those of the 1980s. Several noted film directors got their start creating music videos. After pressure from the Music Video Production Association, MTV began listing the names of the videos' directors at the bottom of the credits by December 1992. As a result, MTV's viewers became familiar with the names of [[Spike Jonze]], [[Michel Gondry]], [[David Fincher]], [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]], [[Samuel Bayer]], [[Matt Mahurin]], [[Mark Romanek]], [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Mark Pellington]], [[Tarsem]], [[Hype Williams]], [[Jake Scott (director)|Jake Scott]], [[Jonathan Glazer]], [[Marcus Nispel]], [[F. Gary Gray]], Jim Yukich, [[Russell Mulcahy]], [[Steve Barron]], [[Marty Callner]], and [[Michael Bay]], among others.

As the PBS series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]''<ref>[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] (2004).[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/ "The Way The Music Died"]</ref> explored, MTV was a driving force that catapulted music videos to a mainstream audience, turning music videos into an art form as well as a marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: "I know when I worked with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it."<ref name="The MTV Effect">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/perfect/mtv.html|title=PBS.org|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref>

==== First reality programs ====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MTV-FEAR PILOT.GIF|thumb|Christina, a contestant on the pilot episode of ''[[MTV's Fear]]'']] -->
In the early-mid 1990s, MTV debuted its first reality shows, ''[[Real World (TV series)|Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]''. Building on the success of ''The Real World'' and ''Road Rules'', MTV placed a stronger focus on reality shows and related series at this time. The first round of these shows came with game shows such as ''[[Singled Out]]'', reality-based comedy shows such as ''[[Buzzkill (TV series)|Buzzkill]]'', and late-night talk shows such as ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' and ''[[Loveline]]''.

==== First animated programs ====
{{further|MTV Animation}}
In a continuing bid to become a more diverse network focusing on youth and culture as well as music, MTV added animated shows to its lineup in the early 1990s. The animation showcase ''[[Liquid Television]]'' (a co-production between [[BBC]] and MTV produced in San Francisco by [[Colossal Pictures]]) was one of the channel's first programs to focus on the medium. In addition to airing original shows created specifically for MTV, the channel also occasionally aired episodes of original cartoon series produced by sister channel Nickelodeon (''[[Nicktoons]]'') in the early 1990s.

MTV has a history of cartoons with mature themes including ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[Æon Flux]]'', and ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]''. Although the channel has gone on to debut many other animated shows, few of MTV's other cartoon series have been renewed for additional seasons, regardless of their reception.

==== First comedy and drama programs ====
{{further|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Comedy series|l1=List of MTV comedy programs|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Drama|l2=List of MTV drama programs}}
MTV has a long history of airing both comedy and drama programs with scripted or improvised premises. Examples from the early-mid 1990s include sketch-based comedies such as ''[[Just Say Julie]]'', ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'', and ''[[The Jenny McCarthy Show (1997 TV series)|The Jenny McCarthy Show]]''.

=== 1997–2008 ===
==== Teen pop ====
In late 1997, MTV began shifting more progressively towards [[teen pop]] music, inspired by the overseas success of the [[Spice Girls]], the [[Backstreet Boys]], and [[NSYNC]] in Europe. Between 1998 and 1999, MTV's musical content composed heavily of videos of [[boy band]]s such as the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, [[girl group]]s such as the Spice Girls, and teen pop "princesses" such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lynda Thomas]], [[Mandy Moore]], and [[Jessica Simpson]]. Airplay of rock, electronica, and alternative acts was reduced.

==== Bling-era hip hop ====
Bling-era hip hop played in heavy rotation on MTV at this time, through the likes of [[Puff Daddy]], [[Mase]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Master P]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Eminem]], [[50 Cent]], [[Jadakiss]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], [[Kanye West]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Timbaland]], and their associates. In contrast to the previous gangsta rap era, this era of hip hop had a more polished sound and materialist subject matter. R&B was also heavily represented with acts such as [[Aaliyah]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[702 (group)|702]], [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].

==== ''Return of the Rock'' ====
Beginning in late 1997, MTV progressively reduced its airing of rock music videos, leading to the slogan among skeptics, "Rock is dead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2000/09/08/mtv_awards/|title=Salon: Rock is dead and well at the MTV Video Awards|access-date=July 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114090331/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2000/09/08/mtv_awards/|archive-date=January 14, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The facts that at the time rock music fans were less materialistic, and bought less music based on television suggestion, were cited as reasons that MTV abandoned its once core music. MTV instead devoted its musical airtime mostly to pop and hip hop/R&B music. All rock-centric shows were eliminated and the rock-related categories of the ''Video Music Awards'' were pared down to one.

From this time until 2004, MTV made some periodic efforts to reintroduce pop rock music videos to the channel. Pop punk band [[Blink-182]] received regular airtime on MTV at this time, due in large part to their "[[All the Small Things]]" video that made fun of the boy bands that MTV was airing at the time. Meanwhile, some rock bands that were not receiving MTV support, such as [[Korn]] and [[Creed (band)|Creed]], continued to sell albums. Then, upon the release of Korn's [[rap rock]] album ''[[Follow the Leader (Korn album)|Follow the Leader]]'', MTV began playing their videos "[[Got the Life]]" and "[[Freak on a Leash]]".

A band promoted by Korn, [[Limp Bizkit]], received airtime for their cover of [[George Michael]]'s "[[Faith (Limp Bizkit song)|Faith]]", which became a hit. Subsequently, MTV began airing more rap/rock hybrid acts, such as Limp Bizkit and [[Kid Rock]]. Some rock acts with more comical videos, such as [[Rob Zombie]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Foo Fighters]], also received airtime.

In the fall of 1999, MTV announced a special ''Return of the Rock'' weekend,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mancini|first=Robert|title=Coal Chamber Lines Up "Nothing" Tour|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427187/19990929/coal_chamber.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2010|date=September 29, 1999}}</ref> in which new rock acts received airtime, after which a compilation album was released. [[System of a Down]], [[Staind]], [[Godsmack]], [[Green Day]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Papa Roach]], [[P.O.D.]], [[Sevendust]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Kittie]], [[Static X]], and [[CKY (band)|CKY]] were among the featured bands. These bands received some airtime on MTV and more so on [[MTV2]], though both channels gave emphasis to the rock/rap acts.

By 2000, [[Linkin Park]], [[Sum 41]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Mudvayne]], Cold, [[At the Drive-In]], [[Alien Ant Farm]], and other acts were added to the musical rotation. MTV also launched subscription channel [[MTVX]] to play rock music videos exclusively, an experiment that lasted until 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTV Dis(miss)es Rock in Favor of Hip Hop|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/2002/may/item8.shtml|work=Antimusic.com|accessdate=June 8, 2010|date=May 9, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522053237/http://www.antimusic.com/news/2002/may/item8.shtml|archive-date=May 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> A daily music video program on MTV that carried the name ''Return of the Rock'' ran through early 2001, replaced by a successor, ''All Things Rock'', from 2002 until 2004.

==== ''Total Request Live'' ====
[[File:MTV Times Square studio.jpg|thumb|[[One Astor Plaza|1515 Broadway]] in [[Times Square]] ]]
{{Main|Total Request Live}}
In 1997, MTV introduced its new studios in [[Times Square]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/report-mtv-to-vacate-times-square-studio-252473/|title=Report: MTV To Vacate Times Square Studio|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2009-08-11|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> MTV created four shows in the late 1990s that centered on music videos: ''[[MTV Live (U.S. TV program)|MTV Live]]'', ''[[Total Request]]'', ''[[Say What?]]'', and''[[12 Angry Viewers]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} A year later, in 1998, MTV merged ''Total Request'' and ''MTV Live'' into a live daily top 10 countdown show, ''[[Total Request Live]]'', which became known as ''TRL.''

From 1998 to 2003, MTV also aired several other music video programs from its studios. These programs included ''[[Say What? Karaoke]]'', a game show hosted by [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dave-holmes-party-of-one_n_57869fdde4b03fc3ee4f19e2|title=For This MTV VJ, Music Paved The Way To An Out And Happy Life|last=Wong|first=Curtis M.|date=2016-07-15|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> In the early 2000s MTV aired ''VJ for a Day'', hosted by [[Ray Munns]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/everyone-wants-to-be-a-vj/|title=Everyone Wants To Be A VJ|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> MTV also aired ''Hot Zone'', hosted by [[Ananda Lewis]], which featured pop music videos during the midday time period.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/21/style/the-extra-v-in-very-vip.html|title=The Extra 'V' in Very V.I.P.|last=Century|first=Douglas|date=1999-11-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Other programs at the time included ''[[Sucker Free]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2000/digital/reviews/mtv-s-direct-effect-1200465769/|title=MTV's "Direct Effect"|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|date=2000-12-20|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> ''BeatSuite'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ0EAAAAMBAJ&q=beatsuite&pg=PA79|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1999-05-08|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> and blocks of music videos hosted by VJs simply called ''Music Television''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==== Milestones and specials ====
Around 1999 through 2001, as MTV aired fewer music videos throughout the day, it regularly aired compilation specials from its then 20-year history to look back on its roots. An all-encompassing special, ''MTV Uncensored'', premiered in 1999 and was later released as a book.<ref>{{IMDb title|393445|MTV Uncensored}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title = Amazon.com|isbn = 0743426827|last1 = Hoye|first1 = Jacob|last2 = Levin|first2 = David P.|last3 = Cohn|first3 = Stuart|year = 2001|url = https://archive.org/details/mtvuncensored00hoye}}</ref>

MTV celebrated its 20th anniversary on August 1, 2001, beginning with a 12-hour long retrospective called ''MTV20: Buggles to Bizkit'', which featured over 100 classic videos played chronologically, hosted by various VJs in reproductions of MTV's old studios. The day of programming culminated in a three-hour celebratory live event called ''MTV20: Live and Almost Legal'', which was hosted by [[Carson Daly]] and featured numerous guests from MTV's history, including the original VJs from 1981. Various other related ''MTV20'' specials aired in the months surrounding the event.

[[Janet Jackson]] became the inaugural honoree of the "[[MTV Icon]]" award, "an annual recognition of artists who have made significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the [[MTV generation]]."<ref name="mtvICON">{{cite magazine|last=Jeckell|first=Barry|title=MTV To Honor Janet Jackson|magazine=Billboard|date=January 10, 2001|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80773/mtv-to-honor-janet-jackson|accessdate=2008-03-16|ref=harv}}</ref> Subsequent recipients included [[Aerosmith]], [[Metallica]], and [[The Cure]].

Five years later, on August 1, 2006, MTV celebrated its 25th anniversary. On their website, MTV.com, visitors could watch the very first hour of MTV, including airing the original promos and commercials from [[Mountain Dew]], [[Atari]], [[Chewels]] gum, and [[Coty, Inc.|Jovan]]. Videos were also shown from [[The Buggles]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Rod Stewart]], and others. The introduction of the first five VJs was also shown. Additionally, MTV.com put together a "yearbook" consisting of the greatest videos of each year from 1981 to 2006. MTV itself only mentioned the anniversary once on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]''.

Although MTV reached its 30th year of broadcasting in 2011, the channel itself passed over this milestone in favor of its current programming schedule. The channel instead aired its 30th anniversary celebrations on its sister networks [[MTV2]] and [[VH1 Classic]]. Nathaniel Brown, senior vice president of communications for MTV, confirmed that there were no plans for an on-air MTV celebration similar to the channel's 20th anniversary. Brown explained, "MTV as a brand doesn't age with our viewers. We are really focused on our current viewers, and our feeling was that our anniversary wasn't something that would be meaningful to them, many of whom weren't even alive in 1981."<ref>[http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/heard/12618/mtv-apparently-wants-to-be-29-forever/ MTV Apparently Wants To Be 29 Forever] – [[Yahoo! Music]] (released August 1, 2011)</ref>

==== Decline in music videos ====
From 1995 to 2000, MTV played 36.5% fewer music videos. MTV president Van Toeffler stated: "Clearly, the novelty of just showing music videos has worn off. It's required us to reinvent ourselves to a contemporary audience."<ref name="Billboard 2001-02-17">{{citation|author=Hay, Carla|title=Proper role of music TV debated in US|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA68|work=Billboard|date=February 17, 2001|page=68}}</ref> Despite targeted efforts to play certain types of music videos in limited rotation, MTV greatly reduced its overall rotation of music videos by the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/arts/television/mike-judges-beavis-and-butt-head-on-mtv.html|work=New York Times|title=Look Who's Trashing 'Jersey Shore' Now|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-08|first1=Jon|last1=Caramanica}}</ref> While music videos were featured on MTV up to eight hours per day in 2000, the year 2008 saw an average of just three hours of music videos per day on MTV. The rise of [[social media]] and websites like [[YouTube]] as a convenient outlet for the promotion and viewing of music videos signaled this reduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fall Of 'TRL' And The Rise of Internet Video|date=November 12, 2008|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96869060|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref>

As the decade progressed, MTV continued to play some music videos instead of relegating them exclusively to its [[List of MTV channels|sister channels]], but nevertheless began to air the videos only in the early morning hours or in a condensed form on ''[[Total Request Live]]''. As a result of these programming changes, [[Justin Timberlake]] implored MTV to "play more damn videos!" while giving an acceptance speech at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name="vma2007">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20053775_20055499,00.html|title=Justin Timberlake to MTV: "Play more damn videos!"|magazine=[[People Magazine]]|date=September 9, 2007|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> Despite the challenge from Timberlake, MTV continued to decrease its total rotation time for music videos in 2007, and the channel eliminated its long-running special tags for music videos such as "Buzzworthy" (for under-represented artists), "Breakthrough" (for visually stunning videos), and "Spankin' New" (for brand new videos). Additionally, the historic [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]] typeface, which MTV displayed at the beginning and end of all music videos since 1981, was phased out in favor of larger text and less information about the video's record label and director. The classic font can still be seen in "prechyroned" versions of old videos on sister network [[MTV Classic (U.S. TV network)|MTV Classic]], which had their title information recorded onto the same tape as the video itself.

==== Further reality programs ====
MTV's next round of reality shows came in the late 1990s to early 2000s, as the channel shifted its focus to prank/comedic shows such as ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'', ''[[Jackass (franchise)|Jackass]]'', and ''[[Wildboyz]]'', and game shows such as ''[[The Challenge (TV series)|The Challenge]]'' (aka ''Real World/Road Rules Challenge''), ''[[The Blame Game (U.S. game show)|The Blame Game]]'', ''[[webRIOT]]'', and ''[[Say What? Karaoke]]''. A year later, in 2000, ''[[Fear (TV series)|MTV's Fear]]'' became the first scare-based/supernatural reality show and the first reality show in which contestants filmed themselves. MTV continued to experiment with late night talk shows in the early 2000s with relatively short-lived programs such as ''[[Kathy's So-Called Reality]]'', starring [[Kathy Griffin]]; and ''[[The Tom Green Show]]''.

Some of the reality shows on the network also followed the lives of musicians. ''[[The Osbournes]]'', a reality show based on the everyday life of [[Black Sabbath]] frontman [[Ozzy Osbourne]], his wife [[Sharon Osbourne|Sharon]], and two of their children, [[Jack Osbourne|Jack]] and [[Kelly Osbourne|Kelly]], premiered on MTV in 2002. The show went on to become one of the network's biggest-ever successes and was also recognized for the Osbourne family members' heavy use of profanity, which MTV censored for broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Ozzy Knows Best|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,227533,00.html|work=Time|date=April 7, 2002|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> It also kick-started a musical career for [[Kelly Osbourne]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Family: Kelly|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/osbournes/hub_kelly.jhtml|work=The Osbournes|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> while Sharon Osbourne went on to host her own [[The Sharon Osbourne Show|self-titled talk show]] on US television.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Family: Sharon|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/osbournes/hub_sharon2.jhtml|work=The Osbournes|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> Production ended on ''The Osbournes'' in November 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Show over for MTV's The Osbournes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4024941.stm|work=BBC News|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> In the fall of 2004, Ozzy Osbourne's reality show ''[[Battle for Ozzfest]]'' aired; the show hosted competitions between bands vying to play as part of [[Ozzfest]], a yearly heavy metal music tour across the United States hosted by Osbourne.

In 2003, MTV added ''[[Punk'd]]'', a project by [[Ashton Kutcher]] to play pranks on various celebrities, and in 2004 they added ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', a show about adding aesthetic and functional modifications to cars and other vehicles. Another show was ''[[Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica]]'', a reality series that followed the lives of pop singers [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Nick Lachey]], a music celebrity couple. It began in 2003 and ran for four seasons, ending in early 2005; the couple later divorced. The success of ''Newlyweds'' was followed in June 2004 by ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]'', which documented the beginnings of the music career of [[Ashlee Simpson]], Jessica Simpson's younger sister.

In 2005 and 2006, MTV continued its focus on reality shows, with the debuts of shows such as ''[[8th & Ocean]]'', ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]'', ''[[Next (2005 TV series)|Next]]'', ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'', ''[[Two-A-Days]]'', ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]'', ''[[Parental Control]]'', and ''[[Viva La Bam]]'', featuring [[Bam Margera]].

In 2007, MTV aired the reality show ''[[A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila]]'', chronicling MySpace sensation [[Tila Tequila]]'s journey to find a companion.

==== Further comedy and drama programs ====
{{further|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Comedy series|l1=List of MTV comedy programs|List of programs broadcast by MTV#Drama|l2=List of MTV drama programs}}
MTV continued to air both comedy and drama programs with scripted or improvised premises at this time. Examples from the late 1990s and early-mid 2000s include sketch-based comedies such as ''[[The Lyricist Lounge Show]]'' and ''[[Doggy Fizzle Televizzle]]'', as well as soap operas such as ''[[Undressed]]'' and ''[[Spyder Games]]''.

=== 2008–present ===
==== ''FNMTV'' and ''AMTV'' ====
Prior to its finale in 2008, MTV's main source of music videos was ''Total Request Live'', airing four times per week, featuring short clips of music videos along with VJs and guests. MTV was experimenting at the time with new ideas for music programs to replace the purpose of ''TRL'' but with a new format.<ref name="variety-trl">{{Cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992211.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Variety: MTV to retire 'TRL'; Long-running show to end run – 15 September 2008|first=Daniel|last=Frankel|date=September 15, 2008|access-date=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604130352/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992211.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|archive-date=June 4, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In mid-2008, MTV premiered new music video programming blocks called ''[[FNMTV]]'' and a weekly special event called ''FNMTV Premieres'', hosted from Los Angeles by [[Pete Wentz]] of the band [[Fall Out Boy]], which was designed to premiere new music videos and have viewers provide instantaneous feedback.<ref name="FNMTV press release">{{cite web|url=http://mtvpress.com/press/release/its_an_fn_mtv_summer/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829001346/http://mtvpress.com/press/release/its_an_fn_mtv_summer/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 29, 2008 |title=MTVpress.com |publisher=MTVpress.com |date=May 29, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-07 }}</ref>

The ''FNMTV Premieres'' event ended before the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]] in September. With the exception of a holiday themed episode in December 2008 and an unrelated ''Spring Break'' special in March 2009 with the same title, ''FNMTV Premieres'' never returned to the channel's regular program schedule, leaving MTV without any music video programs hosted by VJs for the first time in its history.

[[File:AMTV.png|thumb|''[[AMTV]]'', the name of MTV's music video programming from 2009 to 2013]]
Music video programming returned to MTV in March 2009 as ''[[AMTV]]'', an early morning block of music videos that originally aired from 3{{nbsp}}am to 9{{nbsp}}am on most weekdays.<ref name="amtv-nytimes">{{cite news|title=MTV to Put a Bit More Music Back, in the A.M.|date=March 29, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/business/media/30mtv.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-29|first=Brian|last=Stelter}}</ref> It was renamed ''Music Feed'' in 2013 with a reduced schedule. Unlike the ''FNMTV'' block that preceded it, ''Music Feed'' featured many full-length music videos, including some older videos that had been out of regular rotation for many years on MTV. It also featured music news updates, interviews, and performances.<ref name="amtv-nytimes" /> For many years, ''Music Feed'' was the only program on MTV's main channel that was dedicated to music videos.

During the rest of the day, MTV used to play excerpts from music videos in [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]] format during the [[closing credits]] of most programs, along with the address of a website to encourage the viewer to watch the full video online. MTV positioned its website, MTV.com, as its primary destination for music videos, but this strategy was abandoned.

==== Recent reality programs ====
[[File:Jersey shore guys, shooting in Florence, may 2011.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Pauly D]] and [[The Situation (TV personality)|The Situation]] of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' in 2011]]
In late 2009, MTV shifted its focus back to ''Real World''-style reality programming with the premiere of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', a program that brought high ratings to the channel and also caused controversy due to some of its content.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Jersey Shore'' finale breaks ratings for MTV|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 22, 2010|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/jersey-shore-finale-breaks-ratings-records-for-mtv.html|accessdate=2010-05-13}}</ref>

With backlash towards what some consider too much superficial content on the network, a 2009 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article also stated the intention of MTV to shift its focus towards more socially conscious media, which the article labels "MTV for the Obama era."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Arango, Tim|title=Make Room, Cynics; MTV Wants to Do Some Good|date=April 18, 2009|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/media/19mtv.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=the%20buried%20life&st=cse|accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> Shows in that vein included ''[[T.I.'s Road to Redemption]]'' and [[Fonzworth Bentley]]'s finishing school show ''[[From G's to Gents]]''.

The channel also aired a new show around this time titled ''[[16 and Pregnant]]'', which documented the lives of teenagers expecting babies. This had a follow-up show after the first season titled ''[[Teen Mom]]'', which follows some of the teens through the first stages with their newborns.

MTV found further success with ''[[The Buried Life]]'', a program about four friends traveling across the country to check off a list of "100 things to do before I die" and helping others along the way. Another recent reality program is MTV's ''Hired'', which follows the employment interviewing process; candidates meet with career coach [[Ryan Kahn]] from ''[[Dream Careers]]'' and at the end of each episode one candidate lands the job of their dreams.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Monday: New in business TV, movies, books, magazines|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 2, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/monday/2010-05-02-first-monday-may_N.htm|accessdate=2010-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MTV – You're Hired|publisher=lasplash.com|date=April 24, 2010|url=http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Entertainment/cat_index_la_events/MTV|access-date=May 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024023123/http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Entertainment/cat_index_la_events/MTV|archive-date=October 24, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, ''[[Punk'd]]'' returned with a revolving door of new hosts per episode. Meanwhile, spin-offs from ''Jersey Shore'' such as ''[[The Pauly D Project]]'' and ''[[Snooki & Jwoww|Snooki & JWoww]]'' were produced. MTV announced plans to re-enter the late-night comedy space in 2012, with ''[[Nikki & Sara Live]]'', an unscripted series by comedians [[Nikki Glaser]] and [[Sara Schaefer]]. The program initially aired weekly from MTV's studios in Times Square.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTV Joins Late-Night Space With 'Nikki and Sara Show'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mtv-late-night-nikki-sara-show-337900|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 14, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>

==== Recent music programs ====
MTV again resurrected the long-running series ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in 2009 with performances from acts such as [[Adele]] and [[Paramore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/unplugged/|title=''Unplugged''|publisher=Mtv.com|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> However, unlike past ''Unplugged'' specials, these new recordings usually only aired in their entirety on MTV's website, MTV.com. Nevertheless, short clips of the specials were shown on MTV during the ''AMTV'' block of music videos in the early morning hours. On June 12, 2011, MTV aired a traditional television premiere of a new installment of ''MTV Unplugged'' instead of a web debut. The featured artist was rapper [[Lil Wayne]] and the show debuted both on MTV and MTV2. The channel followed up with a similar television premiere of ''MTV Unplugged'' with [[Florence and the Machine]] on April 8, 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Florence and the Machine 'Unplugged' To Premiere Sunday on MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682255/florence-and-the-machine-unplugged.jhtml|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21|work=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>

MTV launched ''10 on Top'' in May 2010 with little promotion throughout its run, a weekly program airing on Saturdays and hosted by [[Lenay Dunn]], that counted down the top 10 most trending and talked about topics of the week (generally focused on entertainment). Dunn also appeared in segments between MTV's shows throughout the day as a recognizable personality and face of the channel in the absence of traditional VJs aside from its MTV News correspondents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/10_on_top/series.jhtml |title=10 on Top |publisher=MTV.com |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>

The animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' returned to MTV in October 2011, with new episodes. As with the original version of the series that ran from 1993 to 1997, the modern-day ''Beavis and Butt-head'' featured segments in which its main characters watch and satirize music videos, as well as the newer addition of reality TV shows such as ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Mike-Judges-Most-Wanted/15748 |title=Beavis and Butt-head DVD news: Box Art for Beavis and Butt-head – Mike Judge's Most Wanted |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=July 29, 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703211507/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Mike-Judges-Most-Wanted/15748 |archivedate=July 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2012, MTV debuted ''Clubland'', which previously existed as an hour of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] videos during the ''AMTV'' video block. The show had no host, but most editorial content was pushed online by the show's [[Tumblr]] and other social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter.

MTV launched a new talk show based on hip hop music on April 12, 2012<!-- at 12:02&nbsp;am ET - relevant? -->, called ''Hip Hop POV'', hosted by [[Amanda Seales]], Bu Thiam, [[Charlamagne]], [[Devi Dev]], and Sowmya Krishnamurthy. The show featured hosted commentary on the headlines in hip hop culture, providing opinions on new music, granting insider access to major events, and including artist interviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2012/03/mtv_announces_new_late_night_rap_show_re.html |title=MTV Announces New Late Night Rap Show, Recruits Charlamagne Tha God |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511191024/http://www.sohh.com/2012/03/mtv_announces_new_late_night_rap_show_re.html |archivedate=May 11, 2012 }}</ref> ''Hip Hip POV'' lasted several episodes before going on hiatus. The show was supposed to return in Fall 2012, but was moved to MTV2 instead, where it was rebranded and merged with ''[[Sucker Free]] Countdown''. The new show debuted as ''[[The Week in Jams]]'' on October 28, 2012.

==== Post-''TRL'' live shows ====
MTV launched a live talk show, ''[[It's On with Alexa Chung]]'', on June 15, 2009. The host of the program, [[Alexa Chung]], was described as a "younger, more [[Web 2.0]]" version of [[Jimmy Fallon]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Liz|first=Miller Shannon|title=MTV's It's on With Alexa Chung a Younger, More Web 2.0 Jimmy Fallon|url=http://newteevee.com/2009/06/16/mtvs-its-on-with-alexa-chung-a-younger-more-web-2-0-jimmy-fallon/|work=newteevee.com|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721074654/http://newteevee.com/2009/06/16/mtvs-its-on-with-alexa-chung-a-younger-more-web-2-0-jimmy-fallon/|archive-date=July 21, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although it was filmed in the same Times Square studio where ''TRL'' used to be broadcast, the network stated that "the only thing the two shows have in common is the studio location."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Social Network, TV Network: Did You Tweet?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/arts/television/14stel.html|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-12|work=The New York Times}}</ref> ''It's On'' was cancelled in December of the same year, which again eliminated the only live in-studio programming from MTV's schedule, just one year after ''TRL'' was also cancelled.

Shortly after Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, the channel aired several hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brokes|title=A Star Idolized and Haunted, Michael Jackson Dies at 50|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/music/26jackson.html?ref=obituaries|work=New York Times|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> The temporary shift in MTV's programming culminated the following week with the channel's live coverage of Jackson's memorial service.<ref>{{cite web|title=More adds, loose ends, and lament |url=http://blog.tylerc.com/post/22264141144/more-adds-loose-ends-and-lament |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204010253/http://blog.tylerc.com/post/22264141144/more-adds-loose-ends-and-lament |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 4, 2012 |work=The 120 Minutes Archive |date=July 25, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}</ref> MTV aired similar one-hour live specials with music videos and news updates following the death of [[Whitney Houston]] on February 11, 2012, and the death of [[Adam Yauch]] of the [[Beastie Boys]] on May 4, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitney Houston: MTV, BET, VH1 low key in coverage|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/02/whitney-houston-mtv-bet-vh1-low-key-in-coverage.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MTV's 'Adam Yauch: Remembering A Beastie Boy' Memorial|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2012/05/04/adam-yauch-remembering-a-beastie-boy-mtv/|work=MTV Buzzworthy|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>

The channel tried its hand again at live programming with the premiere of a half-hour program called ''The Seven'' in September 2010. The program counted down seven entertainment-related stories of interest to viewers (and included some interview segments among them), having aired weekdays at 5{{nbsp}}pm with a weekend wrap-up at 10&nbsp;am ET. Shortly after its debut, the show was slightly retooled as it dropped co-host Julie Alexandria but kept fellow co-host [[Kevin Manno]]; the Saturday recap show was eliminated as well. ''The Seven'' was cancelled on June 13, 2011. Manno's only assignment at MTV post-''Seven'' was conducting an interview with a band which only aired on MTV.com. Manno is no longer employed with MTV and has since appeared as an occasional correspondent on the [[LXTV]]-produced NBC series ''1st Look''.

Presently, MTV airs sporadic live specials called ''MTV First''. The short program, produced by [[MTV News]], debuted in early 2011 and continues to air typically once every couple of weeks on any given weekday. The specials usually begin at 7:53&nbsp;pm. ET, led by one of MTV News' correspondents who will conduct a live interview with a featured artist or actor who has come to MTV to premiere a music video or movie trailer. MTV starts its next scheduled program at 8:00&nbsp;pm, while the interview and chat with fans continues on MTV.com for another 30 to 60 minutes. Since its debut in 2011, ''MTV First'' has featured high-profile acts such as [[Lady Gaga]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and [[Justin Bieber]]. In the absence of daily live programs such as ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'', ''[[It's On with Alexa Chung]]'', and ''The Seven'' to facilitate such segments, the channel now uses ''MTV First'' as its newest approach to present music video premieres and bring viewers from its main television channel to its website for real-time interaction with artists and celebrities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga's 'Yoü And I' Video To Premiere Thursday on MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669079/lady-gaga-you-and-i-music-video-thursday.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Katy Perry Brings 'Wide Awake' Video To MTV!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1687352/katy-perry-wide-awake-video-premiere.jhtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Usher Brings New Song 'Twisted' To MTV Wednesday|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685095/usher-twisted-climax-scream-mtv-premiere.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=May 15, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Justin Bieber Goes 'More Mature' With 'Boyfriend' Video|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1684454/justin-bieber-boyfriend-mature-video.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>

In September 2009, the channel aired ''[[Popzilla]]'', which showcased and imitated celebrities in an animated form.

In January 2016, MTV returned to animation with ''[[Greatest Party Story Ever]]''.

As MTV expanded, music videos and VJ-guided programming were no longer the centerpiece of its programming. Today, MTV's programming covers a wide variety of genres and formats aimed primarily at [[Generation Z]] [[adolescence|adolescents]] and [[young adult (psychology)|young adult]]s. In addition to its original programming, MTV has also aired original and syndicated programs from ViacomCBS-owned siblings and third-party networks.<ref name="mtvweekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/weekly.jhtml|title=MTV.com – On-Air – MTV Week at a Glance}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/weekly.jhtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021022001643/http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/weekly.jhtml|archivedate=October 22, 2002|title=MTV schedule for the week of October 20, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/life-as-we-know-it/natural-disasters/episode/356411/summary.html|title=Life As We Know It: Natural Disasters|publisher=TV.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/weekly.jhtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516214550/http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/weekly.jhtml|archivedate=May 16, 2007|title=MTV.com – On-Air – MTV Week at a Glance}}</ref>

MTV is also a producer of films aimed at young adults through its production label, [[MTV Films]], and has aired both its own theatrically-released films and original made-for-television movies from MTV Studios in addition to acquired films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/daily.jhtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113054935/http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/daily.jhtml|archivedate=January 13, 2007|title=MTV Schedule for January 13, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/schedule/mtv/daily.jhtml?day=07%2F18%2F07|title=MTV Schedule for July 18, 2007}}</ref>

In 2010, a study by the [[GLAAD|Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] found that of 207.5 hours of prime time programming on MTV, 42% included content reflecting the lives of gay, bisexual and transgender people. This was the highest in the industry and the highest percentage ever.<ref>{{cite news|first=Frazier |last=Moore |title=Study:MTV leads in snowing gay characters on television |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/69889 |newspaper=Burlington Free Press |location=Burlington, Vermont |pages=7B |date=July 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203060147/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/69889 |archivedate=December 3, 2010 }}</ref><!---note that softcopy ref does not match hard copy.

== Logo and branding ==
[[File:Mtvstationid.gif|thumb|One of many MTV [[station ID]]s used during the 1980s; this one was designed by [[Henry Selick]].]] <!-- Commented out: [[File:Mtvfiorilla.jpg|thumb|A still image of one of disturbing MTV channel IDs, {{YouTube|8F61dW2kyaQ|"Guillotine"}}, which created by [[Steve Fiorilla]] at Olive Jar Animation in 1987.]] -->
MTV's now-iconic logo was designed in 1981 by [[Manhattan Design]] (a collective formed by Frank Olinsky,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frankolinsky.com/mtvstory1.html|title=MTV Logo Story|publisher=Frankolinsky.com|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> Pat Gorman and Patty Rogoff) under the guidance of original creative director [[Fred Seibert]]. The [[Block letters|block letter]] "M" was sketched by Rogoff, with the scribbled word "TV" spraypainted by Olinksky.<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Vidani|url=http://fredseibert.com/tagged/MTV_logo|title=MTV Logo @ Fred Seibert dot com|publisher=Fredseibert.com|date=May 5, 1980|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> The primary variant of MTV's logo at the time had the "M" in yellow and the "TV" in red. But unlike most television networks' logos at the time, the logo was constantly branded with different colors, patterns and images on a variety of station IDs. Examples include 1988's ID "Adam And Eve", where the "M" is an apple and the snake is the "TV". And for 1984's ID "Art History", the logo is shown in different art styles. The only constant aspects of MTV's logo at the time were its general shape and proportions, with everything else being dynamic.<ref name="awn">{{cite web|title=The Creation of an Icon: MTV|magazine=Animation World Magazine|date=January 1, 1998|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.10/2.10pages/2.10mtv.html}}</ref>

MTV launched on August 1, 1981, with an extended [[station identification|network ID]] featuring the first landing on the moon (with still images acquired directly from [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]), which was a concept of Seibert's executed by [[Buzz Potamkin]] and [[Buzzco Associates|Perpetual Motion Pictures]].<ref name="bare_url">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Vidani|url=http://fredseibert.com/post/184137950/more-than-75-000-times|title=More Than 75,000 Times|publisher=Fredseibert.com|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> The ID then cut to the American flag planted on the moon's surface changed to show the MTV logo on it, which rapidly changed into different colors and patterns several times per second as the network's original guitar-driven jingle was played for the first time. After MTV's launch, the "moon landing" ID was edited to show only its ending, and was shown at the top of every hour until early 1986, when the ID was scrapped in light of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]]. The ID ran "more than 75,000 times each year (48 times each day), at the top and bottom of every hour every day" according to Seibert.<ref name="bare_url" />

[[File:MTV Logo Refresh.png|thumb|Comparison of MTV's original 1980s branding and its 2010 branding]]

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MTV updated its on-air appearance at the beginning of every year and each summer, creating a consistent brand across all of its music-related shows. This style of channel-wide branding came to an end as MTV drastically reduced its number of music-related shows in the early to mid 2000s. Around this time, MTV introduced a static and single color [[digital on-screen graphic]] to be shown during all of its programming.

Starting with the premiere of the short-lived program ''[[FNMTV]]'' in 2008, MTV started using a revised and chopped down version of its original logo during most of its on-air programming. It became MTV's official logo on February 8, 2010 and officially debuted on its website.<ref>{{cite web|title=After 30 Years, MTV Changing its Logo! |publisher=Om Malik |date=February 6, 2010 |url=http://omis.me/2010/02/06/mtv-new-logo/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209081643/http://omis.me/2010/02/06/mtv-new-logo/ |archivedate=February 9, 2010 }}</ref> The channel's full name "Music Television" was officially dropped,<ref name="flavorwire" /><ref name="Music Television dropped" /> with the revised logo largely the same as the original logo, but without the initialism, the bottom of the "M" being cropped and the "V" in "TV" no longer branching off.<ref name="flavorwire">{{cite magazine|title=There's No Music Television in MTV's New Logo|magazine=[[Flavorwire]]|date=February 8, 2010|url=http://flavorwire.com/68793/theres-no-music-television-in-mtvs-new-logo}}</ref> This change was most likely made to reflect MTV's more prominent focus on reality and comedy programming and less on music-related programming. However, much like the original logo, the new logo was designed to be filled in with a seemingly unlimited variety of images. It is used worldwide, but not everywhere existentially. The new logo was first used on [[MTV Films]] logo with the 2010 film ''[[Jackass 3D]]''. MTV's rebranding was overseen by Popkern.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://popkern.tv/#301872/MTV-REDESIGN-2010 |title=Pixel Party: The Studio of Jen Epstein |publisher=Popkern.tv |accessdate=2014-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221143253/http://popkern.tv/#301872/MTV-REDESIGN-2010 |archivedate=February 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

It included a series of new station IDs featuring 3D renderings of objects and people, much akin to vaporwave and seapunk "aesthetics".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dishman|first1=Lydia|title=MTV International Turns The Lens On Its Audience With New "I Am My MTV" Rebrand|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3047788/mtv-international-turns-the-lens-on-its-audience-with-new-i-am-my-mtv-rebrand|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=25 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/tumblr-and-mtv-killed-vaporwave|title=How Tumblr and MTV Killed the Neon Anti-Corporate Aesthetic of Vaporwave|last=Pearson|first=Jordan|date=26 June 2015|work=[[Vice Media#Website|Motherboard]]|access-date=20 September 2016|via=[[Vice Media]]}}</ref> Many have derided MTV's choice of rebranding, insisting that the artistic style was centered on denouncing [[corporate capitalism]] (many aesthetic pieces heavily incorporate corporate logos of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, which coincidentally include MTV's original logo) rather than being embraced by major corporations like MTV. Many have also suggested that MTV made an attempt to be relevant in the modern entertainment world with the rebrand. In addition to this, the rebrand was made on exactly the same day that the social media site [[Tumblr]] introduced Tumblr TV, an animated [[GIF]] viewer which featured branding inspired by MTV's original 1980s on-air look.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/25/tumblr-launches-tumblr-tv-a-gif-search-engine-with-a-full-screen-viewing-mode/|title=Tumblr Launches "Tumblr TV," A GIF Search Engine With A Full-Screen Viewing Mode &#124; TechCrunch |publisher=techcrunch.com |date=2015-06-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> Tumblr has been cited as a prominent location of aesthetic art,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/tumblr-and-mtv-killed-vaporwave |title=How Tumblr and MTV Killed the Neon Anti-Corporate Aesthetic of Vaporwave &#124; Motherboard |publisher=Motherboard.vice.com |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> and thus many have suggested MTV and Tumblr "switched identities". The rebrand also incorporated a modified version of MTV's classic "I Want My MTV!" slogan, changed to read "I Am My MTV". ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' has suggested that the slogan change represents "the current generation's movement towards self-examination, identity politics and apparent narcissism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-the-hell-is-mtvs-new-rebrand-about |title=What the Hell Is MTV's New Rebrand About? &#124; Motherboard |publisher=Motherboard.vice.com |date=2015-06-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> MTV also introduced MTV Bump, a website that allows [[Instagram]] and [[Vine (service)|Vine]] users to submit videos to be aired during commercial breaks, as well as MTV Canvas, an online program where users submit custom IDs to also be aired during commercial breaks.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hobbs |first=Thomas |url=https://www.marketingweek.com/2015/06/25/mtv-announces-rebrand-as-it-aims-to-become-televisions-instagram/ |title=MTV rebrands as it aims to become television's Instagram |magazine=Marketing Week |date=2015-06-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref>

=== "I Want My MTV!" ===
The channel's iconic "I want my MTV!" advertising campaign was launched in 1982. It was first developed by George Lois and was based on a cereal commercial from the 1950s with the slogan "I want my Maypo!" that Lois adapted unsuccessfully from the original created by animator [[John Hubley]].<ref name="Peter Vidani">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Vidani|url=http://fredseibert.com/tagged/IWMM|title="I Want My MTV!" Fred Seibert dot com|publisher=Fredseibert.com|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

Lois's first pitch to the network was roundly rejected when Lois insisted that rock stars like Mick Jagger should be crying when they said the tag line, not unlike his failed 'Maypo' revamp. His associate, and Seibert mentor Dale Pon<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Vidani|url=http://fredseibert.com/tagged/Dale-Pon|title=Dale Pon: My Mentor Fred Seibert dot com|publisher=Fredseibert.com|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> took over the campaign, strategically and creatively, and was able to get the campaign greenlit when he laughed the tears out of the spots. From then on –with the exception of the closely logos on the first round of commercials– Pon was the primary creative force.<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Vidani|url=http://fredseibert.com/post/502390691/i-want-my-mtv-part-3|title="I Want My MTV! Part 3" Fred Seibert dot com|publisher=Fredseibert.com|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

All the commercials were produced by [[Buzz Potamkin]] and his new company Buzzco Productions, directed first by [[Thomas Schlamme]] and [[Alan Goodman]] and eventually by Candy Kugel.<ref name="Peter Vidani"/>

The campaign featured popular artists and celebrities, including [[Pete Townshend]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Adam Ant]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Police]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Culture Club]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Madonna]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Ric Ocasek]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Peter Wolf]], [[Joe Elliott|Joe Elliot]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Rick Springfield]], and [[Mick Jagger]], interacting with the MTV logo on-air and encouraging viewers to call their pay television providers and request that MTV be added to their local channel lineups.<ref name="awn" /> Eventually, the slogan became so ubiquitous that it made an appearance as a lyric sung by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", whose music video aired in regular rotation on MTV when it was first released in 1985.

== Influence and controversies ==
The channel has been a target of criticism by various groups about programming choices, social issues, [[political correctness]], sensitivity, censorship, and a perceived negative [[social influence]] on young people.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lane|first=Frederick S.|year=2006|title=The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture|place=[[Amherst, New York]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=1-59102-427-7|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/decencywarscampa0000lane}}</ref> Portions of the content of MTV's programs and productions have come under controversy in the general news media and among [[social groups]] that have taken offense. Some within the music industry criticized what they saw as MTV's homogenization of rock 'n' roll, including the punk band the [[Dead Kennedys]], whose song "M.T.V.{{snd}}Get Off the Air" was released on their 1985 album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', just as MTV's influence over the music industry was being solidified.<ref>{{cite news|last=The Punk|first=Donny|title=The Dead Kennedys' State of Confusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8dHstWRgcM4C&q=dead+kennedys+mtv+get+off+the+air&pg=PA48|accessdate=May 25, 2013|newspaper=Spin Magazine|date=February 1986}}</ref> MTV was also the major influence on the growth of music videos during the 1980s.<ref>http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/38936?q=mtv&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Subsequent concepts ===
[[HBO]] also had a 30-minute program of music videos called ''[[Video Jukebox (TV series)|Video Jukebox]]'', that first aired around the time of MTV's launch and lasted until late 1986. Also around this time, HBO, as well as other [[pay television|premium channels]] such as [[Cinemax]], [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]], occasionally played one or a few music videos between movies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|SuperStation WTBS]] launched ''[[Night Tracks]]'' on June 3, 1983, with up to 14 hours of music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985. Its most noticeable difference was that [[Black people|black]] artists that MTV initially ignored received airplay. The program ran until the end of May 1992.

A few markets also launched music-only channels including Las Vegas' [[KSNV|KVMY]] (channel 21), which debuted in the summer of 1984 as KRLR-TV and branded as "Vusic 21". The first video played on that channel was "Video Killed the Radio Star", following in the footsteps of MTV.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Shortly after TBS began ''Night Tracks'', [[NBC]] launched a music video program called ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'', which was considered network television's answer to MTV. Later renamed simply ''Friday Night'', the program ran from 1983 to 2002. ABC's contribution to the music video program genre in 1984, ''[[ABC Rocks]]'', was far less successful, lasting only a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303417/|title="ABC Rocks" 1984|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref>

TBS founder [[Ted Turner]] started the [[Cable Music Channel]] in 1984, designed to play a broader mix of music videos than MTV's rock format allowed. But after one month as a money-losing venture, Turner sold it to MTV, who redeveloped the channel into VH1.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Monopoly Television: MTV's Quest to Control the Music, pp. 48–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbYcUkfUbTkC&q=%22cable%20music%20channel%22&pg=PA48|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-1821-9|author1=Banks, Jack|date=April 1996}}</ref>

Shortly after its launch, [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] aired a program called ''[[D-TV]]'', a play on the MTV acronym. The program used music cuts, both from current and past artists. Instead of music videos, the program used clips of various vintage [[Disney]] cartoons and animated films to go with the songs. The program aired in multiple formats, sometimes between shows, sometimes as its own program, and other times as one-off specials. The specials tended to air both on The Disney Channel and [[NBC]]. The program aired at various times between 1984 and 1999. In 2009, Disney Channel revived the ''D-TV'' concept with a new series of short-form segments called ''Re-Micks''.

=== Censorship ===
{{Main|Censorship on MTV}}
MTV has edited a number of music videos to remove references to drugs,<ref name="smut 8">{{harvnb|Williams|2005|p = 8}} In this case, a reference to [[crack cocaine]] was removed from the video for "[[My Band]]" by [[D12]].</ref> sex, violence, weapons, racism, [[homophobia]], and/or advertising.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2001|isbn=0-688-16772-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/parentaladvisory00nuzu/page/91 91–92]|ref=harv|title-link=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America}}</ref> Many music videos aired on the channel were either censored, moved to late-night rotation, or banned entirely from the channel.

In the 1980s, parent media watchdog groups such as the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC) criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of [[satanism]]. As a result, MTV developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict Satanism or [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] themes.<ref name="censorthis">{{cite web|title=Music censorship in America|url=http://geocities.com/fireace_00/mtv.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808082618/http://geocities.com/fireace_00/mtv.html|archivedate=August 8, 2009}}</ref> This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as "[[Jesus Christ Pose]]" by [[Soundgarden]] in 1991<ref name="jcp">Prato, Greg.

On September 28, 2016, on an AfterBuzz TV live stream, Scout Durwood said that MTV had a "[[Cultural appropriation|no appropriation policy]]" that forbid her from wearing her hair in cornrows in an episode of ''[[Mary + Jane]]''. She said, "I wanted to cornrow my hair, and they were like, 'That's racist.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtUy3Yop2eQ&t=8m38s|via=YouTube|date=September 28, 2016|accessdate=September 29, 2016|title=Mary + Jane Season 1 Episode 4 Review & After Show w/ Scout Durwood |publisher=AfterBuzz TV}}</ref>

=== Trademark suit ===
[[Magyar Televízió]], Hungary's public broadcaster who has a trademark on the initials '''MTV''', registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American MTV (Music Television) network for trademark infringement when the Hungarian version of the music channel was launched in 2007.  The suit is still ongoing.

=== Andrew Dice Clay ===
During the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] ceremony, comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]] did his usual "adult nursery rhymes" routine (which he had done in his stand-up acts), after which the network executives imposed a lifetime ban. [[Billy Idol]]'s music video for the song "[[Cradle of Love (Billy Idol song)|Cradle of Love]]" originally had scenes from Clay's film ''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]'' when it was originally aired; scenes from the film were later excised. During the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], Clay was in attendance where he confirmed that the channel lifted the ban.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/09/andrew-dice-clay-lady-gagas-jo-calderone-is-me/|title=Andrew Dice Clay: Lady Gaga's Jo Calderone Is Me|first=Sheila|last=Marikar|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref>

{{Main|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy}}
After [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s purchase of [[CBS]], MTV was selected to produce the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] [[List of Super Bowl halftime shows|halftime show]] in 2001, airing on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and featuring [[Britney Spears]], [[NSYNC]], and [[Aerosmith]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Aerosmith, N'Sync add spice to MTV-driven halftime show|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/2001/playoffs/news/2001/01/28/superbowl_halftimeshow_ap/|work=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|date=January 28, 2001|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> Due to its success, MTV was invited back to produce another halftime show in 2004; this sparked a nationwide debate and controversy that drastically changed Super Bowl halftime shows, MTV's programming, and radio censorship.

When CBS aired [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in 2004, MTV was again chosen to produce the halftime show, with performances by such artists as [[Nelly]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Justin Timberlake]]. The show became controversial, however, after Timberlake tore off part of Jackson's outfit while performing "[[Rock Your Body]]" with her, revealing her right breast.

The [[Christian right]] organization [[American Family Association]] has also criticized MTV from perceptions of negative moral influence,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afa.net/mtvboycott.asp |publisher=[[American Family Association]] |title=Boycott MTV |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107134428/http://www.afa.net/mtvboycott.asp |archivedate=January 7, 2011 }}</ref> describing MTV as promoting a "pro-sex, anti-family, pro-choice, drug culture".<ref>{{cite web|last=Fancher|first=Bill|title=Rock For Life Vows to Expose MTV's Anti-Family Agenda|work=afa.net|publisher=[[American Family Association]]|date=June 14, 2004|url=http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/6/afa/162004f.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211092916/http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/6/afa/162004f.asp|archivedate=February 11, 2007|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

=== ''Jersey Shore'' ===
{{Main|Controversies of Jersey Shore}}
MTV received significant criticism from Italian American organizations for ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', which premiered in 2009.<ref name="FoxNews.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2009/11/25/italian-american-group-asks-mtv-cancel-jersey-shore/|title=FoxNews.com|publisher=FoxNews.com|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201160000/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2009/11/25/italian-american-group-asks-mtv-cancel-jersey-shore/|archive-date=February 1, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The controversy was due in large part to the manner in which MTV marketed the show, as it liberally used the word "[[Guido (slang)|guido]]" to describe the cast members. The word "guido" is generally regarded as an [[List of ethnic slurs|ethnic slur]] when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, "eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos,"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627353/20091201/story.jhtml|title='Jersey Shore' Castmember Defends Show Against Detractors|publisher=MTV.com|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> while yet another advertisement stated, "''Jersey Shore'' exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species&nbsp;... the GUIDO.

Prior to the series debut, [[Unico National]] formally requested that MTV cancel the show.<ref>[http://www.unico.org/breakingnews.htm Unico.org]{{Dead link|date = August 2010}}</ref> In a formal letter, the company called the show a "direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans."<ref>{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Adam K.|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/italian_group_asks_mtv_to_yank.html|title=Italian Group Asks MTV to Yank Jersey Shore|publisher=NYmag.com|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> Unico National President Andre DiMino said in a statement, "MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and red, white and green maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols.

MTV responded by issuing a press release which stated in part, "The Italian American cast takes pride in their ethnicity. We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture."<ref name="FoxNews.com"/> Following the calls for the show's removal, several sponsors requested that their ads not be aired during the show. These sponsors included [[Dell]], [[Domino's Pizza]], and [[American Family Insurance]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/12/22/2009-12-22_dell_pulls_ads_from_jersey_shore.html|title=Dell pulls ads from 'Jersey Shore'; MTV show loses another sponsor over claims of 'ethnic bashing'|publisher=NYdailyNews.com|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-07|location=New York|first=Gina|last=Salamone}}</ref> Despite the loss of certain advertisers, MTV did not cancel the show. Moreover, the show saw its audience increase from its premiere in 2009, and continued to place as MTV's top-rated programs during ''Jersey Shore's'' six-season run, ending in 2012.

=== ''Resolutions for White Guys'' ===
In December 2016, MTV online published a [[social justice]]-oriented New Year's resolution-themed video directed towards white men.

== Social activism ==
In addition to its regular programming, MTV has a long history of promoting social, political, and environmental activism in young people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The channel's vehicles for this activism have been ''Choose or Lose'', encompassing political causes and encouraging viewers to vote in elections; ''Fight For Your Rights'', encompassing anti-violence and anti-discrimination causes; ''think MTV''; and ''MTV Act'' and ''Power of 12'', the newest umbrellas for MTV's social activism.

=== ''Choose or Lose'' ===
[[File:Chooselose.jpg|thumb|MTV ''Choose or Lose'' logo]]
In 1992, MTV started a pro-democracy campaign called ''Choose or Lose'', to encourage over 20 million people to register to vote, and the channel hosted a town hall forum for then-candidate [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>MTV's traveling "Choose or Lose" vehicle brings politics.

In recent years, other politically diverse programs on MTV have included ''[[True Life]]'', which documents people's lives and problems, and [[MTV News]] specials, which center on very current events in both the music industry and the world. One special show covered the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 US presidential election]], airing programs focused on the issues and opinions of young people, including a program where viewers could ask questions of Senator [[John Kerry]].<ref>Sherman, Tom, "[http://underscorebleach.net/jotsheet/2004/11/election-youth-vote The Real Story of the Youth Vote in the 2004 Election.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511152920/http://underscorebleach.net/jotsheet/2004/11/election-youth-vote |date=May 11, 2011 }}" ''Underscorebleach.net'', 2004-11-04.

Additionally, MTV aired a documentary covering a trip by the musical group [[Sum 41]] to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], documenting the conflict there. The group ended up being caught in the midst of an attack outside of the hotel and were subsequently flown out of the country.<ref>"[http://www.warchild.ca/rocked.asp Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo]" ''War Child Canada''. 2001–2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107163733/http://www.warchild.ca/rocked.asp |date=January 7, 2007 }}</ref>

In 2016, MTV continued its pro-democracy campaign with ''Elect This'', an issue-oriented look at the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] targeting Millennials. Original content under the "Elect This" umbrella includes "Infographica," short animations summarizing MTV News polls; "Robo-Roundtable," a digital series hosted by animatronic robots; "The Racket," a multi-weekly digital series; and "The Stakes," a weekly political podcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elect What?

== Beyond MTV ==
Since its launch in 1981, the brand "MTV" has expanded to include many additional properties beyond the original MTV channel, including a variety of sister channels in the US, dozens of affiliated channels around the world, and an Internet presence through MTV.com and related websites.

=== Sister channels in the US ===
{{Further|MTV Networks}}
MTV operates a group of channels under MTV Networks{{snd}}a name that continues to be used for the individual units of the now [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], a division of corporate parent [[ViacomCBS]]. In 1985, MTV saw the introduction of its first true sister channel, [[VH1]], which was originally an acronym for "Video Hits One" and was designed to play [[adult contemporary]] music videos. Today, VH1 is aimed at celebrity and popular culture programming which include many reality shows. Another sister channel, [[Country Music Television|CMT]], targets the [[country music]] and [[Culture of the Southern United States|southern culture]] market.

The advent of satellite television and [[digital cable]] brought MTV greater channel diversity, including its current sister channels [[MTV2]] and MTV Tr3́s (now [[Tr3s|Tr3́s]]), which initially played music videos exclusively but now focus on other programming. MTV also formerly broadcast [[MTVU]] on campuses at various universities until 2018, when the MTV Networks on Campus division was sold, and the channel remained as a digital cable channel only. MTV used to also have MTV Hits and [[MTVX]] channels until these were converted into [[NickMusic]] and MTV Jams, respectively. MTV Jams later was rebranded as [[BET Jams]].

In the 2000s, MTV launched MTV HD, a [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of MTV. Until Viacom's main [[master control]] was upgraded in 2013, only the network's original series after 2010 (with some pre-2010 content) are broadcast in high definition, while music videos, despite being among the first television works to convert to high definition presentation in the early 2000s, were presented in 4:3 [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], forcing them into a [[Windowbox (filmmaking)|windowboxing]] type of presentation; since that time all music videos are presented in HD, and are framed to their director's preference. ''Jersey Shore'', despite being shot with widescreen HD cameras, was also presented with SD windowboxing (though the 2018 ''[[Jersey Shore: Family Vacation|Family Vacation]]'' revival is in full HD). The vast majority of providers carry MTV HD.

MTV Networks also operates [[MTV Live (TV network)|MTV Live]], a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] channel that features original HD music programming and HD versions of music related programs from MTV, VH1 and CMT. The channel was launched in January 2006 as MHD (Music: High Definition). The channel was officially rebranded as MTV Live on February 1, 2016.<ref name="palladia">{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/mtv-networks-mhd-music-high-definition/story.aspx?guid=%7BC338790D-229D-4202-BECB-DCE35ECCB4BA%7D&dist=hppr|title=MTV Networks' MHD: Music High-Definition Channel Kicks Into High Gear With New Programming and a New Name – Palladia}}</ref>

In 2005 and 2006, MTV launched a series of channels for Asian Americans. The first channel was [[MTV Desi]], launched in July 2005, dedicated toward South-Asian Americans. Next was [[MTV Chi]], in December 2005, which catered to Chinese Americans. The third was [[MTV K]], launched in June 2006 and targeted toward Korean Americans. Each of these channels featured music videos and shows from MTV's international affiliates as well as original US programming, promos, and packaging. All three of these channels ceased broadcasting on April 30, 2007.

On August 1, 2016, the 35th anniversary of the original MTV's launch, VH1 Classic was rebranded as [[MTV Classic (U.S. TV network)|MTV Classic]]. The channel's programming focused on classic music videos and programming (including notable episodes of ''MTV Unplugged'' and ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''), but skews more towards the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The network aired encores of 2000s MTV series such as ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' and ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]''. The network's relaunch included a broadcast of MTV's first hour on the air, which was also simulcast on MTV and online via Facebook live streaming.<ref name="polygon-mtvclassic">{{cite web|title=MTV Classic bringing The 2011 Beavis and Butt-Head, Aeon Flux and music videos back on-air|url=http://www.polygon.com/tv/2016/7/28/12310498/mtv-classic-premiere-date-programming-block|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone-mtvclassic">{{cite web|title=MTV Launches 'Classic' Channel Dedicated to 1990s|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mtv-launches-classic-channel-dedicated-to-1990s-w431416|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref> MTV Classic only retained three original VH1 Classic programs, which were ''[[That Metal Show]]'', ''[[Metal Evolution]],'' and ''[[Behind the Music|Behind the Music Remastered]]'', although repeats of current and former VH1 programs such as ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'' and ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' remained on the schedule. However, the rebranded MTV Classic had few viewers, and declined quickly to become the least-watched English-language subscription network rated by Nielsen at the end of 2016.

=== Internet ===
[[File:Mtvcom.png|thumb|MTV.com in 2008]]
In the late 1980s, before the [[World Wide Web]], MTV VJ [[Adam Curry]] began experimenting on the Internet. He registered the then-unclaimed [[domain name]] "MTV.com" in 1993 with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his supervisors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name, which led to an out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loundy.com/CASES/MTV_v_Curry.html|title=MTV vs. Curry|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

The service hosted at the domain name was originally branded "MTV Online" during MTV's first few years of control over it in the mid-1990s. It served as a counterpart to the [[AOL|America Online]] portal for MTV content, which existed at AOL keyword MTV until approximately the end of the 1990s. After this time, the website became known as simply "MTV.com" and served as the Internet hub for all MTV and [[MTV News]] content.

MTV.com experimented with entirely video-based layouts between 2005 and 2007. The experiment began in April 2005 as ''MTV Overdrive'', a streaming video service that supplemented the regular MTV.com website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2005/04/06/mtv-overdrive|title=MTV today announced the launch of the new hybrid channel, "MTV Overdrive"|access-date=August 11, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106064216/http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2005/04/06/mtv-overdrive|archive-date=November 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortly after the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]], which were streamed on MTV.com and heavily utilized the ''MTV Overdrive'' features, MTV introduced a massive change for MTV.com, transforming the entire site into a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] video-based entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://f6design.com/journal/2007/05/04/mtvcom-abandons-flash-experiment/#comment-68614|title=MTV switches to Adobe Flash-based website|access-date=August 11, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172346/http://f6design.com/journal/2007/05/04/mtvcom-abandons-flash-experiment/#comment-68614|archive-date=June 12, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Much of users' feedback about the Flash-based site was negative, demonstrating a dissatisfaction with videos that played automatically, commercials that could not be skipped or stopped, and the slower speed of the entire website. The experiment ended in February 2006 as MTV.com reverted to a traditional [[HTML]]-based website design with embedded video clips, in the style of YouTube and some other video-based websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labsblog.mtv.com/2007/02/05/mtvs-new-html-site-v02/comment-page-1 |title=MTV.com returns to HTML-based website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203063307/http://labsblog.mtv.com/2007/02/05/mtvs-new-html-site-v02/comment-page-1 |archivedate=February 3, 2012 }}</ref>

From 2006 to 2007, MTV operated an online channel, [[MTV International]], targeted to the broad international market. The purpose of the online channel was to air commercial-free music videos once the television channels started concentrating on shows unrelated to music videos or music-related programming.

The channel responded to the rise of the Internet as the new central place to watch music videos in October 2008 by launching MTV Music (later called [[MTV Hive]]), a website that featured thousands of music videos from MTV and [[VH1]]'s video libraries, dating back to the earliest videos from 1981.

A newly created division of the company, MTV New Media, announced in 2008 that it would produce its own original web series, in an attempt to create a bridge between old and new media.<ref name="Director Hustles New Web Series">{{Cite news|url=http://newteevee.com/2008/08/22/director-hustles-new-web-series|title=Director Hustles New Web Series|date=August 27, 2008|work=[[NewTeeVee]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> The programming is available to viewers via personal computers, cell phones, [[iPod]]s, and other digital devices.<ref name="MTV, Craig Brewer team up for online drama">{{Cite news|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/jul/10/midtown-to-star-in-online-drama/|title=MTV, Craig Brewer team up for online drama|date=July 10, 2008|work=[[Commercial Appeal]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref>

In the summer of 2012, MTV launched a music discovery web site called the [[MTV Artists Platform]] (also known as Artists.MTV). MTV stated, "While technology has made it way easier for artists to produce and distribute their own music on their own terms, it hasn't made it any simpler to find a way to cut through all the Internet noise and speak directly to all of their potential fans. The summer launch of the platform is an attempt to help music junkies and musicians close the gap by providing a one-stop place where fans can listen to and buy music and purchase concert tickets and merchandise."<ref name="artistsmtv">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681181/artists-mtv-music-hub.jhtml|title=MTV To Launch Artists.MTV Music Hub|date=March 15, 2012|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>

Today, MTV.com remains the official website of MTV, and it expands on the channel's broadcasts by bringing additional content to its viewers. The site's features include an online version of MTV News, podcasts, a commercial streaming service, movie features, profiles and interviews with recording artists and from MTV's television programs.<!-- Please resist the urge to list all the international channels here.
