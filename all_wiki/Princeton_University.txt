==History==
{{Main|History of Princeton University}}
[[File:US 1956 3c Nassau Hall.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative 3-cent stamp from 1956 celebrating the bicentennial of [[Nassau Hall]]]]

[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Its purpose was to train ministers.<ref name = Princeton>{{cite web | title = Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url= http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description |work= Library Finding Aids|publisher= Princeton University |access-date= 11 November 2012}}</ref> The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish Presbyterian America. In 1754, trustees of the College of New Jersey suggested that, in recognition of Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]]'s interest, Princeton should be named as Belcher College. Belcher replied: "What a name that would be!"<ref>{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=1933 |page=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhJbAAAAYAAJ&q=jonathan+belcher++++princeton++what+the+hell+of&pg=PA487}}</ref> In 1756, the college moved its campus to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.<ref>{{Citation | first = Jeffry H | last = Morrison | title = John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic | year = 2005}}</ref> Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

In 1812, the eighth president of the College of New Jersey, [[Ashbel Green]] (1812–23), helped establish the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] next door.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/green/|title=Ashbel Green – The Presidents of Princeton University|first=Princeton|last=University|access-date=June 29, 2015}}</ref> The plan to extend the theological curriculum met with "enthusiastic approval on the part of the authorities at the College of New Jersey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?menu1_id=2030&menu2_id=2031&id=1264|title=Princeton Theological Seminary|access-date=June 29, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519161941/http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?menu1_id=2030&menu2_id=2031&id=1264|archive-date=May 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Today, Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary maintain separate institutions with ties that include services such as cross-registration and mutual library access.<ref>{{cite web

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.<ref>{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |author-link=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-691-01122-6 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|page=24|edition=First}}</ref> During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the [[United States capital|country's capital]] for four months.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm | title=U.S. Senate: The Nine Capitals of the United States}}</ref> Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), [[Nassau Hall]]'s role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin [[lion sculpture]]s that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.<ref name=apc-nassau-hall/> Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.<ref name="apc-nassau-hall" />

[[File:Princeton University, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|A Birds-eye view of campus in 1906]]

[[James McCosh]] became the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = McCosh, James|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html|oclc = 4193433|work = A Princeton Companion|access-date = October 15, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150809195211/http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html|archive-date = August 9, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.<ref name=":0" /> McCosh Hall is named in his honor.<ref name=apc-nassau-hall />

In 1879, the first thesis for a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of [[New Jersey]] to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=April|title=When Did the College of New Jersey Change to Princeton University?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/07/when-did-the-college-of-new-jersey-change-to-princeton-university/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=6 July 2016|date=2015-07-08}}</ref> During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university.

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]], graduate of the Class of 1879, was elected the 13th president of the university.<ref name="chronology"/> Under Wilson, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=Nathaniel |title=The Princeton Preceptorial System |journal=The Sewanee Review |date=April 1910 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=169–176 |jstor=27532370 }}</ref>

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study "critical languages" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by Sally Frank, [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was denied.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Associated Press | title = Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1991 | page = A4}}</ref> In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1987-03-01 | title = Princeton song goes coed}}</ref> From 2009 to 2011, Princeton professor [[Nannerl O.

===Cannon Green===
[[File:Cannon Green Princeton c1909.jpg|thumb|Cannon Green ca. 1909, with East Pyne, Whig and Clio Halls]]

Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of [[Nassau Hall]] is the "Big Cannon," which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was taken to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott & Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}</ref> In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

A second "Little Cannon" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions|volume=2|year=1879|edition=2nd|publisher=J.

===Landscape===
Princeton's grounds were designed by [[Beatrix Farrand]] between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/02/05/university-name-courtyard-influential-landscape-architect-beatrix-farrand|title=University to name courtyard for influential landscape architect Beatrix Farrand|publisher=Princeton University|author=Emily Aronson|date=February 5, 2019|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild & Partners in 2000.

Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[First College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Woodrow Wilson College and Princeton Inn College, respectively), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=https://whitmancollege.princeton.edu/about |website=Whitman College |publisher=Princeton University Office of the Dean of the College |access-date=14 March 2020}}</ref>

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/rockefeller-college|title= Rockefeller College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/mathey-college|title= Mathey College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the "New New Quad") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including "waffle ceilings," the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/butler-college|title= Butler College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite book|title = A Princeton Companion|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|chapter = West, Andrew Fleming|oclc = 4193433|chapter-url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html}}</ref> Forbes currently houses nearly 500 undergraduates in its residential halls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/forbes-college|title= Forbes College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whitmancollege.princeton.edu/about|title=About {{!}} Whitman College|website=whitmancollege.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alumnus, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's "Constructed Utopia" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |journal = The New England Quarterly|volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=286–317 | date= June 2011 |doi=10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090 |s2cid=57564446 }}</ref>

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.<ref name = "autogenerated1" /> The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/graduate-housing/explore/new-graduate-college|title= New Graduate College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>

[[File:Art Museum Princeton.JPG|thumb|left|The Art Museum]]

The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Numbering over 92,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/32454|title=The Houses of Parliament, Seagulls (y1979-54)|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/25075|title=Meadow at Giverny (y1954-78)|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/31852|title=Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge (y1972-15)|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Cézanne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/search/collections?artistList=%5B%22Paul%20Cezanne%22%5D|title=Search the Collection {{!}} Princeton University Art Museum|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> and Van Gogh,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/21359|title=Tarascon Stagecoach (L.1988.62.11)|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/31653|title=Blue Marilyn (y1978-46)|website=artmuseum.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of $26.1 billion, Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world.<ref>As of June 30, 2019. {{cite web |url=https://www.nacubo.org/-/media/Nacubo/Documents/EndowmentFiles/2019-NTSE-Endowment-Market-Values--FINAL-January-30-2020.ashx|title=U.S. and Canadian Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Endowment Market Value and Change in Endowment Market Value from FY 2018 to FY 2019 |publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers and TIAA |access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university had the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over $2 million for undergraduates) in 2011.<ref name="CNBC">{{cite news |title = Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student|year = 2011|work = CNBC.com|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130531100005/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-date = May 31, 2013 |others = Praefcke, Andreas (photo credit)}}</ref> Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news|title = Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion|work = [[Dly.

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. [[Doctorate|Doctoral education]] is available in most disciplines.<ref name="degree programs">{{cite web |url = http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/|title = Departments & Programs|publisher = Princeton University|access-date = October 19, 2015|date = October 1, 2015}}</ref> It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

The university has ties with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] and the [[Westminster Choir College]] of [[Rider University]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}{{Efn | Princeton Theological Seminary and Westminster Choir College maintain [[cross-registration]] programs with the university.}}

===Undergraduate===
[[File:McCosh 50 (front).jpg|thumb|McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus]]

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements (which include, for example, classes in ethics, literature and the arts, and historical analysis) with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/|title = About Us|publisher = Princeton University|access-date = October 19, 2015|at = Role of Honor Committee|website = Honor Committee|date = May 19, 2015}}</ref> The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|title = Honor Code|publisher = Princeton University|access-date = June 1, 2011 |website = The Student Guide to Princeton|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074938/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|archive-date = June 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68|title = Honor Code|type = YouTube video|year = 2008|others = music and lyrics by Peter Mills|access-date = October 23, 2015}}</ref> Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|title = Committee on Discipline|publisher = Princeton University|access-date = October 23, 2015|website = ODUS: Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students|date = August 25, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103152504/http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/sources/|title = Acknowledging Your Sources|publisher = Princeton University|access-date = October 23, 2015|date = August 2011|website = Academic Integrity}}</ref>

====Grade deflation policy====
[[File:Einstein classroom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Room 302 is a lecture hall at [[Frist Campus Center]] restored to its condition when [[Albert Einstein]] taught there]]

In 2004, [[Nancy Weiss Malkiel]], the Dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.<ref name="On grade deflation">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|newspaper=The Daily Princetonian|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|access-date=June 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113122642/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|archive-date=January 13, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.<ref name="On grade deflation"/> While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.<ref name="On grade deflation"/> Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,<ref name="On grade deflation"/> but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1277406249-7I3hc765HdqNtR0HmzFjDw|work=New York Times|title=In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|access-date=June 24, 2010 | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=June 21, 2010}}</ref> Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison.

The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|access-date=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}</ref>

In August 2014, a faculty committee tasked by Dean of the College [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]] to review the effectiveness of grade deflation found not only that the 35% target was both often misinterpreted as a hard quota and applied inconsistently across departments, but also that grades had begun to decline in 2003, the year before the policy was implemented.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=No more A quotas: Faculty committee recommends Princeton University change its grading policy |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/08/no_more_a_quotas_faculty_committee_recommends_princeton_university_change_its_grading_policy.html|access-date=5 June 2015 |work=nj.com|date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|title=Princeton University - Valerie Smith appointed president of Swarthmore College|website=www.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316001345/http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|archive-date=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The committee concluded that the observed lower grades since 2003 were the result of discussions and increased awareness during and since the implementation of the deflation policy, and not the deflation targets themselves, so recommended removing the numerical targets while charging individual departments with developing consistent standards for grading.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report from the Ad Hoc Committee to Review Policies Regarding Assessment and Grading |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S40/73/33I92/PU_Grading_Policy_Report_2014_Aug.pdf|access-date=5 June 2015|date=5 August 2014}}</ref> In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed as recommended by the committee.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Windemuth|first1=Anna|title=After faculty vote, grade deflation policy officially dead|url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/10/breaking-after-faculty-vote-grade-deflation-policy-officially-dead/|access-date=5 June 2015|work=The Daily Princetonian|date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526105447/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/10/breaking-after-faculty-vote-grade-deflation-policy-officially-dead/|archive-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory===
The [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], PPPL, was founded in 1951 as Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project aimed at achieving controlled [[nuclear fusion]]. Princeton astrophysics professor [[Lyman Spitzer]] became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.<ref>Tanner, Earl C. (1977) ''Project Matterhorn: an informal history'' Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey, p. 77, {{OCLC|80717532}}</ref>

PPPL currently houses approximately half of the graduate astrophysics department, the Princeton Program in Plasma Physics. The lab is also home to the  Harold P. Furth Plasma Physics Library. The library contains all declassified Project Matterhorn documents, included the first design sketch of a [[stellarator]] by Lyman Spitzer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plasma Physics Library |url=https://library.princeton.edu/plasma-physics/resources |website=Prince University Library |publisher=The Trustees of Princeton University |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref> For the 2018–19 academic year, the university allocated approximately 30% of its research expenditures or 5% of its total budget, over 100 million dollars, to PPPL.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finances |url=https://profile.princeton.edu/finances |publisher=The Trustees of Princeton University |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref>

The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eating Clubs |url=https://admission.princeton.edu/campus-life/dining-options/eating-clubs |website=Princeton University Undergraduate Admission |publisher=Princeton University |access-date=14 March 2020}}</ref>

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jsn3_VEvBsC&q=princeton++Additionally,+the+clubs+serve+as+evening+and+weekend+social+venues+for+members+and+guests&pg=PA488|title=The College Buzz Book|last=Editors|first=Vault|date=2006-03-23|publisher=Vault Inc.|isbn=978-1-58131-399-4|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The eleven clubs are Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Terrace, Tiger, and Tower.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Explore the Eating Clubs|url=https://princetoneatingclubs.org/|website=Princeton Eating Clubs|access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>

Although the school's admissions policy is [[Need-blind admission|need-blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities |access-date=October 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826131543/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |archive-date=August 26, 2009 }}</ref> While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=Economic Diversity Among the Top 25 |publisher=US News & World Report |access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>

===Demographics===
Princeton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2016 freshman class was the most diverse in the school's history, with over 43% of students identifying as students of color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inclusive.princeton.edu/about/demographics|title=Demographics {{!}} Many Voices, One Future|website=inclusive.princeton.edu|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> Undergraduate and master's students were 51% male and 49% female for the 2018–19 academic year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gradschool.princeton.edu/about/statistics/enrollment-statistics |title=Enrollment Statistics| publisher=[[Princeton University Graduate School]] |access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>

The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 14% from the bottom 60%.<ref name="NYT mobility index">{{cite news |last1=Aisch |first1=Gregor |last2=Buchanan |first2=Larry |last3=Cox |first3=Amanda |last4=Quealy |first4=Kevin |title=Economic diversity and student outcomes at Princeton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/princeton-university |access-date=9 August 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 January 2017}}</ref>

In 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other [[Ivy League]] schools. Sixteen percent of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. Caroline C. Pam of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that Princeton was "long dogged by a reputation for [[anti-Semitism]]" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students.<ref name="Pam, Caroline">{{cite news|author=Pam, Caroline C.|url=http://observer.com/1999/05/enrollment-of-jews-at-princeton-drops-by-40-percent-in-15-years/|title=Enrollment of Jews at Princeton Drops by 40 Percent in 15 Years|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=1999-05-31|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> At the time many Jewish students at Princeton dated Jewish students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] because they perceived Princeton as an environment where it was difficult to find romantic prospects; Pam stated that there was a theory that the dating issues were a cause of the decline in Jewish students.<ref name="Pam, Caroline"/>

In 1981, the population of African Americans at Princeton University made up less than 10%. Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first [[African Americans|African American]], however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that "a member of your [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]] might feel very much alone" at Princeton University.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Michelle|last=Mundy|first=Liza|publisher=Simon & Schuster paperbacks|year=2008|isbn=9781416599432|location=New York, New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/michellebiograph00mund/page/68 68, 69]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/michellebiograph00mund/page/68}}</ref>

"[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]''{{'s}} melody, which also fits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|access-date=July 5, 2008 | publisher = Princeton}}</ref>

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed "[[Old Nassau reaction]]" because the solution turns orange and then black.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Old Nassau reaction | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 167 |doi=10.1021/ed054p167.2 |year = 1977|last1 = Alyea|first1 = Hubert N.| bibcode = 1977JChEd..54..167A }}</ref>
