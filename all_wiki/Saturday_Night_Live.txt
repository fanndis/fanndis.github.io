'''''Saturday Night Live''''' (also known simply as '''''SNL''''') is an American late-night live television [[sketch comedy]] and [[variety show]] created by [[Lorne Michaels]] and developed by [[Dick Ebersol]]. The show premiered on [[NBC]] on October 11, 1975, under the original title '''''NBC's Saturday Night'''''. The show's [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches (listed alphabetically)|comedy sketches]], which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a [[Saturday Night Live cast members|large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members]]. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast as with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a [[cold open]] sketch that ends with someone [[breaking character]] and proclaiming, "[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]", properly beginning the show.

In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by [[Jean Doumanian]], who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985. Since Michaels' return, he has held the job of show-runner. Many ''SNL'' cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.

Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], ''SNL'' has aired {{Template parameter value|Saturday Night Live|Infobox television||num_episodes|}}<!--Update this stat in the Infobox, the num_episodes parameter, it will then auto-populate to here--> episodes since its debut, and began its [[Saturday Night Live (season 46)|forty-sixth season]] on October 3, 2020, making it one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|longest-running network television programs in the United States]]. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films including ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) and ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including [[List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases|home media releases]] of "best of" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.

Throughout four decades on air, ''Saturday Night Live'' has received a number of awards, including 71 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s,<ref name="GD">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/saturday-night-live-wins-emmys-awards-kate-mckinnon-alec-baldwin-news/|title='Saturday Night Live' wins 4 more Emmys Sunday; extends mind-blowing Emmy series record for wins to 64|last=Beachum|first=Chris|date=September 17, 2017|publisher=[[Gold Derby]]|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> four [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s<ref name="writersguildsnl">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1517|title=Writers Guild Awards|access-date=May 8, 2016|publisher=Writers Guild of America, West|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503095751/http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1517|archive-date=May 3, 2012}}</ref>, and two [[Peabody Award]]s.<ref name="peabodywinnersbooksnl">{{cite web|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/PeabodyWinnersBook.pdf |title=George Foster Peabody award winners |access-date=November 23, 2009 |publisher=National Association of Broadcasters |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726163315/http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/PeabodyWinnersBook.pdf |archive-date=July 26, 2011 }}</ref> In 2000, it was inducted into the [[National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame]].

{{History of SNL|float=left}}

From 1965 until 1975, NBC ran ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Best of Carson]]'' reruns of ''The Tonight Show'', airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as ''The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''). In 1974, [[Johnny Carson]] announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/history.shtml|title=SNL's Beginnings from NBC}}</ref>

In 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, [[Dick Ebersol]], and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} At the suggestion of [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Barry Diller]], Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring [[high-concept]] comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances that would attract 18- to 34-year-old viewers.<ref name="History2" />{{sfn|Hammill|2004|p=2008}} By 1975, Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[John Belushi]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Garrett Morris]], [[Laraine Newman]], [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[Gilda Radner]],<ref name="History2" /> and [[George Coe]].<ref name="LFNYch1" /> The show was originally called ''NBC's Saturday Night'', because ''Saturday Night Live'' was in use by ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' on the rival network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name="OriginalTitle" /> After the cancellation of the Cosell show, NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3426553/saturday-night-live-history/ |last=Rothman |first=Lily |title=The Surprising Story Behind Saturday Night Live's Most Famous Line |website=Time |date=September 26, 2014 |access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> The show was originally conceived with three rotating permanent hosts: [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], and [[George Carlin]]. When Pryor dropped out because his brand of comedy was not censor-friendly, the concept was dropped. {{sfn|Tropiano|2013|p=2}}

Debuting on October 11, 1975,{{sfn|Hammill|2004|p=2008}} the show quickly developed a [[cult following]],{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=105}} eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning (in 1978) "Best of ''Saturday Night Live''" compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first season in 1975 and 1976, according to a book about the show authored by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show's Nielsen ratings and shares.{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=179}} Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen's measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show, and many of them watched little else on television.{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=180}} In 1975 and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers, even though [[Generation X]] was the right age for commercials for toys and other children's products. Baby boomers far outnumbered Generation X in reality but not in television viewership with the exception of Michaels's new show and major league sports, and advertisers had long been concerned about baby boomers' distaste for the powerful medium. NBC executives eventually understood Michaels's explanation of the desirable demographics and they decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches.{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=187}}

They included a Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed Aspen, Colorado murder suspect [[Claudine Longet]] and warranted an on-air apology by announcer [[Don Pardo]] during the following episode.{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=207}} Herminio Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network's Standards and Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman's use of the term "pissed off" in the March 13, 1976, episode with host [[Anthony Perkins]], according to the book by Hill and Weingrad, and was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him.{{sfn|Hill|Weingrad|1986|p=239}}

Chevy Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the then-unknown comic actor [[Bill Murray]]. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 (after season five), Michaels—emotionally and physically exhausted—requested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue other projects.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=121–122}} Concerned the show would be canceled without him, Michaels suggested writers [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], and [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] as his replacements. NBC president [[Fred Silverman]] disliked Franken and was infuriated by Franken's Weekend Update routine called "[[A Limo For A Lame-O]]", a scathing critique of Silverman's job performance at the network and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network's expense. Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=157–159, 161}} Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, [[Jean Doumanian]], with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at ''SNL'' after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=160–161}} Michaels's departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=167}}

The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1&nbsp;million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels's place.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=166, 176}} The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as [[Charles Rocket]] and [[Ann Risley]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=167}} Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said "fuck" on live television.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=175}} After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=130}}<ref name="CrewDoumanian" /> Although executives suggested ''SNL'' be left to die, network chief [[Brandon Tartikoff]] wanted to keep the show on the air, believing the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels's approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=177–179}}

Ebersol's tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of new cast member [[Eddie Murphy]] during the 1980–81 sixth season.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=155}} Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Martin Short]] who could bring their already successful material to the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=177–179}} Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show Michaels had created.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=197}} After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show's established "live" format.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=200}} Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted out. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea to seek out established actors such as [[Joan Cusack]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]]{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=199}} The cast and writers struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer [[Bernie Brillstein]] to give it one more year.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=211}} The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=212}} Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Phil Hartman]] instead of known names.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=212}}

The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase ''SNL''{{'}}s ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president [[Don Ohlmeyer]] and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as [[Chris Farley]] and [[Adam Sandler]] be fired because Ohlmeyer did not "get" them, and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels's position.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=352–353, 358}} Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for [[CBS]] during this time, but remained loyal to ''SNL''.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=350–351}} By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and [[Mike Myers]], another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast featuring [[Will Ferrell]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], and [[Tina Fey]] proved promising.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=359}} The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could write original sketches.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=361–362}} By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels's independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member [[Norm Macdonald]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=363}}

[[File:SNL Original Cast.jpg|thumb|The original 1975 cast, from left to right: [[Laraine Newman]], [[John Belushi]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Garrett Morris]], and [[Chevy Chase]]]]

The original 1975 cast of ''SNL'', titled "The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players,"{{sfn|Marx|Sienkiewicz|Becker|2013|p=6}}<ref name="CastPTime" /> a term coined by writer [[Herb Sargent]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=38}} included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=23}} Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=27}} Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=28}} Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=27}} Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner, and writers [[Anne Beatts]] and [[Michael O'Donoghue]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=26}} Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue, and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=26}}

After Chase left the show, he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but was unable to because of budget restrictions.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=34}} When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=82–83}} Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House|Animal House]]'', and later refused to allow ''SNL'' musician [[Paul Shaffer]] to participate in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=81}}<ref name="CastHistory" /> Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=118}} In 1980, Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests and was replaced by Doumanian, who wanted to give the show a fresh start with a new cast and writing staff.{{sfn|Gates|2013|pp=157–158}} Michaels was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, Radner, Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.<ref name="CastHistory" />

The Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and was not received favorably.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=130}} Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Joe Piscopo]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=140}} Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]. Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=136–137}} Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=153}} after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success.<ref name="Murphy1" />{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=161–163, 165}} Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Trading Places]]'', before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983–84 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Martin Short]] were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode, respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=177–179}} Michaels's return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., [[Jon Lovitz]], and [[Dennis Miller]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=198}} The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller, and [[Nora Dunn]], and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jan Hooks]], who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=209}}

In 1989–90, new talent such as [[Mike Myers]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Chris Farley]] was added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=308–309, 346–347}} By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=352–353, 359}} While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of six cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like [[Bill Hader]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], and [[Fred Armisen]].<ref name="2013CastTransition" />

As of Season 46, ''SNL'' has featured 156 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Spade]], [[Will Forte]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Chris Parnell]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Kristen Wiig]], and many others. [[Kenan Thompson]] is the show's longest-serving cast member. Thompson first joined the series in [[Saturday Night Live (season 29)|2003]], and has been on the show for eighteen seasons.<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/credits/repertory-player/kenan-thompson.] Keenan Thompson biography] NBC</ref> Those selected to join the cast of ''SNL'' are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as [[The Groundlings]] (Newman, Ferrell, Hartman,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=219}} Lovitz, Wiig<ref name="CastWiig1" />) and [[The Second City]] (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,<ref name="FeySC" /> [[Tim Meadows]]), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, [[Norm Macdonald]]), who already possess the training or experience necessary for ''SNL''.<ref name="CastCasting" />

Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of [[Weekend Update]], a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Many of the Weekend Update hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray,{{cn|date=September 2020}} Miller, Macdonald,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=286}} Fey,{{cn|date=September 2020}} Fallon,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=293}} and Poehler. From 2008, [[Seth Meyers]] was the solo host of Weekend Update,{{cn|date=September 2020}} before being partnered with [[Cecily Strong]] in 2013. After Meyers left for ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'' in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer [[Colin Jost]]. However, later that [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|year]], she was replaced by writer [[Michael Che]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/snl-head-writer-join-cecily-strong-weekend-update-co-anchor-2D11981955|title='SNL' head writer to join Cecily Strong as 'Weekend Update' co-anchor shingbauer |last=Cooper|website=The Today Show|date=January 23, 2014|access-date=January 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/saturday-night-live-adds-michael-che-weekend-anchor-011200003.html|title=Saturday Night Live' Replaces Cecily Strong With Michael Che as 'Weekend Update' Anchor|first=Linda |last=Ge|website=Yahoo!

The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show,<ref name="CastContract2" /><ref name="CastContract" /> but starting with the 1999–2000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.<ref name="CastContract" /> The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on ''SNL'' and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, [[Paramount Pictures]], and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on ''SNL'' only to leave and make money for other studios.<ref name="CastContract" /> In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to ''SNL'' for a total of seven years.<ref name="CastContract3" /> The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=81}} In the first season of the show, the cast was paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=78}} By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000<ref name="CastContract" /> and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=81}} In 2001, Ferrell became the highest-paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode).<ref name="CastContractFerrell" /> In [[Saturday Night Live (season 39)|2014]], [[Sasheer Zamata]] was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism of the show's lack of an African-American woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/snl-hires-sasheer-zamata-first-black-female-cast-member-in-years-170086/|title=Meet the New 'SNL' Cast Member|first1=Kory|last1=Grow|first2=Kory|last2=Grow|date=January 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Upright Citizens Brigade alum Sasheer Zamata will join the late-night sketch series Jan. 18. |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/saturday-night-live-adds-sasheer-668659 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 6, 2014 |access-date=January 7, 2014 |first=Lesley |last=Goldberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='S.N.L' Hires Black Female Cast Member |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/business/media/snl-hires-black-female-cast-member.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 6, 2014 |access-date=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

=== Writers ===
{{main|List of Saturday Night Live writers}}
[[File:Lorne Michaels David Shankbone 2010.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Showrunner [[Lorne Michaels]]]]

As of the 2020–21 season, [[Michael Che]], [[Colin Jost]], Kent Sublette, and [[Anna Drezen]] are the show's co-head writers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/snl-michael-che-colin-jost-co-head-writers-1202638276/|title=' SNL' Names Michael Che, Colin Jost Co-Head Writers|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=December 12, 2017}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/09/snl-nbc-show-adds-three-featured-players-will-have-limited-audience-jim-carrey-joe-biden-1234578073/|title=‘SNL’: Jim Carrey Set To Play Joe Biden As NBC Show Adds Three Featured Players & Will Have Limited Audience|first=Peter|last=White|work=Deadline|date=September 16, 2020|access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref> Jost had been a writer since 2005 and was one of the head writers from 2012 to 2015 before being renamed head writer in 2017. Che has been a writer since 2013. He temporarily left the show in the summer of 2014, but came back that fall to anchor Update and reclaimed his status as a writer.

[[Seth Meyers]] became a co-head writer in 2005, became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012, and then left in 2014. The Weekend Update segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 2011–12 season.<ref name="2013SepCasting" /><ref name="AlexBaze1" /><ref name="WritersAbelesInt1" /> Scenes on Weekend Update that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside the dedicated Weekend Update team, who know those characters better.<ref name="WritersAbelesInt1" />

''SNL'' writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]], and [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]].<ref name="CastHistory" /> Comedian [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/index4.html |title=Comedy Isn't Funny |website=[[Nymag.com]] |access-date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the ''SNL'' writing room. Like the ''SNL'' cast who appear on camera, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show, such as [[Conan O'Brien]], who was brought into ''SNL'' from The Groundlings, went on to write for ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and eventually began hosting his own [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|show]].<ref name="speakerbio" /> Former head writer [[Adam McKay]], along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website [[Funny or Die]].<ref name="WriterMcKay" /> In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female ''SNL'' head writer<ref name="Levin2001" /><ref name="observer" /> and successfully made the transition to starring on the show,<ref name="witchel" /> as well as writing and starring in feature films,<ref name="Otto2004" /><ref name="Ebert2010" /><ref name="grosz" /> ultimately creating and starring in her own show ''[[30 Rock]]'', which was partly based on her ''SNL'' experiences.<ref name="Poniewozik2006" /> In 2005, Fey was paid $1.5&nbsp;million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.<ref name="WriterHeadSalary" />

=== Announcers ===
[[Don Pardo]] served as the announcer for the series when it began, and continued in the role for all but season seven between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and [[Mel Brandt]] and [[Bill Hanrahan]] filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 2009–10 season.<ref name="Announcer1"/> In 2010, then 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.<ref name="Announcer1" /><ref name="2014Pardo" /> Cast members Joe Piscopo<ref>{{cite episode |title=Jamie Lee Curtis/The Fixx |series=Saturday Night Live |network=NBC |airdate=February 18, 1984}}</ref> and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=295}} Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|season 40]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ausiello|first1=Michael|title=SNL Taps Darrell Hammond to Succeed Don Pardo as Announcer|url=http://tvline.com/2014/09/18/darrell-hammond-saturday-night-live-announcer-replacing-don-pardo-snl/|access-date=September 18, 2014|date= September 18, 2014|website=[[TVLine]]}}</ref>

=== Hosts and musical guests ===
{{main|List of Saturday Night Live guests}}

A typical episode of ''SNL'' will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=229}} The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally, the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night. Comedian [[George Carlin]] was the first to host ''SNL'' in the debut October 1975 episode;<ref name="HostCarlin" /> three episodes later, [[Candice Bergen]] became the first female host{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=44}} and subsequently the first to host more than once.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=48}} Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from actors, such as [[Christopher Walken]], [[Buck Henry]], and [[John Goodman]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=396}} to musicians like [[Dolly Parton]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=230}} to political activist [[Ralph Nader]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=229}} Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the [[Five-Timers Club]], a term that originated on a sketch performed on [[Tom Hanks]]'s fifth episode.<ref name="Host5Timer" /> As of February 11, 2017, actor [[Alec Baldwin]] holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor [[Steve Martin]] who had hosted fifteen times since 1976.<ref name="HostBaldwinRec" /> Occasionally, in an effort to boost ratings and/or to maintain the show's budget, former SNL cast members also host; however, [[Eddie Murphy]] is the only person to host the show while still a member of the cast, albeit filling in for [[Nick Nolte]].

Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host, and may also appear in comedy sketches. As of May 19, 2012, [[Dave Grohl]] is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.<ref name="MusicalGrohl" /> Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using [[lip-synching]] tracks,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=45}} believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are made only when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.<ref name="60MinutesInterview" /> A 1975 performance by pop group [[ABBA]] was the first and only act to feature lip-synching,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=45}} until [[Saturday Night Live incidents#Ashlee Simpson|the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson]]. Recently, however (particularly in [[Saturday Night Live (season 43)|season 43]]), there have been more solo acts than groups. Conversely, for the past seven years, the show has ended its seasons with a solo musical act, while for the past two years the show has begun and ended with a solo host and solo musical guest.

=== The SNL Band ===
{{main|Saturday Night Live Band}}

The Saturday Night Live Band (also known as "The Live Band") is the [[house band]] for ''SNL''. Academy Award-winning composer [[Howard Shore]] served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including [[Paul Shaffer]] (1975–1980), [[Lou Marini]] (1975–1983), [[David Sanborn]] (1975), [[Michael Brecker]] (early 1980s), [[Ray Chew]] (1980–1983), [[Alan Rubin]] (1975–1983), [[Georg Wadenius]] (1979–1985), [[Steve Ferrone]] (1985), [[David Johansen]] (performing as Buster Poindexter), [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]] (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and [[G. E. Smith]] (musical director from 1985 to 1995). As of 2017, the band is under the leadership of [[Tower of Power]] alumnus [[Lenny Pickett]], keyboardist [[Leon Pendarvis]], and Eli Brueggemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic instrumentation has been three saxophones (alto, tenor, and baritone), one trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards (piano and Hammond organ), a guitar, bass guitar, drums, and an extra percussionist, not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo's arrival in 1995. The 1983–1984 and 1984–1985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a ''Saturday Night Live'' bumper graphic until the program resumes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/band.shtml|title=SNL Band from NBC}}</ref> The band plays "Closing Theme (Waltz in A)", written by Shore, at the end of the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4kCEy9eIsrujGHv9nqEwWnEIIPw6rgAN|title=On the Record: 'Tapestry,' SNL songs close, but not the same|last=Darr|first=Deanna|work=[[Rapid City Journal]]|date=May 16, 2013|access-date=May 4, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:29 - New York - Octobre 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Comcast Building]] (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or "30 Rock") from which the show is broadcast]]

=== The studio ===
{{main|Studio 8H}}
Since the show's inception, ''SNL'' has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors{{nbsp}}8 and{{nbsp}}9 of the Comcast Building (formerly the [[RCA Building]] and [[GE Building]]) ([[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] or "30 Rock"). The studio had originally been used as a radio [[soundstage]] for [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, in need of repair,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=30}} and lacking the capacity to host a live show. Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} at a cost of approximately $300,000.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} Three of the first four shows of the 1976–77 season were shot at the former [[JC Studios|NBC Studios]] in Brooklyn, due to [[NBC News]] using Studio 8H for [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election]] coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/history.shtml|title=SNL's Studio from NBC}}</ref>

During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first-season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in [[high-definition television]], appearing [[letterbox]]ed on conventional television screens. The offices of ''SNL'' writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of "30 Rock."{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=35}}

=== Creating an episode ===
Production on an ''SNL'' episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}}<ref name="SatNightDocu" /> between the cast, writers, producers, including Michaels and the guest host in Michaels's office over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} a process which usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday evening.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}<ref name="SatNightDocu" /> At 5{{nbsp}}p.m. on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers room,<ref name="SatNightDocu" /> attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=28}} At this point, there may be at least forty sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=28}}

After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels's office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|pp=28–29}} Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} but will certainly commence on Thursday. Work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}} and possibly rehearsals.<ref name="SatNightDocu" /> If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8{{nbsp}}p.m., again on Saturday before the live show.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}<ref name="SatNightDocu" /> After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=30}} This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}} The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=23}}

According to an interview with Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated Weekend Update writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of Weekend Update will normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.<ref>{{cite web

=== Post-production ===
With onsite facilities housed on floors{{nbsp}}8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of ''Saturday Night Live'' include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring, and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganize for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily [[analog recording|analog]] to [[Digital data|digital]] in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and five cameras' worth of visual elements.<ref name="snlpostprodsan">{{cite web|url=http://www.qlogic.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Education_and_Resource/case_studies/SNL_v3.pdf |title=Case study.

=== Filming and photography ===
Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. Video camera equipment, as of 2014, included four [[Sony]] BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras. As of 2018, the show uses five Sony HDC-1500 cameras, primarily mounted on [[Vinten]] [[pedestals]], although one is mounted on a Chapman-Leonard Electra crane.<ref>{{cite web |title=Studio 8H and the Chapman crane |url=http://eyesofageneration.com/teletales/studio-8h-and-the-chapman-crane/ |website=Eyes Of A Generation{{nbsp}}...

As of 2014, [[Grass Valley (company)|GVG]] 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analog video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a [[Chyron Corporation|Chyron]] Lyric Pro character generator and an [[Avid Technology|Avid]] Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analog mixing console, and a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[digital mixing console]] used for tape playback support and utility audio work.<ref name="nbcproduction8h">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcproductionservices.com/studio8H.stm |title=NBC Production Services |publisher=NBC Production Services |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302221721/http://www.nbcproductionservices.com/studio8H.stm |access-date=April 12, 2010 |archive-date=2014-03-02}}</ref> While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013–14) had a budget of over $70&nbsp;million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of $12.3&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.esd.ny.gov/Reports/2015_2016/FTCP_4Q2015_Report.pdf 1FILM TAX CREDIT –QUARTERLY REPORTCALENDAR YEAR 2015:FOURTH QUARTER DECEMBER 31,2015] Empire State Development</ref>

As of 2009, the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30&nbsp;[[frame rate|fps]], with slow-motion sequences shot at 60&nbsp;fps, both in full 1080p high definition.<ref name="snlpostprodcanon">{{cite web|url=http://www.shootonline.com/go/index.php?name=Release&op=view&id=rs-web2-1141654-1257971505-2 |title=NBC's Saturday Night Live shoots opening title sequence in full 1080p HD video with Canon's EOS digital SLR cameras | date=November 11, 2009 |access-date=November 16, 2009| publisher=[[Shoot (advertising magazine)|Shoot]]}}</ref>

Edie Baskin was the original ''SNL'' photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=39}} The first episode used publicity photos of host George Carlin as transitional [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host [[Paul Simon]]. It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=41}}

Since 1999, [[Mary Ellen Matthews]] has been the official photographer of ''SNL'', responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.<ref name="MatthewsInt1" /> Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with [[soft light|hard lights]] to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: "I think it just helps the image pop off the screen{{nbsp}}... If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional{{nbsp}}... The [classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can."<ref name="MatthewsInt2" /> Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.<ref name="MatthewsInt2" />

The show begins at 11:29:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and is scheduled for a 92-minute timeslot ending at 1:02&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="nbcabout">{{cite web|title=NBC.com – Saturday Night Live (About)|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/|access-date=April 29, 2011|website=NBC.com}}</ref>

For most of ''SNL'''s history, it aired live only to NBC stations in the Eastern and [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] Zones, with all others receiving a recorded broadcast at the normal start time of late-night network programming (11:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and 10:30&nbsp;p.m. in other time zones). Since 2017, the show is broadcast live across the contiguous United States. Because the show airs outside of the [[safe harbor (broadcasting)|safe harbor]] outside of Eastern and Central Time, a brief [[broadcast delay]] is installed to meet [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations of primetime programming.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/sam-rockwell-drops-f-bomb-snl-1202664138/|title = Sam Rockwell Drops Surprise 'F-Bomb' on 'SNL'|last = Steinberg|first = Brian|work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = January 13, 2018|access-date = February 23, 2019}}</ref>

Outside of the contiguous United States, the show also airs live on the three NBC stations in [[Alaska]] at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. local. Two NBC stations still broadcast ''SNL'' on tape-delay: [[KHNL]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] delays it one hour to 7:30&nbsp;p.m.; and [[KUAM-TV]] in [[Guam]], where the live broadcast occurs at 1:30&nbsp;p.m. Sunday, delays it to 11 p.m.

Since the first opening in 1975 with Michael O'Donoghue, Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a [[cold open]] sketch which ends with one or more cast members [[breaking character]] and proclaiming "[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]", segueing into the opening credits which start immediately after.<ref name="LFNYch1" /> From May 1985 to April 1991, Saturday Night Live was occasionally preempted for ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''.

In February 2013, NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on Saturday evenings at 10&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time during the regular season; the episodes scheduled were sometimes rebroadcasts of the previous week's episode if it was a first-run broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Michael|title=NBC Brings Saturday Night Live to Saturday Primetime|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/saturday-night-live-primetime-1062086.aspx|website=tvguide.com|access-date=April 16, 2014}}</ref> Since the 2014–15 season, the show's 40th anniversary, the prime time rebroadcasts have been a selection of episodes from throughout the show's run under the title ''SNL Vintage''.

NBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies either with NBC or [[Universal Television]]. From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, [[Comedy Central]] and its predecessor [[Ha! (TV channel)|Ha!]] re-aired reruns of the series, after which [[E!]] Entertainment Television signed a deal to carry reruns.<ref>{{cite news

On March 16, 2017, NBC announced that it would air the final four episodes of the [[Saturday Night Live (season 42)|42nd season]] live in all mainland U.S. time zones for the first time in its history.

=== Delays ===
The episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by [[Rosanna Arquette]], was not aired until November{{nbsp}}8 due to [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcasting Game{{nbsp}}6 of the [[1986 World Series]] between the [[New York Mets]] and [[Boston Red Sox]]; the game entered extra innings, causing that night's broadcast of ''SNL'' to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30&nbsp;AM Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with an "apology" by Mets pitcher [[Ron Darling]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Saturday Night Live (TV Series) Rosanna Arquette/Ric Ocasek (1986) Trivia|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0694505/trivia|website=IMDb|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref>

The episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by [[Jennifer Lopez]], aired 45 minutes late due to an [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later. The fledgling football league ended up changing their rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off - whether the game had been decided or not - when ''SNL'' started, so that no such incident would happen again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1021846/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Fight Club |date=February 26, 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909080030/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1021846/index.htm |archive-date=September 9, 2010}}</ref>

The episode on November 7, 2020, hosted by [[Dave Chappelle]], began at 12:10 a.m. Eastern after a [[2020 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]-[[2020 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] [[college football]] game went into double overtime.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2020/11/08/snl-fans-fuming-over-delay-due-to-college-football/ |work=New York Post |title=‘SNL’ fans ticked off after show is delayed by college football game |date=November 8, 2020}}</ref>

== International versions==
Because ''SNL'' has been a huge success in the United States, channels in other countries have created their own versions of the show, including in the Middle East and North Africa region, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, and Poland.<ref name="jezebel">{{cite web|title=Saturday Night Live's International Siblings|url=http://jezebel.com/5810481/saturday-night-lives-international-siblings|access-date=June 26, 2011|website=jezebel}}</ref><ref name="MTV">{{cite web|title=Saturday Night Live – Ohjelmat – MTV.fi|url=http://www.mtv.fi/saturdaynightlive|access-date=January 6, 2015|website=mtv}}</ref>

In the mid-late 1980s, the UK's Channel Four, in association with London Weekend Television, did a version called variously "[[Saturday Live (British TV programme)|Saturday Live]]" (no use of the word Night), and "Friday Night Live", the repeat version entitled "Saturday Almost Live". 

A German version of ''SNL'' named ''RTL Samstag Nacht'' aired between 1993 and 1998 on [[RTL Television]]. Most episodes were hosted by German celebrities, however, some shows were hosted by American personalities who never hosted the American version, including [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Michael Winslow]]. Due to language barriers, they appeared only in opening monologues and in a limited number of sketches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106108/|title=RTL Samstag Nacht (TV Series 1993–1998)|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>

''SNL'' in its original American version has aired in [[Israel]] since the early 2000s and is broadcast by satellite provider [[Yes (Israel)|yes]]. There was a local SNL-based show named ''Am Israel Hai'' (People of Israel Live) back in 2002 but it was canceled after one season. Another SNL-esque Israeli show, ''[[Eretz Nehederet]]'' (A Wonderful Country), debuted in 2003 and continues to garner high ratings.

''SNL'' also airs in the Middle East and North Africa, [[OSN]] First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osn.com/onlineguide/schedules/channel_en_gb.aspx?Channel=OCO&Genre=SER |title=OSN |publisher=OSN |date=October 15, 2011 |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>

In India and Sri Lanka, ''Saturday Night Live!'' airs on [[Comedy Central India|Comedy Central]], in an hour-long version, one week after the U.S. broadcast.<ref>http://tv.burrp.com/channel/Comedy%20Central/267/ {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

Spain's version of the show was short-lived, lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied heavily from the American version, as they did their own versions of sketches already done on the original series.<ref name="jezebel" /> Italy's ''Saturday Night Live From Milan'' aired for four seasons and used original material.<ref name="jezebel" /><ref name="mediaset1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.mediaset.it/italia1/snl/ |title=SNL Italy |publisher=Tv.mediaset.it |date=July 6, 2011 |access-date=August 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816225746/http://www.tv.mediaset.it/italia1/snl/ |archive-date=August 16, 2011 }}</ref>

== Reception ==
In 2002, ''SNL'' was ranked tenth on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]],<ref name="tvguidebestsnl">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|title=TV Guide names Top 50 shows|access-date=November 23, 2009|publisher=Associated Press/CBS News | date=April 26, 2002}}</ref> while in 2007 it was honored with inclusion on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of "100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''."<ref name="nbcabout" /><ref name="AwardTime100" /> In June 2013, the show was placed at number 25 on the list of the 101 best written shows of all time by the [[Writers Guild of America]], assessing series from the previous seventy years.<ref name="2013WGABestever" /> In December 2013, ''TV Guide'' ranked it #18 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |title=The Greatest Shows on Earth |journal=TV Guide |volume=61 |issue=3194–3195 |pages=16–19 }}</ref> A 2015 ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named ''SNL'' as their #7 favorite show.<ref name="thr20150916">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-tv-shows-ever-top-819499/item/friends-hollywoods-100-favorite-tv-821361 |title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-07-17 |language=en}}</ref> It is currently{{as of when|date=October 2017}} the 40th longest running television show in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2016, a ''[[New York Times]]'' study of the fifty television shows with the most [[Facebook like]]s found that ''SNL'' "is very much an urban show. It is most popular in cities throughout the country, and college towns. [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst, Mass.]]; [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, Wis.]]; and [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] are all among the top 10."<ref name="katz20161227">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title='Duck Dynasty' vs. 'Modern Family': 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=December 27, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

By late 2020, however, critics were cautioning that the show was too dependent upon visiting guest actors and former ''SNL'' cast members -- particularly for its impersonations of prominent politicians in the [[2020 U.S. Presidential Election]] races -- and was beginning to have difficulty producing relevant, truly funny content.<ref name="can_we_joke_2020_10_05_time_com">[[Judy Berman|Berman, Judy]]:  [https://time.com/5896549/snl-late-night-trump-covid-19/ "Can We Joke About the President Having COVID-19?

=== Accolades ===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Saturday Night Live}}
[[File:Lorne Michaels and the cast of Saturday Night Live at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Political Satire 2008.jpg|thumb|Lorne Michaels and the cast of Saturday Night Live at the 68th Annual [[Peabody Awards]] for Political Satire 2008]]

''Saturday Night Live'' has won numerous awards since its debut, including sixty-five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s,<ref name="GD" /> four [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s,<ref name="writersguildsnl" /> and three [[Peabody Award]]s.<ref name="peabodywinnersbooksnl" /> In 2009, it received a total of thirteen Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record for the most award-nominated show in Primetime Emmy Award history, previously set with 124 by hospital drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name="AwardsRecordEmmy" /><ref name="AwardsRecordEmmy2" /> As of July 2017, it has received a record total of 231 Primetime Emmy Award nominations.<ref name="nbcabout" /><ref name="2012AccoAug" />

Twenty cast members have received individual Primetime Emmy Award nominations in the show's history. These nominations were mostly in the category of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]] before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have been in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Supporting Actor]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Supporting Actress]] categories for comedy series. Of the thirty-six total nominations for these twenty performers, five have won: [[Chevy Chase]] (1976), [[Gilda Radner]] (1978), [[Dana Carvey]] (1993), [[Kate McKinnon]] (2016, 2017), and [[Alec Baldwin]] (2017).<ref name="GD" />

=== Electoral effect ===
''SNL'' has also affected American elections—most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called ''SNL'' Effect was observed during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on ''SNL'', with ten percent saying it had made a difference in their decision. [[Barack Obama]] was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.<ref name="ImpactGeneral" />

Chevy Chase's bumbling impression of then-president [[Gerald Ford]] during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] stating "I can see Russia from my house" was actually spoken by SNL cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.<ref name="ImpactPalin" /> The political content was abandoned briefly following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], terrorist attack in New York, with Amy Poehler saying the writers did not want to produce politicized material.<ref name="THRPolitical" />

Several politicians have appeared on ''SNL'', including President [[Gerald Ford]] (in 1976, during the show's first season), then-Senator Barack Obama (2007), Senator [[John McCain]] (2002 and 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008 and 2015), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey's Palin impression, resulting in the show's largest audience in fourteen years with fourteen million viewers.<ref name="HostPoliticians" /><ref name="THRPolitical" /> Senator Obama's appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance.<ref name="THRPolitical" /> [[Donald Trump]] hosted the show in 2015,<ref>{{cite episode|title=2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkLzSLkYnGc|access-date=4 October 2020|series=41|series-link=Saturday Night Live (season 41)|network=NBC|date=November 7, 2015}}</ref> which was met with controversy from a Latino PAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/donald-trump-snl-deport-racism-pac-reward-video-1201609250/|title=Donald Trump On ‘SNL’: Latino PAC Offers Reward To Disrupt Broadcast|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|access-date= 6 October 2020|website=Deadline|date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

{{main|List of Saturday Night Live incidents}}
[[File:Sinead rips into the Pope.jpg|thumb|[[Sinéad O'Connor]] tears a picture of [[Pope John Paul II]] apart during a live SNL performance]]

Due to the show's [[live television|live factor]], a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to [[dead air]] have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992, appearance by singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]], in which she ripped up a photo of [[Pope John Paul II]] during her performance.<ref name=SalonSinead>{{cite news|last1=Tapper|first1=Jake|title=Sin|url=http://www.salon.com/2002/10/12/sinead_3/|access-date=June 19, 2015|work=Salon|date=October 13, 2002}}</ref><ref name=AVClubSinead>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=Inventory: Ten Memorable Saturday Night Live Musical Moments|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/inventory-ten-memorable-isaturday-night-livei-musi-1525|website=A.V.

On October 23, 2004, [[Ashlee Simpson]] appeared as a musical guest, and there was a [[lip synching]] mishap. Her first performance, "[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]," was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, "[[Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)|Autobiography]]," the vocals for "Pieces of Me" were heard again through the speakers, even before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig and then became the only musical act to leave the stage. At the goodnights at the close of the show, Simpson blamed her band for playing the wrong song.<ref name=NBCTodaySimpson>{{cite news|title=Ashlee Simpson takes 'SNL' lip sync blame|url=http://www.today.com/id/6356035/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/ashlee-simpson-takes-snl-lip-sync-blame#.VYN2yM791UE|access-date=June 19, 2015|work=Today|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=October 28, 2004}}</ref>

===Minority representation===
Over the years, ''SNL'' has been criticized for its perceived lack of racial and sexuality minority representation. A 2016 study of ''SNL'' episodes from 1975 to 2016 (826 total) revealed over 90% of episodes had white hosts, while 6.8% were black, 1.2% were Hispanic, and 1.1% were of another racial minority.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/snl-awkwafina-become-first-asian-woman-host-18-years-1149851|title='SNL': Awkwafina to Become First Asian Woman to Host in 18 Years| last= Kilkenny| first= Katie| date= October 5, 2018|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> When longtime cast member Kenan Thompson suggested in 2013 that female African-American representation was low because producers were not finding such comediennes who were "ready," media outlets countered it was ''SNL'' that was not ready, and the racial disparity "is symptomatic of problems deeply rooted in comedy and the entertainment industry at large."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gennis |first1=Sadie |title=Kenan Thompson Blames SNL's Diversity Issue on Lack of Talented Black Comediennes |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-diversity-issue-kenan-thompson-1072056/ |website=TV Guide |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=14 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kerry |first1=Coddett |title=The Real Problem With SNL and Casting Black Women |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/the-real-problem-with-snl-and-casting-black-women/281280/ |website=The Atlantic |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=8 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/the-remarkable-rise-of-tiffany-haddish/538872/|title=The Remarkable Rise of Tiffany Haddish|last=Jeffries|first=Michael P.|date=September 7, 2017|website=[[The Atlantic]]|language=en-US|access-date=December 9, 2019}}</ref>

=== Films ===
{{main|List of Saturday Night Live feature films}}

''SNL'' has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which earned over $115&nbsp;million on a $27&nbsp;million budget.<ref name="BOMBlues" />

In 1990, Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled ''The Saturday Night Live Movie'' with many of the show's then-current writing staff, including [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Robert Smigel]], and [[George Meyer]], contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990, before being abandoned.<ref>[http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2012/07/06/script-review-the-saturday-night-live-movie/ Script Review: THE SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE MOVIE] from filmbuffonline.com</ref>

The success of ''Wayne's World'' (1992) encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (1993), followed by ''[[It's Pat]]'' (1994); ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]'' (1995); ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'' (1998), ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'' (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did not—notably, ''It's Pat'', which did so badly at the box office the studio that made the film, [[Touchstone Pictures]] (owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], which also owns NBC's rival [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), pulled it only one week after releasing it,<ref>[http://www.filmcritic.com/features/2010/05/snls-bad-boys----top-ten-worst-snlmovies/ Live, From New York, It's the Worst Movies From the Cast of SNL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527104355/http://www.filmcritic.com/features/2010/05/snls-bad-boys----top-ten-worst-snlmovies/ |date=May 27, 2010}} from filmcritic.com</ref> and ''Stuart Saves His Family'', which lost $14&nbsp;million. Many of these films were produced by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The films based on ''The Blues Brothers'' were produced by [[Universal Studios]], which merged with NBC in 2004 to form [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] (Universal also has a [[United International Pictures|joint venture]] with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios' films).

The character Bob Roberts from the [[Tim Robbins]] [[Bob Roberts|film of the same name]] (1992) first appeared on ''SNL'' in a short film about the conservative folk singer.

In addition, the 1999 comedy film ''[[Office Space]]'' originated from a series of animated short films by [[Mike Judge]] that aired on ''SNL'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite news | last = Fierman | first = Daniel | title = Judge's Dread | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = February 26, 1999 | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274497,00.html | access-date = August 16, 2007}}</ref>

The fictitious American folk music trio [[The Folksmen]] first appeared on ''SNL'', performing the song "Old Joe's Place" before later appearing in the film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: [[Harry Shearer]], [[Michael McKean]], and [[Christopher Guest]], who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]. At the time of the appearance (the 1984–85 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.

''[[Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures]]'' is based on the [[Mr. Bill]] sketches from early seasons of ''SNL''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091565/ |title=Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures (1986) – IMDb |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=IMDb |access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Rosenberg |title=The First Arrivals on the Home Front |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58024463.html?dids=58024463:58024463&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+10%2C+1986&author=HOWARD+ROSENBERG&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=THE+FIRST+ARRIVALS+ON+THE+HOME+FRONT&pqatl=google |work=Los Angeles Times |page=1, Calendar section |date=September 10, 1986 |access-date=October 11, 2013}}</ref>

=== Music ===
In 2005, the comedy troupe [[The Lonely Island]], consisting of ''SNL'' members [[Andy Samberg]], [[Akiva Schaffer]], and [[Jorma Taccone]], gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic music video "[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]," written with fellow cast member [[Chris Parnell]]. The song became a surprise hit,<ref name="LonelyIsland1" /> and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including "[[Like a Boss]]," "[[Jizz in My Pants]]," "[[I'm on a Boat]]," "[[Incredibad|We Like Sportz]]," "[[Incredibad|Boombox]]," and "[[Dick in a Box]]"—which won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]] in 2007<ref name="LonelyIsland2" />—saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, ''[[Incredibad]]'' (2009)<ref name="LonelyIsland3" /> and ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' (2011), containing ''SNL''-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by [[Universal Republic Records]] who were provided with a license to the ''SNL'' songs by NBC and Broadway Video.

A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song "Chevy's Girls" and comedy bits from the show (Weekend Update, "Emily Litella," "Gun Control");<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-NBCs-Saturday-Night-Live/release/2119575 |title=NBC's Saturday Night Live|website=www.discogs.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref> it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download.

=== Other ===
Several programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. A ''60 Minutes'' report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an [[A&E Network|A&E]] episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' which covered the production process, as well as an episode of ''TV Tales'' in 2002 on [[E!]]. In 2010, [[Saturday Night (2010 film)|''Saturday Night'']], a 94-minute documentary by actor [[James Franco]] in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by [[John Malkovich]], from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live.
