The list provides a short summary on some of the known business activities of the individuals and families, together with commentary on how their ranking has changed from the previous year, if listed. 

The list was historically released annually in May or June in a special issue of the ''[[BRW (magazine)|Business Review Weekly]] (BRW)'', published by [[Fairfax Media]]. The final hardcopy issue of ''BRW'' was published in November 2013, and between 2014 and March 2016, the list was published online only. In March 2016 the ''BRW Rich 200'' was published in hardcopy in ''The Australian Financial Review Magazine'' (or  ''AFR Magazine''), and published online on the ''Financial Review'' website.<ref name="BRWclosure"/> In 2017, the list was renamed as the ''Financial Review Rich List'', published in both print and online. The most recent list was published in October 2020.

In 2008 it was the first time in more than 20 years that [[Kerry Packer|Kerry]] or [[James Packer]] had not headed the list. [[Andrew Forrest]] was listed as the richest person in Australia, with a net worth estimated at A$9.41&nbsp;billion, with James Packer listed third with A$6.1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=news2008>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/alan-bond-makes-brw-rich-list-comeback/story-e6frfm1i-1111116468829 |title=Alan Bond makes BRW rich list comeback |author=Chappell, Trevor |date=28 May 2008 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |work=news.com.au |location=Australia |accessdate=27 July 2011 }}</ref> In 2009 Pratt was top of the list with A$4.3&nbsp;billion.

The list has sometimes caught the ire of those profiled. In an essay celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''BRW'', Jefferson Penberthy, the founding editor of the ''BRW Rich 100'' wrote that Australian entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]], at one stage valued at A$50&nbsp;million, did not want to appear on the list. When told that the cut off was A$35&nbsp;million, Smith publicly divested A$20&nbsp;million to charities.<ref name=blood/>

The ''Financial Review Rich List'' excludes individuals who have renounced their Australian citizenship. For example, despite [[Rupert Murdoch]] being born in Australia and having a personal net wealth of [[US dollar|US$]]7.6&nbsp;billion in 2011,<ref name="Forbes">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/rupert-murdoch |title=World's billionaires: Rupert Murdoch profile |work=Forbes |date=March 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2011 }}</ref> due to Murdoch becoming a [[naturalized|naturalised]] US citizen in 1985, he was excluded from the list.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/national/rupert_murdoch_tops_brw_executive_Entix4zLbUv5PBV4ztmd8I |title=Rupert Murdoch tops BRW Executive Rich List 2014 |work=[[Business Review Weekly|BRW]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |author=Xavier, Allan |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=26 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094021/http://www.brw.com.au/p/national/rupert_murdoch_tops_brw_executive_Entix4zLbUv5PBV4ztmd8I |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The ''BRW Rich Families List'' was first published annually between 2008 and 2015. In every year of its publication the [[Victor Smorgon|Smorgon family]] has headed the list, with estimated wealth of A$2.74&nbsp;billion in 2015 spread across seven branches of the family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/poultry_fortunes_property_how_australia_AXBIWJiDYVaSlF4gebRFXJ |title=Poultry to property: how Australia’s richest families are making second fortunes|work=[[BRW (magazine)|BRW]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=26 October 2015 |author=Stensholt, John }}</ref> In 2015 the list comprised fifty families with an entry point of A$302&nbsp;million.<ref name=BRW2015fam>{{cite news |url=http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-families/2015/ |title=Rich Families List 2015 |work=BRW |location=Australia |date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=26 October 2015 }}</ref> The families list has not been published in hard copy or online since 2015.

On 4 March 2016, Fairfax Media announced the closure of the ''BRW'' website, and redirected the site to a new section of ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''.
