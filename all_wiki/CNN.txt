===Major events===
[[File:CNN Center newsroom1.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the newsroom at CNN Center.]]

====Gulf War====
The first Persian [[Gulf War]] in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the "[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]" American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside [[Iraq]] during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the [[al-Rashid Hotel]] in [[Baghdad]] by reporters Bernard Shaw, [[John Holliman]] and [[Peter Arnett]].

[[File:CNN Gulf War nightscope January 1991.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Desert Storm]] as captured live on a CNN [[night vision]] camera with reporters narrating.]]

The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Shaw on January 16, 1991, as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1996/2/96.02.08.x.html|title=The Gulf War and its Consequences|publisher=Yale.edu|year=1996|access-date=October 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326004359/http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1996/2/96.02.08.x.html|archive-date=March 26, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{quote|This is Bernie Shaw. Something is happening outside. ... Peter Arnett, join me here. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing... The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. ... We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky.}}

Unable to immediately broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic feel of a radio broadcast – and was compared to legendary [[CBS]] news anchor [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s gripping live radio reports of the German bombing of London during [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/06/entertainment/et-howard6|title='Baghdad': When CNN was the news|date=December 6, 2002|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 22, 2017|issn=0458-3035|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423132548/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/06/entertainment/et-howard6|archive-date=April 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IyjcoJ1BtMC&q=cnn%20gulf%20war%20%22billion%20viewers%22&pg=PT33 |title=Remade in America: How Asia Will Change Because America Boomed|last=Rohwer|first=Jim|date=March 15, 2001|publisher=Crown Publishing Group |isbn=9780609504123}}</ref>

The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy, and made household names of previously obscure reporters. Shaw, known for his live-from-Bagdhad reporting during the Gulf War, became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/bernard-shaw-38028|title=Bernard Shaw|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=April 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929135442/https://www.biography.com/people/bernard-shaw-38028|archive-date=September 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/2/where-are-they-now-bernard-shaw|title=Where Are They Now?

===Trump presidency, AT&T ownership===
The [[presidency of Donald Trump]] has led to many prominent controversies involving CNN. The network was accused by critics of giving disproportionate amounts of coverage to Donald Trump and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Hillary Clinton]]. CNN president [[Jeff Zucker]] defended CNN against the criticism, commenting that out of the Republican candidates, Trump was the most willing to give on-air interviews. Trump commented upon the allegations during his speech at the 2017 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC), jokingly referring to CNN as the "Clinton News Network".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-talks-about-enemies-again-at-cpac|title=Trump Talks About Enemies, Again, at CPAC|last=Sorkin|first=Amy Davidson|date=February 24, 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=October 27, 2017|issn=0028-792X|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027130415/https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-talks-about-enemies-again-at-cpac|archive-date=October 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=CNNLightningRod>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/03/cnn-media-bias-donald-trump|title=Here's why CNN Became a Lightning Rod for Accusations of Media Bias|date=December 3, 2016|work=Fortune|access-date=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422033207/http://fortune.com/2016/12/03/cnn-media-bias-donald-trump/|archive-date=April 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Trump interviewed by CNN and VOA.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Donald Trump]] interview with CNN and [[Voice of America]] in September 2016.]]
In January 2017, CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on a [[Donald Trump–Russia dossier|classified dossier]] which detailed compromising personal and financial information allegedly obtained by the Russian government. While CNN did not publish the dossier, Trump criticized the network during a press conference the following day, and refused to take a question from CNN reporter [[Jim Acosta]], claiming that the network was "[[fake news]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/01/trump-refusing-to-answer-question-from-cnn-reporter-you-are-fake-news-233485|title=Trump calls CNN 'fake news', as channel defends its reporting on intelligence briefing|work=Politico|access-date=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925120010/https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/01/trump-refusing-to-answer-question-from-cnn-reporter-you-are-fake-news-233485|archive-date=September 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On June 26, 2017, CNN investigative journalists Thomas Frank, [[Eric Lichtblau]], and Lex Haris voluntarily resigned after the network retracted an online article which incorrectly connected Trump aide [[Anthony Scaramucci]] to a $10 billion Russian investment fund.

In July 2017, Trump posted a video on Twitter of himself tackling [[Vince McMahon]] on the ground during [[WrestleMania 23]], edited to replace McMahon's face with the CNN logo. The clip was considered to be a further expression of his opinions regarding the network's quality of coverage. Several media columnists and Democratic politicians condemned the retweeted video, concerned that its substance—given the tone of some of Trump's criticism of mainstream media outlets for what he deems as unfavorable coverage of him, and his presidency—could encourage some of his extreme right-wing supporters to commit violence against journalists from outlets outside of the conservative media spectrum.<ref name="kfile">{{cite news|title=How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/politics/kfile-reddit-user-trump-tweet/index.html|date=July 4, 2017|access-date=July 5, 2017|work=CNN Politics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012924/http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/politics/kfile-reddit-user-trump-tweet/index.html|archive-date=July 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="nyt-fraudnews">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/media/trump-wrestling-video-cnn-twitter.html|title=Trump Tweets a Video of Him Wrestling 'CNN' to the Ground|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=July 2, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702183957/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/media/trump-wrestling-video-cnn-twitter.html|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> CNN also faced [[CNN controversies#Redditor controversy|criticism]] over an investigation that identified the [[Reddit]] user (associated with a Trump-focused community on the service, [[r/The_Donald]]) who had allegedly created the video, facing accusations that they had [[blackmailed]] the user.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Chris|title=CNN accused of 'blackmailing' Trump gif maker|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-40504203|access-date=July 5, 2017|work=BBC News|date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706003407/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-40504203|archive-date=July 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Apology>{{cite news|last1=Nwanevu|first1=Osita|title=Reddit User Apologizes for Trump-CNN GIF; CNN Coverage Raises Eyebrows|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/07/05/reddit_user_hanassholesolo_apologizes_for_trump_cnn_gif_cnn_covers_with.html|access-date=July 5, 2017|work=Slate|date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705143150/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/07/05/reddit_user_hanassholesolo_apologizes_for_trump_cnn_gif_cnn_covers_with.html|archive-date=July 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The network's evening and primetime lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including ''[[Erin Burnett OutFront]]'' at 7 p.m. ET,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Colby|title=CNN Reveals New 7 pm Show Title: Erin Burnett: OutFront|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-reveals-erin-burnetts-new-show-title-outfront/|work=Mediaite|access-date=September 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731015404/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-reveals-erin-burnetts-new-show-title-outfront/|archive-date=July 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' at 8 p.m. ET, followed by ''[[Cuomo Prime Time]]'' with [[Chris Cuomo]] at 9 p.m., and ''[[CNN Tonight]]'' hosted by [[Don Lemon]] at 10 p.m. Eastern. Overnight programming consists of reruns of the primetime lineup, and an overnight simulcast of the [[CNN International]] version of ''[[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|CNN Newsroom]]'' from Atlanta.

Weekend primetime is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as [[Documentary film|documentary]] specials and [[miniseries]], and documentary-style [[reality television|reality]] series (such as ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]'' and ''[[United Shades of America]]''), as well as acquired documentary films presented under the banner ''[[CNN Films]]''. The network's weekend morning programming consists of ''CNN Newsroom'' (simulcast from CNN International) at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by the weekend editions of ''New Day'', hosted by [[Christi Paul]] and [[Victor Blackwell]], which airs every Saturday at 6–9 a.m. ET and Sunday at 6–8 a.m. ET, and the network's Saturday program ''Smerconish'' with [[Michael Smerconish]] at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at 6 p.m. Eastern.

For the 2014–15 season, after cancelling ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' (which, itself, replaced the long-running ''[[Larry King Live]]''), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ET hour, such as [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]]'s ''[[The Hunt with John Walsh|The Hunt]]'', ''[[This Is Life with Lisa Ling]]'', and [[Mike Rowe]]'s ''[[Somebody's Gotta Do It]]''. Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on [[pundit]]-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network.

By 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off ''1968''), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and U.S. policies, such as ''The Bush Years'', and ''American Dynasties: The [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]]''—which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7 million viewers.

[[File:CNN Election Express.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN Election Express bus, used for broadcasts.]]
CNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/17920|title=CNN Rolls Out Election Express|publisher=Tvtechnology.com|date=October 17, 2007|access-date=October 12, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125163505/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/17920|archive-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref>

In December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower-third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static "flipper", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the [[RSS]] feeds of CNN.com), or "topical" details related to a story.<ref name=CNNnewlook>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/160701-CNN_Gets_New_Graphic_Look.php|title=CNN Gets New Graphic Look|date=December 15, 2008|magazine=Broadcasting & Cable|last=Dickson|first=Glen|access-date=January 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206234223/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/160701-CNN_Gets_New_Graphic_Look.php|archive-date=February 6, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="tvn-2011look">{{cite web|title=CNN Debuts New Graphics Package|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn-debuts-new-graphics-package_b47645|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713161604/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn-debuts-new-graphics-package_b47645|archive-date=July 13, 2014|website=TVNewser|access-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref>

CNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue and white color scheme, and moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen. Additionally, the network began to solely produce its programming in the [[16:9]] aspect ratio, with standard definition feeds using a [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] version of the HD feed.<ref name="tvn-2011look"/> On February 18, 2013, the "flipper" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker; originally displayed as a blue background with white text, the ticker was reconfigured a day later with blue text on a white background to match the look of the 'flipper'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/so-long-flipper-the-ticker-returns-to-cnn_b167507|title=The Ticker Returns to CNN|last=Airens|first=Chris|date=February 18, 2013|work=TVNewser|access-date=February 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221024656/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/so-long-flipper-the-ticker-returns-to-cnn_b167507|archive-date=February 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On August 11, 2014, CNN introduced its most recent graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]] typeface. The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from [[CNN Business]], and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, [[hashtag]], or [[Twitter]] handle for the show being aired or its anchor.<ref name="tvn-2014graphics">{{cite web|title=CNN Updates Graphics Package|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn-updates-graphics-package_b235005|website=TVNewser|access-date=September 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815050801/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn-updates-graphics-package_b235005|archive-date=August 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as "CNN Sans", across all of its platforms.

[[CNN Pipeline]] was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or "pipes"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up "news alerts" to computer users.
