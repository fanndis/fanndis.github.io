'''Aurora''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|r|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|ɔː|r|ə}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Colorado#Home rule municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]], spanning [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe]] and [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams counties]], with the extreme southeastern portion of the city extending into [[Douglas County, Colorado|Douglas County]]. Aurora is one of the principal cities of the [[Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Aurora, Colorado}}
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}
Before European settlement, the land that now makes up Aurora was the territory of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute), and Očeti Šakówiŋ (Sioux) tribes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Temprano |first1=Victor |title=Native Land |url=https://native-land.ca/ |website=Native Land Digital |date=2015}}</ref>
Aurora originated in the 1880s as the town of Fletcher, taking its name from Denver businessman [[Donald Fletcher]] who saw it as a real estate opportunity. He and his partners staked out {{Convert|4|sqmi|spell=in}} east of [[Denver]], but the town - and Colorado - struggled mightily after the [[Denver Depression of 1893|Silver Crash of 1893]]. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town Aurora in 1907, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aurora, composed of hundreds of subdivisions, thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.

Aurora's growing population in recent decades has led to efforts for co-equal recognition with its larger neighbor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Former mayor Dennis Champine once expressed the somewhat whimsical notion that eventually the area would be called the "Aurora/Denver Metropolitan Area". Indeed, since the 2000 Census Aurora has surpassed Denver in land area, and much of Aurora is undeveloped, while Denver is more fully built-out. However, such efforts are somewhat hampered by the lack of a large, historically important [[central business district]] in the city. Aurora is largely suburban in character, as evidenced by the city's modest number of multi-story buildings, although the portion of Colfax Avenue that runs through Aurora is often considered the downtown area.

[[File:Aerial view of Fitzsimons Army Hospital, 1973.JPEG|thumb|left|1973 aerial view of Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora, before closure]]
A large military presence has existed in Aurora since the early 20th century. In 1918, Army General Hospital #21 (later renamed [[Fitzsimons Army Hospital]]) opened, with the U.S. government expanding and upgrading the hospital facilities in 1941 just in time to care for the wounded servicemen of World War II. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was opened in 1938, straddling the border of Aurora and Denver. It eventually closed in 1994, and has been redeveloped into a master-planned community featuring residential, commercial, business and educational facilities. In 1942, the Army Air Corps built Buckley Field, which has been renamed Naval Air Station, Buckley Air National Guard Base and finally [[Buckley Air Force Base]]. The base, home of the [[460th Space Wing]] and the [[140th Wing]] Colorado Air National Guard, is Aurora's largest employer.

President [[Warren G. Harding]] visited Fitzsimons Army Hospital in 1923, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] visited in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2016/03/25/ttimeline-development-of-the-anschutz-campus.html#g6|title=Timeline: Development of the Anschutz campus (Slideshow) - Denver Business Journal|website=Denver Business Journal|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> In 1943 the hospital was the birthplace of 2004 Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]]. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recovered from a heart attack at Fitzsimons for seven weeks during the fall of 1955. Decommissioned in 1999, the facility is part of the [[Anschutz Medical Campus]] of the [[University of Colorado Denver]], and the [[Fitzsimons Life Science District]]. The Anschutz Medical Campus also includes the [[University of Colorado Hospital]], which moved to Aurora from Denver in 2007, and the [[Children's Hospital (Aurora, Colorado)|Children's Hospital]]. The first carbon-ion [[Particle therapy|radiotherapy research]] and treatment facility in the U.S. has been proposed at the site.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://source.colostate.edu/plan-presents-new-hope-for-us-cancer-patients/|title = CSU plan presents new hope for U.S. Cancer Patients|date = September 24, 2014|accessdate = November 8, 2014|website = Colorado State University|publisher = |last = Cornelius|first = Cornell}}</ref> These facilities will employ a workforce of 32,000 at build-out.

In 1965, mayor [[Norma O. Walker]] became the [[List of first female mayors|first woman]] to head a U.S. city with a population over 60,000.

In 1979, it was announced that a science fiction theme park would be built in Aurora using the sets of a $50 million film based on the fantasy novel [[Lord of Light]]. However, due to legal problems the project was never completed. The script of the unmade film project, renamed ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', was used as cover for the "Canadian Caper": the exfiltration of six U.S. diplomatic staff trapped by the [[Iranian hostage crisis]].

In 1993, [[Cherry Creek State Park]] on the southwestern edge of Aurora was the location for the papal mass of the 8th [[World Youth Day]] with [[Pope John Paul II]], attended by an estimated 500,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |title=World Youth Day memorial signs in need of repair |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065853/http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2004, Aurora was honored as the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 50th Anniversary "Sportstown" for Colorado because of its exemplary involvement in facilitating and enhancing sports. The city attracts more than 30 regional and national sports tournaments annually to Aurora's fields, which include the {{convert|220|acre|km2|adj=on}} Aurora Sports Park opened in 2003. Aurora's active populace is also reflected in the variety of professional athletes [[#Notables|hailing from the city]]. Aurora's first semi-professional sports franchise, the [[Aurora Cavalry]] in the [[International Basketball League (2005-)|International Basketball League]], began play in 2006 but folded by season's end due to budget mishaps.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Aurora is split among three counties and lies distant from the respective county seats. A [[consolidated city-county|consolidated city and county government]] such as those found elsewhere in Colorado ([[Denver]] and [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]) was considered in the mid-1990s but failed to win approval by city voters; the issue was reconsidered in 2006.<ref>http://www.aurorasentinel.com/main.asp?SectionID=8&SubSectionID=8&ArticleID=11778{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2008, Aurora was designated an [[All-America City]] by the National Civic League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=130&Itemid=186 |title=AAC Winners by State and City |publisher=Ncl.org |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref>

In 2017, the [[El Salvador|Republic of El Salvador]] opened a consulate in Aurora, serving Colorado, [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Wyoming]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consuladoaurora.rree.gob.sv/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118105939/http://consuladoaurora.rree.gob.sv/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-01-18|title=Consulado de el Salvador en Aurora, Colorado - Inicio}}</ref>

===2012 shooting===
{{Main|2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting}}
On July 20, 2012, Aurora was the site of the third largest [[mass shooting]] in terms of number of casualties in United States history at the time (now the eighteenth largest) and the second-deadliest shooting in Colorado after the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]].<ref name="70 victims in mass shooting">{{cite news | title = Colorado Movie Theater Shooting: 70 Victims The Largest Mass Shooting |url=http://gma.yahoo.com/colorado-batman-movie-shooting-suspect-phd-student-085940589--abc-news-topstories.html | accessdate = July 21, 2012 | publisher = Good morning America |date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The shooting occurred just after midnight, when [[James Holmes (mass murderer)|James Eagan Holmes]] opened fire during the [[Midnight movie#Midnight releases|midnight premiere]] of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in a [[Century Theatres|Century]] [[movie theater]], killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.<ref name="complete list">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/10/officials-release-complete-list-injured-victims-in-aurora-massacre/ |title=Officials release complete list of injured victims in Aurora massacre |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}</ref> Holmes was arrested and was eventually sentenced to 12 life sentences in prison with an additional required 3,318 years. The shooting drew an international response from world leaders. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] visited victims, as well as local and state officials, and addressed the nation in a televised address from Aurora on July 22. Actor [[Christian Bale]], who plays [[Batman]] in the film, also visited some victims in hospitals. The events marked a turning point in recognition and public perception of the city; rather than referring to the site as being in "Denver" or "suburban Denver", as would have been typical before the event, virtually all media accounts of the incident unequivocally named "Aurora" as its location.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.westword.com/news/aurora-is-finally-a-household-namefor-the-wrong-reason-5822506 |title= Aurora is Finally a Household Name...For the Wrong Reason |website= westword.com |accessdate= March 20, 2015 |quote= Most of the headlines name-check Aurora as the site of the massacre, rather than tying it to a Denver suburb. |date= 2012-07-20 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Buckley AFB.png|thumb|[[Buckley Air Force Base]]]]
Aurora's official elevation, posted on signs at the city limits, is {{convert|5471|ft}}. However, the city spans a difference in elevation of nearly {{convert|1000|ft|m}}. The lowest elevation of {{convert|5285|ft}} is found at the point where [[Sand Creek (Denver, Colorado)|Sand Creek]] crosses the city limit in the northwest corner of the city, while the highest elevation of {{convert|6229|ft}} is on the extreme southern border of the city in Douglas County, near the intersection of Inspiration and Gartrell roads.<ref>[https://www.auroragov.org/AuroraGov/Departments/PlanningAndDevelopmentServices/ComprehensivePlanningDivision/DataAndDemographics/index.htm?ssSourceNodeId=1882&ssSourceSiteId=621 Auroragov.org: ''Planning and Development Services Department''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927032003/https://www.auroragov.org/AuroraGov/Departments/PlanningAndDevelopmentServices/ComprehensivePlanningDivision/DataAndDemographics/index.htm?ssSourceNodeId=1882&ssSourceSiteId=621 |date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the city had a total area of {{convert|142.7|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|142.5|sqmi}} was land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi}}, or 0.17%, was water. By 2010, the city had grown to {{convert|154.7|sqmi}}, surpassing Denver's {{convert|153.0|sqmi}} and ranking as the [[List of United States cities by area|54th largest U.S. city in land area]].

===Climate===
Aurora experiences a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold steppe|''BSk'']]''), with four distinct seasons and modest precipitation year-round.  Summers range from mild to hot, with generally low humidity and frequent afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s, and Aurora also averages about one dozen tornado warnings throughout tornado season, running from April–July. Although a touchdown does occur every couple of years, tornadoes are typically weak and short lived, but there is a long history of dangerous and devastating tornadoes. Aurora residents typically hear the tornado sirens go off numerous times more than residents in Denver, to the West. All of Aurora is located east of I-25, where tornado alley begins. Hailstorms, at times 1–2'+ deep happen on occasion, and typical hailstorms are very common throughout these months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=22250&cityname=Aurora,+Colorado,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Aurora, Colorado Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|author=|date=|website=Weatherbase|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref> July is the warmest month of the year, with an average high of {{convert|89|°F|0}} and an average low of {{convert|57|°F|0}}.

==Transportation==
[[File:Florida Station ped. bridge, I-225, Aurora, CO.jpg|thumb|Florida Station pedestrian bridge over Interstate 225 ]]
Aurora straddles [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|Interstate 70]], [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|Interstate 225]] and the [[E-470]] [[beltway]]. The Regional Transportation District's [[light rail]] transit system was extended to serve the southwestern edge of Aurora on November 17, 2006. The [[H Line (RTD)|H Line]] stops at Aurora's [[Dayton (RTD)|Dayton]] and [[Nine Mile (RTD)|Nine Mile]] Stations; a comprehensive network of feeder buses in southern Aurora serve the latter. On February 24, 2017, the line was extended as the [[R Line (RTD)|R Line]] to [[Peoria station|Peoria Station]] in the city's northwest, where riders may transfer to the [[A Line (RTD)|A Line]] providing service between Union Station in downtown Denver and [[Denver International Airport]] (DIA). Much of Aurora is more convenient to DIA than Denver itself. This proximity is a factor in the expected growth of the E-470 corridor directly south of DIA, projected to eventually accommodate 250,000 additional Aurora residents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
