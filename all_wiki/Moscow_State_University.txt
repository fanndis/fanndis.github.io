'''Moscow State University''' ('''MSU'''; {{lang-ru|Московский государственный университет имени М. В. Ломоносова}} ''Moskovskiy gosudarstvenn'y universitet imeni M. V. Lomonosova'', often abbreviated МГУ, ''MGU'') is a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] and [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It was founded on {{OldStyleDate|23 January|1755|12 January}} by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. During the Soviet period, MSU was renamed after Lomonosov in 1940 and was then known as ''Lomonosov University''. Its current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] is [[Viktor Sadovnichiy]].

Moscow State University has educated many notable alumni including leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] and other governments as well as a [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus|Patriarch of Russian Orthodox Church]]. As of 2019, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|13 Nobel laureates]], [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|6 Fields Medal winners]] and [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation|1 Turing Award winner]] have been affiliated with the university. According to the 2019 QS World University Rankings, it is the highest-ranking Russian educational institution<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=June 5, 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref> and according to the Nature Index, it is highest ranking Russian university for research output.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natureindex.com/annual-tables/2019/institution/all/all/countries-Russia|title=2019 tables: Institutions &#124; 2019 tables &#124; Institutions &#124; Nature Index|website=www.natureindex.com}}</ref> The university includes 15 research institutes, 43 faculties, more than 300 departments and 6 branches (including five foreign ones - all in the CIS countries).

==History==
===Imperial Moscow University===
{{main|Imperial Moscow University}}
[[File:Moscow Red Square rathaus, survey by Bove, 1816.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Principal Medicine Store building on Red Square that housed Moscow University from 1755 to 1787]]
[[File:mgu 1798.jpg|thumb|Main buildings of the university in Mokhovaya Street, 1798]]
[[Ivan Shuvalov]] and [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] promoted the idea of a university in Moscow, and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Russian Empress Elizabeth]] decreed its establishment on {{OldStyleDate|23 January|1755|12 January}}.
The first lectures were given on {{OldStyleDate|7 May||26 April}}. Russians still celebrate 25 January as [[Tatiana Day|Students' Day]]. (Foundation of the University is traditionally associated with the feast of [[Tatiana of Rome|Saint Tatiana]], celebrated by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] on 12 January Julian, which corresponds to 25 January Gregorian in the 20th–21st centuries.)

[[Saint Petersburg State University]] and Moscow State University engage in friendly rivalry over the title of Russia's oldest university.  Though Moscow State University was founded in 1755, its competitor in St. Petersburg has had a continuous existence as a "university" since 1819 and sees itself as the successor of an academy established on 24 January 1724, by a decree of [[Peter the Great]].

The present Moscow State University originally occupied the [[State Historical Museum|Principal Medicine Store]] on [[Red Square]] from 1755 to 1787.   [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] transferred the University to a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] building on the other side of Mokhovaya Street; that main building was constructed between 1782 and 1793 in the Neo-Palladian style, to a design by [[Matvei Kazakov]], and rebuilt by [[Domenico Giliardi]] after the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire consumed much of Moscow in 1812]].

In the 18th century, the University had three departments: [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], and [[law]]. A preparatory college was affiliated with the University until its abolition in 1812.  In 1779, [[Mikhail Kheraskov]] founded a boarding school for noblemen (Благородный пансион) which in 1830 became a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the [[Russian nobility]].  The [[university press]], run by [[Nikolay Novikov]] in the 1780s, published the most popular newspaper in Imperial Russia:  ''[[Moskovskie Vedomosti]]''.
[[File:Moscow 05-2012 Mokhovaya 05.jpg|thumb|left|{{As of | 2015}}, the Old Building housed the Department of Oriental studies]]

In 1804, medical education split into clinical (therapy), [[Surgery|surgical]], and [[obstetrics]] faculties.  During 1884–1897, the Department of Medicine—supported by private donations, and the municipal and imperial governments—built an extensive, 1.6-kilometer-long, state-of-the-art medical campus in [[Devichye Pole]], between the [[Garden Ring]] and [[Novodevichy Convent]]; this had been designed by [[:ru:Быковский, Константин Михайлович|Konstantin Bykovsky]], with university doctors like [[Nikolay Sklifosovskiy]] and Fyodor Erismann acting as consultants.  The campus, and medical education in general, were separated from the Moscow University in 1930. Devichye Pole was operated by the independent [[I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University]] and by various other state and private institutions.

The roots of student unrest in the University reach deep into the nineteenth century. In 1905, a social-democratic organization emerged at the University and called for the overthrow of the Czarist government and the establishment of a republic in Russia.  The [[Russian Empire|imperial]] government repeatedly threatened to close the University.  In 1911, in a protest over the introduction of troops onto the campus and mistreatment of certain professors, 130 scientists and professors resigned ''en masse'', including such prominent men as [[Nikolay Dimitrievich Zelinskiy]], [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev]], and [[Sergei Alekseevich Chaplygin]]; thousands of students were expelled.

===Moscow State University===
[[File:Moscow University stamp 1960.png|thumb|A 1962 Soviet stamp features Moscow State University]]
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the institution began to admit the children of the proletariat and peasantry.  In 1919, the University abolished fees for tuition and established a preparatory facility to help working-class children prepare for entrance examinations.  During the implementation of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[first five-year plan]] (1928–1932), prisoners from the [[Gulag]] were forced to construct parts of the newly expanded University.

[[File:Msu-Languagebuilding-seabhcan.JPG|thumb|left|The first Humanities Building]]

After 1991, nine new faculties were established.  The following year, the University gained a unique status:  it is funded directly from the state budget (bypassing the Ministry of Education), thus providing the University a significant level of independence.

On 6 September 1997, the French electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]], whom the mayor of Moscow had specially invited to perform, used the entire front facade of the University as the backdrop for a [[List of Jean Michel Jarre concerts#Oxygen in Moscow|concert]]:  the frontage served as a giant projection screen, with [[fireworks]], [[lasers]], and [[searchlights]] all launched from various points around the building.  The stage stood directly in front of the building, and the concert, entitled "The Road To The 21st Century" in Russia but renamed "Oxygen In Moscow" for worldwide release in video/DVD, attracted a world-record crowd of 3.5 million people.

On 19 March 2008, Russia's most powerful [[supercomputer]] to date, the SKIF MSU ({{lang-ru|СКИФ МГУ}}; ''skif'' means "[[Scythian]]" in Russian) was launched at the University.  Its peak performance of 60 [[TFLOPS]] ([[LINPACK]] - 47.170 TFLOPS) makes it the fastest supercomputer in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].<ref>{{cite web|title=8th edition of the Top 50 list of the most powerful computers in Russia released |url=http://www.top500.org/blog/2008/04/16/8th_edition_top_50_list_most_powerful_computers_russia_released |publisher=TOP500 Supercomputing Sites |website=Top500.org |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2011-10-29 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927074613/http://www.top500.org/blog/2008/04/16/8th_edition_top_50_list_most_powerful_computers_russia_released |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.t-platforms.ru/en/news.php?zone=engnews&id=75|title=News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.km.ru/glavnoe/2008/03/20/arkhiv/v-mgu-zapushchen-samyi-moshchnyi-v-sng-kompyuter|title=ru:В МГУ запустили мощнейший в СНГ компьютер|website=Km.ru|date=2008-03-20|accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref>

==Campus==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2015}}
{{Main|Main building of Moscow State University}}
[[File:MSUSoilScienceFaculty1.JPG|thumb|Building of the Faculties of Biology and of Soil Science]]
Since 1953, most of the faculties have been situated on [[Sparrow Hills]], in the southwest of Moscow, 5&nbsp;km from the city centre. The [[Main building of Moscow State University|main building]] was designed by [[architect]] [[Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev]]. In the post-war era, [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven huge tiered neoclassic towers]] to be built around the city. It was built using [[Gulag]] labour, as were many of Stalin's Great Construction Projects in Russia.<ref>Figes, O. (2013) 'Just Send Me Word – A True Story of Love and Survival in the Gulag' pg. 192, Penguin Books: London.</ref> Located on Moscow's outskirts at the time of its construction, the location of the main building is now about half-way between the center of [[Moscow]] at the [[Kremlin]] and the city's current limits. The Journalism Department now occupies the university's original location in downtown Moscow across from the Manezh, steps from the Kremlin and other government buildings.  Indeed, frequent student unrest, including street protests, well pre-dating 1917 may be one reason why Stalin's planners sited the university across the Moscow River, so far away.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}<!--Whose guess is this?-->

The MSU main building was the tallest building in the world outside of [[New York City]] at the time of its construction, and remained the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|tallest building in Europe]] until 1990. The central tower is 240&nbsp;m tall, 36 stories high, and flanked by four huge wings of student and faculty accommodations. It is said to contain a total of 33 kilometres of corridors and 5,000 rooms.

[[File:MoscowUniversityLibrary.jpg|thumb|The university library]]

Facilities available inside the building include a concert hall, a theater, a museum, administrative services, a library, a swimming pool, a police station, a post office, a laundry, a hairdresser's salon, several canteens, bank offices and ATMs, shops, cafeterias, a bomb shelter, etc. Along with the university administration, the Museum of Earth Sciences and four of the main faculties – [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics|Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics]], the [[MSU Faculty of Geology|Faculty of Geology]], the [[MSU Faculty of Geography|Faculty of Geography]], and the [[MSU Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts|Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts]] – now reside in the Main building. The star on the top of the tower is large enough to include a small room and a viewing platform; it weighs 12 tons. The building's facades are ornamented with giant clocks, [[barometers]], [[thermometers]], statues, carved wheat sheaves, and Soviet crests. It stands before a terrace featuring statues of male and female students gazing optimistically and confidently into the future.

While the [[Sparrow Hills]] were on the outskirts of the city at the time of the construction of the main building, they are now about halfway from the [[Kremlin]] to the city limits. Several other buildings and sports facilities were later added to the campus, including the only [[baseball]] stadium in Russia. Currently, a new building is under construction for the social sciences faculties, and another new one of vast size has just been built for the library, which is the second-largest in Russia by volume (number of books). The university also has several dormitory buildings in the Southwest of Moscow, outside the campus.

The historical building on Mokhovaya Street now mainly houses the [[MSU Faculty of Journalism|Faculty of Journalism]], the [[MSU Faculty of Psychology|Faculty of Psychology]], and [[MSU The Institute of Asian and African Studies|The Institute of Asian and African Studies]]. The university includes a number of faculty buildings located near [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]] in the centre of Moscow and a number of campuses abroad in [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

The university's main library is one of the largest in Russia.  Current estimates suggest that it contains approximately 9,000,000 volumes. The library serves in the area of 55,000 readers per year, using approximately 5,500,000 books.

The university offers classes on its main campus not only in Moscow, but also on campuses in [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. These include the Puschino MSU campus, Podmoskovny MSU campus, Chernomorsky MSU campus and Kazakhstan MSU campus. The [[Ulyanovsk]] branch of MSU was reorganized into [[Ulyanovsk State University]] in 1996.

==Faculties==
As of September 2009, the university has 39 faculties and 15 research centres. A number of small faculties have been opened recently, such as [[MSU Faculty of Physics and Chemistry|Faculty of Physics and Chemistry]] and [[MSU Higher School of Television|Higher School of Television]]. Evening classes are conducted by the Faculties of Economics, History, Journalism, Philology, Psychology and Sociology while the Faculty of Journalism offers a correspondence degree program.

[[File:Moskva MGU 1.jpg|thumb|The main building in winter]]
The university has well-established contacts with the most distinguished universities in the world, exchanging students and lecturers with the leading international institutions of higher education. It houses the [[UNESCO]] International Demography Courses, the UNESCO Hydrology Courses, the International Biotechnology Center, the International LASER Center, courses or seminars on Russian as a foreign language. In 1991 the French University College, the Russian-American University and the Institute of German Science and Culture were opened. The university has awarded honorary degrees to more than 60 scientists, statesmen and politicians from abroad. Many prominent university scholars and scientists in return hold honorary degrees from foreign academies and universities.

Moscow State University is one of Russia's most prestigious institutions of higher learning, and has demanding entry requirements for prospective students. Nonetheless, it performs inconsistently in international rankings.
