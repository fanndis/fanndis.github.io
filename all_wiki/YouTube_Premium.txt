'''YouTube Premium''' (formerly '''YouTube Red''') is a [[Subscription business model|subscription service]] offered by the video platform [[YouTube]]. The service provides ad-free access to content across the service, as well as access to premium ''[[List of YouTube Originals|YouTube Originals]]'' programming produced in collaboration with the site's creators, downloading videos and background playback of videos on mobile devices, and access to the [[YouTube Music]] music streaming service.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=YouTube Red buys its first big TV series |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/23/12020774/youtube-red-google-original-tv-series-step-up-lionsgate |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>

[[YouTube]] announced the rebranding of the service as YouTube Premium on May 17, 2018, alongside the return of a separate, [[YouTube Music]] subscription service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing YouTube Premium|url=https://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-youtube-premium.html|website=Official YouTube Blog|accessdate=May 17, 2018|date=May 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Savov|first1=Vlad|title=Google announces YouTube Music and YouTube Premium|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17364056/youtube-music-premium-google-launch|website=The Verge|accessdate=May 17, 2018|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref> Later in the year, it was reported that [[YouTube]] was planning to make some of the original content associated with the service available on an ad-supported basis.

== History ==
[[File:YouTube Red Logo.svg|thumb|right|YouTube Red's logo between 2017 and 2018.]]
The service was first unveiled in November 2014 as Music Key, serving as a collaboration between [[YouTube]] and [[Google Play Music]], and meant to succeed the former's own subscription service. Music Key offered ad-free playback of music videos from participating [[record label|labels]] hosted on [[YouTube]], as well as background and offline playback of music videos on mobile devices from within the YouTube app. The service also included access to Google Play Music All Access, which provides ad-free audio streaming of a library of music.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Mediati |title=Google Play Music subscribers will get free access to YouTube Music Key |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2848025/streaming-media/google-play-music-subscribers-will-get-free-access-to-youtube-music-key.html |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=November 15, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> Alongside Music Key, Google also introduced tighter integration between Play Music and YouTube's apps, including the sharing of music recommendations, and access to YouTube's music videos from within the Play Music app.<ref name="The Verge Music Key"/><ref name="Variety Music Key"/> Music Key was not YouTube's first foray into premium content, having launched film rentals in 2010,<ref>{{cite web |first=Miguel |last=Helft |title=YouTube Takes a Small Step Into the Film Rental Market |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/technology/internet/21youtube.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 20, 2010 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> and premium, subscription-based channels in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |first=Todd |last=Spangler |title=YouTube's 30 Pay-Channel Partners Run from Kid Fare to Cage Matches |url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtubes-30-pay-video-partners-run-from-kid-fare-to-cage-matches-1200478570/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>

During its invite-only beta, Music Key faced mixed reception due to the limited scope of the offering; YouTube's chief business officer [[Robert Kyncl]] explained that his daughter was confused over why videos of songs from ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' were not "music" in the scope of the service, and thus not advertisement-free.<ref name="The Verge Red"/> These concerns and others led to a revamping of the Music Key concept to create YouTube Red; unlike Music Key, YouTube Red was designed to provide ad-free streaming to all videos, rather than just music content. This shift required YouTube to seek permission from its content creators and rights holders to allow their content to be part of the ad-free service; under the new contract terms, partners would receive a share of the total revenue from YouTube Red subscriptions, as determined by how much their content is viewed by subscribers.<ref name="The Verge Red"/>

[[YouTube]] also sought to compete against sites such as [[Netflix]], [[Prime Video]] and [[Hulu]] by offering original content (YouTube Originals) as part of the subscription service, leveraging prominent YouTube personalities in combination with professional producers. Robert Kyncl acknowledged that many of YouTube's prominent personalities had built their followings and created content while operating on a "shoestring budget", but he maintained that "in order to scale up, it takes a different kind of enterprise, a different kind of skill set" such as story-telling and "showrunning".<ref name="The Verge Red"/><ref name="Variety Red">{{cite web |first=Todd |last=Spangler |title=YouTube Red Unveiled: Ad-Free Streaming Service Priced Same as Netflix |url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/youtube-red-launches-ad-free-svod-netflix-1201623219 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher= [[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=October 21, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> Prominent YouTube personality [[PewDiePie]], who was involved in one of the planned originals for the service,<ref name="Variety Red"/> explained that the service was meant to mitigate profit loss from the use of [[ad blocking]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Brandy |last=Shaul |title=PewDiePie on YouTube Red: 'Adblock Has Actual Consequences' |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/pewdiepie-on-youtube-red-adblock-has-actual-consequences/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=November 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>

=== As YouTube Premium ===
On May 17, 2018, [[YouTube]] announced the upcoming rebranding of the service as '''YouTube Premium''', which officially took effect on June 18. The rebranding came alongside the re-launch of [[YouTube Music]], with a separate subscription service focused solely on music (that, as before, is bundled with the larger YouTube Premium service, and also offered to [[Google Play Music]] subscribers). [[YouTube]] also announced that the price of the service would increase from US$9.99 to US$11.99 per month for new subscribers; the existing pricing, as well as bundling of YouTube Premium benefits with [[Google Play Music]] subscriptions, is grandfathered for those who subscribed prior to the rebranding. Alongside the rebranding, the services also expanded into Canada, and 11 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom), with more expansion to come in the future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/youtubes-revamped-music-subscription-service-launches-on-may-22/|title=New YouTube Music Premium costs $9.99 monthly, add $2 to get all Red perks|work=Ars Technica|access-date=July 18, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/18/youtube-premium-music-launch-today-17-countries-including-canada-11-european-countries/|title=YouTube Premium and Music launch today in 17 countries, including Canada and 11 European countries|last=Gao|first=Richard|date=Jun 18, 2018|work=Android Police|access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17475122/youtube-music-premium-launch-us-canada-uk|title=YouTube Music and YouTube Premium officially launch in US, Canada, UK, and other countries|work=The Verge|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> By July 2019, the services were available in at least 60 countries and territories with subscription price difference.<ref>{{Cite web|title=YouTube Premium without ads for only $0.50 per month!

In November 2018, it was reported that [[YouTube]] was planning to offer some of its premium shows available for free on an ad-supported basis by 2020.

=== Licensing terms for channels{{anchor|Licensing terms and content blocking}} ===
In May 2014, prior to the official unveiling of the Music Key service, the [[independent music]] trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were "undervalued" in comparison to other streaming services, and stated that YouTube threatened to block a label's videos from public access if they did not agree to the new terms. In a statement to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in June 2014, [[Robert Kyncl]] confirmed that these measures were "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms". Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that "while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience".<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Popper |title=YouTube will block videos from artists who don't sign up for its paid streaming service |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817408/youtube-reportedly-block-videos-indie-artists |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 17, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Dredge |title=YouTube subscription music licensing strikes wrong notes with indie labels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/22/indie-labels-youtube-subscription-music |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Gibbs |title=Talks with indie labels stall over YouTube music subscription service |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/23/talks-indie-labels-stall-youtube-music-subscription-service |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Stuart |last1=Dredge |first2=Dominic |last2=Rushe |title=YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 17, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with [[Merlin Network]]—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service. However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal.<ref name="Variety Music Key"/>

Following the unveiling of YouTube Red, it was stated that these same contractual requirements would now apply to all YouTube Partner Program members; partners who do not accept the new terms and revenue sharing agreements related to the YouTube Red service will have their videos blocked entirely in regions where YouTube Red is available.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=YouTube Will Completely Remove Videos Of Creators Who Don't Sign Its Red Subscription Deal |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/21/an-offer-creators-cant-refuse/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 21, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> The YouTube channels of [[ESPN]] were a notable party affected by the change; a representative of ESPN's parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]], stated that conflicts with third-party rightsholders in regards to sports footage contained in ESPN's YouTube videos prevented them from being offered under the new terms. A limited number of older videos remain on ESPN's main channel.<ref>{{cite web |first=Russell |last=Brandom |title=ESPN is shutting down its YouTube channels over paid subscriptions |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602998/espn-youtube-red-blackout-pulling-videos |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>

Similarly, a large amount of content licensed by [[Japan]]ese record labels became unavailable in regions where YouTube Red is available. It was believed that the ability to download videos for offline viewing in YouTube Red was a subject of hesitation for [[Japanese media]] companies due to the need to monitor when, where, and how content is being used in accordance with [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]s, hence their content was blocked under the new requirements.<ref name=nyt-cdlovingjapan>{{cite news|title=CD-Loving Japan Resists Move to Online Music| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/business/media/cd-loving-japan-resists-move-to-digital-music-.html|accessdate=January 25, 2016|work=The New York Times | date=September 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=nw-japanblock>{{cite news|title=YouTube blocks Japanese contributors' content for refusing to use its paid version|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3014058/mobile-wireless/youtube-red-blocks-japanese-contributors-content-for-refusing-to-use-its-paid-version.html|accessdate=January 25, 2016|work=Networkworld|publisher=IDG}}</ref><ref name=rn24-japanesemusic>{{cite web|title=Japanese music and vocaloid content disappears as YouTube rolls out new paid service|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/12/04/japanese-music-and-vocaloid-content-disappears-as-youtube-rolls-out-new-paid-service |website=RocketNews24|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref>
