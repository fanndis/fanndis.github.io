The '''2018 United States elections''' were held on Tuesday, November 6, 2018.{{efn|Some [[By-election|special elections]] as well as the regularly-scheduled elections in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] were held on other dates.}} These [[United States midterm election|midterm elections]] occurred during the presidency of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]]. Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] and all 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] were contested. Thirty-nine state and territorial [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] as well as numerous state and local elections were also contested.

Democrats made a net gain of 41 seats in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House of Representatives]],{{efn|name=undecided|Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats on election day, but gained one more seat in a [[2018 Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election|special election]] held earlier in 2018. One House seat in North Carolina remained vacant after the elections due to allegations of election fraud; a [[2019 North Carolina's 9th congressional district special election|special election]] filled it in 2019.}} gaining a majority in the chamber and thereby ending the [[Government trifecta|federal trifecta]] that the Republican Party had established in the [[2016 United States elections|2016 elections]]. The Republican Party retained control of the [[2018 United States Senate elections|United States Senate]], making a net gain of two seats and defeating four Democratic incumbents in states that had voted for Trump in 2016. As a result of the 2018 elections, the [[116th United States Congress]] became the first Congress since the [[99th United States Congress]] ([[1984 United States elections|elected in 1984]]) in which the Democrats controlled the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of approximately 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers.
 
The elections marked the highest [[voter turnout]] seen in midterm elections since [[United States elections, 1914|1914]], at 49.3%. The elections saw several electoral firsts for women, racial minorities and [[LGBT]] candidates, including the election of the [[Jared Polis|first openly gay governor]] and the [[Kyrsten Sinema|first openly bisexual U.S. senator]]. In various referenda, numerous states voted to expand [[Medicaid]] coverage, require [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter identification]], establish independent [[redistricting commission]]s, legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], repeal [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws and enact other proposals.

During the campaign, Democrats focused on health care, frequently attacking Republicans for supporting repeal of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Republican messaging focused on immigration and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. There were [[Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections|allegations of attempted Russian interference in these elections]] as well as [[Voter suppression in the United States#2017–2018|controversies regarding potential voter suppression]] and other alleged election irregularities. The election was widely characterized as a [[Wave elections in the United States|"blue wave" election]].

== Issues, advertisements, and campaigning ==

In May 2018, President Trump began to emphasize his effort to overcome the traditional strength of the non-presidential party in midterm elections, with the "top priority for the White House [being to hold] the Republican majority in the Senate". He was already well into his own [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020|2020 reelection campaign]], having launched it on his [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration day]] in January 2017.<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]],, Sarah Westwood and Pamela Brown, [https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/midterm-trump-campaign/index.html "Unprecedented?

Retrieved August 22, 2018.</ref> By early August, the president's midterm efforts had included rallies in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Montana and elsewhere "reprising the style and rhetoric of his 2016 campaign". He focused his message on the [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Economy|economy]], his proposed [[Mexico–United States barrier|border wall]], the [[Trump tariffs|"trade war"]] with China, [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Relationship with the news media|criticism of the media]], and his proposal to create the [[United States Space Force|space force]], a new branch of the military devoted to operations in space.<ref>Fritze, John, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/11/donald-trump-midterm-rally-message/905600002/ "Trump's midterm message: Five things the president is telling voters"], ''USA Today'', August 11, 2018.

In the 2018 elections, Republicans sought to defend the Senate majority they had maintained since the [[2014 United States Senate elections|2014 elections]]. Thirty-five of the 100 seats were up for election, including all 33 [[Classes of United States Senators#Class 1|Class{{nbsp}}1]] Senate seats.

The Class{{nbsp}}1 Senate elections were for terms lasting from January 2019 to January 2025 while the Class{{nbsp}}2 special elections were for terms ending in January 2021. 24 of the seats up for election were held by Democrats, two of the seats up for election were held by independents caucusing with the Democrats and nine of the seats up for election were held by Republicans.<ref name="skelleysenate"/> Three Republican incumbents did not seek election in 2018 while all Democratic and independent incumbents sought another term. 42 Republican senators and 23 Democratic senators were not up for election.

Assuming the two independents won re-election and continued to caucus with them, Senate Democrats needed to win a net gain of two Senate seats to win a majority.{{efn|Democrats needed to win 51 seats to acquire a Senate majority.

The vast majority of states held gubernatorial or state legislative elections in 2018. The 2018 state elections will impact the [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] that will follow the [[2020 United States Census]] as many states task governors and state legislators with drawing new boundaries for state legislative and Congressional districts.

=== Gubernatorial elections ===

{{main|2018 United States gubernatorial elections}}

Elections were held for the [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] of 36 [[U.S. states]] and three [[United States insular area|U.S. territories]] as well as for the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]]. Democrats defended every seat they had controlled prior to the election and picked up seven governorships. They won open seats in Michigan, Nevada, Kansas, New Mexico and Maine and defeated Republican incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin. They also picked up the independent-held seat in the U.S. Virgin Islands in a runoff election held November 20, 2018.<ref>{{cite news| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| date=November 20, 2018| title=Albert Bryan Becomes Ninth Elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands| url=https://viconsortium.com/breaking-news/governor-elect-albert-bryan/| work=The Virgin Islands Consortium| location=Christiansted, St. Croix, USVI| access-date=November 20, 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Most of the Democratic victories were in Democratic-leaning states or swing states.

=== Other state elections ===

{{see also|List of U.S. statewide elected officials}}

Many states have statewide elected officials other than the governor. Such positions include [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], [[State attorney general|attorney general]], [[State treasurer|treasurer]] and [[State auditor|auditor]]. These officials can play important roles in setting policy and overseeing state functions. In 2018, Democrats won attorneys general races in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado; each position had previously been held by a Republican.

This table shows the partisan results of Congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races held in each state and [[Territories of the United States|territories]] in 2018. Note that not all states and territories held gubernatorial, state legislative, and United States Senate elections in 2018—the territories and [[Washington, D.C.]] do not elect members of the United States Senate. Washington, D.C. and the five inhabited territories each elect one [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting member]] of the United States House of Representatives. Nebraska's [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Nebraska legislature|legislature]] and the governorship and legislature of American Samoa are officially [[Non-partisan democracy|non-partisan]]. Several seats in the House of Representatives were vacant at the time of the election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 6, 2018|url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/2018election/|publisher=U.S. House of Reps, Office of the Clerk|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>
