In [[music]], a '''solo''' (from the {{lang-it|solo}}, meaning ''alone'') is a [[musical composition|piece]] or a [[section (music)|section]] of a piece played or sung featuring a single performer, who may be performing completely alone or supported by an accompanying instrument such as a piano or organ, a [[Basso continuo|continuo]] group (in Baroque music), or the rest of a choir, orchestra, band, or other ensemble. Performing a solo is "to solo", and  the performer is known as a ''soloist''.

The plural is '''soli''' or the [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form '''solos'''. In some context these are interchangeable, but ''soli'' tends to be restricted to classical music, and mostly either the solo performers or the solo [[passage (music)|passage]]s in a single piece. Furthermore, the word ''soli'' can be used to refer to a small number of simultaneous parts assigned to single players in an orchestral composition. In the Baroque [[concerto grosso]], the term for such a group of soloists was ''[[Concertino (group)|concertino]]''.

An instrumental solo is often used in popular music during a [[break (music)|break]] or [[bridge (music)|bridge]] to add interest and variety to a part of the song without lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Originating as a musical term, "solo" was borrowed into other fields, as for example in the [[First solo flight]] of a student pilot. 

==History==
===18th century===
In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] periods, the word ''solo'' was virtually equivalent to ''[[sonata]]'', and could refer either to a piece for one melody instrument with (continuo) accompaniment, or to a sonata for an unaccompanied melody instrument, such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]â€™s [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|sonatas for violin alone]].<ref>David Fuller, "Solo", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>
