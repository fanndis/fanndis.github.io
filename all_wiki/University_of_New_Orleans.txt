The '''University of New Orleans''' ('''UNO''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. It is a member of the [[University of Louisiana System]] and the [[Urban 13]] association. It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=159939 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |accessdate=13 September 2020}}</ref>

==History==
[[Louisiana State Senate|State Senator]] [[Theodore M. Hickey]] of New Orleans in 1956 authored the act which established the University of New Orleans. At the time New Orleans was the largest [[metropolitan area]] in the United States without a public university though it had several [[Private university|private universities]], such as [[Tulane University|Tulane]] (which was originally a state-supported university before being privatized in 1884), [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola]], and [[Dillard University|Dillard]]. The institution was a branch of [[Louisiana State University]], and as such was originally named '''Louisiana State University in New Orleans''' or '''LSUNO'''. The UNO University Ballroom was named in Hickey's honor late in 2014, more than two decades after his death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2014/10/uno_to_name_ballroom_after_sta.html|title=UNO to name ballroom after former state Sen. Ted Hickey|newspaper=[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|author=Jed Lipinski|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

The university was built on the New Orleans Lakefront when the [[United States Navy]] relocated [[Naval Air Station New Orleans]]. The [[Orleans Levee Board]] leased the closed base to the LSU Board of Supervisors. The renovation went quicker than expected. LSUNO opened for classes in 1958, two years ahead of schedule. It was the first racially integrated public university in the South. For its first five years, it was reckoned as an offsite department of the main campus in Baton Rouge, and as such its chief administrative officer was originally called a dean (1958–1961), then a vice president in charge (1961–1962). In 1962, the [[Louisiana State University System|LSU System of Higher Education]] was established, and LSUNO became a separate campus in that system. To signify that it was now a co-equal institution with LSU, its chief executive's title was changed from "vice president in charge" to "chancellor."  After a decade of growth, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved a name change to the current '''University of New Orleans.'''  Nearly fifty years later, in 2011, the University of New Orleans was transferred from LSU to the [[University of Louisiana system]], and its chief executive's title was changed to "president."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uno.edu/about-uno/history |title=History |publisher=University of New Orleans |year=2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

===Hurricane Katrina===
On August 29, 2005, the university suffered damage due to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The main campus is on relatively high ground and the damage was caused mostly by winds, rain-driven-water, and human activity during the storm. The university was used as an evacuation point and staging area by the National Guard. A levee breach on the [[London Avenue Canal]] occurred just a few blocks south of the main campus and caused the flooding of the first floor of the Bienville Hall dormitories, the Lafitte Village couples apartments, and the Engineering Building.

UNO was the first of the large, damaged universities in New Orleans to re-open, albeit virtually, by using web-based courses starting in October 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,39153086,00.htm |title=University of New Orleans reopens online - Networks - Breaking Business and Technology News at silicon.com |access-date=9 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103120817/http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,39153086,00.htm |archive-date=3 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The university was able to offer classes in the fall semester immediately following Hurricane Katrina at satellite campuses; the main campus re-opened in December 2005.

Hurricane Katrina reduced enrollments at all colleges in New Orleans, but the University of New Orleans was particularly hard hit. This echoed the damage to New Orleans as a whole, since UNO serves as a leader in educating students from New Orleans. Since the hurricane, the student enrollment is on a steady increase toward pre-Katrina numbers. In 2011, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Conrad Appel]] of [[Jefferson Parish]], with the support of [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]], tried to combine UNO with the [[historically black]] [[Southern University at New Orleans]] as a way to save higher education dollars. His plan was withdrawn in both houses of the legislature because of a lack of support from his colleagues.

==Colleges==
{{Infobox US university ranking

| USNWR_NU = 293–381
| Wamo_NU = 269
}}
UNO has four colleges: College of Business Administration, College of Liberal Arts, Education and Human Development, College of Engineering, and College of Sciences. The university also offers a bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.

==Campus==
The university's campus is located in the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]], sitting on [[Lake Pontchartrain]] at the end of [[Elysian Fields Avenue]] and on the former site of [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans|NAS New Orleans.]] The UNO Research and Technology Park is located adjacent to campus on the former site of the [[Pontchartrain Beach]] amusement park. The Kiefer UNO Lakefront Arena and Maestri Field at Privateer Park, UNO's basketball and baseball facilities, are located at the corner of Franklin Avenue and Leon C. Simon Boulevard.

UNO's classes were originally housed in the remaining buildings following the closure of NAS New Orleans at that site. As a nod to campus' time as a Naval base, the oldest lecture buildings, the Liberal Arts Building and the Science Building, are both numbered and laid-out like a ship with Liberal Arts featuring exterior balconies for access to the classrooms as opposed to interior hallways, and both Liberal Arts and Science featuring two central courtyards in each building.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Virtual Tour: Liberal Arts|url=https://www.uno.edu/virtual-tour/liberal-arts|access-date=2020-06-05|website=The University of New Orleans|language=en}}</ref> UNO's newer chemical-sciences annex is designed like a steam boat and many of the newer lecture buildings on campus have similar shapes to the original science and liberal arts buildings without the interior courtyards due to limited space on the main campus. 

Throughout the years, additional buildings were built to accommodate a larger student body. These include Milneburg Hall (the original business building now a satellite building to the college of liberal arts), the University Center, the Earl K. Long Library, the Administration Building, the Geology/Psychology Building, the Engineering Building, the Life Sciences Complex (Phase 1: the Computer Center, Phase 2: the Biology Building, and Phase 3: the Mathematics Building), the Chemical-Sciences Annex, and Kirschman Hall (the new business building). 

The College of Engineering building built in the 1970's is the tallest building on campus. It has a total of nine floors and is home to the university's Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (NAME) Program (making it one of very few universities in the United States offering this program) among other engineering programs. The first floor is the largest floor featuring large workshop, labs, lobbies, and study spaces as well as the towing tank for the NAME program. Through the breezeway on the first floor is the home of the Dohse Auditorium. Floors two through nine are all part of one large tower in a straight line and are each not as big as the first floor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Virtual Tour: Engineering Building|url=https://www.uno.edu/virtual-tour/engineering|access-date=2020-09-16|website=The University of New Orleans|language=en}}</ref> 

Two buildings on campus feature atrium designs as opposed to hallways. Kirschman Hall, the newest lecture building on campus and home of the College of Business Administration, features a large atrium in the center with a few satellite hallways connecting to it. It is considered to be the second largest lecture building on campus (after the engineering building).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Virtual Tour: Kirschman Hall|url=https://www.uno.edu/virtual-tour/kirschman|access-date=2020-09-16|website=The University of New Orleans|language=en}}</ref>   

Furthermore, the University Center building, one of the centers of campus life, has an atrium in the center with dining locations and event spaces on one side and hallways with offices on the other. 

UNO's Homer Hitt Alumni Center is built around a smoke-stack which remains from when campus was a Naval Base. The smoke-stack is the oldest structure on campus.

=== Campus Life Centers<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=UNO Virtual Tour|url=https://www.uno.edu/virtual-tour|access-date=2020-09-16|website=The University of New Orleans|language=en}}</ref> ===
The University of New Orleans features three buildings that are considered to be the centers of campus life:

==== Earl K. Long Library ====
The Earl K. Long Library is home to the Privateer Enrollment Center, which is "a one-stop shop for all your enrollment needs." This location includes offices of Enrollment, Orientation, the Bursar, Financial Aid, First Year Experience, and First Year Advising (with plans to increase services to advising for upperclassmen). Not only is this building home to many enrollment services, but this building also has a Coffee Shop run by dining services and different academic resources on each floor. The first floor is home to a large study area known as the "Learning Commons" which is home to a large computer lab in the front, an open-concept study area in the rear, the offices of Student Accountability/Disability Services & the Learning Resource Center, and group study room. The second floor is home to quiet computers, additional group study rooms, periodicals, the Women's Center, and the UNO Press. The third floor houses the silent study room, the honors program, the digital animation studio, the meditation area, and private study rooms for faculty and graduate students. The fourth floor is where the quiet study area, the special collections/archives, the reading room, various conferences rooms, and additional offices are located. <ref name=":0" />

==== University Center ====
The university center is "the center of campus life at UNO." The building is home to dining services locations, the grand ball room, the Captain's Quarter's Game Room, the UNO Bookstore, and various meeting spaces. University offices located here include counseling services, career services, student involvement and leadership, greek life, student government association, student affairs, and the Driftwood student newspaper. <ref name=":0" />

==== Administration Building ====
The Administration Building is comprised of two sections: The original administration building and the newer administration annex, an addition to the building that was built later. Many university administrative offices are located here. 

=== Residential Life ===
The university's campus is home to three on-campus housing options for students all located on UNO's main campus:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Office of Residential Life|url=https://www.uno.edu/housing|access-date=2020-06-05|website=The University of New Orleans|language=en}}</ref>
