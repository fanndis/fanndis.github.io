== Early life and education ==
Naidu was born on 20 April 1950 at [[Naravaripalle]], [[Chittoor district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] in an agricultural family. His father, Nara Kharjura Naidu, worked in agriculture and his mother, Amanamma, was a housewife.<ref name="Rediff">[http://www.rediff.com/election/1999/sep/23naidu.htm Rediff On The NeT: The Rediff Election Profile/Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu].

Naidu completed his BA degree in 1972.<ref>[https://ncbn.in/timelineNara Chandrababu Naidu Timeline NCBN’s College Days] NCBN.in</ref>

== Early political career ==
Naidu was drawn to politics at an early age, and joined the [[Indian Youth Congress]] as a student leader in Chandragiri, near [[Tirupati]] in Chittoor district. After [[The Emergency (India)|the emergency]] was imposed on the country in 1975, he became a close supporter of the Indian Youth Congress president, [[Sanjay Gandhi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nara-Chandrababu-Naidu|title=Nara Chandrababu Naidu {{!}} Indian politician|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref>

=== {{anchor|Legislative career 1978–1983}}Legislative career, 1978–1983 ===
Naidu became a Congress (I) member of the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly (MLA) for [[Chandragiri (Assembly constituency)|Chandragiri constituency]] in 1978. The party's 20% quota for youth to run for the office was beneficial for him. Not long afterwards, Naidu was appointed as the technical education and cinematography minister in [[Tanguturi Anjaiah|T. Anjaiah]]'s government at the age of 28. He was the youngest minister in the Congress (I) cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/N.-Chandrababu-Naidu-(politician) |title=N. Chandrababu Naidu Profile |publisher=Times of India}}</ref>

As the cinematography minister, Naidu came in contact with [[N. T. Rama Rao]], a popular film star in Telugu cinema. In 1980, he married Bhuvaneswari, Rao's second daughter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/chandrababu-naidu-becomes-first-chief-minister-of-new-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/36258115.cms?from=mdr|title=Chandrababu Naidu becomes first chief minister of new Andhra Pradesh|date=8 June 2014|work=The Economic Times|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref>

== Telugu Desam Party ==
{{See also|Telugu Desam Party}}
In 1982, N. T. Rama Rao formed the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and swept the assembly polls held in 1983. Naidu, who was then still in the INC, was defeated by a TDP candidate in Chandragiri. He joined the TDP soon after.

=== Rise in the party ===
Naidu demonstrated his political skills in August 1984, when [[Nadendla Bhaskara Rao]] staged a coup against N. T. Rama Rao. He rallied the TDP MLAs together and paraded them before the [[President of India]]. N. T. Rama Rao was reinstated as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh 31 days later. Impressed with his son-in-law's manoeuvre, Rao appointed Naidu as the General Secretary of the party and he began playing an important role in the TDP after Nadendla Rao's coup attempt. Later, when N. T. Rama Rao married [[Lakshmi Parvathi]], Naidu took over the TDP legislative party predicting the problems in the party and became the Chief Minister of united Andhra Pradesh.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mitra |first1=Sumit |last2=Mennon |first2=Amarnath K. |title=Dismissal of NTR ministry planned, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao nurtured with care of an assassin |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19840915-dismissal-of-ntr-ministry-planned-nadendla-bhaskara-rao-nurtured-with-care-of-an-assassin-803240-1984-09-15 |accessdate=10 March 2020 |work=India Today |date=15 September 1984 |language=en}}</ref>

In the [[1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election|1989 assembly election]], Naidu contested from [[Kuppam]] and won by 5,000 votes.<ref name="HT">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news-feed/archives/chandrababu-naidu/article1-12769.aspx |title=Chandrababu Naidu |publisher=Hindustan Times |access-date=3 April 2004}}</ref> INC, however, had regained power in the election so Naidu had to sit in the opposition. He served as a coordinator of the TDP, in which capacity he effectively handled the party's role of the main opposition in the assembly which won him wide appreciation from both the party and the public. Naidu's role during this phase, both inside the Legislative Assembly and outside, was a critical factor for the subsequent success of the party at the hustings.<ref name=HT />

== Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh ==
On 1 September 1995, Naidu came to power as the Chief Minister by revolting against N.T. Rama Rao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19950930-victorious-chandrababu-naidu-will-have-to-reckon-with-father-in-law-ntrs-mass-appeal-808231-1995-09-30 |title=Victorious Chandrababu Naidu will have to reckon with father-in-law NTR's mass appeal |date=30 September 1995|author=Amarnath K.

The [[Telugu Desam Party]], led by Naidu, won a majority in the state legislature: 185 of 294 seats in the Assembly and 29 of 42 at the parliament in the [[1999 Indian general election|1999 general election]], making it the second-largest party in the BJP-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA coalition government]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elections.in/andhra-pradesh/assembly-constituencies/1999-election-results.html|title=Andhra Pradesh Assembly Election Results in 1999|website=www.elections.in|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

'''Janmabhoomi Programme'''

Naidu launched the Janmabhoomi (birthplace) Programme in February 1996. The main aim was to involve people in the reconstruction and revitalisation of the society. The programme works at a micro level, planning to identify people-represented problems through [[Gram sabha|Gram Sabha]] discussions by regional officers, especially in villages, and to send project proposals for the government to work on. The core concentrated areas are [[community service|community work]], primary school education, drinking water, health and hospitals, family welfare, and environmental protection through watershed and joint forest management activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/24772/cyberbabu-of-hyderabad/|title=CYBERBABU OF HYDERABAD - India Environment Portal {{!}} News, reports, documents, blogs, data, analysis on environment & development {{!}} India, South Asia|website=www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in|access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref>

From 1997 onward, the 'Clean and Green Campaign' was initiated where school students and teachers participated in institutional and household plantation with government employees. A total of 46 million trees in the [[Telangana]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] state were planted. About 3,906,835 people participated in sanitation work, with 1,438,850 persons engaged to remove garbage and 40,921,447 people participated in health awareness rallies. The Naidu idea was to make every habitation and municipal ward 'clean and green' and it was one of the largest and most successful events organised by his government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/71133/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=Janmabhoomi programme details and participation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref>

His government started the "self help groups" (SHG) such as water user associations, Vanasamrakshana Samities, Rythu Mithra Groups, CMEY Groups, School Education Committees, and promoted the 'Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas' (DWCRA) where each group had 15-20 female members and chose a leader who conducted group meetings. The main purpose was to offer [[microfinance]] through government and bank-linkage that would help rural women to start income generating activities, know about their rights, and the importance of education. The Naidu government distributed two [[lakh]] (two-hundred-thousand) bicycles to the girls who joined the government high schools as part of women empowerment initiative and launched the Deepam scheme in 1999 to reduce dependence on forest firewood, and to provide gas connections to poor rural members of the DWCRA groups and families below the [[poverty line]].<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jul/10ap.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT: AP CM launches subsidised LPG Deepam scheme|date=10 July 1999|work=rediff.com|accessdate=10 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://14.139.116.20:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/71369/12/12_chapter%205.pdf|title=Reforms in participatory governance|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref>

'''Dial your Chief minister'''

''Prajalato Mukhyamantri'' (Chief Minister with People) Phone is a programme that encourages open dialogue between the chief minister and the common people of Andhra Pradesh state. There is a [[live broadcast]] every Monday, on both [[Doordarshan]] and All India Radio (AIR) where Naidu interacts with the callers directly to know their issues and address them. The live show is conducted in two sessions: in the first session, there is a discussion with vice-chancellors, academicians, and writers and in the second session, there is interaction with the people. Naidu was described as "a leader, who mingled with the masses after shedding his official status and time as Chief Minister." The innovative program found acceptance in the country's information and broadcasting systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Intellectuals-to-feature-in-Dial-your-CM/articleshow/45304730.cms|title=Intellectuals to feature in 'Dial-your-CM' {{!}} Hyderabad News - Times of India|date=4 May 2003|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref>

'''Rythu Bazaar (farmers market)'''

''Rythu Bazaar'' was launched by Naidu on 26 January 1999 with the objective to control the skyrocketing prices of fruits and vegetables. Under this program, farmers were encouraged to sell their produce directly to the consumers and in the process, eliminate the middleman. In the first phase itself, the program succeeded and reached various towns. Prices were down by 70 to 75 percent, and it benefited both the farmers and the direct consumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/124048/15/15_chapter%205.pdf|title=Rythu Bazaar scheme Launched the Government of Andhra Pradesh|last=Rythu Bazaar|first=January 1999|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

'''E-governance'''

With the intention of bringing [[e-governance]] to the citizens, Naidu launched [[Mee Seva (Andhra Pradesh)|e-Seva]] centers in 2001 for paperless and speedy delivery of results to applicants. These e-Seva centers were one-stop solutions providing all government information and services online such as utility bills, banking services, issuing birth and death certificates, written test for drivers licence, government orders, and APSRTC tours and travel operators booking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/110-civic-bodies-to-have-e-Seva-centres/articleshow/20206985.cms|title=110 civic bodies to have e-Seva centres {{!}} Hyderabad News - Times of India|date=26 August 2002|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref> The government introduced an outsourcing employee system where government-related services are done under a contract agreement and after a certain time, they are declared as permanent government employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/naidu-on-mission-to-e-enable-rural-masses/|title=Naidu on mission to e-enable rural masses|date=5 January 2002|website=Geospatial World|language=en-US|access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref>

'''Vision 2020'''

In 1999, Naidu produced a [[vision statement]] called "Andhra Pradesh Vision 2020" that outlined various goals and objectives to be achieved by 2020.  It was prepared in collaboration with US consultants, [[McKinsey & Company]], who proposed the following:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/21042/8/08_chapter%202.pdf|title=Naidu's Developmental Programme and Vision 2020|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

* Poverty must be eradicated. Support the elderly and children, those who really need help.
* The people should be given the opportunity to live a healthy life along with practice and income.
* Small families should be encouraged for a healthy and prosperous society.
* Provide a happy life for little girls. They should be given the opportunity to use their energy 100 percent.
*Safeguard its environment and make its cities and villages clean, green and safe to live in. 
*Enable small entrepreneurs and young professionals to make startups and build thriving industries and services business.
* Women and girls need to be empowered and supported to compete equally with men in society and in the economy.
* People should be provided with resources such as investments and infrastructure. These can transform their future.
* New techniques in agriculture, upmarket services, and innovations for quality produce should be promoted.
* The government should be transparent, accountable and responsive.
* The people's voice should be heard loud and clear during the rule.

After returning as Chief Minister in 2014, Naidu updated the document to version 2.0, titled ''Sunrise AP Vision 2029''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apvision.ap.gov.in/vision2.0.php|title=AP Vision 2029|website=apvision.ap.gov.in|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/naidu-releases-draft-of-sunrise-ap-vision-2029-document-694813-2016-09-28|title=Naidu releases draft of Sunrise AP Vision 2029 document|date=28 September 2016|author=P.

'''Other activities'''

For attracting global investments, a world class airport was required for Hyderabad city. Naidu called for a global tender under a public–private partnership for [[Shamshabad]] Greenfield international airport with a 5,495 acres of land already acquired by his government and in possession.

=== Cyclone Titli ===
Following [[Cyclone Hudhud]], the next cyclone that battered the north-east coastal [[Srikakulam district|Srikakulam]] and [[Vizianagaram district|Vizianagaram]] districts of Andhra Pradesh state was [[Cyclone Titli]], leaving as many as 2.25 lakh families in about 18 mandals on 11 October 2018, triggering gales of {{convert|120|kph}} causing extensive damage. As per official estimations, 9.07 lakh people, in 202 villages, in 18 mandals were affected due to the cyclone. About 8,962 houses were damaged, {{convert|290|km}} of roads were  destroyed, 386 trees fell and 80 minor irrigation projects and tanks were damaged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2018-10-27/Titli-damages-entire-Srikakulam/432556|title=Titli damages entire Srikakulam|last=Rao|first=Ch Lakshman|date=28 October 2018|website=www.thehansindia.com|language=en|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Power supply was affected in six towns and 319 villages. The [[cell phone]] networks of [[BSNL]] (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited), and private telecom companies were affected, sending communications out for two day. Horticulture was hit with damages to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore followed by agriculture (Rs 800 crore).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/cyclone-titli-srikakulam-farmers-worry-about-crop-loss-and-loss-livelihood-90549|title=srikakulam-farmers-worry-about-crop-loss-and-loss-livelihood Cyclone Titli|last=|first=|date=25 October 2018|website=www.thenewsminute.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu acted as soon as the cyclone warning was received by alerting the administration to prepare for the calamity and was in constant touch with officials of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO), Real-Time Governance and alerted the Collectors of both Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-titli-makes-landfall-in-andhra-s-srikakulam-leaves-trail-of-panic-and-devastation/story-dlAarp1bVUx0ApaZhZseRK.html|title=In Andhra's Srikakulam, cyclone Titli leaves trail of devastation|date=11 October 2018|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> The Naidu  government appealed to people in the cyclone-affected villages to be alert to prevent loss of life and directed the officials to take up relief and rehabilitation works in the affected regions and issued immediate orders for necessary assistance to the villagers and farmers who suffered severe losses. {{convert|25|kg}} rice was provided to the families and {{convert|50|kg}} to the families of the fishermen community. Additionally, [[dal]], palm oil, potatoes, onions and sugar were distributed to families, and milk was made available to children in cyclone-affected regions. Rs. 5 lakh was announced as an [[ex gratia]] grant to family members of 8 persons killed by the cyclone, and that [[Asbestos sheeting|asbestos sheet]]s would be distributed free of cost to fishermen to help with the repairing of their houses, also to pay Rs 2 lakh for the fisheremen who lost their boats. Compensation will be Rs 6 lakh for motor boats and Rs 10,000 for each net. Aqua farmers will receive Rs 30,000 compensation per hectare to recover from the damage. 100 [[Deputy Collector]]s were pressed into service to take part in cyclone relief operations and with a nodal officer appointed in-charge of each mandal to supervise relief operations. More than 50% of the power supply was restored by the next day. Naidu addressed people at Lollaputtuga, Balliputtuga, Patavaraka, Manikyaputtuga, Borivanka, and Sompeta and interacted with them on the relief measures while feedback was collected from people to know whether they received water and food and restoration of power supply was assured.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2018/oct/11/cyclone-titli-andhra-pradesh-cm-chandrababu-naidu-to-visit-affected-areas-in-srikakulam-district-1884083.html|title=Cyclone Titli: Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu to visit affected areas in Srikakulam district|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> The [[Real Time Governance Society]] (RGTS) correctly forecast the course of Cyclone Titli in the coastal region of Srikakulam district above [[Kalingapatnam]]. The cyclone made its landfall at Pallesarathi village, [[Vajrapukothuru]] Mandal on the night of 11 October 2018. The clear prediction helped in communicating with the local agencies to evacuate the coastal population to safe places in time and taking other preparatory measures while passing the communication to fisherman to remain off the sea for fishing due to the cyclone and rough sea. All these measures by RTGS ensured that the number of casualties due to Cyclone Titli remained low. Though protective measures were taken, there was still eight people killed, seven in Srikakulam district and one in Vizianagaram, whereas Titli claimed more than 62 lives in Odisha State.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Latest-News/2018-12-16/Mitigation-measures-taken-by-RTGS-on-cyclone-alert/459796|title=Mitigation measures taken by RTGS on cyclone alert|last=M|first=Sambasiva Rao|date=16 December 2018|website=www.thehansindia.com|language=en|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>

=== Cyclone Phethai ===
Due to the previous experience with Cyclone Titli, the Naidu government responded to the third cyclone using RTGS and was able to deftly handle Cyclone Phethai, which hit central coastal Andhra Pradesh near Kakinada on 17 December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2019/may/04/accurate-cyclone-alerts-win-accolades-for-rtgs-from-andhra-pradesh-as-odisha-lauds-support--1972593.html|title=Accurate cyclone alerts win accolades for RTGS from Andhra Pradesh as Odisha lauds support|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> RTGS monitored the entire track of Cyclone Phethai right from its inception as a low-pressure system 1400 south-east of Bay of Bengal to the time it formed into a depression, deep depression and severe cyclone until it made landfall off AP Coast between Kakinada and Yanam. Understanding the movement of the cyclone, RTGS alerted the rural departments in central districts especially [[Guntur]], [[Krishna district|Krishna]], East and West Godavari and up to [[Visakhapatnam]] to further advise farmers to quickly complete harvesting of their standing crops. This ensured more than 30,000 hectares of [[Paddy field|Paddy]] crops were saved from lodging and inundation due to the cyclone and Fishermen were alerted one week before [[Landfall]] not to venture into the sea considering a forecast of rough sea and tidal waves. There was not even a single casualty of fishermen during the cyclone. RTGS alerted the fisheries department, local administrations, local communities, village functionaries of the impending storm through IVRS calls advising them to stay off the sea. Based on RTGS recommendation, communication was also sent to fishermen who went into the sea to return. Nearly 350 vessels were made to return before the cyclone. There was a case of four boats that went deep into the sea that could not be communicated using mobile phones. RTGS utilised the FM radio and sent advisories to these vessels naming their villages asking them to immediately return. The Naidu government also pressed helicopter operations, taking the support of the navy to identify the four vessels carrying 26 fishermen that drifted off from [[East Godavari]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cyclone-phethai-andhra-pradesh-odisha-indian-navy-phethai-intensifies-andhra-pradesh-odisha-coastal-1963428|title=Cyclone Phethai Intensifies Off Andhra Pradesh; Coastal Areas On Alert|website=NDTV.com|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> and one casualty were reported and advisories were also sent to the citizens of vulnerable mandals along the coast where the cyclone was predicted to make the landfall forcing the evacuation of 20,000 people have been sheltered in relief camps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cyclone-phethai-live-updates-meteorological-department-weather-andhra-pradesh-tamil-nadu-5495722/|title=Cyclone Phethai Highlights: 20,000 people shifted to relief camps, storm weakens|date=18 December 2018|website=The Indian Express|language=en-US|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>

== 2015 Cash for Vote Scam ==
{{see|2015 Cash for Vote Scam}}
The 2015 cash-for-votes scam was a [[political scandal]], the second scandal of its kind since the 2008 [[cash-for-votes scandal]]. The 2015 political scandal started off when the [[Telugu Desam Party]] Leaders of [[Telangana]] state were caught in video footage, aired in the media, offering bribes to a nominated MLA for his vote in the 2015 elections of the [[Telangana Legislative Council]]. The Telugu Desam MLA [[Revanth Reddy]] was arrested by the Telangana Police when he was offering Rs. 50 [[lakh]]s to the nominated MLA Elvis Stephenson. Reddy was then presented before the court of justice and sent to jail. Similarly, the phone conversation, which was quoted as the voice of Naidu with the same nominated MLA was aired in the news media.<ref>Rahul, U.

The Telugu Desam party alleged that the scandal, was a political vendetta, doctored by the Telangana State Government under the direction of [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao|K. Chandrashekhar Rao]], the Chief Minister of Telangana, alongside the [[YSR Congress Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-cash-for-vote-case-poll-alleged-bribe-an-audio-clip/|title=Cash-for-vote case explained: Poll, alleged bribe, an audio clip|date=10 June 2015|work=The Indian Express}}</ref> In a further development, The [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] granted bail to [[Revanth Reddy]] and two other co-accused due to lack of substantial evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/cashforvote-case-hc-grants-bail-to-revanth-reddy/article7370014.ece|title=Revanth Reddy gets bail; ACB set to approach Supreme Court|author=V Rishi Kumar|work=The Hindu Business Line}}</ref>

== 2019 election defeat ==
The [[Telugu Desam Party]] (led by Naidu) lost the 2019 general elections to the [[YSR Congress Party]] led by [[Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy]]. It was the party's biggest defeat since its inception in 1982; TDP won 23 assembly seats out of 175 and 3 [[Lok Sabha]] seats out of 25.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

== Arrest in 2019 ==
In 2019, Naidu was taken into preventive custody by the police citing law and order issues as he planned to organise the ''Chalo Atmakur'' rally to protest political violence and the massacre of his Telugu Desam party activists by the ruling party. Following his arrest, Naidu went on a hunger strike to protest his house arrest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/naidu-was-creating-law-and-order-situation-ap-dgp-on-naidus-preventive-detention20190911154108/ |title=Naidu was creating law and order situation : AP DGP on Naidu's preventive detention |website=www.aninews.in |language=en |access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref>

== Business Career ==
The Heritage Group (HFL) was incorporated by Naidu in 1992. In 1994, HFL went for public issue to raise resources. Currently, the organisation is being led by Nara Brahmini, Naidu's daughter-in-law. Heritage has hundreds of outlets throughout Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and a significant presence in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Odisha, NCR-Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh which comprises a solid portion of Naidu's current assets.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Heritage Foods Ltd.|work=Business Standard India|url=https://www.business-standard.com/company/heritage-foods-4439/information/company-history|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref>
