==History==

===1996–1999: Formation and first years===
[[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] first met during their [[orientation week]] at [[University College London]] (UCL) in September 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Front Row King|url=http://frontrowking.com/coldplay-tickets/index.html|publisher=frontrowking.com|accessdate=13 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514030523/http://frontrowking.com/coldplay-tickets/index.html|archive-date=14 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz.<ref name="all">{{cite web|accessdate=1 May 2008|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/051126/yworld6.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601192601/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/051126/yworld6.htm|archivedate=1 June 2008|title=All That Is Cold play |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=26 November 2005|author=Ali, Mehreen F. }}</ref> [[Guy Berryman]], a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] promoters at small clubs.<ref name="roach 19"/> Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], who was studying [[classics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], to be the band's manager.<ref>{{harv|Roach|2003|p=22}}</ref> Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group.<ref name="id=80"/> The band's line-up was completed when [[Will Champion]] joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and [[tin whistle]]; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience).<ref name="all"/> The band finally settled on the name "Coldplay" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.<ref name="id=80"/>

By 1997, Martin had met Classics student [[Tim Rice-Oxley]]. During a weekend in the English village [[Virginia Water]] in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, [[Keane (band)|Keane]], was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Odell|first=Michael|url=http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |title=The Shore Thing (Annotated)|work=[[Q magazine]]|date=1 May 2004|pages=48–52|accessdate=12 March 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013211302/http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |archivedate = 13 October 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the EP ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety]].''<ref name="balance" /> Most of the discs were given to record labels and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public.

After completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed a five-album contract with [[Parlophone]] in early 1999.<ref name="ColdplayParlophone"/> After making their first appearance at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], the band went into the studio to record a second EP, titled ''[[The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room]]''.<ref>{{harv|Roach|2003|p=26}}</ref> Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October,<ref name="roach 28">{{harv|Roach|2003|p=28}}</ref> and the single "Bigger Stronger" received [[BBC Radio 1]] airplay. The recording sessions for ''The Blue Room'' were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like [[U2]] and [[R.E.M.]], Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used [[Hard and soft drugs|hard drugs]].<ref name="The Edge">{{cite podcast|url=http://www.edge.ca |title=The Ongoing History of New Music&nbsp;– Coldplay |website=[[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |host=[[Alan Cross]] |year=2003 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080609/http://www.edge.ca/ |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}</ref>

After the success of ''Parachutes'', Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on ''Parachutes''. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. "[[In My Place]]" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album, following a "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" three months after the success of ''Parachutes''. According to Martin "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."<ref>Cumberbatch, Franklin (13 August 2002).
