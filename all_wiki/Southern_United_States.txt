The '''Southern United States''', also known as the '''American South''', the '''Southern States''', or simply known as '''the South''', is a geographic and cultural [[List of regions of the United States#Official regions of the United States|region of the United States]]. It is between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Western United States]], with the [[Midwestern United States]] and [[Northeastern United States]] to its north and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Mexico]] to its south. The region was historically defined as all states south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] and [[Ohio River]].

The South does not precisely coincide with the geographic south of the [[United States]] but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the [[Confederate States of America]] in the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="south">{{cite web| url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/South| title = south| work = TheFreeDictionary.com| accessdate = September 30, 2014}}</ref> The [[Deep South]] lies entirely within the southeastern corner.

The region is known for its [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]] and [[History of the Southern United States|history]], having developed its own customs, musical styles, and [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|cuisines]], which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States. The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong [[European Americans|European]] (mostly [[English Americans|English]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[French Americans|French]]), [[African Americans|African]] and some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] components.<ref>{{cite web |author = Bethune, Lawrence E |title = Scots to Colonial North Carolina Before 1775 |work = Lawrence E.

The historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of [[slave labor]] on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States; the presence of a large proportion of [[African Americans]] in the population; support for the doctrine of [[states' rights]], and the legacy of racism magnified by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era]], as seen in thousands of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] (mostly from 1880 to 1930), the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] system of separate schools and public facilities known as "[[Jim Crow laws]]" that remained until the 1960s, and the widespread use of [[poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]] and other methods frequently to deny black people the ability to vote or hold office until the 1960s. Since the enactment of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], black people have held many offices in Southern states, notably in the states of [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]]. Black people have also been elected or appointed as mayors and police chiefs in [[Baltimore]], [[Charlotte]], [[Raleigh]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[New Orleans]], and serve in both the U.S. Congress and state legislatures.<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7234/US-Race-Relations-Region-South.aspx "Gallup Poll: U.S. race relations by region; The South"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527064428/http://www.gallup.com/poll/7234/US-Race-Relations-Region-South.aspx |date=May 27, 2016 }}.

Historically, the South relied heavily on [[agriculture]], and was highly rural until after 1945. It has since become more industrialized and urban and has attracted national and international migrants. The American South is now among the fastest-growing areas in the United States. [[Houston]] is the largest city in the Southern United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census Bureau Regions and Divisions with State FIPS Codes |work=US Census |date=December 2008 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/maps/pdfs/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |accessdate=December 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053705/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/maps/pdfs/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |archive-date=September 21, 2013 }}</ref> Sociological research indicates that Southern collective identity stems from political, demographic, and cultural distinctiveness from the rest of the United States.

Oklahoma was not a state during the Civil War, but all its major Native American tribes signed [https://web.archive.org/web/20160201074014/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v031/v031p189.pdf formal treaties] of alliance with the Confederacy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The South is a diverse meteorological region with numerous climatic zones, including [[temperate]], [[Subtropics|sub-tropical]], [[Tropical climate|tropical]] and [[arid]]—though the South generally has a reputation as hot and humid, with long summers and short, mild winters. Most of the south—except for the higher elevations and areas near the western, southern and some northern fringes—fall in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone. Crops grow readily in the South; its climate consistently provides growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost. Another common environment occurs in the [[bayou]]s and swamplands of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], especially in Louisiana and in Texas.

Although not included in the Census definition, two [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] located southeast of [[Florida]] ([[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) are sometimes included as part of the Southern United States.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Southern United States}}

===Native American culture===
The first well-dated evidence of human occupation in the south United States occurs around 9500 BC with the appearance of the earliest documented Americans, who are now referred to as [[Paleo-Indians]].<ref name=guy_prentice>{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title = Native american archeology and culture history |last = Prentice |first = Guy |accessdate = February 11, 2008 }}</ref> Paleoindians were hunter-gathers that roamed in bands and frequently hunted [[megafauna]].  Several cultural stages, such as Archaic (ca. 8000–1000 BC) and the Woodland (ca. 1000 BC – AD 1000), preceded what the Europeans found at the end of the 15th century—the [[Mississippian culture]].<ref name=guy_prentice />

The Mississippian culture was a complex, mound-building [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture that flourished in what is now the Southeastern United States from approximately 800 AD to 1500 AD.  Natives had elaborate and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial centers extending through the river valleys and from the East Coast to the Great Lakes.<ref name=guy_prentice />  Some noted explorers who encountered and described the Mississippian culture, by then in decline, included [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] (1528), [[Hernando de Soto]] (1540), and [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] (1699).

Native American descendants of the mound-builders include [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]], [[Apalachee]], [[Caddo]], [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], [[Guale]], [[Hitchiti]], [[Houma Tribe|Houma]], and [[Seminole]] peoples, all of whom still reside in the South.

Other peoples whose ancestral links to the Mississippian culture are less clear but were clearly in the region before the European incursion include the [[Catawba people|Catawba]] and the [[Powhatan]].

===European colonization===
[[File:Benjamin Hawkins and the Creek Indians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Hawkins]], seen here on his plantation, teaching Creek Native Americans how to use European technology (painted in 1805)]]
European immigration caused a [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Depopulation from disease|die-off of Native Americans]], whose immune systems could not protect them from the [[Infectious disease|diseases]] the Europeans unwittingly introduced.<ref>Cook, Noble David. ''Born To Die'', pp. 1–11.</ref>

The predominant culture of the original Southern states was [[British colonization of the Americas|British]]. In the 17th century, most voluntary immigrants were of [[English people|English]] origin, and settled chiefly along the eastern coast but had pushed as far inland as the [[Appalachian Mountains]] by the 18th century. The majority of early English settlers were [[indentured servant]]s, who gained freedom after working off their passage. The wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights, to encourage settlement.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |last=Barker |first=Deanna |publisher=National Association for Interpretation's Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5klVsFyDj?url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archive-date=October 24, 2009 |url-status=dead|access-date=November 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The Spanish and French established settlements in [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], [[Spanish Texas|Texas]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The Spanish settled Florida in the 16th century, reaching a peak in the late 17th century, but the population was small because the Spaniards were relatively uninterested in agriculture, and Florida had no mineral resources.

In the British colonies, immigration began in 1607 and continued until the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775. Settlers cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The Southern rich owned large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] that dominated export agriculture and used slaves. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields. They used old fields as pasture, and for crops such as corn wheat, or allowed them to grow into woodlots.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Isaac |first = Rhys |title = The Transformation of Virginia 1740–1790 |year = 1982 |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |isbn = 978-0-8078-4814-2 |pages = 22–23 }}</ref>

In the mid-to-late-18th century, large groups of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (later called the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]) and people from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] region immigrated and settled in the back country of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. They were the largest group of non-English immigrants from the [[British Isles]] before the [[American Revolution]].<ref>[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 361–368</ref> In the [[1980 Census]], 34% of Southerners reported that they were of English ancestry; English was the largest reported European ancestry in every Southern state by a large margin.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

The early colonists engaged in [[endemic warfare|warfare]], [[trade]], and cultural exchanges. Those living in the backcountry were more likely to encounter [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek Indians]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Choctaw]]s and other regional native groups.

The oldest university in the South, the [[College of William & Mary]], was founded in 1693 in Virginia; it pioneered in the teaching of [[political economy]] and educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[James Monroe|Monroe]] and [[John Tyler|Tyler]], all from Virginia. Indeed, the entire region dominated politics in the [[First Party System]] era: for example, four of the first five [[President of the United States|Presidents]]—[[George Washington|Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[James Madison|Madison]], and [[James Monroe|Monroe]]—were from Virginia. The two oldest public universities are also in the South: the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (1789) and the [[University of Georgia]] (1785).

===American Revolution===
{{Main|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:Battle of Guilford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]] in [[North Carolina]]]]
With Virginia in the lead, the Southern colonies embraced the [[American Revolution]], providing such leaders as commander in chief [[George Washington]], and the author of the Declaration of Independence, [[Thomas Jefferson]].

In 1780 and 1781, the British largely halted reconquest of the northern states, and concentrated on the south, where they were told there was a large Loyalist population ready to leap to arms once the royal forces arrived. The British took control of Savannah and Charleston, capturing a large American army in the process, and set up a network of bases inland. There were many more Loyalists in the South than in the North,<ref>The World Book: Organized Knowledge in Story and Picture, Volume 6 edited by Michael Vincent O'Shea, Ellsworth Decatur Foster, George Herbert Locke p. 4989</ref> but they were concentrated in larger coastal cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries. Large numbers of loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].  The British forces at the [[Battle of Monck's Corner]] and the [[Battle of Lenud's Ferry]] consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer ([[Banastre Tarleton]]).<ref>Wilson, David. The Southern Strategy. University of South Carolina Press. 2005.</ref>  Both white and black Loyalists fought for the British at the [[Battle of Kemp's Landing]] in Virginia.<ref>Selby, John E; Higginbotham, Don (2007)</ref><ref>Wilson, David K (2005). ''The Southern Strategy: Britain's conquest of South Carolina and Georgia, 1775–1780''. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. p. 9</ref>  Led by [[Nathanael Greene]] and other generals, the Americans engaged in [[Fabian strategy|Fabian tactics]] designed to wear down the British invasion force, and to neutralize its strong points one by one. There were numerous battles large and small, with each side claiming some victories. By 1781, however, British [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] moved north to Virginia, where an approaching army forced him to fortify and await rescue by the British Navy. The British Navy did arrive, but so did a stronger French fleet, and Cornwallis was trapped. American and French armies, led by Washington, forced Cornwallis to surrender his entire army in [[Yorktown, Virginia]] in October 1781, effectively winning the North American part of the war.<ref>Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)</ref>

The Revolution provided a shock to slavery in the South. Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British Governor Dunmore of Virginia's promise of freedom for service. Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the Empire. Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks – from 61% to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', (Hill and Wang, 1994), p. 73.</ref>

In addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, and Quaker and Methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves. Planters such as [[George Washington]] often freed slaves by their wills. In the upper South, more than 10 percent of all blacks were free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less than 1 percent free.<ref>Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', p. 81.</ref>

===Antebellum years===
[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumb|[[Slavery|Slaves]] on a [[South Carolina]] plantation (''[[The Old Plantation]]'', circa 1790)]]
[[King Cotton|Cotton]] became dominant in the lower South after 1800. After the invention of the [[cotton gin]], short staple cotton could be grown more widely.  This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama and other parts of the Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta.  Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west.  The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |title = The Peculiar Institution of American Slavery |accessdate = June 11, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103122831/http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |archive-date = November 3, 2007 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

With the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi, there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories.  From the 1820s through the 1850s, more than one million enslaved Africans were transported to the Deep South in forced migration, two-thirds of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there. Planters in the Upper South sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture. Many enslaved families were broken up, as planters preferred mostly strong males for field work.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 5, 215.</ref>

Two major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment along sectional lines, strengthened the identities of North and South as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests, and fed the arguments over states' rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War.  One of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector, primarily in the North.  In 1832, in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs, South Carolina passed an ordinance of [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], a procedure in which a state would, in effect, repeal a Federal law. Soon a naval flotilla was sent to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced, but the underlying argument over states' rights continued to escalate in the following decades.

[[File:A Race Meeting at Jacksonville, Alabama by W.S. Hedges - BMA.jpg|thumb|[[Horse racing]] at [[Jacksonville, Alabama]], 1841]]
The second issue concerned slavery, primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states. The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of "free" and "slave" states. The issue resurfaced in more virulent form, however, around the time of the [[Mexican–American War]], which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of the imaginary geographic divide. Congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories.

Before the Civil War, the number of immigrants arriving at Southern ports began to increase, although the North continued to receive the most immigrants. [[Hugenots]] were among the first settlers in Charleston, along with the largest number of Orthodox Jews outside of [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans, establishing a distinct [[ethnic enclave]] now known as the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]].  Germans also went to New Orleans and its environs, resulting in a large area north of the city (along the Mississippi) becoming known as the German Coast. Still greater numbers immigrated to Texas (especially after 1848), where many bought land and were farmers.  Many more German immigrants arrived in Texas after the Civil War, where they created the brewing industry in Houston and elsewhere, became grocers in numerous cities, and also established wide areas of farming.

By 1840, [[New Orleans]] was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population. The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave '', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2–7</ref> Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation.

===Civil War===

[[File:Southern_United_States_Civil_War_Map.svg|thumb|left|alt=map of United States with southeastern states highlighted in shades of red|Historic Southern United States.

Although members of the Five Tribes in Indian Territory (today part of Oklahoma) aligned themselves with the Confederacy, the region is not shaded because at the time it was a territory, not a state.]]
By 1856, the South had lost control of Congress, and was no longer able to silence calls for an end to slavery—which came mostly from the more populated, [[Slave and free states|free states]] of the North. The Republican Party, founded in 1854, pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed.  After Abraham Lincoln was elected the first Republican president in 1860, seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] before Lincoln was inaugurated.  The United States government, both outgoing and incoming,  refused to recognize the Confederacy, and when the new Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered his troops to open fire on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, there was an overwhelming demand, North and South, for war.  Only the state of [[Kentucky]] attempted to remain neutral, and it could only do so briefly.  When Lincoln called for troops to suppress what he referred to as "combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary" judicial or martial means,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tulane.edu/~latner/Aftermath/AApr15Comm.html |title = Commentary: Lincoln's Proclamation |accessdate = September 30, 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140906024508/http://www.tulane.edu/~latner/Aftermath/AApr15Comm.html |archive-date = September 6, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> four more states decided to secede and join the Confederacy (which then moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia). Although the Confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers, it was slower than the Union in dealing with the border states.  By March 1862, the Union largely controlled Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports, had prevented European recognition of the Confederate government, and was poised to seize New Orleans.
[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead of General Ewell's Corps who attacked the Union lines at the Battle of Spotsylvania, May 19, 1864.]]

In the four years of war 1861–65 the South was the primary battleground, with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern soil. Union forces relentlessly squeezed the Confederacy, controlling the border states in 1861, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River and New Orleans in 1862, and the Mississippi River in 1863.  In the East, however, the Confederate Army under [[Robert E. Lee]] beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at Richmond. But when Lee tried to move north, he was repulsed (and nearly captured) at Sharpsburg (1862) and Gettysburg (1863).

The Confederacy had the resources for a short war, but was unable to finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. The [[Union Army|Union]] blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat; both were shut down by the [[Union Navy]]. The small railroad system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled.

The Confederate cause was hopeless by the time Atlanta fell and [[William T. Sherman]] marched through Georgia in late 1864, but the rebels fought on, refusing to give up their independence until Lee's army surrendered in April 1865. All the Confederate forces surrendered, and the region moved into the [[Reconstruction Era]].

The South suffered much more than the North overall, as the Union strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties, and the total war waged by Sherman, Sheridan and other Union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress. The Confederacy suffered military losses of 95,000 men killed in action and 165,000 who died of disease, for a total of 260,000,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/wars19c.htm#ACW |title = Nineteenth Century Death Tolls: American Civil War |accessdate = August 22, 2006 }}</ref> out of a total white Southern population at the time of around 5.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancivilwar.org.uk/news_those-confederate-states_42.htm |title=American Civil War, Those Confederate States |accessdate=2007-07-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928050453/http://www.americancivilwar.org.uk/news_those-confederate-states_42.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2006 }}</ref> Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and about 18% in the South.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gySktxKYPGoC&pg=PA7&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Toward a social history of the American Civil War: exploratory essays]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106175459/https://books.google.com/books?id=gySktxKYPGoC&pg=PA7&dq&hl=en |date=November 6, 2011 }}''".

===Reconstruction and Jim Crow===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|Voting rights in the United States}}
[[File:A Home on the Mississippi.png|thumb|''[[A Home on the Mississippi]]'', [[Currier and Ives]], 1871]]
After the Civil War, the South was devastated in terms of population, [[infrastructure]] and economy. Because of states' reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression. In addition, what limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most of the Southern states initially passed [[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]]. Eventually, these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910091017/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-date = September 10, 2006 |title = Chapter 3: An Easy Adjustment to the Post War Nation: Pensacola Between 1865 and 1870 |date = December 4, 2010 |publisher = fsu.edu }}</ref>

There were thousands of people on the move, as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.

[[File:Little Bo Peep. Group of men and women seated outside, child peeking out of a barrel in the foreground.png|thumb|An [[African American]] family photo-graphed by O'Pierre Havens, c. 1868.]]

With passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States]] (which outlawed slavery), the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (which granted full U.S. citizenship to [[African American]]s) and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] (which extended the right to vote to [[African American]] males), African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote. Under Federal protection, white and black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] formed constitutional conventions and state governments. Among their accomplishments were creating the first public education systems in Southern states, and providing for welfare through orphanages, hospitals and similar institutions.

Northerners came south to participate in politics and business. Some were representatives of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] and other agencies of Reconstruction; some were [[Humanitarianism|humanitarians]] with the intent to help black people. Some were adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods. They were all condemned with the pejorative term of [[carpetbagger]]. Some Southerners also took advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various schemes, including bonds and financing for railroads.<ref>Richard Nelson Current, ''Those Terrible Carpetbaggers: A Reinterpretation'' (1989)</ref>

Secret [[vigilante]] organizations such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]—an organization sworn to perpetuate [[white supremacy]]—had arisen quickly after the war's end and used [[lynching]], physical attacks, house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep African Americans from exercising their political rights. Although the first Klan was disrupted by prosecution by the Federal government in the early 1870s, other groups persisted. By the mid-to-late-1870s, elite Southerners created increasing resistance to the altered social structure. [[Paramilitary organizations]] such as the [[White League]] in [[Louisiana]] (1874), the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in [[Mississippi]] (1875) and rifle clubs, all "White Line" organizations, used organized violence against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], both black and white, to remove Republicans from political office, repress and bar black voting, and restore the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to power.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, 2002, pp. 70–75</ref> In 1876 white Democrats regained power in most of the state legislatures. They began to pass laws designed to strip African Americans and [[Poor White|poor whites]] from the voter registration rolls. The success of late-19th century interracial coalitions in several states inspired a reaction among some white Democrats, who worked harder to prevent both groups from voting.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H.

Despite discrimination, many blacks became property owners in areas that were still developing. For instance, 90% of the Mississippi's bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the farmers in Mississippi's Delta bottomlands were black. They had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber. Tens of thousands of migrants went to the Delta, both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies, and many to develop their own farms.<ref>John Solomon Otto, ''The Final Frontiers, 1880–1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands'', Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1999</ref>  Nonetheless, the long agricultural depression, along with disenfranchisement and lack of access to credit, led to many blacks in the Delta losing their property by 1910 and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following decade. More than two generations of free African Americans lost their stake in property.<ref>John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War'', Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000.</ref>

Nearly all Southerners, black and white, suffered as a result of the Civil War. Within a few years cotton production and harvest was back to pre-war levels, but low prices through much of the 19th century hampered recovery.

Migrations continued in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among both blacks and whites. In the last two decades of the 19th century about 141,000 blacks left the South, and more after 1900, totaling a loss of 537,000. After that the movement increased in what became known as the Great Migration from 1910 to 1940, and the Second Great Migration through 1970.  Even more whites left the South, some going to [[California]] for opportunities and others heading to Northern industrial cities after 1900. Between 1880 and 1910, the loss of whites totaled 1,243,000.<ref>Edward L. Ayers, ''The Promise of the New South: Life after Reconstruction'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1992; 15th Anniversary Edition (pbk), 2007, p. 24</ref> Five million more left between 1940 and 1970.

From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states, along with Oklahoma upon statehood, passed [[disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barriers—such as [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy test]]s—that were hard for many poor to meet. Most African Americans, most Mexican Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites were disfranchised, losing the vote for decades. In some states, [[grandfather clause]]s temporarily exempted white illiterates from literacy tests. The numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the former Confederacy as a result. This can be seen via the feature "Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections" at the University of Texas’ ''Politics: Barriers to Voting''. Alabama, which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 when it became a state, also substantially reduced voting by poor whites.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12–13] {{webarchive |url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525202211/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 |date=May 25, 2017 }}, accessed March 10, 2008</ref><ref>Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004</ref> [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]-controlled legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to segregate public facilities and services, including transportation.

While African Americans, poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early 20th century, for decades [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting. Most blacks in the former Confederacy and Oklahoma could not vote until 1965, after passage of the Voting Rights Act and Federal enforcement to ensure people could register. Despite increases in the eligible voting population with the inclusion of women, blacks, and those eighteen and over throughout this period, turnout in ex-Confederate states remained below the national average throughout the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Springer |first1 = Melanie |title = How the States Shaped the Nation |date = 2014 |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = The University of Chicago |page = 145 }}</ref> Not until the late 1960s did all American citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].

Historian [[William Chafe]] has explored the defensive techniques developed inside the African-American community to avoid the worst features of Jim Crow as expressed in the legal system, unbalanced economic power, and intimidation and psychological pressure. Chafe says "protective socialization by blacks themselves" was created inside the community in order to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as "walking the tightrope," such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective Before the 1920s, but did build the foundation The younger  African-Americans deployed in their aggressive, large-scale activism during the civil rights movement in the 1950s.<ref>William H.

At the end of the 19th century, white Democrats in the South had created state constitutions that were hostile to industry and business development, with anti-industrial laws extensive from the time new constitutions were adopted in the 1890s.<ref>Busbee, Wesley F.; ''Mississippi: A History''; p. 185 {{ISBN|0882952277}}</ref> Banks were few and small; there was little access to credit. Traditional agricultural persisted across the region.  Especially in Alabama and Florida, rural minorities held control in many state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing cities, and legislators resisted business and modernizing interests: Alabama refused to redistrict between 1901 and 1972, long after major population and economic shifts to cities. For decades Birmingham generated the majority of revenue for the state, for instance, but received little back in services or infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |title=Dr. Michael McDonald, US Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, George Mason University |accessdate=2017-03-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406101110/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-date=April 6, 2005 }}, accessed April 6, 2008</ref>

In the late 19th century, Texas rapidly expanded its railroad network, creating a network of cities connected on a radial plan and linked to the port of Galveston.  It was the first state{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}in which urban and economic development proceeded independently of rivers, the primary transportation network of the past. A reflection of increasing industry were strikes and labor unrest: "in 1885 Texas ranked ninth among forty states in number of workers involved in strikes (4,000); for the six-year period it ranked fifteenth. Seventy-five of the one hundred strikes, chiefly interstate strikes of telegraphers and railway workers, occurred in the year 1886."<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ "Strikes", Texas Handbook On-Line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527043219/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ |date=May 27, 2016 }}, accessed April 6, 2008</ref>

By 1890 [[Dallas]] became the largest city in Texas, and by 1900 it had a population of more than 42,000, which more than doubled to over 92,000 a decade later. Dallas was the harnessmaking capital of the world and a center of other manufacturing. As an example of its ambitions, in 1907 Dallas built the Praetorian Building, fifteen storeys tall and the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi, soon to be followed by other skyscrapers.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdd01 Jackie McElhaney and Michael V.

Business interests were ignored by the Southern Democrat ruling class. Nonetheless, major new industries started developing in cities such as Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, AL; and Dallas, Fort Worth and [[Houston]], Texas. Growth began occurring at a geometric rate. Birmingham became a major steel producer and mining town, with major population growth in the early decades of the 20th century.

The first major oil well in the South was drilled at [[Spindletop]] near [[Beaumont, Texas]], on the morning of January 10, 1901. Other oil fields were later discovered nearby in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and under the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The resulting "Oil Boom" permanently transformed the economy of the West South Central states and produced the richest economic expansion after the Civil War.<ref>Paul N. Spellman, ''Spindletop Boom Days'' (Texas A & M University Press, 2001).</ref><ref>John S. Spratt, ''The Road to Spindletop: Economic Change in Texas, 1875–1901'' (U of Texas Press, 1955).</ref>

In the early 20th century, invasion of the [[boll weevil]] devastated cotton crops in the South, producing an additional catalyst to African Americans' decisions to leave the South. From 1910 to 1970, more than 6.5&nbsp;million African Americans left the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to Northern and Western cities, defecting from persistent [[lynching]], violence, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], poor education, and inability to vote. Black migration transformed many Northern and Western cities, creating new cultures and music. Many African Americans, like other groups, became industrial workers; others started their own businesses within the communities. Southern whites also migrated to industrial cities like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, and Los Angeles, where they took jobs in the booming new auto and defense industry.

Later, the Southern economy was dealt additional blows by the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]]. After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left unemployed.  Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939, an ecological disaster of severe wind and [[drought]] caused an exodus from Texas and Arkansas, the [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] region, and the surrounding plains, in which over 500,000 [[Maps of American ancestries|Americans]] were homeless, hungry and jobless.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/gregory.htm |title = First Measured Century: Interview: James Gregory |accessdate = August 22, 2006 }}</ref> Thousands left the region forever to seek economic opportunities along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] noted the South as the "number one priority" in terms of need of assistance during the Great Depression.  His administration created programs such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in 1933 to provide rural electrification and stimulate development.  Locked into low-productivity agriculture, the region's growth was slowed by limited industrial development, low levels of entrepreneurship, and the lack of capital investment.

===Economy of 1940s===
{{Further|United States home front during World War II}}
[[United States home front during World War II|World War II]] marked a time of dramatic change in the poor, heavily rural South as new industries and military bases were developed by the Federal government, providing badly needed capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region's many bases and new industries.  During and after the war millions of hard-scrabble farmers, both white and black, left agriculture for urban jobs.<ref>Morton Sosna, and James C. Cobb, ''Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South'' (UP of Mississippi, 1997).</ref><ref>Ralph C. Hon, "The South in a War Economy" ''Southern Economic Journal''8#3 (1942), pp. 291-308 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1052610 online]</ref><ref>For comprehensive coverage see Dwight C. Hoover and B.U. Ratchford, ''Economic Resources and Policies of the South'' (1951).</ref>

United States began mobilizing for war in a major way in the spring of 1940. The warm sunny weather of the South proved ideal for building 60 percent of the Army's new training camps and nearly half the new airfields, In all 40 percent of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example, it, and sleepy [[Starke, Florida]] a town of 1500 people in 1940, became the base of [[Camp Blanding]]. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers.  Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4&nbsp;billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5&nbsp;billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built In Virginia, Charleston, and Along the Gulf Coast. Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia. The most secret and expensive operation was at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], were unlimited amounts of locally generated electricity were used to prepare uranium for the atom bomb.<ref>Russell B. Olwell, ''At Work in the Atomic City: A Labor and Social History of Oak Ridge, Tennessee'' (2004.</ref> The number of production workers doubled during the war. Most training centers, factories and shipyards were closed in 1945, but not all, and the families that left hardscrabble farms remained to find jobs in the urban South. The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as [[George B. Tindall]] notes, the transformation was, "The demonstration of industrial potential, new habits of mind, and a recognition that industrialization demanded community services."<ref>George B. Tindall, The Emergence of the New South pp.694-701, quoting p. 701.</ref><ref>Dewey W. Grantham, ''The South in modern America'' (1994) pp 172-183.</ref>

Per capita income jumped 140% from 1940 to 1945, compared to 100% elsewhere in the United States. Southern income rose from 59 percent to 65 percent. Dewey Grantham says the war, "brought an abrupt departure from the South's economic backwardness, poverty, and distinctive rural life, as the region moved perceptively closer to the mainstream of national economic and social life."<ref>Grantham, ''The South in modern America'' (1994) p 179.</ref>

Farming shifted from cotton and tobacco to include cattle, rice, [[soybean]]s, [[Maize|corn]], and other foods. Industrial growth increased in the 1960s and greatly accelerated into the 1980s and 1990s. Several large urban areas in Texas, Georgia, and Florida grew to over four million people. Rapid expansion in industries such as autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country.  By the 2000 census, the South (along with the West) was leading the nation in population growth. With this growth, however, has come long commute times and air pollution problems in cities such as Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and others that rely on sprawling development and highway networks.<ref>Numan V. Bartley,  ''The new south, 1945-1980'' (LSU Press, 1995) pp 105-46.</ref>

===Decline of Southern liberalism after 1945===
Southern liberals  were an essential part of the [[New Deal coalition]] – without them Roosevelt lacked majorities in Congress. Typical leaders were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in Texas, [[Jim Folsom]] and [[John Sparkman]] in Alabama, [[Claude Pepper]] in Florida, [[Earl Long]] in Louisiana, [[Luther H. Hodges]] in North Carolina, and [[Estes Kefauver]] in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers, and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this north–south coalition was for northern liberals to ignore southern racism. After 1945, however, northern liberals—led especially by young [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota—increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats – the [[Dixiecrat]]s – took control of the state parties in half the region and ran [[Strom Thurmond]] for president against Truman. Thurmond carried only the deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 and 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 southern congressmen and senators signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] denouncing forced desegregation.<ref>Brent J. Aucoin, "The Southern Manifesto and Southern Opposition to Desegregation." ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' 55.2 (1996): 173-193 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40030963 Online].</ref> The labor movement in the South was divided, and lost its political influence. Southern liberals were in a quandary – most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism, others switched sides, and the rest continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated; historian Numan V. Bartley states, "Indeed, the very word 'liberal' gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium."<ref>Numan V. Bartley, ''The New South, 1945-1980: the story of the South's modernization '' (1995) pp 61, 67-73, 92, 101; quoting p. 71.</ref>

==Modern economy==
In the late 20th century, the South changed dramatically. It saw a boom in its [[service economy]], manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Texas in particular witnessed dramatic growth and population change with the dominance of the energy industry and tourism such as the [[Alamo Mission]] in [[San Antonio]]. Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast also grew steadily throughout the last decades of the 20th century.

Numerous new automobile production plants have opened in the region, or are soon to open, such as [[Mercedes-Benz]] in [[Mercedes-Benz U.S. International|Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]; [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] in [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Montgomery, Alabama]]; the [[BMW]] production plant in [[BMW US Manufacturing Company|Spartanburg, South Carolina]]; [[Toyota]] plants in [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky|Georgetown, Kentucky]], [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi|Blue Springs, Mississippi]] and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas|San Antonio]]; the [[General Motors|GM]] manufacturing plant in [[Spring Hill Manufacturing|Spring Hill, Tennessee]]; a [[Honda]] factory in [[Lincoln, Alabama]]; the [[Nissan]] North American headquarters in [[Franklin, Tennessee]] and factories in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] and [[Canton, Mississippi]]; a [[Kia Motors|Kia]] factory in [[West Point, Georgia]]; and the [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant]] in Tennessee.

The two largest research parks in the country are located in the South: [[Research Triangle Park]] in North Carolina (the world's largest) and the [[Cummings Research Park]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] (the world's fourth largest).

In medicine, the Texas Medical Center in Houston has achieved international recognition in education, research, and patient care, especially in the fields of heart disease, cancer, and rehabilitation. In 1994 the Texas Medical Center was the largest medical center in the world including fourteen hospitals, two medical schools, four colleges of nursing, and six university systems.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kct23 |title = Texas Medical Center |work = tshaonline.org |date = 2010-06-15 }}</ref> The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is consistently ranked the #1 cancer research and treatment center in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/cancer |title=U.S. News Best Hospitals: Cancer |work=usnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406163531/http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/cancer |archive-date=April 6, 2012 }}</ref>

Many major banking corporations have headquarters in the region. [[Bank of America]] is in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. [[Wachovia]] was headquartered there before its purchase by [[Wells Fargo]]. [[Regions Financial Corporation]] is in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], as is [[AmSouth Bancorporation]], and [[BBVA Compass]]. [[SunTrust Banks]] is located in [[Atlanta]] as is the district headquarters of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta]]. [[BB&T]] is headquartered in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]].

Many corporations are headquartered in Atlanta and its surrounding area, such as [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[The Home Depot]], and also to many cable television networks, such as the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[CNN]], [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[Turner South]], [[Cartoon Network]]), and [[The Weather Channel]]. In recent years some southern states, most notably Texas, have lured companies with lower tax burdens and lower cost of living for their workforce. Today, the states with the most Fortune 500 companies include California, New York, and Texas; closely mirroring the economic and population resources of those states.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ceo.com/entrepreneurial_ceo/two-charts-showing-states-with-the-most-fortune-500-companies/ |title = Chart: States With The Most Fortune 500 Companies |accessdate = September 30, 2014 |date = 2013-09-10 }}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Southern United States}}
[[File:Maynardville-musicians-tn1.jpg|thumb|[[Street musician]]s in [[Maynardville, Tennessee]], photographed in 1935]]
Several Southern states (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) were British colonies that sent delegates to sign the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and then fought against the government along with the Northern colonies during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/01/life-in-the-southern-colonies-part-2-of-3/</ref> The basis for much Southern culture derives from the pride in these states being among the 13 original colonies, and from the fact that much of the population of the South has strong ancestral links to Colonists who emigrated west. Southern manners and customs reflect the relationship with England that was held by the early population.

The predominant culture of the South has its origins with the settlement of the region by large groups of people from parts of [[southern England]] such as [[Sussex]], [[Kent]], the [[West Country]], and [[East Anglia]] who moved to the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] and the eastern parts of the [[Deep South]] in the 17th and early 18th centuries, [[Northern England|Northern English]], [[Scottish people|Scots lowlanders]] and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] (later called the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]) who settled in [[Appalachia]] and the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in the mid to late 18th century,<ref>David Hackett Fischer, ''Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 633–639</ref> and the many African slaves who were part of the Southern economy.  African-American descendants of the slaves brought into the South compose the United States' second-largest racial minority, accounting for 12.1 percent of the total population according to the 2000 census.  Despite [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era [[Great Migration (African American)|outflow to the North]], the majority of the black population remains concentrated in the Southern states, and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend (Christianity, foods, art, music (see [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[soul music]], [[country music]], [[zydeco]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[rock and roll]]) that characterize Southern culture today.

===Religion===
The South has had a majority of its population adhering to [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] ever since the [[Second Great Awakening]],<ref>Christine Leigh Heyrman, ''Southern Cross: The Beginnings of the Bible Belt'' (1998)</ref> although the upper classes often stayed [[Anglicanism|Anglican/Episcopalian]] or [[Presbyterian]]. The [[First Great Awakening]] and the [[Second Great Awakening]] from about 1742 about 1850 generated large numbers of Methodists and Baptists, which remain the two main Christian confessions in the South.<ref>Donald G. Mathews, ''Religion in the Old South'' (1979)</ref> By 1900, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] had become the largest Protestant denomination in the whole United States with its membership concentrated in rural areas of the South.<ref>Edward L.

===Northern and Latin influences===
Apart from its climate, the living experience in the South increasingly resembles the rest of the nation. The arrival of millions of Northerners has reshaped the culture of major metropolitan areas and coastal areas.<ref>Marc Egnal, ''Divergent paths: how culture and institutions have shaped North American growth'' (1996) p 170</ref> Observers conclude that collective identity and Southern distinctiveness are thus declining, particularly when defined against "an earlier South that was somehow more authentic, real, more unified and distinct".<ref name="Edward L. Ayers 2005 p. 46">Edward L. Ayers, ''What Caused the Civil War? Reflections on the South and Southern History'' (2005) p. 46</ref>  

While Hispanics have long been a major factor in Texas, millions more have arrived in other Southern states in recent years bringing values not rooted in local traditions.<ref>Rebecca Mark and Robert C.

Gibbs Knotts, eds. ''The New Politics of North Carolina'' (2008)</ref> 
Historian Raymond Mohl emphasizes the role of [[NAFTA]] in lowering trade barriers and facilitating large-scale population movements. He adds other factors such as ongoing economic crisis in Mexico, new more liberal immigration policies in the United States, labor recruitment and smuggling, that have produced a major flow of Mexican and Hispanic migration to the southeast. That region's low-wage, low-skill economy readily hired cheap, reliable, nonunion labor, without asking applicants too many questions about legal status.<ref>Raymond A.

==Sports==
===Racial integration===
Racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the regional agenda in the 1950s and 1960s.  Involved were issues of equality, racism, and the alumni demand for the top players needed to win high-profile games.  The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) took the lead. First they started to schedule integrated teams from the North. The wake-up call came in  1966 when [[Don Haskins]]'s [[University of Texas at El Paso#History|Texas Western College]] team with [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners men's basketball team|five black starters]] upset the all-white University of Kentucky team to win the NCAA national basketball championship.<ref>[[Don Haskins]] and Dan Wetzel, ''My Story of the 1966 NCAA Basketball Championship and How One Team Triumphed Against the Odds and Changed America Forever'' (2006).</ref> That happened at a time when there were no black varsity basketball teams in either the Southeastern Conference or  the Southwest Conference.  Finally ACC schools—typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups—integrated their teams.<ref>Charles H. Martin, "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow in Southern College Sports: The Case of the Atlantic Coast Conference." ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 76.3 (1999): 253-284. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522657 online]</ref><ref>Richard Pennington, ''Breaking the Ice: The Racial Integration of Southwest Conference Football'' (McFarland , 1987).</ref>  With an alumni base that dominated local and state politics, society and business, the ACC flagship schools were successful in their endeavor—as Pamela Grundy argues, they had learned how to win:
: The widespread admiration that athletic ability inspired would help transform athletic fields from grounds of symbolic play to forces for social change, places where a wide range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the assumptions that cast them as unworthy of full participation in U.S. society. While athletic successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotype—black athletes would continue to confront racial slurs...[minority star players demonstrated] the discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every arena of national life.<ref>Pamela Grundy, ''Learning to win: Sports, education, and social change in twentieth-century North Carolina'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2003) p 297 [https://www.questia.com/read/101457616/learning-to-win-sports-education-and-social-change online].</ref>

===American football===
[[File:2010 BCS Champ.jpg|thumb|[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] plays [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] in American football for the 2010 [[BCS National Championship Game]]]]
American football, especially at the college and high school level, is by far the most popular team sport in most areas of the Southern United States.

The region is home to numerous decorated and historic [[college football]] programs, particularly in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (known as the "SEC"), [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (known as the "ACC"), and the [[Big 12 Conference]]. The SEC, consisting entirely of teams based in Southern states, is widely considered to be the strongest league in contemporary college football and includes the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]], the program with the most national championships in the sport's history. The sport is also highly competitive and has a spectator following at the [[high school football|high school level]], particularly in rural areas where high school football games often serve as prominent community gatherings.

Though not as popular on a wider basis as the collegiate game, professional football also has a growing tradition in the Southern United States. Before league expansion began in the 1960s, the only established professional team based in the South was the [[History of the Washington Football Team|Washington Redskins]]. Now the [[Washington Football Team]], they still retain a large following in most of Virginia, and parts of Maryland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/the-geography-of-nfl-fandom/379729/|title=Here Is Every U.S. County's Favorite Football Team (According to Facebook)|first=Robinson|last=Meyer|date=September 5, 2014|website=The Atlantic}}</ref> Later on, the merger-era [[National Football League]] began to expand into the football-crazed Deep South in the 1960s with franchises like the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Houston Oilers]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and most prominently the [[Dallas Cowboys]], who overtook Washington as the region's most popular team and eventually became widely considered the most popular team in the United States. In later decades, NFL expansion into Southern states continued, with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and [[Carolina Panthers]] added to the league, while the Houston Oilers were replaced by the [[Houston Texans]] after the Oilers relocated to [[Nashville]] to become the [[Tennessee Titans]].

Baseball has been played in the Southern United States since at least the years leading up to the American Civil War. It was traditionally more popular than American football until the 1980s, and still accounts for the largest annual attendance amongst sports played in the South. The first mention of a baseball team in Houston was on April 11, 1861.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/stream/houstonahistory00writmiss#page/215/mode/1up |title = Houston: A History and Guide |publisher = The Anson Jones Press |year = 1942 |series = American Guide Series |author = Writers' Program of the Work Projects Administration on the State of Texas |page = 215 |lccn = 87890145 |ol = 2507140M }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Base Ball Club |url = http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth236140/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22base%20ball%22&zoom=6&lat=2565.42725&lon=2008.57349&layers=BF |newspaper = The Weekly Telegraph |date = April 16, 1861 |accessdate = December 10, 2012 }}</ref> 19th century and early 20th century games were common, especially once the professional leagues such as the [[Texas League]], the [[Dixie League (1916 baseball)|Dixie League]]<!--The 1916 league looks too late in context and only played 2 seasons-->, and the [[Southern League (1885–99)|Southern League]] were organized.

The short-lived [[Louisville Colonels]] were a part of the early [[National League]] and [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], but ceased to exist in 1899. The first Southern Major League Baseball team after the Colonels appeared in 1962 when the Houston Colt .45s (known today as the [[Houston Astros]]) were enfranchised.  Later, the [[Atlanta Braves]] came in 1966, followed by the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in 1972, and finally the [[Miami Marlins]] and [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in the 1990s.

College baseball appears to be more well attended in the Southern U.S. than elsewhere, as teams like [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Arkansas]], [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]], [[Virginia Cavaliers baseball|Virginia]], [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State]], [[Ole Miss Rebels baseball|Ole Miss]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]], [[Florida Gators baseball|Florida]] and [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas]] are commonly at the top of the [[NCAA]]'s attendance.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sportswriters.net/ncbwa/news/2014/attendance140331.pdf |title = 2014 Division I Baseball Attendance |publisher = [[National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association]] |author = Cutler, Tami |date = March 31, 2014 |access-date = January 20, 2015 }}</ref>  The South generally produces very successful collegiate baseball teams as well, with Virginia, Vanderbilt, LSU, South Carolina, Florida and [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers|Coastal Carolina]] winning recent College World Series Titles.

===Auto racing===
[[File:Green flag at Daytona.JPG|thumb|right|The start of the [[2015 Daytona 500]], the biggest race in [[NASCAR]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]]]
The Southern states are commonly associated with [[stock car racing]] and its most prominent competition [[NASCAR]], which is based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The sport was developed in the South in the early 20th century, with stock car racing's historic mecca being [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], where cars initially raced on the wide, flat beachfront before the construction of [[Daytona International Speedway]]. Though the sport has attained a following throughout the United States, a majority of NASCAR races continue to take place at Southern tracks.

===Basketball===
[[Basketball]] is very popular throughout the Southern United States as both a recreational and spectator sport, particularly in the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[North Carolina]] which are home to several [[college basketball]] programs, the most prominent of which are the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]].

[[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams based in the South include the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[Dallas Mavericks]], [[Washington Wizards]], [[Charlotte Hornets]], [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Orlando Magic]], [[Memphis Grizzlies]], [[New Orleans Pelicans]], and [[Miami Heat]]. Since the 21st century, the Spurs and Heat in particular have become prominent within the NBA, with eight championships won by the two between 1999 and 2013.

===Golf===
[[Golf]] is a popular recreational sport in most areas of the South, with the region's warm climate allowing it to host many professional tournaments and numerous destination golf resorts, particularly in the state of [[Florida]]. The region is home to [[The Masters]], an elite invitational competition played at [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], which has become one of the professional game's most important tournaments.

===Soccer===
In recent decades [[association football]], known in the South as in the rest of the United States as "soccer", has become a popular sport at youth and collegiate levels throughout the region. The game has been historically widespread at the college level in the Atlantic coast states of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, which contain many of the nation's most successful college soccer programs.

The establishment of [[Major League Soccer]] has led to professional soccer clubs in the Southern cities including [[FC Dallas]], [[Houston Dynamo]], [[D.C. United]], [[Orlando City SC|Orlando City]], [[Inter Miami CF]], [[Nashville SC]], [[Atlanta United]] and the future [[Austin FC]] and [[Charlotte FC]].The current United States second division soccer league, the [[USL Championship]], was initially geographically based in the coastal Southeast around clubs in Charleston, Richmond, Charlotte, Wilmington, Raleigh, Virginia Beach, and Atlanta.

===Major sports teams in the South===
The Southern region is home to numerous professional sports franchises in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|"Big Four" leagues]] (NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB), with more than 100 championships collectively among them.

[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|A rally against school integration in 1959.]]
In the first decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, they began to make voter registration more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They had no one to represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.<ref>Michael Perman, ''Pursuit of Unity: A Political History of the American South'' (2009)</ref> Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being "authoritarian enclaves" from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Act.<ref name="Mickey 2015"/><ref name="University of Chicago Press"/><ref name="kuo"/><ref name="Gibson 2013"/>

With the collapse of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the “[[Solid South]]”, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was [[tantamount to election]]. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts.<ref>Key; ''Southern Politics State and Nation'' (1984)</ref><ref>Gordon B. McKinney (2010); ''Southern Mountain Republicans 1865–1900''. University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-9724-9}}</ref> Republicans, however, continued to control parts of the Appalachian Mountains and compete for power in the Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd Machine]] in Virginia, the [[E. H. Crump|Crump]] [[Political machine|Machine]] in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees.<ref>The classic study is V.O. Key, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiESAAAAYAAJ ''Southern politics in State and Nation'' (1949)]</ref> By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement measures like the “grandfather clause” and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in Congress and could sidetrack or [[filibuster]] efforts by Northerners to pass legislation against lynching, for example.

Increasing support for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate [[Strom Thurmond]] on a third-party “Dixiecrat” ticket in 1948. These Dixiecrats returned to the party by 1950, but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the [[civil rights movement]]. In response to the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling of 1954, 101 Southern congressmen (19 senators, 82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 2 were Republicans) in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a "clear abuse of judicial power [that] climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people." The manifesto lauded, “...those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means”. It was signed by all Southern senators except Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and Tennessee senators [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] and [[Estes Kefauver]]. Virginia closed schools in [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] rather than integrate, but no other state followed suit. Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi, [[John Connally]] of Texas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia, and, especially, [[George Wallace]] of Alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and [[blue-collar]] electorate.<ref>Numan V. Bartley, ''The New South, 1945–1980'' (1995) pp 455–70</ref>
[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|right|US president Lyndon B. Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]
The northern Democrats’ support of civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement of voting rights for blacks. In the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]], [[Barry Goldwater]]’s only electoral victories outside his home state of [[United States presidential election in Arizona, 1964|Arizona]] were in the states of the [[Deep South]] where few blacks could vote before the 1965 Voting Rights Act.<ref>Bernard Cosman, ''Five States for Goldwater Continuity and Change in Southern Presidential Voting Patterns'' (1966)</ref>

Pockets of resistance to integration in public places broke out in violence during the 1960s by the shadowy [[Ku Klux Klan]], which caused a backlash among moderates.<ref>David M. Chalmers, ''Backfire: how the Ku Klux Klan helped the civil rights movement'' (2003)</ref> Major resistance to school busing extended into the 1970s.<ref>Bartley, ''The New South'' pp 408–11</ref>

National Republicans such as [[Richard Nixon]] began to develop their [[Southern strategy]] to attract conservative white Southerners, especially the middle class and suburban voters, in addition to migrants from the North and traditional GOP pockets in Appalachia. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with [[Sonny Perdue]] taking the governorship in 2002.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''The Rise of Southern Republicans'' (2003)</ref> In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.<ref>William C. Martin, ''With God On Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America'' (2005)</ref>

===Presidents from the South===
The South produced nine of the first twelve Presidents prior to the Civil War. For more than a century after the Civil War, no politician from an antebellum slave state became president unless he either moved North (like [[Woodrow Wilson]]) or was vice president when the president died in office (like [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]). In 1976, [[Jimmy Carter]] defied this trend and became the first Southerner to break the pattern since [[Zachary Taylor]] in 1848. The South has produced five of the last nine American Presidents: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963–69), [[Jimmy Carter]] (1977–81), [[George H. W. Bush]] (1989–93), [[Bill Clinton]] (1993–2001) and [[George W. Bush]] (2001–2009). Johnson was a native of Texas, while Carter is from Georgia, and Clinton from Arkansas. While George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush began their political careers in Texas, they were both born in [[New England]] and have their ancestral roots in that region.

===Other politicians and political movements===
[[File:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]], newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] speaking with [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978. Carter and Clinton were both [[Southern Democrats]] and elected to the presidencies in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].]]
The South has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements. In 1948, a group of Democratic congressmen, led by Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by [[Minneapolis]] mayor and future senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]]. They founded the States Rights Democratic or [[Dixiecrat]] Party. During that year's presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.

In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 Presidential election]], Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] ran for president on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Wallace ran a “law and order” campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, [[Richard Nixon]]. Nixon's [[Southern Strategy]] of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values, such as family issues, patriotism, and cultural issues that appealed to [[Southern Baptists]].

In [[United States elections, 1994|the 1994 mid-term elections]], another Southern politician, [[Newt Gingrich]], led the [[Republican Revolution]], ushering in twelve years of GOP control of the House. Gingrich became [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. [[Tom DeLay]] was the most powerful Republican leader in Congress{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican rules.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Apart from [[Bob Dole]] from Kansas (1985–96), the recent Republican Senate Leaders have been Southerners: [[Howard Baker]] (1981–1985) of Tennessee, [[Trent Lott]] (1996–2003) of Mississippi, [[Bill Frist]] (2003–2006) of Tennessee, and [[Mitch McConnell]] (2007–present) of Kentucky.

The Republicans candidates for president have won the South in elections since [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], except for [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. The region is not, however, entirely monolithic, and every successful Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states. [[Barack Obama]] won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 reelection campaign.<ref>“[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-10/romney-bus-tour-charts-course-for-battlegrounds-obama-won Romney Bus Tour Charts Course for Battlegrounds Obama Won]”.

==Race relations==
{{Main|Racism in the United States}}

===Native Americans===
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] had lived in the south for nearly 12,000 years.  They were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending in the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Seminole Wars]], and most were removed west to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma and Kansas), but large numbers of Native Americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society.  This was especially true of the wives of Euro-American merchants and miners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Civil rights movement===
{{Main|Civil rights movement|Montgomery bus boycott|Martin Luther King Jr.}}

The South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans: the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].

The Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during World War II. During this migration, Black people left the South to find work in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy.<ref>Katzman, 1996</ref>

The migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], the March on [[Selma, Alabama]], and the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King's "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]".  Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The [[Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument]] in Birmingham includes the [[Birmingham Civil Rights Institute]] which details Birmingham's role as the center of the Civil Rights Movement. The [[16th Street Baptist Church]] served as a rallying point for coordinating and carrying out the [[Birmingham campaign]]as well as the adjacent [[Kelly Ingram Park]] that served as ground zero for the infamous children's protest that eventually led to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] has been rededicated as a place of "Revolution and Reconciliation" and is now the setting of moving sculptures related to the battle for Civil Rights in the city, both are center pieces of the [[Birmingham Civil Rights District]]. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park]] in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King Jr.'s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center, location of Martin Luther and [[Coretta Scott King]]'s gravesites.

The Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow laws across the South. A second migration appears to be underway, with [[New Great Migration|African Americans from the North moving to the South]] in record numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5261746 |title = Tracking New Trends in Race Migration |work = [[News & Notes]] |accessdate = April 4, 2008 |date = March 14, 2006 |publisher = [[National Public Radio]] }}</ref> While race relations are still a contentious issue in the South, the region surpasses the rest of the country in many areas of integration and racial equality.

===Congress ends segregation (1964) and guarantees voting rights (1965)===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964|Voting Rights Act of 1965}}
The decisive action ending segregation came when Congress in bipartisan fashion overcame Southern filibusters to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].  A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954–1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, where shouted down by both sides and have limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organize massive demonstrations, that seiozed massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon.<ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/   ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle''  (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South.  National  attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators – and Connor arrested 900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations.<ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001)</ref><ref>Dewey W. Grantham, ''The South in Modern America'' (1994) 228-234.</ref>

Confrontations continued to escalate,  In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama  in June 1963 Governor [[George Wallace]] escalated the crisis by defying  court orders to admit the first two  black students to the University of Alabama.<ref>Dan T. Carter,''The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref> Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressman blocked any legislation.<ref>Robert E. Gilbert, "John F. Kennedy and civil rights for black Americans." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 12.3 (1982): 386-399. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27547837 Online]</ref> After Kennedy was assassinated President Lyndon Johnson called for immediate passage of Kennedy civil rights legislation as a memorial to the martyred president. Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader [[Everett Dirksen]] with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and The Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27.<ref>Garth E. Pauley, "Presidential rhetoric and interest group politics: Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 63.1 (1997): 1-19.</ref> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits does desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore, racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1963, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia, who became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia followed the new law as the business community realized that peaceful integration was the only way forward.<ref>Grantham, ''The South in Modern America '' (1994) 234-245.</ref><ref>David Garrow,  ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1989).</ref><ref>Jeanne Theoharis, ''A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History'' (2018).</ref><ref>For primary sources see   John A.

==Symbolism==
Some Southerners use the [[Confederate flag]] to identify themselves with the South, states' rights and Southern tradition.
Groups, such as the [[League of the South]], have a high regard for the secession movement of 1860, citing a desire to protect and defend Southern heritage.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://leagueofthesouth.com/corebeliefs/ |title = Core Beliefs Statement of The League of the South |accessdate = January 23, 2020 |date = June 1994 |publisher = [[League of the South]] }}</ref>  Numerous political battles have erupted over flying the Confederate flag over state capitols, and the naming of public buildings or highways after Confederate leaders, the prominence of certain statues, and the everyday display of Confederate insignia.<ref>Tony Horowitz, ''Confederates in the Attic'' (1998)</ref>

Other symbols of the South include the [[Bonnie Blue Flag]], [[magnolia]] trees, and the song "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERsyiUOYI4kC |title=Confederate Symbols |publisher=University Press of Florida |year=2000 |isbn=9780813017587 |editor-last=Martinez |editor-first=James Michael |editor-last2=Richardson |editor-first2=William Donald |editor-last3=McNinch-Su |editor-first3=Ron}}</ref>
