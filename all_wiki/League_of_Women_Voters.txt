{{Politics of the United States}}
The ''' League of Women Voters''' ('''LWV''') is a civic organization in the [[United States]] that was formed to help women take a larger role in public affairs after they won the right to vote. It was founded in 1920 to support the new women suffrage rights and was a merger of National Council of Women Voters, founded by [[Emma Smith DeVoe]], and [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], led by [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], approximately six months before the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] gave women the right to vote. The League of Women Voters began as a "mighty political experiment" aimed to help newly enfranchised women exercise their responsibilities as voters. Originally, only women could join the league; but in 1973 the charter was modified to include men. LWV operates at the local, state, and national level, with over 1,000 local and 50 state leagues, and one territory league in the U.S. Virgin Islands.<ref name=gun>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Gregg Lee|title=Guns in American Society: A-L|date=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576072684|page=352}}</ref>

The League of Women Voters is officially nonpartisan—it neither supports nor opposes candidates or parties. However, it does support a variety of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] public policy positions, including [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]], [[universal health care]], [[abortion rights]], [[climate change]] action and [[environmental regulation]], and [[gun control]].<ref name=gun/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Amy|title=Broward GOP activists claim "we had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website"|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/dec/03/broward-republican-executive-committee/broward-gop-activists-claim-we-had-liberal-league-/|access-date=February 6, 2015|work=PolitiFact Florida|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=December 3, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
In 1909, [[Emma Smith DeVoe]] proposed at the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) convention in [[Seattle]] that a separate organization be created to educate women on election processes and lobby for favorable legislation on women's issues. When her proposal was ignored, DeVoe founded the National Council of Women Voters in 1911. She recruited western suffragists and organizations to join the league.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Council of Women Voters |url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/ncwv/ |website=Washingtonhistory.org |publisher=Washington State Historical Society |accessdate=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123131009/http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/ncwv/ |archive-date=23 November 2018 |location=Tacoma, Washington |date=February 1, 1912}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=DeAngelis |first=Therese |title=Women's Rights on the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3rTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT67 |year=2014 |publisher=Mason Crest |location=Broomall, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-4222-9352-2 |page=67}}</ref>

Ten years later, prior to the 1919 Convention of the NAWSA (in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]), [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] began negotiating with DeVoe to merge her organization with a new league that would be the successor to the NAWSA. Catt was concerned that DeVoe's alignment with the more radical [[Alice Paul]] might discourage conservative women from joining the National Council of Women Voters and thus proposed the formation of a new league.  As fifteen states had already ratified the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]], the women wanted to move forward with a plan to educate women on the voting process and shepherd their participation.

Though not all members of either organization were in favor of a merger, a motion was made at the 1919 NAWSA convention to merge the two organizations into a successor, the National League of Women Voters. The merger was officially completed on 6 January 1920, though for the first year the league operated as a committee of the NAWSA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carrie Chapman Catt|url=http://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/carrie-chapman-catt|website=History.com|access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ross-Nazzal |first=Jennifer M. |title=Winning the West for Women: The Life of Suffragist Emma Smith DeVoe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRex0ocBj6QC&pg=PA163 |date=2011 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |location=Seattle, Washington |isbn=978-0-295-99086-6 |pages=163–165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Van Voris |first=Jacqueline |title=Carrie Chapman Catt: A Public Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA154 |date=1996 |publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-55861-139-9 |page=154}}</ref> The formal organization of the League was drafted at the 1920 Convention held in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Virginia Clark |title=The History of Woman Suffrage and the League of Women Voters in Cuyahoga County, 1911-1945 |url=http://teachingcleveland.org/history-of-woman-suffrage-and-league-of-women-voters-in-cuyahoga-county-1911-1945-by-virginia-clark-abbott/ |year=1949 |publisher=League of Women Voters |location=Cleveland, Ohio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205181521/http://teachingcleveland.org/history-of-woman-suffrage-and-league-of-women-voters-in-cuyahoga-county-1911-1945-by-virginia-clark-abbott/ |archive-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=925432053 |page=76}}</ref>

Local Leagues and state Leagues are organized in order to promote the purposes of the League and to take action on local and state governmental matters. These Leagues (chapters) have their own directors and officers. The national board may withdraw recognition from any state or local League for failure to fulfill recognition requirements.<ref name=bylaw />

==Chapters==
The League of Women Voters has state and local chapters in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Hong Kong.
