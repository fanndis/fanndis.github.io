'''RosUkrEnergo''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-registered venture company that transports [[natural gas]] from [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Eastern Europe|East European countries]]. 50% of the company is owned by [[Gazprom]], through its daughter Swiss-registered Rosgas Holding A.G., and another 50% by Swiss-registered private company Centragas Holding A.G., acting on behalf of a consortium of GDF Group<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://groupdf.com/about.asp |title=Official website of GDF group |access-date=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014054408/http://groupdf.com/about.asp |archive-date=2007-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.democracy.ru/article.php?id=1057 Сомнительный посредник - Демократия.Ру]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rusenergy.com/newssystem/opened/37/20060426/436603.htm |title=Стали известны хозяева РосУкрЭнерго |access-date=2007-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006152513/http://www.rusenergy.com/newssystem/opened/37/20060426/436603.htm |archive-date=2007-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/weekly01.asp?id=3638 |title=Emerging Markets Economic Briefings |access-date=2008-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327203719/http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/weekly01.asp?id=3638 |archive-date=2008-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> owned by [[Dmytro Firtash]] and {{ill|Ivan Fursin|uk|Фурсін Іван Геннадійович}}.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-241453.html UNIAN - Nemtsov: Russian part in RosUkrEnergo looks as improper as Ukrainian one]</ref>

Before the [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute]], it was the sole importer of natural gas from [[Gazprom]], reselling it to [[Naftogaz Ukrainy]]. Critics have questioned Gazprom's claimed need for RUE as a middleman. RUE has been accused of simply being “a corrupt intermediary” but has dismissed suggestions that Russian or Ukrainian politicians benefit from the arrangement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-ukraine-gas-rosukrenergo-sb-idUSTRE5021BN20090103|title=FACTBOX: RUE: A mystery player in Russia-Ukraine gas row|date=2009-01-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-12-08|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
The company was created in July 2004 in a deal by former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and his [[Russian President|Russian counterpart]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to replace [[Eural Trans Gas]].<ref name="timelineRosUkrEnergo">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96310/ Nation’s gas trade has volatile history rife with murky dealings], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 4, 2011)</ref> Until 2006 the company acted as a middleman between Turkmenistan and Ukraine. The company also sells Turkmenistan gas to [[Poland]]. Due to an agreement between Gazprom and Naftogaz, from 2006 till January 2009 the company supplied all of Ukraine's natural gas imports from [[Russia]] and other Central Asian countries, in addition to Turkmenistan. On October 24, 2008 [[Gazprom]] and Ukraine's national energy company [[Naftogaz]] signed a long-term cooperation deal in which was stated that Ukraine will receive Russian natural gas directly from Gazprom and Naftogaz will be the sole importer of Russian natural gas.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-280400.html Gazprom, Naftogaz sign long-term cooperation deal]</ref>

After weeks of disputes the head of Gazprom Alexei Miller and the head of [[Naftohaz Ukrainy]] [[Oleh Dubyna]] signed the 10-year agreement on natural gas supplies to Ukraine for the period of 2009-2019 on 19 January 2009.<ref name=UNA190109>

==Eural Trans Gas==
'''Eural Trans Gas''' ('''ETG''') was an energy company registered in [[Budapest]], Hungary, on December 6, 2002. It was suspected of acting as a [[Gazprom]] front. Andras Knopp, a former Hungarian communist cultural functionary with no knowledge of the gas business, became director of the company. The registered owner was Dmytro Firtash, an obscure Ukrainian national who reportedly had little if any known assets. Yet the person received almost $300 million in credits from Russian banks.<ref name="gazpromeuropeanweb">[http://ua-energy.org/uploads/library/analitics/FULL_GazpromsWeb.pdf Gazprom’s European Web]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Jamestown Foundation. February 2009.</ref>

ETG maintained an account at a Budapest branch of Vienna's [[Raiffeisen Bank]] and had a number of accounts in Vienna's [[Meinl Bank]].<ref name="gazpromeuropeanweb"/>

==Owners and allegations of criminal connections==
Former Ukrainian Prime-Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] stated in November 2006, the company is controlled by notorious Ukrainian-born [[Russian mafia]] boss [[Semion Mogilevich]],<ref>According to Tymoshenko ''"we have no doubts whatsoever that the man named [[Semyon Mogilevich|Mogilevich]] is behind the whole operation called RosUkrEnergo"'', see  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6121508.stm The High Price of Gas] by [[BBC News]] (aired November 5, 2006)</ref> while in 2009 Vladimir Putin was quoted as claiming that RosUkrEnergo is owned by a business ally of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/09/news/gazprom.php Russia and Ukraine reach pact on gas deliveries], International Herald Tribune, January 9, 2009</ref> The Ukrainian investigation into RosUkrEnergo begun during Tymoshenko's previous term as Prime Minister was closed after she lost her position as Prime Minister in September 2005.<ref>[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/303006.htm Mogilevich Arrested With Arbat Boss] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123010921/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/303006.htm |date=2009-01-23 }}, The Moscow Times, January 28, 2008</ref> According to a document uncovered during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] US-diplomats shared Tymoshenko's suspicions.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/91986/ U.S. official: Austrian bank’s ties to RosUkrEnergo suspicious], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 3, 2010)</ref>

In April 2006, London-based corruption watchdog [[Global Witness]] published a report focusing on RosUkrEnergo and other transit companies that have acted as intermediaries between Turkmenistan, Russia and Ukraine. The report highlighted the many links in personnel between RosUkrEnergo and the previous intermediary Eural Trans Gas. According to the report, Israeli lawyer Zeev Gordon had registered Eural Trans Gas on behalf of Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/296/its_a_gas_april_2006_lowres.pdf |title=It's a Gas—Funny Business in the Turkmen-Ukraine Gas Trade |access-date=2007-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044707/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/296/its_a_gas_april_2006_lowres.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Also in late April 2006, ''[[Izvestia]]'' reported that the primary shareholder of RosUkrEnergo is Dmytro Firtash. The report stated that he owned 90% of CentraGas Holding, equaling 45% of RosUkrEnergo. The report stated that a further owner is another Ukrainian businessman Ivan Fursin, the primary shareholder of the [[Odessa Film Studio]] and an owner of Misto-bank. His stake was revealed to be 10% of CentraGas and therefore a 5% owner of RosUkrEnergo.<ref>[http://izvestia.ru/economic/article3092391/ Известия.Ру: Кто владеет украинским газом]</ref>

==Profits==
RosUkrEnergo reported a 2005 profit of $755 million and paid $735 million in dividends.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business.html |title=ROSUKRENERGO - Business<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928230032/http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The company's 2006 profit is listed at over $785 million.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

RosUkrEnergo profit for January–September 2007 is reported at $213 million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gazprom.ru/articles/article26995.shtml |title=ОАО «Газпром» {{!}} Акционерам и инвесторам / Отчеты / Промежуточная финансовая отчетность 30.09.2007<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303025910/http://www.gazprom.ru/articles/article26995.shtml |archive-date=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The company makes its profit on re-exporting gas to Europe. The size of the profit is defined by Gazprom through the export allowances of about 9 billion cubic meters a year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business/financial_data.html |title=ROSUKRENERGO - Business - Financial data<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325051613/http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business/financial_data.html |archive-date=2008-03-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> RosUkrEnergo supplies gas to the Hungarian gas distributor [[Emfesz]], for example, which is also controlled by Firtash via his holding company [[Group DF]].

Effectively, by engaging in this supply scheme Gazprom transfers profits from its shareholders to the shareholders of RosUkrEnergo.
