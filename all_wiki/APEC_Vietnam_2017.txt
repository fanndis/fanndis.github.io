The Vietnamese [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (Vietnam)|Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism]] and the National Committee for APEC 2017 through the Agency for Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition organized a logo design contest for the APEC Vietnam 2017 summit. The contest ran from March to April 4, 2016 and was open to both amateur and professional Vietnamese artists. The organizers of the logo design contests required the entries to feature the phrase "APEC Vietnam 2017", highlight [[Vietnamese culture]], as well as to represent the five components of the 2017 summit which are dynamism, creativity, action, unity, and movement to the future.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vietnam organizes contest to select logo for APEC 2017|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/33705/vietnam-organizes-contest-to-select-logo-for-apec-2017|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Tuoi Tre News|date=13 March 2016}}</ref> 234 submissions from 92 candidates residing in 20 provinces and cities across Vietnam for the competition were received by the ministry.<ref name=logoselected>{{cite news|title=Official APEC 2017 logo selected|url=http://english.vov.vn/society/official-apec-2017-logo-selected-341674.vov|accessdate=19 March 2017|work=The Voice of Vietnam|agency=Vietnam News Agency|date=16 January 2017}}</ref>

The winning logo design was announced in January 2017. The selected design was conceptualized by a group working for Mark&B Vietnam, a branding agency. The winning logo depicts stylised images of paddles and Lạc birds, a common motif on drums of the ancient [[Đông Sơn culture]]. The placement of the elements suggest a circular movement which is meant to represent a "dynamic APEC".<ref name=logoselected/>

==Preparation==
A Round Table Meeting with the theme, "Stronger Joint Action for APEC's Shared Vision", was held in [[Hanoi]] on December 17, 2015 by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to discuss preparation efforts for the 2017 APEC Summit.<ref name=Vietnamprepares/>

The People's Committee of [[Đà Nẵng]], the host city of the Economic Leader's Meeting, approved a project to upgrade major roads in the city for the occasion. The project covered 34 streets in the city, with an estimated cost of around [[Vietnamese đồng|₫]]243 billion or US$10.9 million. The [[Da Nang International Airport]] was also scheduled for completion in March.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vietnam’s Da Nang to upgrade streets in preparation for 2017 APEC|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/33598/vietnams-da-nang-to-upgrade-streets-in-preparation-for-2017-apec|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Tuoi Tre News|date=7 March 2016}}</ref>

During the 4th National Committee for APEC 2017 on April 13, 2016 in Hanoi, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam [[Pham Binh Minh]] directed ministries and agencies to coordinate with other APEC member states especially [[Peru]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], the hosts of the [[APEC Peru 2016|2016]] and 2018 summits respectively.<ref name=deputypmrequests/>
