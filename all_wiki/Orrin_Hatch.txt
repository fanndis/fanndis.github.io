=== 2012 Senate election ===
{{Main|2012 United States Senate election in Utah}}
After the defeat of Utah's Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] in 2010, conjecture began as to whether six-term Senator Hatch would retire in 2012. It was also speculated that Congressman [[Jason Chaffetz]] would run against Hatch, though Chaffetz would later decline.

Having elected state delegates in mid-March, both the Democratic and Republican parties held conventions on April 21, with the possibilities to determine their nominees for the November general election. At the Republican convention, Hatch failed to get the 60% vote needed to clinch the Republican nomination, so he faced Liljenquist (the second-place winner) in the primary June 26.<ref name=April21ConvDeseret /> Hatch won the primary easily.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dennis Romboy |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586210/US-Sen-Orrin-Hatch-wins-Utah-Republican-primary.html |title=Sen.

=== 2016 presidential endorsements ===
In the 2016 presidential election, Hatch originally supported former Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] and later endorsed Florida Senator [[Marco Rubio]] once Bush ended his campaign. On May 12, 2016, after [[Donald Trump]] became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Hatch endorsed him.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hellmann|first1=Jessie|title=Hatch endorses Trump after meeting|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/279726-gop-sen-hatch-endorses-trump|accessdate=October 10, 2016|work=The Hill|date=May 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022022101/http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/279726-gop-sen-hatch-endorses-trump|archive-date=2016-10-22|url-status=live}}</ref> On May 27, 2016, after Trump suggested that a federal judge [[Gonzalo P.

In September 1989, Hatch was one of nine Republican senators appointed by Senate Republican Leader [[Robert Dole]] to negotiate a dispute with Democrats over the financing of President Bush's anti-drug plan that called for spending $7.8 billion by the following year as part of the president's efforts to address narcotics nationwide and abroad.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/09/14/Senate-drug-funding-dispute-threatens-money-bills/3024621748800/|title=Senate drug funding dispute threatens money bills|first=Steve|last=Gerstel|date=September 14, 1989|publisher=UPI|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125162802/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/09/14/Senate-drug-funding-dispute-threatens-money-bills/3024621748800/|archive-date=2018-11-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Anti-terrorism ====
[[File:HatchBush.jpg|thumb|Sen. Hatch visits at the White House with [[George W. Bush|Pres. Bush]] following the [[September 11 attacks]].]]
In 1995, Hatch was the leading figure behind the senate's [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|anti-terrorism bill]], to a large extent a response to the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]]. Elements of the bill were criticised by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and [[American Jewish Committee]] on civil liberties grounds, especially the new limits imposed on [[habeas corpus]] in capital cases.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Jewish Year Book, 1997|year=1997|publisher=American Jewish Committee|location=New York|isbn=0-87495-111-9|url=https://archive.org/details/americanjewishye00amer|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanjewishye00amer/page/146 146]}}</ref>

As a senior member of the [[Senate Select Intelligence Committee]], Hatch was also instrumental in the 2008 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. He said, "This bipartisan bill will help defeat terrorism and keep America safe. No, the legislation is not perfect, but it ensures that the increased expansion of the judiciary into foreign intelligence gathering doesn't unnecessarily hamper our intelligence community."<ref>{{cite press release |title=Hatch Lauds Passage of FISA Modernization Act |url=https://hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.View&PressRelease_id=0d432a46-1b78-be3e-e0e4-97855ddb539b |publisher=Orrin Hatch |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105013804/http://hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.View&PressRelease_id=0d432a46-1b78-be3e-e0e4-97855ddb539b |archive-date=2010-11-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Hatch voted in favor of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|2008 legislation]] that established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2008-213 |title=Senate Vote On Passage: H.R. 1424 [110th&#93;: Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 |publisher=Govtrack.us |date=October 1, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118084225/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2008-213 |archive-date=2012-01-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2011, Hatch said that he "probably made a mistake voting for it", and also claimed "at the time, we were in real trouble and it looked like we were ready for a [[economic depression|depression]].

==== Bank of Credit and Commerce International ====
{{Main|Bank of Credit and Commerce International}}

In January 1990, the federal judge in a case against the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) accepted a 1989 plea bargain offered to the bank by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. The bank was to pay $15 million in fines and only admit that it had laundered drug money. Afterward, Hatch presented an impassioned defense of the bank in a speech on the Senate floor. It had been largely written for him by the bank's attorney [[Robert A. Altman|Robert Altman]]. Hatch said, "The case arose from the conduct of a small number of B.C.C.I.'s more than 14,000 employees." Since 1989, Hatch and his aide, Michael Pillsbury, had been involved in efforts to counter the negative publicity that surrounded the bank. Hatch had also solicited the bank to approve a $10 million loan to a close friend, Monzer Hourani. In 1991, B.C.C.I. was shut down  after regulators accused it of one of the biggest international financial frauds in history. Law enforcement officials accused the bank of making bribes throughout the third world to arrange government deposits. [[Clark Clifford]], a former presidential advisor and Defense Secretary, and Altman, his law partner, were charged with taking bribes from B.C.C.I., in exchange for concealing its illegal ownership of First American Bankshares, a Washington holding company which Clifford chaired. Both had denied the charges, which were filed in  New York State and Federal courts.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/business/lawmaker-s-defense-of-bcci-went-beyond-speech-in-senate.html Lawmaker's Defense of B.C.C.I.

==== Energy ====

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch has investigated the use of what are known as Section 1603 grants and tax credits. The Section 1603 program was created in President [[Barack Obama]]'s 2009 stimulus package with the intention of subsidizing green energy production. Since 2009, the federal government has given out $25 billion in cash grants on behalf of the program. Hatch has investigated the program on several occasions. On June 9, 2016, his office requested from Department of Treasury, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the [[Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]] (TIGTA) details about how companies use the program. In March 2016, Hatch asked the IRS and Treasury Department to demonstrate that the agencies use safeguards and coordinate with each other when reviewing applications for Section 1603 grants. Per his June letter to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Jack Lew]], the agencies have cooperated with Hatch's investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-continues-inquiry-of-green-energy-programs|title=Hatch Continues Inquiry of Green Energy Programs|date=June 9, 2016|website=U.S. Senate Finance Committee|access-date=June 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813054115/http://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-continues-inquiry-of-green-energy-programs|archive-date=2016-08-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hatch has argued that the insurance mandate found in the legislation is not in the category that can be covered by the [[interstate commerce clause]] since it regulates the decision to engage in commercial activity rather than regulating the activity itself.

==== Immigration ====
Hatch was one of the architects and advocates of the expansion of [[H-1B visa]]s and has generally been an advocate of tougher enforcement immigration policy including voting for 1,500 new law enforcement agents to patrol the border. His 2010 Immigration Bill titled Strengthening Our Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's Security Act has received the support of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).<ref>{{cite web |last=Kephart |first=Janice |url=http://www.cis.org/kephart/hatch-bill |title=Senator Hatch Drops a Helpful and Thoughtful Border Security Bill |publisher=Center for Immigration Studies |date=October 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308100806/http://www.cis.org/kephart/hatch-bill |archive-date=2012-03-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also proposed the [[DREAM Act]], which would provide a pathway to citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, who were children when their parents came to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:SN01291: |title=Bill Summary & Status – 107th Congress (2001–2002) – S.1291 |publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218165321/http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:SN01291: |archive-date=2015-02-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Hatch critiqued President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to temporarily suspend immigration from seven Muslim countries until better screening methods are devised. He reflected on his own family's immigration history and described the order as placing "unnecessary burdens" on families.<ref name="Farber">{{cite web|last1=Farber|first1=Madeline|title=Here Are the Republicans Who Have Criticized President Trump's Immigration Ban|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/donald-trump-immigration-ban-republicans/|website=Fortune|accessdate=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130230747/http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/donald-trump-immigration-ban-republicans/|archive-date=2017-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref>

As ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hatch fought hard to get conservative judges nominated to the Supreme Court. He took a leading role in the Senate confirmation hearings of [[Clarence Thomas]] in October 1991. He was also a strong supporter of [[Jay Bybee]] during Bybee's confirmation hearings for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], stating "I've seen a lot of people around and a lot of judges and I don't know of anybody who has any greater qualifications or any greater ability in the law than you have."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=3614&updaterx=2009-04-25+02%3A15%3A24|title=The Real News|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170523/http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=3614&updaterx=2009-04-25+02:15:24|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_4194186| title=Hatch Says Democratic Win Could Help Terrorists| publisher=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]| date=August 17, 2006| accessdate=April 1, 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301174142/http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_4194186| archive-date=March 1, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Nevertheless, in 1993, Hatch recommended [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], whom he knew personally, to President [[Bill Clinton]] to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, even as he knew she was a political liberal. Clinton had not previously considered Ginsburg, and Hatch, as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, assured him that a Ginsburg confirmation would go smoothly.<ref>{{cite book|first=Orrin|last=Hatch|title=Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen Senator|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/squarepegconfess00hatc_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Basic Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/squarepegconfess00hatc_0/page/180 180]|isbn=0465028675}}</ref>

With regards to the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|Senate filibuster]] being used to stall President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointments]], Hatch voted against the [[Nuclear option#Use of nuclear option during Obama presidency|November 2013 reforms]], which eliminated the use of the filibuster on executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html|title=In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster|work=New York Times|first=Jeremy W.|last=Peters|date=November 21, 2013|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131040651/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html|archive-date=2019-01-31|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2014, Hatch argued that the filibuster should be restored, saying: "We should get it back to where it was.

As an opponent of the confirmation of [[Merrick Garland]], Hatch submitted to the ''[[Deseret News]]'' an opinion piece stating that, after meeting with Garland, his opinion on blocking Garland had not changed; the piece was published prior to Hatch's meeting with Garland.<ref name=anachronism>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-garland-idUSKCN0YH26W Oops!

==== Intellectual property ====

Hatch has long been a proponent of expanding [[intellectual property]] rights, and introduced the Senate version of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] in 1997.<ref name=copyright>Orrin Hatch, "Toward a Principled Approach to Copyright Legislation at the Turn of the Millennium". ''University of Pittsburgh Law Review'' 59 (1998), pp. 719–57.</ref> Hatch believes intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators.<ref name=copyright />

Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003 by proposing that [[copyright]] owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of [[copyright infringement]], including [[file sharing]], he stated that "This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2003-06-18-hatch-wants-computers-dead_x.htm |title=Senator takes aim at illegal downloads |work=USA Today |date=June 19, 2003}}</ref> In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch's official website was using an unlicensed [[JavaScript]] menu from [[United Kingdom]]-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that "We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms." Shortly after the publication of that story in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, the company that runs Hatch's website contacted Milonic to start registration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Orrin Hatch, Software Pirate?|first=Leander|last=Kahney|url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59305,00.html|work=Wired|date=June 19, 2003|accessdate=April 2, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182237/http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59305,00.html|archive-date=2007-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>* Leonard Pitts, ''Computer-destroying idea might have some merit'', [[Chicago Tribune]], (June 24, 2003).

So I guess he'd be just as happy to see it melted into a steaming plastic heap or dropped from the top of a very tall building. The main point is that your computer ceases to exist."''</ref>

On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the [[Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act]] (COICA). This bill would authorize the [[United States Department of Justice]] to blacklist and censor all websites that the department deemed to be dedicated to "infringing activities".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jaikumar |last=Vijayan |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9188618/Online_IP_protection_bill_sparks_outrage |title=Online IP protection bill sparks outrage |work=Computerworld |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142147/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9188618/Online_IP_protection_bill_sparks_outrage |archive-date=2012-01-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2012, Hatch recommended and supported District Court Judge [[Robert J.

In April 2013, Hatch stated that he viewed [[same-sex marriage]] as "undermining the very basis of marital law", but declined to support a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] and endorsed same-sex couples' right to form a [[civil union]], stating that the law should "give gay people the same rights as married people".<ref>{{cite news |first=Neal |last=Broverman |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/politicians/2013/04/08/utah-sen-orrin-hatch-comes-out-civil-unions |title=Utah Sen.

==== Nuclear testing ====

During Hatch's first year in the Senate in 1977, reporter Gordon Eliot White of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' published the first of what would be a lengthy series of articles detailing government malfeasance in atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Over the next 13 years White's articles detailed how the government determined to proceed with the tests, and with mining and refining, without adequate safeguards for innocent citizens whose health would be damaged. Though Hatch feared an investigation would endanger the nation's nuclear deterrence versus the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], by 1979 he was pushing for hearings on the issue before the Senate Labor Committee. Hatch prevailed on Committee Chairman [[Ted Kennedy]] to hold field hearings in Utah in 1980. At the end of 1980, Hatch was positioned to chair the committee himself.

By 1984, Hatch had held a dozen hearings, passed legislation requiring scientific investigation of the injuries and had enlisted the aid of the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Cancer Institute]], but still could not muster the votes to get a bill. When a vote was obtained in the Senate in 1985 (as an amendment to a bill to compensate Pacific Islanders for nuclear tests in the 1950s), it failed by a handful of votes.<ref name="DeseretNews-19901028">{{cite news |title=Justice For Fallout Victims Has Been Long Time Coming |author=Gordon Eliot White |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/129343/JUSTICE-FOR-FALLOUT-VICTIMS-HAS-BEEN-LONG-TIME-COMING.html |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=October 28, 1990 |accessdate=February 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022162648/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/129343/JUSTICE-FOR-FALLOUT-VICTIMS-HAS-BEEN-LONG-TIME-COMING.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> Hatch discovered a clause in the proposed Treaty of Peace and Friendship with [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]] to pay at least $100 million to residents of the [[Marshall Islands]] for injuries similar to those of Utahns, and Hatch took the treaty hostage. His hold on consideration of the treaty eventually got agreement from the Reagan administration to agree not to oppose radiation compensation for Utah citizens, but it still took another five years to get the bill through. The [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] of 1990 provided compensation for citizens injured by radioactive fallout from the tests.<ref name="DeseretNews-19901028" />

In December 2010, Hatch was one of twenty-six senators who voted against the ratification of [[New START|New Start]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Memmott |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/22/132262684/senate-ratifies-start |title=Senate Ratifies START |publisher=npr.org |date=22 December 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>  a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when [[START I]] expired the previous year.

Hatch introduced the [[Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act]], narrowing the broad authority of the DEA to suspend drug "manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/483?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Ensuring+Patient+Access+and+Effective+Drug+Enforcement+Act.%22%5D%7D&r=1|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=December 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034626/https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/483?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Ensuring+Patient+Access+and+Effective+Drug+Enforcement+Act.%22%5D%7D&r=1|archive-date=2017-12-16|url-status=live}}</ref> Hatch stated the  bill was also written to protect patients from disruptions in the production and delivery of their prescription drugs: "The fact that prescription drugs can be abused should not prevent patients from receiving the medications they need. This bill takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse by clarifying penalties for manufacturing or dispensing outside approved procedures while helping to ensure that supply chains to legitimate users remain intact".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hatch and Whitehouse's Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act Passes Senate|url=https://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/releases?ID=4AD21F6A-DAA6-4865-8F4A-4A93AA3FA321|website=Orrin Hatch United States Senator for Utah|accessdate=December 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213000538/https://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/releases?ID=4AD21F6A-DAA6-4865-8F4A-4A93AA3FA321|archive-date=2017-12-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill passed the Senate unanimously<ref>{{cite web|title=Hatch and White House's Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act Passes Senate|url=https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/hatch-and-whitehouses-ensuring-patient-access-and-effective-drug-enforcement-act-passes-senate|website=Shelodon Whitehouse United States Senator for Rhode Island|accessdate=December 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227122220/https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/hatch-and-whitehouses-ensuring-patient-access-and-effective-drug-enforcement-act-passes-senate|archive-date=2017-12-27|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Tom Marino]] passed a version of the bill in the House<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.

==== Other issues ====

In 1980, Hatch spoke in favor of rolling back provisions of the [[Fair Housing Act]] enforced by the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]]. Acting on his motion in 1988, Congress eventually voted to weaken the ability of plaintiffs to prosecute cases of discriminatory treatment in housing. At the time the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments were being debated, he introduced a bill endorsed by the National Association of Realtors to severely limit who can file anti-discrimination suits and to make the proceedings a private affair.

In 1999, Hatch called for a federal probe into manufacturers of [[Video game controversies|violent video games]], and proposed making the existing voluntary rating system for video games ([[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]) mandatory by federal law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/694981/Hatch-assails-violent-games.html?pg=all|title=Hatch assails violent games|date=May 4, 1999|newspaper=DeseretNews.com|access-date=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117064143/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/694981/Hatch-assails-violent-games.html?pg=all|archive-date=2016-11-17|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hatch pushed legislation for the [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]], which would amend Article 2, Section I, Clause 5 of the [[United States Constitution]]. This amendment would allow anyone who has been a U.S. citizen for twenty years to seek the presidency or vice-presidency.

A vocal supporter of [[stem cell research]], Hatch was one of 58 senators who signed a letter directed to President [[George W. Bush]], requesting the relaxing of federal restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. In 2010, Hatch's bill was reauthorized which allowed stem cells from umbilical cords to be used to find treatment options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3751/show|title=S.3751 – Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010|publisher=OpenCongress|accessdate=January 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206172538/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3751/show|archive-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, Hatch was criticized for comments he made suggesting that the rich have an unfair financial burden in the current tax system.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McAuliff|first1=Michael|title=Orrin Hatch Rips 'Perverse' Tax System That Spares Lower Middle Class (VIDEO)|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/11/orrin-hatch-tax-system_n_895186.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=July 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107183748/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/11/orrin-hatch-tax-system_n_895186.html|archive-date=2014-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2013, Hatch commented on a [[G8]] proposal that tax authorities in the world's largest economies openly share information among themselves in order to fight [[tax evasion]]. The proposal has strong suggestions about ways to make companies more transparent and governments more accountable for their tax policies. Hatch stated that transparency is always a good thing, but he would like to see a bill before giving any support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/gang-of-eight-tax-call-congress-93009.html |title=G-8 tax call won't be answered quickly on Hill |last1=Snell |first1=Kelsey |last2=French |first2=Lauren |date=June 19, 2013 |work=Politico |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181446/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/gang-of-eight-tax-call-congress-93009.html |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2018, over the Judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court controversy, Hatch said that it did not matter even if Kavanaugh did what his accusers alleged was true. Hatch said, "If that was true, I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today. That's the issue. Is this judge a really good man? And he is. And by any measure he is.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151274/orrin-hatch-offers-confusing-defense-brett-kavanaugh|title=Orrin Hatch offers confusing defense of Brett Kavanaugh.|date=2018-09-17|website=The New Republic|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206005429/https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151274/orrin-hatch-offers-confusing-defense-brett-kavanaugh|archive-date=2018-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hatch voted for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1999, saying "committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office...

In April 2018, Hatch was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Steve Mnuchin]] and acting Secretary of State [[John J. Sullivan (diplomat)|John Sullivan]] expressing "deep concern" over a report by the [[United Nations]] exposing "North Korean sanctions evasion involving [[Russia]] and [[China]]" and asserting that the findings "demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue, tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people" while calling it "imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by [[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] and his forces, and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/383085-key-senators-warn-trump-of-north-korea-effort-on-syria|title=Key senators warn Trump of North Korea effort on Syria|date=April 13, 2018|work=The Hill|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105201009/https://thehill.com/policy/defense/383085-key-senators-warn-trump-of-north-korea-effort-on-syria|archive-date=2019-01-05|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Judd Gregg]]'s 2011 retirement created a [[domino]] effect among high-profile Senate Republicans: [[Jeff Sessions]] took his spot as Ranking Republican on the [[Senate Budget Committee]]; [[Chuck Grassley]] in turn took his spot on the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], and Hatch took the top Republican spot on the [[Senate Finance Committee]].

=== Lobbying ties ===
Hatch's son [[Scott Hatch]] was formerly a partner and registered lobbyist at Walker, Martin & Hatch LLC, a Washington lobbying firm. The firm was formed in 2001 with Jack Martin, a staff aide to Hatch for six years, and H. Laird Walker, described as a close associate of the senator.<ref name="WT=2March2009">{{cite news|title=Sen.

In March 2009, the ''[[Washington Times]]'' reported that the pharmaceutical industry, which has benefited from Hatch's legislative efforts, had previously unreported connections to Hatch. In 2007, five pharmaceutical companies and the industry's main trade association, [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), donated $172,500 to the Utah Families Foundation—a charitable foundation which Hatch helped start in the 1990s and has continued to support since. Walker, Martin & Hatch LLC was paid $120,000 by PhRMA in 2007 to lobby Congress on pending [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] legislation.<ref name="WT=2March2009" />
