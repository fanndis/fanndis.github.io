'''Public relations''' ('''PR''') is the practice of deliberately managing the release and spread of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the [[General public|public]] in order to affect the public perception. Public relations (PR) and publicity differ in that PR is controlled internally, whereas [[publicity]] is not controlled and contributed by external parties.<ref>{{citation|last1=Grunig|first1=James E|last2=Hunt|first2=Todd|title=Managing Public Relations|location=Orlando, FL|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1984|edition= 6th}}</ref> Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.<ref>{{citation|last=Seitel|first=Fraser P.|title=The Practice of Public Relations. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|year= 2007|edition= 10th}}</ref> This differentiates it from [[advertising]] as a form of [[marketing communications]]. Public relations aims to create or obtain coverage for clients for free, also known as 'earned media', rather than paying for [[marketing]] or advertising. But in the early 21st century, advertising is also a part of broader PR activities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306758|title=#10 Important Trends in PR that You Can't Afford to Ignore|last=Singh|first=Honey|date=2017-12-29|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref>

An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article.<ref>{{cite web|title = What You Need to Get a Job in Public Relations After College - AfterCollege|url = http://blog.aftercollege.com/2014/need-get-job-public-relations-college/#sthash.m6uq8xLi.dpuf|accessdate = 2015-09-28|date = 5 March 2014}}</ref> The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders, and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its [[leadership]], products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, [[businesses]] and [[companies]], [[government]], and [[official|public officials]] as [[public information officer]]s and [[nongovernmental organizations]], and [[nonprofit organizations]]. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.<ref>{{cite web|title = Career Overview: Public Relations - Wetfeet.com|url = https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|accessdate = 2015-09-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929184702/https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|archive-date = 29 September 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organization's target [[audience]], the [[mass media|media]], relevant trade media, and other [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]]. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing [[press releases]] and other content for [[news]], working with the [[News media|press]], arranging [[interview]]s for company spokespeople, writing [[speech]]es for company leaders, acting as an organisation's [[spokesperson]], preparing clients for [[press conferences]], media interviews and speeches, writing [[website]] and [[social media]] content, managing company reputation ([[crisis management]]), managing [[internal communications]], and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management.<ref>{{citation|last= Rubel|first= Gina F.|title= Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers|location=Doylestown, PA|edition=  1st|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9801719-0-7}}</ref> Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders.

== Definitions ==
[[Ivy Lee]], the man who turned around the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]] name and image, and his friend, [[Edward Bernays|Edward Louis Bernays]], established the first definition of public relations in the early 20th century as follows: "a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780321510075|url-access=registration|quote=a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance.|title=PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences|last=Breakenridge|first=Deirdre|author-link=Deirdre Breakenridge|date=2008-03-26|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780132703970}}</ref> However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the United Transit Commission, he said "I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do."<ref name="twoway"/> In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be "disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field."<ref name="twoway">{{cite book

According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public's consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.<ref>Edward Bernays, "The New Propagandists," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 38.</ref>

In August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as <blockquote>"the art and [[social science]] of analyzing [[fad|trends]], predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the [[public interest]]."<ref>Jensen Zhao. Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd. Ed. Retrieved from  [https://archive.is/20120713012953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5209/is_1999/ai_n19125848/ findarticles.com]</ref></blockquote>

In 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: 
<blockquote>"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/public-relations-a-topic-that-is-tricky-to-define.html |author= Stuart Elliot| title=Public Relations Defined, After an Energetic Public Discussion|date=1 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref></blockquote>

Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing [[communication]] between an organization and its publics.<ref>Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations.

==History==
{{main|History of public relations}}
Public relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. Academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations. such as Aristotle’s rhetoric which explains the core foundations of persuasion. It is believed that there is an evolutionary aspect to PR, and that it only has improved over time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myers|first=Cayce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzHwDwAAQBAJ&q=public+relations+history&pg=PT7|title=Public Relations History: Theory, Practice, and Profession|date=2020-07-29|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-03300-8|language=en}}</ref> Evidence shows that it continued to evolve during the settling of the [[New World]] and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the [[United Kingdom]] for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The concept of propaganda, which later evolved into Public Relations was used by the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars. World War I was the first war which affected not only military but whole populations and is considered to be "modern propaganda's launching pad."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Martin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC|title=Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda|last2=Manning|first2=Martin|last3=Romerstein|first3=Herbert|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29605-5|language=en}}</ref> This led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe modern day public relations was first established in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall Plan|Marshall plan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In the second half of the 1900s, public relations entered an era of professional development. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Tactics ==
Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as "discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing [[rhetorical]] strategies to achieve managerial aims."<ref name="L'Etang2004">{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2 September 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}</ref>

Specific public relations disciplines include:
* Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy
* [[Consumer]]/[[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service
* [[Crisis communication]] – responding in a crisis
* [[Internal communications]] – communicating within the company itself
* [[Government relations]] – engaging government departments to influence public policy
* [[Media relations]] – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.
*[[Social media marketing|Social Media/Community Marketing]] - in today's climate, public relations professionals leverage social media marketing to distribute messages about their clients to desired target markets
*In-house public relations – a public relations professional hired to manage press and publicity campaigns for the company that hired them.

Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual's audiences has a central role in doing public relations.<ref>{{citation|first=David|last=Phillips|year=2006|title=Towards relationship management: Public relations at the core of organizational development|journal=Journal of Communication Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|doi=10.1108/13632540610664751}}</ref><ref>Kamau, C.

Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}</ref> After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.

Within each discipline, typical activities include [[pseudo-event|publicity events]], speaking opportunities, [[press releases]], [[newsletters]], [[blog]]s, [[social media]], press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.

=== Audience targeting ===
A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the [[target audience]] and to tailor messages that are relevant to each audience.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Target audience|title=Key concepts in public relations|page=[https://archive.org/details/keyconceptsinpub0000unse/page/227 227]|first1=Bob|last1=Franklin|first2=Mike|last2=Hogan|first3=Quentin|last3=Langley|first4=Nick|last4=Mosdell|first5=Elliot|last5=Pill|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2318-7|year=2009|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/keyconceptsinpub0000unse/page/227}}</ref> Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.<ref>Smith, Ronald D. Strategic Planning for Public Relations. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002. Print.</ref>

On the other hand, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue.<ref>{{citation|title=The Stakeholder Approach Revisited|first=R Edward|last=Freeman|year=2004|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag|volume=5|issue=3|pages=228–241|journal=Zeitschrift für Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik|doi=10.5771/1439-880X-2004-3-228|s2cid=158039195|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bc20491c2def35375c65db180b192a10c745c3ba}}</ref> All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the [[charitable organization|charity]] and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.<ref>Andrews, Mark. "Climate Change and Public Relations."

=== The public in public relations ===
The public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:

* '''''Traditional Publics''''': Groups with which the individual has an ongoing and long-term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers<ref name=":0">{{Citation |title=Public relations : a values-driven approach|last=David.|first=Guth|date=2012|publisher=Allyn & Bacon|others=Marsh, Charles, 1955-|isbn=9780205811809|edition= 5th|location=Boston|oclc=660088137}}</ref>
* '''''Non-Traditional Publics''''': Groups that are typically unfamiliar with the organization and the individual has not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Latent Publics''''': A group whose values have come into contact with the values of the organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Aware Publics''''': A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.
* '''''Intervening Publics''''': Any public that helps an individual send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Primary Publics:''''' If a public can directly affect an organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Secondary Publics''''': Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Internal Publics''''': People within an organization<ref name=":0" />
* '''''External Publics''''': People outside of an organization<ref name=":0" />
* '''''Domestic Publics''''': Those within the country<ref name=":0" />
* '''''International Publics''''': Those outside of the country and when communicating with this publics individuals must be wary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.<ref name=":0" />

Early literature authored by [[James E. Grunig|James Grunig]] (1978) suggested that publics develop in stages determined by their levels of problem recognition, constraint recognition and involvement in addressing the issue. The theory posited that publics develop in the following stages:

* '''''Non-Publics''':'' Share no issue with an organisation.
* '''''Latent Publics''': F''ace an issue but do not recognize it''.''
* '''''Apathetic Publics''':'' Face an issue but do not care to address it.
* '''''Aware Publics''':'' Face an issue but are unorganised to mobilise against it. 
* '''''Active Publics''':'' Face an issue and are organised to respond to it.

=== Messaging ===
Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.

=== Social media marketing ===
{{Main|Digital marketing}}
Digital marketing is the use of [[Internet]] tools and technologies such as [[search engines]], Web 2.0 social bookmarking, [[new media]] relations, [[blogging]], and [[social media marketing]]. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.

PR practitioners have always relied on the media such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that "Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place".<ref>Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., & Kelly, K. (2009). New media: A critical introduction. (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.</ref>
 
Social media platforms enable users to connect with audiences to build brands, increase sales, and drive website traffic. This involves publishing content on social media profiles, engaging with followers, analyzing results, and running social media advertisements. The goal is to produce content that users will share with their social network to help a company increase brand exposure and broaden customer reach. Some of the major social media platforms are currently Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=Margaret |title=Social Media Marketing (SMM) |url=https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/social-media-marketing-SMM |website=WhatsIt.com |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref>

As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. 
# ''Engagement'': Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments). 
# ''Impressions'': Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.
# ''Items'': Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.
# ''Mentions'': Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.
# ''Reach'': Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/BusinessCase/MeasurementStandarization/#.VdZtN1WrTmE|title=PR Measurement Standardization: Moving Toward Industry Agreement: PRSA|first=Arthur|last=Yann}}</ref>

=== Types of public relations arenas ===
Publicists can work in a host of different types of business verticals such as entertainment, technology, music, travel, television, food, consumer electronics and more. Many publicists build their career in a specific business space to leverage relationships and contacts. There are different kinds of press strategies for such as B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to consumer). Business to business publicity highlights service providers who provide services and products to other businesses. Business to Consumer publicizes products and services for regular consumers, such as toys, travel, food, entertainment, personal electronics and music.

=== Other techniques ===
[[Litigation public relations]] is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client's overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

== Ethics ==
Public relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.<ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006">Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein, " Introduction: Towards a Definitional Framework for Responsible Advocacy," in Ethics in Public Relations, Responsible Advocacy, ed. Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein (USA: Sage Publications, Inc. 2006), ix.</ref> In 2000, the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics "advocacy" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.<ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"/>

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.<ref name="Marshall2002">{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Tim|title=Ethics – Who needs them?|journal=Journal of Communication Management|volume=7|issue=2|year=2002|pages=107–112|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540310807313}}</ref> The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]], the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]]'s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.<ref name="journal">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|title = Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?| journal=Journal of Communication Management| volume=9| pages=56–64|year = 2005|last1 = Tobin|first1 = Natasha}}</ref> Individuals in public relations are growing increasingly concerned with their company's marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company's social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, individuals in marketing are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.<ref>Kermani, Faiz and Alan Needham. Marketing and Public Relations. Marlow: Institute of Clinical Research, 2006. N. pag. Print.</ref>

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.<ref>{{citation|first=Scott|last=Cutlip|author-link=Scott Cutlip|year=1994|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1464-4}}</ref>

Marketing and communications strategist, Ira Gostin, believes there is a code of conduct when conducting business and using public relations. Public relations specialists have the ability to influence society. Fact-checking and presenting accurate information is necessary to maintain credibility with employers and clients.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gostin|first=Ira|title=Council Post: Reflecting On Ethics And Doing The Right Thing As Professionals|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/10/reflecting-on-ethics-and-doing-the-right-thing-as-professionals/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

=== Public Relation Code of Ethics ===
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

* '''''Advocacy''''': Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.
* '''''Honesty''''': Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.
* '''''Expertise''''': To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research and education. Meanwhile, professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.
* '''''Independence''''': Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.
* '''''Loyalty''''': Stay devoted to the client while remembering that there is a duty to still serve the public interest.
* '''''Fairness''''': Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/|title=Code of Ethics - Public Relations Society of America|work=Public Relations Society of America|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>

=== Spin ===
{{Main|Spin (public relations)}}
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a "polishing of the truth."<ref name="Safire96"/> Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spin|title=spin|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.<ref name="Safire96">Safire, William
(1996) [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html?scp=19&sq=spin%20definition&st=cse ''The Spinner Spun'']</ref> Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.<ref>[http://donhalepr.com/?p=163 Spin Doctor a Derogatory Term That Needs to Go, Dilenschneider Says]. Don Hale PR. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref><ref>[http://blog.prnewswire.com/2012/02/17/dear-gracie-is-flack-a-four-letter-word/ Dear Gracie: Is ‘Flack’ a Four-Letter Word? | Beyond PR]. Blog.prnewswire.com (17 February 2012). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref> Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called "spin doctors."

In [[Stuart Ewen]]'s ''PR! A Social History of Spin'', he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.<ref>W. Timothy Coombs and Sherry J. Holladay, "Does Society Need Public Relations? Criticisms of Public Relations" in It's Not Just PR: Public Relations in Society, (Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007), 10.</ref>

According to [[Jim Hoggan]], " public relations is not by definition 'spin'. Public relations is the art of building good relationships. You do that most effectively by earning trust and goodwill among those who are important to you and your business... Spin us to public relations what manipulation is to interpersonal communications. It's a diversion whose primary effect is ultimately to undermine the central goal of building trust and nurturing a good relationship."<ref>Hoggan, J., Littlemore, R., & Canadian Electronic Library. (2009). Climate cover-up : The crusade to deny global warming / James Hoggan and Richard Littlemore. (DesLibris. Books collection). Vancouver [B.C.]: Greystone Books.</ref>

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ([[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]), the so-called "[[non-denial denial]]," phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, [[euphemism]]s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

=== Negative ===
{{see also|Negative campaigning}}
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing "Black PR", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or [[corporate identity]]. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on [[IT security]], [[industrial espionage]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and [[competitive intelligence]]. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.<ref>Wattenberg, Martin P. (22 August 1996).

=== T.A.R.E.S. ===
The T.A.R.E.S. is a five-point test that evaluates ethical persuasion and provides boundaries in persuasive practices.

* '''''Truthfulness''''' (of the message) examples
** Is this communicating something factually true and accurate?
** Does this downplay or diminish evidence?
** Am I creating a false narrative or image?
** Does this influence people to believe something that I do not believe myself?
* '''''Authenticity''''' (of the persuader) examples
** Will people question my honesty or integrity from this?
** Do I truly believe that what is being presented will benefit those who are reading?
** Do I support or advocate in the statement, person, or product?
* '''''Respect''''' (for the persuadee) examples
** Am I presenting statements in self-interest, or do I genuinely care about the issue, person, or product?
** Is this presented to persuadees who are rational, self-thinking beings?
** What ethical responsibility do I hold by presenting this information?
* '''''Equity''''' (of the persuasive appeal) examples
** Is this appeal fair and nondiscriminatory?
** Have I target persuadees who are not capable of understanding the claims and the context?
** Are the statements I present sensitive to various interests, needs, or concerns of the persuadees? 
* '''''Social Responsibility''''' (for the common good) examples
** Have I unfairly stereotyped groups of society in my statements or actions?
** Will my statements or actions cause harms to various groups of society?
** Will there be any negative consequences against a group in society based on my statements or actions? 
** Have I fairly presented issues that concern groups who may have been underrepresented in society? 
** Are the statements or actions that are being communicated responsible to various societal groups, public interest, and the public?<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Sherry|last2=Martinson|first2=David L.|year=2001|title=The TARES Test: Five Principles for Ethical Persuasion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233168773|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Research Gate}}</ref>

=== Politics and civil society ===
In ''[[Propaganda (book)|Propaganda]]'' (1928), [[Edward Bernays|Bernays]] argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/EdwardLBernays-Propaganda Edward Bernays ''Propaganda'' (1928) p. 10]</ref> In public relations, [[lobby groups]] are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or [[public opinion]], typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.

In fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the 'mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals.<ref>Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 10.</ref> In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an 'invisible government' to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.<ref>Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 11.</ref>

When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a [[front group]].<ref>See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, ''Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect'', Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000).</ref> Front groups are a form of [[astroturfing]], because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.

Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies and even personalities to their best advantages.<ref>{{citation|title=On the Record: Politics, Politicians and Power|first=Laurie|last=Oakes|page=191|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Australia|isbn=978-0-7336-2700-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Yanick|date=2018-01-02|title=Ethical Decision Making and Reputation Management in Public Relations|journal=Journal of Media Ethics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=2–13|doi=10.1080/23736992.2017.1401931|s2cid=158618395|issn=2373-6992|url=http://archipel.uqam.ca/12464/1/Ethical%20Decision%20Making%20and%20Reputation%20Management%20in%20Public%20Relations.pdf}}</ref>
