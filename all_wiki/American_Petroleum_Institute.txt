The '''American Petroleum Institute''' ('''API''') is the largest U.S. [[industry trade group|trade association]] for the oil and natural gas industry. It claims to represent nearly 600 corporations involved in [[extraction of petroleum|production]], [[oil refinery|refinement]], [[pipeline transport|distribution]], and many other aspects of the [[petroleum industry]].

The association describes its mission as ''to promote safety across the industry globally and influence [[public policy]] in support of a strong, viable [[Petroleum in the United States|U.S. oil and natural gas industry]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Industry Mission|url=https://www.api.org:443/about/industry-mission|access-date=2020-07-01|website=www.api.org|language=en}}</ref> API's chief functions on behalf of the industry include [[advocacy]], [[negotiation]] and [[Fossil fuels lobby|lobbying]] with governmental, legal, and regulatory agencies; [[research]] into economic, toxicological, and [[Environmental issue|environmental effects]]; establishment and certification of [[technical standard|industry standard]]s; and [[education outreach]].<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/aboutapi/ |title=About API |publisher=American Petroleum Institute |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> API both funds and conducts research related to many aspects of the petroleum industry.<ref name="about" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.api.org:443/about/president-and-ceo|title=API President and CEO|website=www.api.org|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|Petroleum industry|Petroleum in the United States}}
[[File:American Petroleum Institute logo.svg|thumb|Previous logo]]
Although some oil was produced commercially before 1859 as a byproduct from salt brine wells, the [[American oil industry]] started on a major scale with the discovery of oil at the [[Drake Well]] in western Pennsylvania in 1859.

The American Petroleum Institute was founded on 20 March 1919 and based in [[New York City]].<ref name=history>[http://www.api.org/globalitems/globalheaderpages/~/link.aspx?_id=9C594CAB469847F5B6932F13813812D4&_z=z "API history"], American Petroleum Institute (page visited on 2 January 2018).</ref>

In 1959, at a symposium organized by the American Petroleum Institute and the [[Columbia Graduate School of Business]] for the centennial of the American oil industry, the [[physicist]] [[Edward Teller]] warned then of the danger of global [[climate change]].<ref name=Franta/> Edward Teller explained that carbon dioxide "in the atmosphere causes a [[greenhouse effect]]" and that burning more [[fossil fuels]] could "melt the icecap and submerge New York".<ref name=Franta>Benjamin Franta, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/01/on-its-hundredth-birthday-in-1959-edward-teller-warned-the-oil-industry-about-global-warming "On its 100th birthday in 1959, Edward Teller warned the oil industry about global warming"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 January 2018 (page visited on 2 January 2018).</ref>

In 1969, the API decided to move its offices to [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=history/>

==Standards and certification==

API also defines the industry standard for the energy conservation of [[motor oil]]. '''API SN''' is the latest specification to which motor oils intended for spark-ignited engines should adhere since 2010. It supersedes '''API SM'''.<ref name="sm">{{cite web|title=Engine Oil Guide|url=http://www.api.org/~/media/files/certification/engine-oil-diesel/publications/mom_guide_english_2013.pdf|publisher=American Petroleum Institute|date=March 2010}}</ref>

API also defines and drafts standards for measurement for manufactured products such as:

* Precision [[thread gauge]]s
* Plain plug and [[ring gauge]]s
* Thread measuring systems
* Metrology and industrial supplies
* Measuring instruments
* Custom gauges
* Precision machining and grinding
* [[ISO/IEC 17025|ISO 17025]] registered calibration

API RP 500 and RP 505 classify the locations for [[electrical equipment in hazardous areas]].<ref>
API RP 505  Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Zone 0, Zone 1 and Zone 2 (2002).</ref><ref>API RP 500 Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2.</ref>

API has entered petroleum industry nomenclature in a number of areas:

* [[API gravity]], a measure of the density of petroleum.
* [[API number]], a unique identifier applied to each petroleum exploration or production well drilled in the United States.
* API unit, a standard measure of natural [[Formation evaluation gamma ray|gamma radiation]] measured in a borehole.<ref>[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/a/api_unit.aspx API Unit], Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, accessed 11 Nov. 2015.</ref>

==Educator intervention==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
In addition to training industry workers and conducting seminars, workshops, and conferences on public policy, API develops and distributes materials and curricula for schoolchildren and educators. The association also maintains a website, Classroom Energy. {{Third-party inline|date=December 2016}}

==Public relations and lobbying==
{{See also|Fossil fuels lobby}}

API spent more than $3 million annually during the period 2005 to 2009 on [[lobbying]]; $3.6 million in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=American+Petroleum+Institute&year=2009 |title=Lobbying: American Petroleum Institute |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> As of 2009, according to API’s quarterly “Lobbying Report” submitted to the U.S. Senate, the organization had 16 lobbyists lobbying Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=AD1E2A9B-A167-4DA2-89A8-AB6D97C5F719 |title=Second Quarter Lobbying Form, 2009, Secretary of the Senate |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> According to an investigation conducted by the ''[[International Business Times]]'', API lobbied the Department of State for all of 2009 on "legislative efforts concerning oil sands" and "[[Canadian Oil Sands]]."<ref name="Clinton">{{cite news|last1=Sirota|first1=David|title=Oil Companies Donated to Clinton Foundation While Lobbying State Department|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/oil-companies-donated-clinton-foundation-while-lobbying-state-department-2348832|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=International Business Times|date=5 April 2016}}</ref>

The American Petroleum Institute also lobbied the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] every quarter in 2009. In three of four quarters, the group listed “legislative efforts concerning oil sands” as one of the areas it was focusing on in its lobbying, and in the final quarter, it listed “Canadian Oil Sands.” Among API’s members are [[ExxonMobil]], which has invested in Canadian oil sands.

API lobbies and organizes its member employees' attendance at public events to communicate the industry's position on issues. A leaked summer 2009 memo from then API President [[Jack Gerard]] asked its member companies to urge their employees to participate in planned protests (designed to appear independently organized) against the [[cap-and-trade]] legislation the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] passed that same summer. "The objective of these rallies is to put a human face on the impacts of unsound energy policy and to aim a loud message at [20 different] states," including Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.  Gerard went on to assure recipients of the memo that API will cover all organizational costs and handling of logistics. In response to the memo, an API spokesman told media that participants will be there (at protests) because of their own concerns, and that API is just helping them assemble.<ref>{{cite web|first=Daniel |last=Stone |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/212934?from=rss |title=The Browning of Grassroots |publisher=Newsweek |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

To help fight [[climate change policy of the United States|climate control legislation]] that has been approved by the U.S. House, API supports the Energy Citizens group, which is holding public events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/business/energy-environment/19climate.html|title=Oil Companies Back Public Protests of Greenhouse Gas Bill|first1=Clifford|last1=Krauss|first2=Jad|last2=Mouawad|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McNulty |first=Sheila |url=http://blogs.ft.com/energy-source/2009/08/20/big-oil-backlash/ |title=The big oil backlash? |publisher=Financial Times |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> API encouraged energy company employees to attend one of its first Energy Citizen events held in Houston in August 2009, but turned away Texas residents who were not employed by the energy industry.

In the second half of 2008, as the [[2008 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]] neared, API began airing a series of television ads where spokeswoman [[Brooke Alexander]] encourages people to visit their new website, EnergyTomorrow.org. {{Third-party inline|date=December 2016}}

In January 2012, the American Petroleum Institute launched the voter education campaign - Vote 4 Energy. The campaign says that increased domestic energy production can create jobs, increase government revenue, and provide U.S. energy security. The Vote 4 Energy campaign does not promote any specific candidate or party, but rather provides voters with energy information to equip them to evaluate candidates on the federal and local levels and make decisions in favor of domestic energy on Election Day. The main components of the Vote 4 Energy campaign include the website - Vote4Energy.org - and social media communities, along with a series of advertisements and events around the country. The vote 4 energy campaign was criticized for presenting misleading arguments about the relationship between oil production and jobs whilst ignoring the potentially catastrophic consequences of increased fossil fuel consumption on the Earth's climate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=DaMelle|first1=Brendan|title=API's New 'Vote 4 Energy' Ad Campaign Is Thinly Veiled Election Year Bullying|url=http://www.desmogblog.com/api-s-new-vote-4-energy-ad-campaign-thinly-veiled-election-year-bullying|website=desmogblog.com|publisher=DeSmog Blog|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>

The API successfully pushed for an end to a ban on American oil exports on the grounds that the ban increased demand for Russian and Iranian oil, thereby benefiting the unfriendly regimes in these countries. Critics noted that many of its member companies continued to maintain ongoing business in these countries whilst the lobbying campaign was in progress, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Horn|first1=Steve|title=Big Oil Argued for U.S. Crude Exports to Fend Off Iran, But First Exporter Vitol Group Also Exported Iran's Oil|url=http://www.desmogblog.com/2015/12/29/crude-oil-exports-iran-russia-vitol-group|website=DeSmog Blog|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> Furthermore, the API's campaigns have been criticized for advocating policies that are likely to exacerbate [[global warming]] and its associated problems.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Readfearn|first1=Graham|title=What happened to the lobbyists who tried to reshape the US view of climate change?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/27/what-happened-to-lobbyists-who-tried-reshape-us-view-climate-change|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> The API has repeatedly funded conservative groups that deny the reality of anthropogenic global warming<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Riley|last2=Jacques|first2=Peter|title=Climate Change Denial Books and Conservative Think Tanks: Exploring the Connection|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=2013|volume=57|issue=6|pages=699–731|doi=10.1177/0002764213477096|pmid=24098056|pmc=3787818}}</ref> in spite of the overwhelming scientific consensus that it presents a serious problem for the planet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=John|title=Reply to 'Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature: A re-analysis'.|journal=Energy Policy|date=2014|volume=73|pages=706–708|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2014.06.002}}</ref>

==Inventory Reports==
Every Tuesday (unless Monday is a holiday) at 4:30 PM the API releases a report on US inventories of crude oil, gasoline and distillates, to paid subscribers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.api.org/products-and-services/statistics|title=API Statistics Web page}}</ref> This information is soon relayed to the public by news sources. As this information predates the report on the same inventory levels by the Energy Information Agency (EIA), it gives investors an early look at the information that may be coming from the EIA, although there is frequently some disagreement between the two sets of figures.
