Shell was formed in 1907 through the amalgamation of the '''Royal Dutch Petroleum Company''' ({{lang-nl|'''N.V. Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij'''}}) of the Netherlands (formerly the Royal Dutch Company for the Exploitation of Petroleum Wells in the [[Dutch East Indies]] ({{lang-nl|N.V. Koninklijke Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indië}})) and the '''"Shell" Transport and Trading Company''' of the United Kingdom. Until its unification in 2005 the firm operated as a [[dual-listed company]], whereby the British and Dutch companies maintained their legal existence but operated as a single-unit partnership for business purposes. Shell first entered the chemicals industry in 1929. Shell was one of the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]" which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. In 1970 Shell acquired the mining company Billiton, which it subsequently sold in 1994 and now forms part of [[BHP]]. In recent decades gas exploration and production has become an increasingly important part of Shell's business.<ref name=bloom8415>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-04-08/maybe-it-s-time-to-stop-calling-shell-an-oil-company|title=Stop Calling Shell an Oil Company|date=8 April 2015|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=29 October 2016|first=Justin|last=Fox|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030081338/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-04-08/maybe-it-s-time-to-stop-calling-shell-an-oil-company|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Shell acquired [[BG Group]] in 2016, making it the world's largest producer of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG).<ref name=bloom8415/>

For various reasons, the new firm operated as a [[dual-listed company]], whereby the merging companies maintained their legal existence but operated as a single-unit partnership for business purposes. The terms of the merger gave 60 percent stock ownership of the new group to Royal Dutch, and 40 percent to Shell.

==Operations==
===Business groupings===
[[File:Oil platform.jpeg|thumb|right|Oil platform]]
Shell is organised into four major business groupings:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.com/about-us/what-we-do.html|title=What we do|publisher=Shell|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507124209/http://www.shell.com/about-us/what-we-do.html|archive-date=7 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
* '''Upstream'''&nbsp;– manages the upstream business. It searches for and recovers crude oil and natural gas and operates the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas to the market. Its activities are organised primarily within geographic units, although there are some activities that are managed across the business or provided through support units.
* '''Integrated Gas and New Energies'''&nbsp;– manages liquefying natural gas, converting gas to liquids and low-carbon opportunities.
* '''Downstream'''&nbsp;– manages Shell's manufacturing, distribution, and marketing activities for oil products and chemicals. Manufacturing and supply include refinery, supply, and shipping of crude oil.
* '''Projects and technology'''&nbsp;– manages the delivery of Shell's major projects, provides technical services and technology capability covering both upstream and downstream activities. It is also responsible for providing functional leadership across Shell in the areas of health, safety and environment, and contracting and procurement.

===Oil and gas activities===
[[File:HK Shell depot.JPG|thumb|upright|Former Shell oil depot in [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]], around the mid-1980s]]
Shell's primary business is the management of a [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] oil company. The development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration, from the initial search for oil (exploration) through its harvesting (production), transportation, [[Oil refinery|refining]] and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded. Similar competencies were required for natural gas, which has become one of the most important businesses in which Shell is involved, and which contributes a significant proportion of the company's profits. While the vertically integrated business model provided significant [[economies of scale]] and [[barriers to entry]], each business now seeks to be a self-supporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13396061|title=Vertical integration|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 March 2009|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520062103/http://www.economist.com/node/13396061|archive-date=20 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Traditionally, Shell was a heavily decentralised business worldwide (especially in the downstream) with companies in over 100 countries, each of which operated with a high degree of independence. The upstream tended to be far more centralised with much of the technical and financial direction coming from the central offices in [[The Hague]]. The upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the "exploration and production" sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psac.ca/business/industry-overview/|title=Industry Overview|publisher=Petroleum Services Association of Canada|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508053546/http://www.psac.ca/business/industry-overview/|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Downstream operations, which now also includes the chemicals business, generates the majority of Shell's profits worldwide and is known for its global network of more than 40,000 [[petrol station]]s and its various [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]. The downstream business, which in some countries also included [[oil refining]], generally included a retail [[petrol station]] network, lubricants manufacture and marketing, industrial fuel and lubricants sales, and a host of other product/market sectors such as [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] and [[bitumen]]. The practice in Shell was that these businesses were essentially local and that they were best managed by local "operating companies"&nbsp;– often with middle and senior management reinforced by [[expatriates]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/facelift-for-shell-logo-in-pounds-500m-new-look-drive-petrol-giant-plans-to-update-outlets-in-100-1464484.html|title=Facelift for Shell logo in pounds 500m 'new look' drive: Petrol giant plans to update outlets in 100 countries ready for next century|date=30 August 1993|work=The Independent|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412142831/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/facelift-for-shell-logo-in-pounds-500m-new-look-drive-petrol-giant-plans-to-update-outlets-in-100-1464484.html|archive-date=12 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Through most of Shell's early history, the [[Shell Oil Company]] business in the United States was substantially independent. Its stock was traded on the [[NYSE]], and the group's central office had little direct involvement in running the operation. However, in 1984, Royal Dutch Shell made a bid to purchase those shares of Shell Oil Company it did not own (around 30%) and, despite opposition from some minority shareholders which led to a court case, Shell completed the buyout for a sum of $5.7&nbsp;billion.<ref name="hayes">{{cite news| author=Thomas C.

Shell sold 9.5% of its 23.1% stake in [[Woodside Petroleum]] in June 2014 and advised that it had reached an agreement for Woodside to buy back 9.5% of its shares at a later stage.

In November 2017, Shell's CEO Ben van Beurden announced Shell's plan to cut half of its carbon emissions by 2050, and 20 percent by 2035. In this regard, Shell promised to spend $2 billion annually on renewable energy sources. Shell began to develop its wind energy segment in 2001, the company now operates six wind farms in the United States and is part of a plan to build two offshore wind farms in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.com/news/20171130/royal-dutch-shell-announces-plans-to-combat-climate-change |title= Royal Dutch Shell announces plans to combat climate change |date= 30 November 2017 |author= Jared Stonesifer |work= The Times online |access-date= 1 December 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201232939/http://www.timesonline.com/news/20171130/royal-dutch-shell-announces-plans-to-combat-climate-change |archive-date= 1 December 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref>

</ref><ref name="Jerry" /> The plans to drill in the Arctic led to protests from environmental groups, particularly [[Greenpeace]]; furthermore, analysts in the energy field, as well as related industries, also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is "too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations".<ref name="Jerry">{{cite web|author1=Jerry Beilinson|title=What Shell's Kulluk Oil Rig Accident Means for Arctic Drilling|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/coal-oil-gas/kulluk-oil-rig-accident-arctic-drilling-14928526|website=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Communication, Inc|accessdate=20 June 2014|date=1 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109212203/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/coal-oil-gas/kulluk-oil-rig-accident-arctic-drilling-14928526|archive-date=9 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Phil" />

Further problems hampered the Arctic project after the commencement of drilling in 2012, as Shell dealt with a series of issues that involved air permits, Coast Guard certification of a marine vessel, and severe damage to essential oil-spill equipment. Additionally, difficult weather conditions resulted in the delay of drilling during mid-2012 and the already dire situation was exacerbated by the "Kulluk" incident at the end of the year. Royal Dutch Shell had invested nearly US$5 billion by this stage of the project.<ref name="Jon" /><ref name="Jerry" />

As the ''Kulluk'' oil rig was being towed to the American state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season, a winter storm on 27 December 2012 caused the towing crews, as well as the rescue service, to lose control of the situation. As of 1 January 2013, the Kulluk was grounded off the coast Sitkalidak Island, near the eastern end of Kodiak Island. Following the accident, a ''Fortune'' magazine contacted Larry McKinney, the executive director at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M, and he explained that "A two-month delay in the Arctic is not a two-month delay ... A two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season."<ref name="Jon">{{cite web|author1=Jon Birger|title=What I learned aboard Shell's grounded Alaskan oil rig|url=http://fortune.com/2013/01/03/what-i-learned-aboard-shells-grounded-alaskan-oil-rig/|website=Fortune Magazine|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=20 June 2014|date=3 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132911/http://fortune.com/2013/01/03/what-i-learned-aboard-shells-grounded-alaskan-oil-rig/|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

It was unclear if Shell would recommence drilling in mid-2013, following the "Kulluk" incident, and, in February 2013, the corporation stated that it would "pause" its closely watched drilling project off the Alaskan coast in 2013, and will instead prepare for future exploration.<ref name="Mat" /> In January 2014, the corporation announced the extension of the suspension of its drilling program in the Arctic, with chief executive van Beurden explaining that the project is "under review" due to both market and internal issues.<ref name="Terry">{{cite news|title=Shell shelves plan to drill in Alaskan Arctic this summer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/shell-shelves-alaskan-arctic-drilling-oil|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 January 2014|author=Terry Macalister|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302181906/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/shell-shelves-alaskan-arctic-drilling-oil|archive-date=2 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

A June 2014 interview with Pickard indicated that, following a forensic analysis of the problems encountered in 2012, Royal Dutch Shell will continue with the project and Pickard stated that she perceives the future of the corporation activity in the Arctic region as a long-term "marathon".<ref name="Ann" /> Pickard stated that the forensic "look back" revealed "there was an on/off switch" and further explained:

<blockquote>
In other words, don't spend the money unless you're sure you're going to have the legal environment to go forward. Don't spend the money unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.<ref name="Ann" /></blockquote>

Based upon the interview with Pickard, Shell is approaching the project as an investment that will reap energy resources with a lifespan of around 30 years.<ref name="Ann" />

[[File:ShellgebouwAmsterdam.JPG|thumb|upright|Former Shell Research and Technology Centre, [[Amsterdam]]]]

===Brent Spar platform===
In the 1990s, protesters criticised the company's environmental record, particularly the possible pollution caused by the proposed disposal of the [[Brent Spar]] platform into the North Sea. Despite support from the UK government, Shell reversed the decision under public pressure but maintained that sinking the platform would have been environmentally better.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/218527.stm Brent Spar's long saga] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331041643/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/218527.stm |date=31 March 2008 }} BBC News, 1998</ref> Shell subsequently published an unequivocal commitment to [[sustainable development]], supported by executive speeches reinforcing this commitment.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ek Kia | first = Tan | title = Sustainable Development in Shell | date = 19 April 2005 | url = http://www.shellchemicals.com/chemicals/pdf/speeches/sydney_speech_april_2005.pdf | accessdate = 30 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926070114/http://www.shellchemicals.com/chemicals/pdf/speeches/sydney_speech_april_2005.pdf | archive-date = 26 September 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Shell was subsequently criticised by the European Commission and five EU members after deciding to leave part of its decommissioned oil rigs standing in the North Sea. Shell argued that removing them would be too costly and risky. Germany said that the estimated 11,000 tonnes of raw oil and toxins remaining in the rigs would eventually seep into the sea, and called it a 'ticking timebomb'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/04/uk-facing-eu-outrage-over-timebomb-of-north-sea-oil-rigs|title=UK facing EU outrage over 'timebomb' of North Sea oil rigs|date=4 September 2019|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905000116/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/04/uk-facing-eu-outrage-over-timebomb-of-north-sea-oil-rigs|archive-date=5 September 2019|access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref>

===2004 overstatement of oil reserves===
In 2004 Shell overstated its oil reserves, resulting in loss of confidence in the group, a £17&nbsp;million fine by the [[Financial Services Authority]] and the departure of the chairman [[Philip Watts]].

A number of incidents over the years led to criticism of Shell's [[health and safety]] record, including repeated warnings by the UK Health and Safety Executive about the poor state of the company's North Sea platforms.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/05/oilandpetrol.news | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Terry | last=MacAlister | title=Shell safety record in North Sea takes a hammering | date=5 March 2007 | access-date=13 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102173324/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/05/oilandpetrol.news | archive-date=2 January 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Human rights===
In the beginning of 1996, several human rights groups [[Ken Saro-Wiwa#Family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell|brought cases to hold Shell accountable]] for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including [[summary execution]], crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and [[arbitrary arrest and detention]]. In particular, Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] and eight other leaders of the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]] tribe of southern Nigeria, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news |author=Ed Pilkington in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/08/nigeria-usa |title=Shell pays out $15.5m over Saro-Wiwa killing |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 May 2012 |location=London |date=8 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906192049/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/08/nigeria-usa |archive-date=6 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiwavshell.org/|title=Wiwa v.

In 2009, Shell was the subject of an Amnesty International report into the deterioration of human rights as a consequence of Shell's activities in the [[Niger Delta]]. In particular, Amnesty criticised the continuation of [[gas flaring]] and Shell's slow response to oil spills.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/017/2009/en/ |title=Amnesty.org |format=PDF |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703061520/http://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AFR44/017/2009/en/ |archive-date=3 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1998, on its first public report on community and environmental issues in Nigeria, Shell promised "to end the practice of gas flaring in ten years, while pledging to establish a youth training scheme in Ogoniland".<ref>[[David Vogel (professor)|Vogel, D]].

In 2010 Greenpeace activists painted "No Arctic Drilling" with spilled BP oil on the side of a ship in the Gulf of Mexico that was en route to explore for Arctic oil for Shell.

In July 2012, Greenpeace activists shut down 53&nbsp;Shell petrol stations in [[Edinburgh]] and [[London]] in a protest against the company's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.
