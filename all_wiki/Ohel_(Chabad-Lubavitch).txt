In the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] Jewish movement, the '''Ohel''' ({{lang-he|אהל||tent}}) is an ''[[Ohel (grave)|ohel]]'' (Jewish monumental tomb) in [[New York City]] at which the Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], and his father-in-law, Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], (the two most recent leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty) are buried.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web |title=Lubavitchers Mark 10 Years Since Death of Revered Rabbi  |first=Corey |last=Kilgannon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/nyregion/lubavitchers-mark-10-years-since-death-of-revered-rabbi.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 June 2004  |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> The Ohel is visited by thousands of Jews and non-Jews each year.

== Description ==
[[File:אהל הרבי מליובאוויטש מבפנים.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Interior of the Chabad Ohel. The grave of Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] is at right; that of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] is at left.]]
The Ohel is located at [[Montefiore Cemetery]] (Old Springfield Cemetery) in [[Cambria Heights, Queens]], New York City. The cemetery is a remnant of the large Jewish community that once inhabited Cambria Heights. Today the area is largely [[African American]].<ref name="queens"/>

The Ohel is situated at the northern edge of the cemetery, near the corner of Francis Lewis Boulevard and 121st Avenue, in a section designated for prominent Lubavitcher men and their wives. It is an open-air structure containing the side-by-side graves of Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (1880&ndash;1950) and Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (1902&ndash;1994).<ref name="Samuel17">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWH51mqdpi8C&q=ohel+chabad&pg=PA17 |page=17 |title= The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson |first1=Samuel |last1=Heilman |first2=Menachem |last2=Friedman |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-691-15442-8}}</ref>

A row of small brick houses along Francis Lewis Boulevard abuts the cemetery. In 1995, Lubavitcher [[Hasid]]im bought one of these houses and turned it into a 24-hour visitors center. This center includes a video room, a library, a small [[synagogue]], a quiet room for visitors to compose the prayers they will say in the Ohel, and refreshments.<ref name="Samuel17"/><ref name="craig">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eQCAAAAMBAJ&q=ohel+chabad&pg=PA42 |title=Beyond Belief |first=Craig |last=Horowitz |journal=[[New York Magazine]] |date=19 June 1995 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |page=42}}</ref> The entrance to the Ohel is through the back door of this house and down a pathway. Men and women enter the Ohel through separate doors.<ref name="queens"/>

== History ==
Following the burial of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneerson in the cemetery in 1950, his successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, would visit his father-in-law's grave several times a week &ndash; even up to six days a week. He would read out the requests of people who came to speak with him, then tear the notes and leave them at the gravesite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/36247/jewish/Overview.htm |title=The Ohel: An overview |publisher=Chabad.org |year=2012 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125005705/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/36247/jewish/Overview.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2012 }}</ref> After the death of his wife in 1988, the Ohel was the only place the Rebbe regularly visited outside [[Brooklyn]]. He suffered his first [[stroke]] at the Ohel in 1992.<ref>Heilman and Friedman (2012), p. 63.</ref>

Following Schneerson's death and burial at the Ohel in 1994, the number of visitors to the Ohel increased significantly. Today, tens of thousands of Jews visit the Ohel annually.<ref name="queens"/> It is also frequented by travelers going to or returning from nearby [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] or [[770 Eastern Parkway]], the headquarters of Chabad in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]].<ref>Heilman and Friedman (2012), p. 18.</ref>

The presence of large numbers of pilgrims, nighttime visitations, and the build-up of Chabad homes and facilities in the area has resulted in tension with the surrounding African-American community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Queens Holy Land; Paying Homage at Rebbe's Grave  |first=Lynette |last=Holloway  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/nyregion/queens-holy-land-paying-homage-at-rebbe-s-grave.html |work=The New York Times |date=11 March 1995|accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref>

== Customs ==
At the Ohel, visitors have a tradition of writing ''[[Kvitel|kvitlach]]'' &ndash; prayers on small pieces of paper &ndash; which are then torn up and tossed onto the graves.<ref name=NYT /> In the visitor's center, a fax machine receives over 700 faxes a day, while a computer receives 400 e-mails daily. These ''kvitlach'' are all printed and then taken to the graves, where they are torn into shreds and placed atop the graves. When the pile grows too high, the shredded notes are burned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2018794/At-the-Ohel.html|title=At the Ohel|last=Olidort|first=B.|accessdate=2010-01-18|date=18 June 2007|publisher=lubavitch.com}}</ref> The visitor's center also receives many wedding invitations for the Rebbe; these invitations are read at and/or placed on the graves.<ref name="craig"/> In addition to ''kvitlach'', visitors are encouraged to light memorial candles at the Ohel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYkrNhPMQkC&q=ohel+chabad&pg=PA582 |title= Pilgrimage: From the Ganges to Graceland &ndash; An Encyclopedia |first1=Linda Kay |last1=Davidson |first2=David |last2=Gitlitz |year=2002 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 1-57607-004-2 |page=582}}</ref>

The Ohel website advises visitors to wear modest clothing, cover the head with a hat (men) or head-covering (women), and avoid wearing leather shoes. When leaving, visitors walk backwards as a sign of respect.<ref name="queens"/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ul0kFIxtMfkC&q=ohel+chabad&pg=PT310 |title=Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions: A Comprehensive Introduction to the Religions of the World |first=James A. |last=Beverley |year=2009 |publisher=Thomas Nelson |page=310|isbn=978-0-7852-4491-2}}</ref>

Visitors to the Ohel customarily light candles on shelves in the antechamber. Candles are available at the visitor's center. Visitors also write letters to the Rebbe beforehand and read them quietly beside the graves, then rip them up and leave them on the graves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohelchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/78447/jewish/Conduct.htm|title=Appropriate Conduct at the Ohel|publisher=Ohel Chabad Lubavitch|year=2014|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>

== Kohanim ==
According to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest) is not allowed to [[Prohibition of Kohen defilement by the dead#Cemeteries|ritually defile himself by entering a cemetery]]. Halacha mandates that the kohen be a distance of four [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|amahs]] from a grave unless separated by a fence.  The construction of fencing along the pathway leading to it makes it possible for kohanim to enter the Ohel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/kohanim/ |title=Kohanim |first=Yaakov |last=Goldstein |date=28 November 2016 |access-date=2 April 2018 |work=shulchanaruchharav.com}}</ref>

At the Ohel itself, the graves are open to the sky to eliminate problems of ''tumas meis'' ("impurity from the dead"; see [[Tumah and taharah]]) in an enclosure, and a low wall surrounds the graves and keeps the kohen at least 12.59 inches (320&nbsp;mm) away from a tombstone to maintain his ritual purity.
