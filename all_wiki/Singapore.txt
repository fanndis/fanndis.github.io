'''Singapore''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Singapore.ogg|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|(|g|)|ə|p|ɔːr}}), officially the '''Republic of Singapore''', is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] island [[city-state]] in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. It lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], off the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]], bordering the [[Straits of Malacca]] to the west, the [[Riau Islands]] to the south, and the [[South China Sea]] to the east. The country's territory is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects. It has the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|second greatest population density in the world]]. The country has almost 5.7&nbsp;million residents, 61% (3.4&nbsp;million) of whom are [[Singaporeans|Singaporean citizens]]. There are four [[Languages of Singapore|official languages of Singapore]]: [[Singapore English|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], with English being the [[lingua franca]]. [[Multiracialism]] is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape [[Race in Singapore|national policies]] in education, housing, and politics.

Although its [[History of Singapore|history]] stretches back millennia, [[Founding of modern Singapore|modern Singapore was founded]] in 1819 by [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Stamford Raffles]] as a trading post of the [[British Empire]]. In 1867, the colonies in East Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the [[Straits Settlements]]. During the [[Second World War]], Singapore was [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupied by Japan]] in 1942, but returned to British control as a separate [[Colony of Singapore|crown colony]] following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945. [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] gained self-governance in 1959, and in 1963 became part of the new federation of [[Malaysia]], alongside [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]]. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Ideological differences]] led to Singapore being expelled from the federation two years later, thereby becoming an independent country.

After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]] and despite lacking natural resources and a [[hinterland]], the nation rapidly developed to become one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] based on external trade, becoming a highly [[developed country]]; it is ranked ninth on the UN [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], and has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|second-highest GDP per capita (PPP)]] in the world. Singapore is the only country in Asia with an AAA sovereign rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major financial and shipping hub, consistently ranked the most expensive city to live in since 2013, and has been identified as a [[tax haven]]. Singapore [[International rankings of Singapore|ranks highly]] in international measures of economic freedom, [[Education in Singapore|education]], [[Healthcare in Singapore|healthcare]], [[Human Capital Index|quality of life]], [[personal safety]], [[Corruption in Singapore|transparency]] and [[public housing in Singapore|housing]], with a home-ownership rate of 91%. [[Singaporeans]] enjoy one of the world's longest life expectancies, [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds|fastest Internet connection speeds]] and one of the [[List of countries by infant and under-five mortality rates|lowest infant mortality rates in the world]].

Singapore is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a [[Westminster system]] of [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliamentary government. While elections are free, the government exercises significant control over politics and society, and the [[People's Action Party]] has ruled continuously since independence. One of the five founding members of [[ASEAN]], Singapore is also the headquarters of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) Secretariat and [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] (PECC) Secretariat, as well as many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[East Asia Summit]], the [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The English name of Singapore is an [[anglicisation]] of the native [[Malay language|Malay]] name for the country, '''''[[wikt:Singapura#Malay|Singapura]]''''', which was in turn derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word for ''lion city'' (<small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|romanised:]]</small> '''''[[wikt:सिंहपुर#Sanskrit|Siṃhapura]]'''''; [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]]: 𑀲𑀺𑀁𑀳𑀧𑀼𑀭; literally ''"lion city"''; ''[[wikt:सिंह#Sanskrit|siṃha]]'' means "lion", ''[[wikt:पुर#Sanskrit|pura]]'' means "city" or "fortress").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411060419/http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 April 2001|title=Singapore|publisher=bartleby.com|access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref> A Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as ''[[Pulau Ujong|Pú Luó Zhōng]]'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:蒲|蒲]][[wikt:羅|羅]][[wikt:中|中]]}}), which sounds like Malay for "island at the end of [[Malay Peninsula|a peninsula]]".<ref name="utexas">{{cite web|title=Singapore: History, Singapore 1994|url=http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/singapore/Singapore-History.html|publisher=Asian Studies @ University of Texas at Austin|access-date=13 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323095958/http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/Singapore/Singapore-History.html|archive-date=23 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Early references to the name [[Temasek]] (or Tumasik) are found in the [[Nagarakretagama]], a [[Java (island)|Javanese]] epic poem written in 1365, and a Vietnamese source from the same time period. The name possibly means "Sea Town", being derived from the Malay ''tasek'', meaning "sea" or "lake".<ref name="toponym">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTOJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA381 |title=Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics|authors= Victor R Savage, Brenda Yeoh |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |date= 15 June 2013 |isbn=9789814484749 |page=381}}</ref> The Chinese traveller [[Wang Dayuan]] visited a place around 1330 named ''Danmaxi'' ({{zh|c=淡馬錫|p= Dànmǎxí|w=Tan Ma Hsi}}) or ''Tam ma siak'', depending on pronunciation.

Variations of the name ''Siṃhapura'' were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura. In Hindu-Buddhist culture, lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name.{{sfn|Miksic|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA151 151–152]}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mothership.sg/2016/12/5-other-places-in-asia-which-are-also-called-singapura/ |title=5 other places in Asia which are also called Singapura |author=Joshua Lee |work=Mothership |date=6 December 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2020}}</ref> The name ''Singapura'' supplanted ''Temasek'' sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] on the island by a fleeing [[Srivijaya]]n ''[[Raja]]'' (prince) from [[Palembang]]. However, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. The semi-historical [[Malay Annals]] state that Temasek was christened ''Singapura'' by [[Sang Nila Utama]], a 13th-century Srivijayan Raja from Palembang. The Annals state that Sang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he established the town of Singapura where he encountered the beast. The second hypothesis, drawn from [[Tomé Pires#The Suma Oriental|Portuguese sources]], postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. Parameswara declared independence from [[Majapahit]] and mounted a Lion Throne, thus claiming the Srivijaya Empire. After then being driven into exile by the Javanese, he usurped control over Temasek. It is possible that he rechristened the area as ''Singapura'', recalling the throne he had been driven from.<ref name="turnbull">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819–2005|last=Turnbull|first=C.M.|pages=21–22|publisher=NUS Press|year=2009|isbn=978-9971-69-430-2}}</ref>

Singapore was not greatly affected by the [[First World War]] (1914–18), as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia.

However, the [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. As a consequence, after [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving Singapore vulnerable to Japanese invasion.<ref name="LambTarling2001">{{cite book |last1=Lamb |first1=Margaret |last2=Tarling |first2=Nicholas |title=From Versailles to Pearl Harbor: The Origins of the Second World War in Europe and Asia |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4izcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39 |date=2001 |publisher= Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=978-1-4039-3772-8 |page=39}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BH88kpvyrdYC&pg=PA90|title=Marshall of Singapore: A Biography |last=Tan |first=Kevin |isbn=978-981-230-878-8 |year=2008}}</ref>

=== Post-war period ===
{{Main|Colony of Singapore}}
After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]] [[Operation Tiderace|returned to Singapore]] to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General [[Itagaki Seishiro]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945.{{sfn|Bose|2010|pp=18–20}}<ref name="auto1" /> Meanwhile, [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore.

Much of Singapore's infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar">{{cite web|title=Singapore – Aftermath of War|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> The failure of Britain to successfully defend changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans.

During the 1950s, Chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the [[Malayan Emergency]].

PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], splitting from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=T.

UMNO, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of merger due to joint fear of communists takeover.<ref name="Wipe out extremists">{{cite news|title=MCA: Wipe out extremists|date=18 February 1959|newspaper=Singapore Standard}}</ref>

On 27 May 1961, Malaya's Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called [[Malaysia]], which would unite the current and former British possessions in the region: the [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]], [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]], and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]].<ref name="Wipe out extremists" /> UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore's Chinese population.<ref name=countrystudies10 /> The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Appeal To Singapore|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19620328-1.2.70.1?ST=1&AT=advanced|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|page=10|date=28 March 1962}}</ref> To obtain a mandate for a merger, the PAP held a [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|referendum on the merger]]. This referendum included a choice of different terms for merger with Malaysia, but had no option for avoiding merger altogether. On 16 September 1963, Singapore joined with Malaya, the North Borneo, and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia under the terms of the [[Malaysia Agreement]].

Even after the merger, the [[People's Action Party–United Malays National Organisation relations|Singaporean government and the Malaysian central government disagreed]] on many political and economic issues. Despite an agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. Talks soon broke down, and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides.

=== Fresh water ===

Access to water is universal, affordable, efficient and of high quality. Singapore relies on [[Water supply and sanitation in Singapore|four main water sources]], or "four national taps" – water imported from neighbouring Malaysia, [[List of dams and reservoirs in Singapore|urban rainwater catchments]], [[reclaimed water]] ([[NEWater]]) and seawater [[desalination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/singaporewaterstory|title=Singapore Water Story|publisher=Public Utilities Board|year=2018|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> Singapore's approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure, but it also emphasises proper legislation and enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development.<ref name="Luan">{{cite journal|author=Ivy Ong Bee Luan|title=Singapore Water Management Policies and Practices|journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development|year=2010|volume=26|issue=1|pages=65–80|doi=10.1080/07900620903392190|s2cid=154813810}}</ref> Singapore has declared that it will be water self-sufficient by the time its 1961 long-term water supply agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. However, according to official forecasts, water demand in Singapore is expected to double from 380 to 760 million US gallons (1.4 to 2.8 billion litres; 1.4 to 2.8 million cubic meters) per day between 2010 and 2060. The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 and is expected to account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time, water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bloomberg interview with Chew Men Leong, chief executive of PUB|title=Singapore To Meet Water Target Before Deadline: Southeast Asia|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-29/singapore-to-meet-water-target-before-deadline-southeast-asia.html|access-date=9 August 2012|date=30 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805212635/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-29/singapore-to-meet-water-target-before-deadline-southeast-asia.html|archive-date=5 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=PUB|title=Four National Taps Provide Water for All|url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/Pages/default.aspx|access-date=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730063932/http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=30 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Literature of Singapore, or "SingLit", comprises a collection of literary works by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country's four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Singapore is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works have been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal ''Singa'', published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including [[Edwin Thumboo]] and [[Koh Buck Song]], as well as in multilingual anthologies such as ''Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry'' (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each. A number of Singaporean writers such as [[Tan Swie Hian]] and [[Kuo Pao Kun]] have contributed work in more than one language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/poet-feature-singapores-unique-language-in-literature|title=Singapore Writers Festival: Feature Singapore's unique language in literature, says poet|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|access-date=27 August 2019|date=5 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/kbolton/pdf/(2014)%20Bolton%20and%20Ng.pdf|title=The dynamics of multilingualism in contemporary Singapore|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

Singapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical. Western classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, with the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]] (SSO) instituted in 1979.

Singapore's diversity of cuisine is touted as a reason to visit the country, due to its combination of convenience, variety, quality, and price.<ref name="Foodways">{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=p5Mw_WTLhiYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA161&dq=singapore*+cuisine|title=Changing Chinese foodways in Asia|last1=Wu|first1=David Y.H.|author2=Chee Beng Tan|pages=161 ff|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-201-914-0|year=2001|access-date=27 February 2011}}</ref> Local food items generally relate to a particular ethnicity – Chinese, Malay and Indian; but the diversity of cuisine has increased further by the hybridisation of different styles (e.g., the [[Peranakan cuisine]], a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion is exemplified by traditionally Malay hawker stalls also selling Tamil food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay ingredients, cooking techniques, or entire dishes into their range of catering.<ref name="Foodways" /> [[Hainanese chicken rice]], based on the Hainanese dish [[Wenchang chicken]], is considered Singapore's national dish.<ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015">{{cite web|last1=Farley|first1=David|title=The Dish Worth the 15-Hour Flight|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20151105-the-singapore-dish-worth-a-15-hour-flight|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="lingCNN14apr2010">{{cite web|last1=Ling|first1=Catherine|title=40 Singapore foods we can't live without|url=http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/none/40-singapore-foods-we-cant-live-without-810208/|publisher=CNN|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>

Prior to the 1980s, [[street food]] was sold mainly by immigrants from China, India, and Malaysia to other immigrants seeking a familiar taste.
