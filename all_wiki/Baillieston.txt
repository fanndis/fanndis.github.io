==Geographical position==
Once a separate village, Baillieston is now on the periphery of the Glasgow urban area, situated west of a major interchange between the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], [[M74 motorway|M74]] and [[M73 motorway|M73]] [[motorway]]s and the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8]] [[trunk road]], between the town of [[Coatbridge]] in [[North Lanarkshire]], and the neighbouring Glasgow neighbourhoods of [[Sandyhills]], [[Barlanark]] and [[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon]]. Suburban developments in the vicinity such as [[Barrachnie]], [[Garrowhill]], [[Springhill, Glasgow|Springhill]] and [[Swinton, Glasgow|Swinton]] are generally considered to fall within the larger modern Baillieston district.
