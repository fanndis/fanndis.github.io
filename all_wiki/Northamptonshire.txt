In 2015 it had a population of 723,000. The [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]] is administered by [[Northamptonshire County Council]] and by seven [[non-metropolitan district]] councils. It is known as "The Rose of the Shires".

Covering an area of 2,364 square kilometres (913 sq mi), Northamptonshire is landlocked between eight other counties: [[Warwickshire]] to the west, [[Leicestershire]] and [[Rutland]] to the north, [[Cambridgeshire]] to the east, [[Bedfordshire]] to the south-east, [[Buckinghamshire]] to the south, [[Oxfordshire]] to the south-west and [[Lincolnshire]] to the north-east – England's shortest administrative county boundary at 20 yards (19 metres), although this was not the case with the historic county boundary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thebythams.org.uk/localgovernment/lincolnshire-cc/index.html |title= Lincolnshire County Council |publisher= Thebythams.org.uk |date= 24 October 2005 |accessdate= 25 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506222240/http://www.thebythams.org.uk/localgovernment/lincolnshire-cc/index.html |archive-date= 6 May 2009 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Northamptonshire is the southernmost county in the [[East Midlands]] region.

==History==
{{Main|History of Northamptonshire}}
Much of Northamptonshire's countryside appears to have remained somewhat intractable with regards to early human occupation, resulting in an apparently sparse population and relatively few finds from the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods.<ref>Greenall (1979) p.19</ref> In about 500 BC the [[Iron Age]] was introduced into the area by a continental people in the form of the [[Hallstatt culture]],<ref name="Greenall p.20">Greenall (1979) p.20</ref> and over the next century a series of hill-forts were constructed at [[Arbury]] Camp, [[Rainsborough]] camp, Borough Hill, Castle Dykes, [[Guilsborough]], [[Irthlingborough]], and most notably of all, [[Hunsbury Hill]]. There are two more possible hill-forts at [[Arbury Hill]] ([[Badby]]) and [[Thenford]].<ref name="Greenall p.20"/>

In the 1st century BC, most of what later became Northamptonshire became part of the territory of the [[Catuvellauni]], a [[Belgic tribe]], the Northamptonshire area forming their most northerly possession.<ref name="Greenall p.20"/> The [[Catuvellauni]] were in turn conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 43 AD.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/iron_02.shtml BBC - History - Tribes of Britain]. Retrieved 16 August 2009.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825061252/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/iron_02.shtml |date=25 August 2009 }}</ref>

The Roman road of [[Watling Street]] passed through the county, and an important Roman settlement, ''Lactodorum'', stood on the site of modern-day [[Towcester]]. There were other Roman settlements at [[Northampton]], [[Kettering]] and along the [[River Nene|Nene Valley]] near [[Raunds]]. A large fort was built at [[Longthorpe]].<ref name="Greenall p.20"/>

After the Romans left, the area eventually became part of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Mercia]], and Northampton functioned as an administrative centre. The Mercians converted to [[Christianity]] in 654 AD with the death of the [[pagan]] king [[Penda]].<ref>Greenall (1979) p.29</ref> From about 889 the area was conquered by the [[Danes]] (as at one point almost all of England was, except for [[Athelney]] marsh in [[Somerset]]) and became part of the [[Danelaw]] – with [[Watling Street]] serving as the boundary – until being recaptured by the [[English people|English]] under the [[Wessex]] king [[Edward the Elder]], son of [[Alfred the Great]], in 917. Northamptonshire was conquered again in 940, this time by the [[Vikings]] of [[York]], who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942.<ref>Wood, Michael (1986) ''The Domesday Quest'' p. 90, BBC Books, 1986 {{ISBN|0-563-52274-7}}.</ref> Consequently, it is one of the few counties in England to have both Saxon and Danish town-names and settlements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The county was first recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (1011), as ''Hamtunscire'': the ''scire'' ([[shire]]) of ''Hamtun'' (the homestead). The "North" was added to distinguish Northampton from the other important ''Hamtun'' further south: [[Southampton]] – though the origins of the two names are in fact different.<ref>Mills, A.D. (1998). A Dictionary of English Place-names. Second Edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford. p256. {{ISBN|0-19-280074-4}}</ref>

[[Rockingham Castle]] was built for [[William the Conqueror]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockinghamcastle.com/|title=Rockingham Castle - Rockingham Castle, a home of history, Weddings, Corporate events and the Rockingham International Horse Trials|website=Rockinghamcastle.com|accessdate=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111071343/http://www.rockinghamcastle.com/|archive-date=11 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was used as a Royal fortress until [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times.

[[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States of America]], was born into the Washington family who had migrated to America from Northamptonshire in 1656. [[George Washington]]'s ancestor, Lawrence Washington, was Mayor of [[Northampton]] on several occasions and it was he who bought [[Sulgrave Manor]] from [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1539.

During the [[English Civil War]], Northamptonshire strongly supported the [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause, and the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] forces suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Naseby]] in 1645 in the north of the county. King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was imprisoned at [[Holdenby House]] in 1647.<ref>Edmonds. 1848.

In 1823 Northamptonshire was said to "[enjoy] a very pure and wholesome air" because of its dryness and distance from the sea. Its livestock were celebrated: "Horned cattle, and other animals, are fed to extraordinary sizes: and many horses of the large black breed are reared."<ref>[[Richard Brookes (physician)|Brookes, R.]], Whittaker, W.B.

Nine years later, the county was described as "a county enjoying the reputation of being one of the healthiest and pleasantest parts of England" although the towns were "of small importance" with the exceptions of Peterborough and Northampton.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, parts of Northamptonshire and the surrounding area became [[industrialised]]. The local specialisation was [[shoe]]making and the [[leather]] industry and became one of Britain's major centres for these crafts by the 19th century. In the north of the county a large [[ironstone]] [[quarry]]ing industry developed from 1850.<ref>[http://www.kellner.eclipse.co.uk/genuki/NTH/ GENUKI: Northamptonshire Genealogy: Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles, 1887] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612095348/http://www.kellner.eclipse.co.uk/genuki/NTH/ |date=12 June 2009 }}.

==Governance==
===Local government===
{{main|Northamptonshire County Council}}
Northamptonshire, like most English counties, is divided into a number of local authorities. The seven borough/district councils cover 15 towns and hundreds of villages. The county has a two-tier structure of [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] and an elected [[county council]] based in [[Northampton]], and is also divided into seven [[Non-metropolitan district|districts]] each with their own district or borough councils:<ref>[http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/Pages/districts.aspx Northamptonshire County Council: District and Borough Councils] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926125344/http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/Pages/districts.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}. 2008.

Northampton itself is the most populous urban district in England not to be administered as a [[unitary authority]] (even though several smaller districts are unitary). During the [[1990s UK local government reform|1990s local government reform]], Northampton Borough Council petitioned strongly for unitary status, which led to fractured relations with the County Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[Soke of Peterborough]] is within the historic county of Northamptonshire, although it had had a separate county council since 1889 and separate [[Quarter Sessions|courts of quarter sessions]] before then. The city of [[Local government in Peterborough|Peterborough]] has been a [[unitary authority]] since 1998, but it  forms part of [[Cambridgeshire]] for [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial purposes]].<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/contents/made The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501043451/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/contents/made |date=1 May 2011 }} (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon & Thurrock, Blackburn & Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling & Rushcliffe, Dartford & Gravesham, Gillingham & Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton & Warrington, Huntingdonshire & Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995</ref>

====De facto bankruptcy of the county council====
In early 2018, Northamptonshire County Council was declared technically insolvent and would be able to provide only the bare essential services.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bankrupt-northamptonshire-county-council-may-cut-to-legal-minimum-dv2p5p0ns |title='Bankrupt' Northamptonshire county council may cut to legal minimum |last=Johnston |first=Neil |date=2 August 2018 |website=The Times |access-date=9 September 2018|quote=Hundreds of jobs are also at risk}}</ref> According to [[The Guardian]] the problems were caused by "a reckless half-decade in which it refused to raise council tax to pay for the soaring costs of social care" and "partly due to past failings, the council is now having to make some drastic decisions to reduce services to a core offer." Some observers, such as Simon Edwards of the [[County Councils Network]], added another perspective on the cause of the financial crisis, the [[United Kingdom government austerity programme]]: "It is clear that, partly due to past failings, the council is now having to make some drastic decisions to reduce services to a core offer. However, we can’t ignore that some of the underlying causes of the challenges facing Northamptonshire, such as dramatic reductions to council budgets and severe demand for services, mean county authorities across the country face funding pressures of £3.2bn over the next two years."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/01/northamptonshire-councillors-discuss-drastic-cuts-to-stem-crisis |title=Northamptonshire's cash crisis driven by ideological folly, councillors told |last=Butler |first=Patrick |date=1 August 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=9 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909114220/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/01/northamptonshire-councillors-discuss-drastic-cuts-to-stem-crisis |archive-date=9 September 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

====Structural changes====
{{main|West Northamptonshire|North Northamptonshire}}
[[File:Northamtonshire numbered districts 2021.svg|thumb|200px|{{olist |[[West Northamptonshire]] |[[North Northamptonshire]]}}]]
In early 2018, following the events above, Government-appointed commissioners took over control of the council's affairs. Consequently, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government commissioned an independent report which, in March 2018, proposed structural changes to local government in Northamptonshire. These changes will see the existing county council and district councils abolished and two new unitary authorities created in their place.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-40610349 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319180715/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-40610349 |archive-date=19 March 2018 |url-status=bot: unknown  }}</ref> One authority, [[West Northamptonshire]], will consist of the existing districts of [[Daventry District|Daventry]], [[Northampton]] and [[South Northamptonshire]] and the other authority, [[North Northamptonshire]], will consist of [[Corby (borough)|Corby]], [[East Northamptonshire]], [[Borough of Kettering|Kettering]] and [[Borough of Wellingborough|Wellingborough]] districts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-03-15/northamptonshire-county-council-should-be-split-up-finds-damning-report/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802223701/http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-03-15/northamptonshire-county-council-should-be-split-up-finds-damning-report/ |archive-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=bot: unknown  }}</ref>

In the 2016 EU referendum, all of the Northamptonshire districts voted to Leave, most by a significant margin. Two prominent Brexiteer MPs, [[Philip Hollobone]] and [[Peter Bone]] represent parts of the county.

The councils of the rural districts – Daventry, East Northamptonshire, and South Northamptonshire – are strongly Conservative, whereas the political composition of the urban districts is more mixed. At the 2003 local elections, Labour lost control of Kettering, Northampton, and Wellingborough, retaining only Corby. Elections for the entire County Council are held every four years – the last were held on 5 May 2005 when control of the County Council changed from the Labour Party to the Conservatives. The County Council uses a [[leader and cabinet]] executive system and abolished its [[area committee]]s in April 2006.

==Healthcare==

===Hospitals===
The main acute [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] hospitals in Northamptonshire [[Northampton General Hospital]], which also operates Danetre Hospital in Daventry, and [[Kettering General Hospital]].  In the south-west of the county, the towns of  Brackley, Towcester and surrounding villages are serviced by the [[Horton General Hospital]] in [[Banbury]] in neighbouring Oxfordshire for acute medical needs. A similar arrangement is in place for the town of [[Oundle]] and nearby villages, served by [[Peterborough City Hospital]].

In February 2011 a new satellite out-patient centre opened at Nene Park, Irthlingborough to provide over 40,000 appointments a year, as well as a minor injury unit to serve Eastern Northamptonshire.  This was opened to relieve pressure off Kettering General Hospital, and has also replaced the dated Rushden Memorial Clinic which provided at the time about 8,000 appointments a year, when open.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-12379676|title=New £4.2m Irthlingborough outpatients clinic opens|work=BBC News|date=7 February 2011|accessdate=7 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208232104/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-12379676|archive-date=8 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|East Midlands#Transport}}
[[File:A43 Brackley.jpg|right|thumb|Brackley bypass on the A43]]
The gap in the hills at [[Watford Gap]] meant that many south-east to north-west routes passed through Northamptonshire. The Roman Road [[Watling Street]] (now part of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]) passes through here, as did later canals, railways and major roads.

===Roads===

Major national roads including the [[M1 motorway]] (London to Leeds) and the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] (Rugby to Felixstowe), provide Northamptonshire with transport links, both north–south and east–west. The [[A43 road|A43]] joins the M1 to the [[M40 motorway]], passing through the south of the county to the junction west of Brackley, and the [[A45 road|A45]] links Northampton with Wellingborough and Peterborough.

The county road network, managed by Northamptonshire County Council includes the [[A45 road|A45]] west of the [[M1 motorway]], the [[A43 road|A43]] between [[Northampton]] and the county boundary near Stamford, the [[A361 road|A361]] between [[Kilsby]] and [[Banbury]] (Oxon) and all B, C and Unclassified Roads. Since 2009 these highways have been managed on behalf of the county council by MGWSP, a joint venture between [[May Gurney]] and WSP.

===Rivers and canals===
[[File:Grand Union Canal at Braunston.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Grand Union Canal]] at [[Braunston]]]]
{{Further|:Category:Rivers of Northamptonshire}}

Two major canals – the [[Oxford Canal|Oxford]] and the [[Grand Union Canal|Grand Union]] – join in the county at [[Braunston]]. Notable features include a flight of 17 [[canal lock|locks]] on the Grand Union at [[Rothersthorpe]], the [[Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum|canal museum]] at [[Stoke Bruerne]], and a tunnel at [[Blisworth Tunnel|Blisworth]] which, at {{convert|2813|m|yd}}, is the third-longest navigable canal tunnel on the [[Canals of the United Kingdom|UK canal network]].

A branch of the Grand Union Canal connects to the [[River Nene]] in Northampton and has been upgraded to a "wide canal" in places and is known as the ''Nene Navigation''. It is famous for its [[guillotine lock]]s.

===Railways===
[[File:Next stop Wellingborough - geograph.org.uk - 1400370.jpg|thumb|An [[East Midlands Trains]] service approaching [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough]] on the [[Midland Main Line]]]]
Two trunk railway routes, the [[Midland Main Line]] and the [[West Coast Main Line]], cross the county. At its peak, Northamptonshire had 75 railway stations. It now has only six, at [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]] and [[Long Buckby railway station|Long Buckby]] on the West Coast Main Line, [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]], [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough]] and [[Corby railway station|Corby]] on the Midland Main Line, along with [[King's Sutton railway station|King's Sutton]], only a few yards from the boundary with Oxfordshire on the [[Chiltern Main Line]].

Before [[nationalisation]] of the railways in 1948 and the creation of [[British Rail]]ways, three of the "Big Four" railway companies operated in Northamptonshire: the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], [[London and North Eastern Railway]] and [[Great Western Railway]]. Only the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] was not represented. As of 2019, it is served by [[Chiltern Railways]], [[East Midlands Railway]], [[Avanti West Coast]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].

;Corby rail history
[[Corby]] was described as  the largest town in Britain without a railway station.<ref>{{cite news |last=Britten |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/4787477/The-17million-train-station-with-only-one-service-a-day.html |title=Corby station |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226194552/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/4787477/The-17million-train-station-with-only-one-service-a-day.html |archive-date=26 February 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The railway running through the town from Kettering to [[Oakham]] in [[Rutland]] was previously used only by freight traffic and occasional diverted passenger trains that did not stop at the station. The line through Corby was once part of a main line to [[Nottingham]] through [[Melton Mowbray]], but the stretch between Melton and Nottingham was closed in 1968. In the 1980s, an experimental passenger shuttle service ran between Corby and Kettering but was withdrawn a few years later.<ref>[http://www.nsers.org.uk/nse2.htm Network South East routes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107065315/http://www.nsers.org.uk/nse2.htm |date=7 January 2009 }}</ref> On 23 February 2009, a new [[Corby railway station|railway station]] opened, providing direct hourly access to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]]. Following the opening of Corby Station, Rushden then became the largest town in the United Kingdom without a direct railway station.

;Closed lines and stations
Railway services in Northamptonshire were reduced by the [[Beeching cuts]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smjr.info |title=SMJR |publisher=Smjr.info |date=19 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211181131/http://www.smjr.info/ |archivedate=11 December 2008  }}</ref> Closure of the line connecting Northampton to [[Peterborough]] by way of Wellingborough, [[Thrapston]], and [[Oundle]] left eastern Northamptonshire devoid of railways. Part of this route was reopened in 1977 as the [[Nene Valley Railway]]. A section of one of the closed lines, the [[Northampton to Market Harborough line]], is now the [[Northampton & Lamport Railway|Northampton & Lamport]] [[heritage railway]], while the route as a whole forms a part of the [[National Cycle Network]], as the [[Brampton Valley Way]].

As early as 1897 Northamptonshire would have had its own [[Channel Tunnel]] rail link with the creation of the [[Great Central Railway]], which was intended to connect to a tunnel under the [[English Channel]]. Although the complete project never came to fruition, the rail link through Northamptonshire was constructed, and had stations at [[Charwelton]], [[Woodford Halse]], [[Helmdon]] and [[Brackley]]. It became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 (and of British Railways in 1948) before its closure in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

;Future

In June 2009 the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] (ATOC) recommended opening a new station on the former [[Irchester railway station]] site for [[Rushden]], [[Higham Ferrers]] and [[Irchester]], called [[Rushden Parkway railway station|Rushden Parkway]].{{ATOCConnectingCommunitiesReportS10|page=19}} [[Network Rail]] is electrifying the Midland Main Line north of [[Bedford]], to Kettering and Corby.<ref name="East Mids Draft RUS">[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/east%20midlands/east%20midlands%20rus%20draft%20for%20consultation.pdf Network Rail: East Midlands Draft Route Utilisation Strategy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015151810/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/east%20midlands/east%20midlands%20rus%20draft%20for%20consultation.pdf |date=15 October 2010 }} Access date: 4 January 2010</ref> An open access company has approached Network Rail for services to [[Oakham]] in [[Rutland]] to London via the county.<ref name="East Mids Draft RUS"/>

The [[Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway]] would like to see the railway fully reopen between [[Wellingborough]] and [[Higham Ferrers]]. As part of the government-proposed [[High Speed 2]] railway line (between London and Birmingham), the [[high-speed rail]]way will go through the southern part of the county but with no station built.

===Buses===
[[File:Sywell Aerodrome.jpg|thumb|Sywell Aerodrome]]
Most buses are operated by [[Stagecoach Midlands]].  Some town area routes have been named the Corby Star, Connect Kettering, Connect Wellingborough and Daventry Dart; the last three of these routes have route designations that include a letter (such as A, D1, W1, W2). [[Stagecoach Gold bus route X4|Stagecoach's X4 route]] provides interurban links across the county, running between Northampton, Wellingborough, Kettering, Corby, Oundle, and Peterborough.

===Airports===
[[Sywell Aerodrome]], on the edge of [[Sywell]] village, has three grass runways and one concrete all-weather runway. It is, however, only 1000 metres long and therefore cannot be served by passenger jets.<ref>[http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int/eadbasic/pamslight-113B93979B7148E51E98BD22C3FF290E/7FE5QZZF3FXUS/EN/AIP/AD/EG_AD_2_EGBK_en_2011-03-10.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>

===Association football===
Northamptonshire has twenty four [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs operating in the top ten levels of the [[English football league system]]. The sport in the area is administered by the [[Northamptonshire County Football Association]], which is affiliated with the [[United Counties League]], the [[Northamptonshire Combination Football League]], the Northampton Town Football League, as well as the [[Peterborough and District Football League]] in neighbouring [[Cambridgeshire]]. Only two clubs in Northamptonshire have competed in [[The Football League]] - Northampton Town and the defunct Rushden & Diamonds.
