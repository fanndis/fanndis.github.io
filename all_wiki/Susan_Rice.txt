Rice's tenure saw significant changes in U.S.–Africa policy, including the passage of the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]], support for democratic transitions in [[South Africa]] and [[Nigeria]], and an increased U.S. focus on fighting HIV/AIDS.

After Obama won the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], Rice was nominated as Ambassador to the United Nations. The Senate confirmed her by unanimous consent on January 22, 2009.

[[Millennium Development Goals]]. She also defended [[Israel]] at the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], pushed for tough sanctions against [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervention in Libya in 2011]].

<blockquote>Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy—sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that—in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent. We do not—we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence.... Whether they were al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-16-2012-libyan-pres-magariaf-amb-rice-and-sen-mccain/|title='Face the Nation' transcripts, September 16, 2012: Libyan Pres.

Since Rice's five television appearances, there have been persistent accusations that she had intentionally misled the public. However, none of the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten Benghazi investigations]] conducted by Congress—six by Republican-controlled House committees—determined she had. The Republican-controlled [[House Intelligence Committee|House Intelligence Committee's]] two-year investigation did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people. The [[Associated Press]] reported:

<blockquote>In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |author=Ken Dilanian |date=November 21, 2014    |url=https://apnews.com/ecc3a300383445d5a90dd6ca764c9e15|title=House intel panel debunks many Benghazi theories|work=Associated Press |access-date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401212654/https://apnews.com/ecc3a300383445d5a90dd6ca764c9e15|archive-date=April 1, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

Rice testified to the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that she requested the unmasking because of a redacted report provided by the intelligence services concerning an undisclosed visit to the United States by [[United Arab Emirates]] crown prince [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] in December 2016.  During the visit al-Nahyan met with [[Steve Bannon]], [[Michael Flynn]] and [[Jared Kushner]] at [[Trump Tower]] in New York.
