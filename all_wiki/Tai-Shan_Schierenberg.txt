==Early life and career==
Tai-Shan Schierenberg was born in England<ref>[https://www.flowersgallery.com/artists/view/tai-shan-schierenberg]</ref> in 1962, the eldest of three sons to a very young Chinese mother and a German painter. As a child, he spent the first years of his life with his grandparents in Malaysia but was eventually returned to his London-based parents for the beginning of primary school..

Being taken on frequent visits to the London Museums or art galleries made him familiar with painting of all realms and ages, while drawing soon became the child's favourite activity. After extensive travels to the places of Antiquity in Greece and Asia Minor, the family settled in the Black Forest and, in pursuit of a more ecologically centred life, did some subsistence farming, while the boy, by now eleven years old, started his secondary education under the auspices of a Jesuit run grammar school nearby.  In his mid-teens, the first cautious steps towards oil painting were undertaken.

At the age of seventeen and with his secondary education completed, he left home, reconnoitred  Frankfurt and Amsterdam, drifted over to Paris, where he predominantly spent his time drawing from life at the venerable [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]].

Schierenberg eventually returned to London, where he has remained ever since. He applied to and was accepted by St. Martin's and in due course, [[Slade School|Slade School of Art]] for postgraduate studies, which he finished in 1987.<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait-list.php?search=sp&sText=Tai-Shan%20Schierenberg National Portrait Gallery collection – Tai-Shan Schierenberg]</ref>

In 1989 he won joint first prize in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]'s [[BP Portrait Award|John Player Portrait Award]], and as part of the prize, was commissioned to paint the portrait of playwright [[John Mortimer]] for the Gallery's collection. The National Portrait Gallery also holds his portraits of [[Peter Alexander Rupert Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] from 1994, [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]] 2002 and most recently [[Seamus Heaney]] from 2004. He has also executed the commission for a double portrait of the Royal Couple. His paintings can be seen at Flowers East in Hackney.

During the season Schierenberg gained "unprecedented access" to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] Football Club for the production of a [[Channel 4]] documentary called ‘The Football Club’, which is part of the channel’s ‘Artist in Residence’ series. Schierenberg sought "to understand what it was about the game that makes it so compelling", and whilst he began the project as a football cynic, he emerged as a fan of the club.<ref>[https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/west-bromwich-albion/2018/07/20/emotional-documentary-on-west-broms-season-being-aired-on-television/]</ref>
