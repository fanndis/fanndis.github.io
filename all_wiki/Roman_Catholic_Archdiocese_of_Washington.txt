The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington''' is an [[Diocese#Archdiocese|archdiocese]] of the [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic Church in the United States]]. It comprises the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]], [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] and [[Saint Mary's County, Maryland|Saint Mary's]] [[county (United States)|counties]] in the state of [[Maryland]]. It was originally part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]].

This Archdiocese crosses a state line. Three other U.S. Roman-rite dioceses ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington|Wilmington]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich|Norwich]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup|Gallup]]) also do this, but they each have territory in more than one state.

The [[Archdiocese]] of Washington is home to [[The Catholic University of America]], the only national university operated by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cua.edu/about-us/index.html|title=About Us|website=The Catholic University of America|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> and [[Georgetown University]], the oldest Catholic and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] institution of higher education in the country.

In addition, the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], a [[minor basilica]] dedicated to the nation's [[Patron saint|patroness]], the [[Immaculate Conception]], is located within and administered by it, and it is not the Archdiocesan cathedral (nor even a parish of the Archdiocese). The cathedral of the archdiocese is the [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle (Washington, D.C.)|Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] in downtown Washington.

==History==
On March 25, 1634, the first Catholic Mass in the English-speaking colonies was celebrated by Fr. Andrew White, S.J., on St. Clement's Island, Maryland, in what is now part of the Archdiocese of Washington.<ref name="site.adw.org">[http://adw.org/about/ About Us]. Archdiocese of Washington. Retrieved November 19, 2016.</ref> The Catholic founders of the Maryland settlement then established the colony as a place of religious freedom. During the colonial era, however, when others took power, Catholics would become a persecuted people suffering the wrath of oppression allowed by local penal laws.<ref name="site.adw.org"/>

Upon the founding of the United States, a [[Jesuit]] priest, Father [[John Carroll (priest)|John Carroll]], was elected head of the [[mission sui juris|missionary territory]] (later [[Prefecture Apostolic]]) of the United States. In 1789 the Diocese of Baltimore (later the Archdiocese of Baltimore) was established with Carroll as its first bishop, and given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the entire nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12386a.htm|title=Prefect Apostolic|publisher= The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>

On July 22, 1939, [[Pope Pius XII]] created the Archdiocese of Washington from territory which was then within the Archdiocese of Baltimore, with a single prelate serving as the archbishop of both archdioceses, two ecclesiastical jurisdictions united ''[[in persona episcopi]]''.<ref>{{cite book | access-date = October 20, 2020 | title = Acta Apostolicae Sedis | url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-31-1939-ocr.pdf | date= 1939 | volume = XXXI | pages= 668–70 }}</ref><ref name="created" /><ref name="site.adw.org" /> The Archdiocese dates its founding from 1939.<ref name=75ann/> On November 15, 1947, Pope Pius appointed Washington's first residential archbishop.<ref name="created" /><ref name="site.adw.org" /> The Archdiocese of Washington became a [[metropolitan see]] on October 12, 1965, when the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Thomas|Diocese of Saint Thomas]] became its first (and, so far, only) [[Suffragan diocese|suffragan see]].

===Sex abuse scandal===
On September 26, 2018, it was announced that the Archdiocese of Washington was now one of four American Catholic dioceses under investigation by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] for reports of sex abuse.<ref name=sept26>[https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2018/09/26/bishops-to-investigate-4-dioceses-after-pope-nixes-vatican-mccarrick-probe/]{{dead link|date=December 2020}}</ref> Accused former cardinal and Washington archbishop [[Theodore McCarrick]] had served in each diocese.<ref name=sept26 /> On October 15, 2018, the Archdiocese of Washington released the names of 31 clergy who served in the archdiocese and were credibly accused of sexually abusing minors since 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2018/10/15/washington-catholic-archdiocese-releases-names-priests-credibly-accused-abuse-since/|title=Washington Catholic Archdiocese releases names of 31 clergy members 'credibly accused' since 1948 of sexually abusing minors|first1=Michelle|last1=Boorstein|first2=Julie|last2=Zauzmer|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/15/washington-catholic-archdiocese-names-31-credibly-accused-priests/1653423002/|title=Washington Catholic Archdiocese names of 31 priests credibly accused of abuse since 1948|first=Kristin|last=Lam|website=USA TODAY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/16/washington-diocese-names-31-ex-clergy-accused-of-abuse|title=Washington diocese names 31 ex-clergy accused of abuse|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref> On August 15, 2019, archdiocesan priest Urbano Vazquez was convicted of four counts of sexual abuse involving two girls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/catholic-priest-found-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-girls-at-his-dc-parish/2019/08/15/677291d0-bf64-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html|title=Catholic priest found guilty of sexually abusing girls at his D.C. parish|first=Keith L.|last=Alexander|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> On November 22, 2019, Vazquez was sentenced to 15 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dc-priest-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-for-sexually-abusing-kids-at-shrine-of-the-sacred-heart|title=DC priest sentenced to 15 years in prison for sexually abusing kids at Shrine of the Sacred Heart|first=Paul|last=Wagner|date=November 22, 2019|website=FOX 5 DC}}</ref>
