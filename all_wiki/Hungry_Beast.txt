'''''Hungry Beast''''' (originally ''Projext NEXT''<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Denton's ABC Project retitled|url=http://tvtonight.com.au/2009/08/dentons-abc-project-retitled.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref>) was an [[Television in Australia|Australian television]] comedy and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] program that was broadcast on [[ABC Television]].

==Format==
The show was a half-hour program and is structured as a hybrid between a current affairs program and a satire/comedy show. The presenters were initially given a single editorial instruction: "Tell me something I don't know".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200909/programs/LE0823H001D30092009T210000.htm|title=''Hungry Beast'' (9:00pm Wednesday, 30&nbsp;Sep 2009)|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> Rather than conforming to a strict format, the final shape evolved alongside the presentation team that had been assembled.<ref name="Coleman2009-09-17">{{cite news | last = Coleman | first = Adam | date = 17 September 2009 | title = Creating a monster | work = [[inside film]] | url = http://if.com.au/2009/09/17/article/Creating-a-monster/BHUGRIXSGN.html | accessdate = 12 March 2010 }}</ref> As a result, prior to the show's debut executive producer [[Andrew Denton]] described it as "unclassifiable" due to the chaotic nature of the work, likening the show's format to the Internet.<ref name="Kalina2009-09-28">{{cite news | last = Kalina | first = Paul | date = 28 September 2009 | title = Appetite for a fresh take on the world | work = [[The Age]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/fresh-take-on-the-world/2009/09/22/1253384998717.html | accessdate = 12 March 2010 }}</ref>

Originally 19 presenters were used, but the second season saw the hosts pared down to just four, [[Kirsten Drysdale]], [[Nicholas Hayden]], [[Dan Ilic]] and [[Monique Schafter]], although some of the other presenters continue to report onscreen.<ref name="Vashti2010-03-04">{{cite news | last = Vashti | first = Lorelei | date = 4 March 2010 | title = Less frantic much improved | work = [[The Age]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv-radio/articles/2010/03/03/1267291888915.html | accessdate = 12 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Molitorisz2010-02-11">{{cite news | last = Molitorisz | first = Sacha | date = 11 February 2010 | title = Food for thought | work = [[The Age]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | page = 13 }}</ref> During the second season of Hungry Beast reporters Ali Russell and Kirk Docker were nominated for a [[Walkley Award]] for Coverage of Indigenous Affairs<ref name="Metroscreen2010-08-11">{{cite web | title=Metro Screen graduate Ali Russell nominated for a Walkley Award |date = 8 November 2010 |url = http://www.metroscreen.com.au/_blog/eNews_Congratulations/post/Metro_Screen_graduate_Ali_Russell_nominated_for_a_Walkley_Award/ }}</ref> for their story on the "Gang of 49".

==Pre-broadcast marketing==
Prior to the debut of the first series, ''Hungry Beast'''s pre-broadcast publicity incorporated perpetrating a hoax upon several Australian news agencies, in which they constructed a media release by the fictitious [[Levitt Institute]].<ref name=TheAustralian1>{{cite news|url=http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26137070-25090,00.html|title=Scam within a scam|author=Natasha Robinson|date=29 September 2009|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=News Limited}}</ref> The release discussed a report called "Deception Detection Across Australian Populations", which looked at the comparative gullibility of people in different Australian states, and the release used a website and altered [[Wikipedia]] articles to provide support for the document.<ref name=MediaWatch>{{cite web |url=http://abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2698835.htm|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|title=Deception Detection Deficiency|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref> The hoax was successful, with a number of Australian media groups, including the [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]], running stories based on the material.<ref name=NineMSN1>{{cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/868763/denton-show-owns-up-to-media-hoax|title=Denton show owns up to media hoax|date=28 September 2009|work=[[NineMSN]]|publisher=NineMSN}}</ref> When revealed, the hoax was criticised by the AAP who stated that they were "... disappointed that an individual, or organisation, would go to such lengths to take advantage of the Australian media and ultimately the Australian public."<ref name=MediaWatchAAP>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/0934_aap.pdf|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|title=AAP Response to hoax|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>
