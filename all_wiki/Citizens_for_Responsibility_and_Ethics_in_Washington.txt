'''Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington''' ('''CREW''') is a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|nonprofit 501(c)(3)]] and nonpartisan U.S. government ethics and accountability watchdog organization.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Paul|title=Citizens United Lawyer Jim Bopp Hit With Tax Complaint From Watchdog Group|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/citizens-united-jim-bopp_n_3568048.html|accessdate=November 11, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=July 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-01-03/secret-house-gop-vote-guts-ethics-panel-prompts-outcry Secret House GOP Vote Guts Ethics Panel, Prompts Outcry]; ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''; Gabrielle Levy; January 3, 2017</ref><ref name="OrgList">''Washington Information Directory 2017-2018''; [[CQ Press]]; 2017; Pg. 327</ref> Founded in 2003 as a counterweight to conservative government watchdog groups such as [[Judicial Watch]], CREW works to expose ethics violations and corruption by government officials and institutions and to reduce the role of money in politics.

Its activities include investigating, reporting and litigating government misconduct, requesting and forcing government information disclosure through [[Freedom of information legislation|FOIA]] requests, and filing congressional ethics complaints against individuals, institutions and agencies.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About CREW|publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/about|accessdate=May 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120905201513/http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/about|archivedate=September 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="OrgList"/> Its projects have included the publication of "CREW's Most Corrupt Members of Congress", an annual report in which CREW lists the people it determines to be the [[Federal government of the United States]]'s most corrupt politicians. From 2005 and 2014 the annual reports named 25 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 63 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

[[David Brock]] became CREW's chairman in 2014 and stepped down in 2016. He was replaced by [[Richard Painter]], who went on to take a leave of absence to run as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in [[United States Senate special election in Minnesota, 2018|Minnesota's 2018 U.S. Senate special election]]. Under Painter's leadership, CREW has pursued aggressive litigation against the Trump administration, which it calls the "most unethical presidency" in U.S. history. CREW filed 41 lawsuits during [[George W. Bush]]'s administration, 38 during [[Barack Obama]]'s administration and, by January 2018, 180 against the Trump administration.<ref name=gerstein/>

==History==

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington was co-founded in 2003 by [[Norman L. Eisen]] and [[Melanie Sloan]] in part as a counterweight to conservative watchdog groups such as [[Judicial Watch]]. Sloan initially ran the fledgling organization by herself; by 2007, CREW had 13 staff members.<ref name="burstyn">{{cite journal|author=Linda Burstyn|date=Winter 2007|title=The Most Feared Woman on Capitol Hill?|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/2007-02-01-mostfearedwoman.asp|website=MsMagazine.com|access-date=November 11, 2015|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208111055/http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/2007-02-01-mostfearedwoman.asp|archive-date=December 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.c-span.org/video/?286316-1/qa-melanie-sloan Q&A Interview with Melanie Sloan, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)]; CSPAN Transcripts; May 13, 2009.</ref> By 2016, the group had four lawyers on staff. 

===Chairmanships of David Brock and Richard Painter===

In August 2014, liberal political operative [[David Brock]] was elected chairman of CREW's board of directors. At the time, ''USA Today'' wrote that "One of the most vocal congressional ethics watchdog groups is becoming part of a Democratic political operation."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Singer |first1=Paul |title=Ethics watchdog drops its non-partisan veneer |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2014/08/14/ethics-watchdog-drops-its-non-partisan-veneer/81232064/ |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=USA Today |date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> ''Politico'' wrote that Brock's newly announced involvement with CREW was a "major power play that aligns liberal muscle more fully behind the Democratic Party" and that CREW would add a "more politically oriented arm, expand its focus into state politics and donor targeting and will operate in close coordination with Brock's growing fleet of aggressive Democrat-backing nonprofits and super PACs — [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], [[American Bridge 21st Century|American Bridge]], and the [[American Independent Institute]]."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth |title=David Brock expands empire |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/david-brock-citizens-for-responsibility-and-ethics-in-washington-110003 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=August 13, 2014}}</ref> Prior to Brock's involvement with CREW, the group had aggressively targeted Republican public officials as well as some Democrats. The [[Center for Public Integrity]] wrote that "Many key staffers left soon after Brock became its chairman, and since then, the organization has almost exclusively pursued Republicans and conservative organizations through federal complaints and its own investigations."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Levinthal |first1=David |title=Inside Hillary Clinton's big-money cavalry |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/07/19528/inside-hillary-clintons-big-money-cavalry |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Center for Public Integrity |date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, ''Bloomberg'' reported that Republicans had faced the vast majority of CREW investigations in recent months.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Bill |title=CREW's Watchdog Status Fades After Arrival of Democrat David Brock |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/washington-watchdog-adjusts-to-life-with-partisan-roommates |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

Brock left CREW's board of directors in December 2017, but did not cut ties with the group and continued to fundraise for it.<ref name=gerstein>{{cite news |last1=Gerstein |first1=Josh |title=Liberals cribbing from conservatives' playbook to attack Trump |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/democrats-trump-resistance-conservative-playbook-232687 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=December 16, 2016}}</ref> He was replaced by former [[George W.

In December 2016, ''Politico'' wrote that after its 2003 founding, CREW had "quickly built a strong reputation as an ethics watchdog and transparency advocate, filing complaints against lawmakers from both parties, though the bulk of its ethics work targeted Republicans. However, in recent years CREW faced increased questions about its credibility, stemming from a 2014 shift that brought the group under Brock's sway and—in the eyes of many observers—into the Clinton orbit. Brock and his allies joined the group's board, while several longtime employees left." In 2015, CREW had revenue of just under $2.2 million. CREW filed just one lawsuit in 2015 and three in 2016, all asking the [[Federal Election Commission]] for stricter enforcement of campaign finance laws.<ref name=gerstein/>

===Trump administration===
CREW has aggressively targeted the [[Donald Trump]] administration, filing its first lawsuit against Trump three days after his inauguration as U.S. president. According to ''New York'' magazine, "Since then, it has been launching actions against the administration and its allies in Congress at a rate of about one a day, filing lawsuits and public-record inquiries and lodging complaints with authorities like the Office of Government Ethics." In June 2017, ''New York'' wrote that "CREW is officially nonpartisan, but it's a thin veneer. For the last few years, it has been loosely aligned with a network of organizations, including the super-PAC American Bridge, run by Democratic operative David Brock. After the election, Brock promised to 'kick Donald Trump's ass,' saying in a fund-raising document that CREW's litigation strategy would assure Trump would be 'afflicted by a steady flow of damaging information.'" CREW co-founder [[Norman L. Eisen]] rejoined CREW in December 2016 and set about distancing the organization from Brock.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rice |first1=Andrew |title=Is Trump Inc. the President's Greatest Vulnerability? |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/donald-trump-emoluments-clause-crew.html |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=New York |date=June 12, 2017}}</ref> Eisen stepped down from the board in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=CREW Statement on Norman Eisen |url=https://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-statement-on-norman-eisen/ |publisher=CREW |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>

In January 2018, CREW issued a 36-page report on Trump's presidency, calling it the "most unethical presidency" in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pasha-Robinson |first1=Lucy |title=Donald Trump presidency 'most unethical in modern history', report finds |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-white-house-unethical-us-president-ethics-crew-report-washington-dc-a8163401.html |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=The Independent |date=January 17, 2018}}</ref> In February 2018, [[Environment & Energy Publishing]] wrote that Painter was "at the center of more than 180 legal challenges to Trump and his administration as vice chairman of the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Northey |first1=Hannah |title=Former Bush ethics czar on the 'nerd resistance,' suing Trump |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060072785 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=E&E News |date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

==Mission statements==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2018}}
The organization's website says it is "dedicated to promoting ethics and accountability in government and public life by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests."<ref name=about/> The CREW mission statement has changed several times between 2005 and 2008 to de-emphasize its focus on personal litigation, dropping language that once read that CREW "differs from other good government groups in that it sues offending politicians directly" and that it "is a non-partisan legal watchdog group working to force our government officials to behave responsibly and ethically. CREW's mission is to use the legal system to expose government officials who betray the public interest by serving special interests. CREW aims to counterbalance the conservative legal watchdog groups that made such a strong impact over the past decade". It added that CREW "advances its mission using a combination of research, litigation and media outreach."<ref name="RollCall"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/ |title=Original Mission Statement; website - 2003 |access-date=2004-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040730122215/http://www.citizensforethics.org/ |archive-date=2004-07-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2015, the organization's mission stated, "CREW uses high-impact legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests <small>[...]</small> we work to ensure government officials — regardless of party affiliation — act with honesty and integrity and merit the public trust."<ref>[http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/mission CREW Mission statement] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151202225914/http%3A//www.citizensforethics.org/pages/mission |date=2015-12-02 }}; CitizensForEthics.org; accessed December 15, 2015.</ref>

As of 2018, the organization's mission states, "Dedicated to fighting the influence of money on our political system. CREW uses aggressive legal action, in-depth research, and bold communications to reduce the influence of money in politics and help foster a government that is ethical and accountable. We highlight abuses, change behavior, and lay the groundwork for new policies and approaches that encourage public officials to work for the benefit of the people, not powerful interests."<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.citizensforethics.org/|publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref>

According to the organization, its activities include litigation, [[Freedom of information legislation|FOIA]] requests, congressional ethics complaints, [[Internal Revenue Service]] complaints, [[Federal Election Commission]] complaints, and requests for investigation with government agencies.<ref name="about"/>

In 2012, CREW released a report entitled ''Family Affair'', which examined how members of Congress had used their positions to benefit themselves and their families.

;FOIA requests for emails
In 2012, after learning that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson had used an alias email account to conduct government business, CREW submitted an FOIA request for "records sufficient to show the number of email accounts of or associated with Secretary Hilary Rodham Clinton, and the extent to which those email accounts are identifiable as those of or associated with Secretary Clinton."<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/116565335/FOIA-Request-CREW-Department-of-State-Regarding-Alias-Email-Accounts-12-6-2012 FOIA Request].

;Criticism of Continuing Appropriations Resolution
CREW raised questions about some of the content of the [[Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59; 113th Congress)]]. One controversial provision of the bill was section 134, which stated that "notwithstanding any other provision of this joint resolution, there is appropriated for payment to Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg, widow of [[Frank Lautenberg|Frank R.

==Personnel==
Norman L. Eisen, an attorney specializing in fraud, and eventual (in 2009) Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform in the White House, co-founded CREW in 2003.

==Allegations of partisanship==
CREW operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit prohibited from engaging in partisan activity. In 2010, [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] of ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' described CREW's founding in 2003 as "one of a wave of new groups backed by liberal donors" and called CREW "a vehicle for assaults on largely – but not entirely – Republican targets",<ref name=staffing>Ben Smith, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1110/Staffing_up_for_Congressional_investigations.html "Staffing up for Congressional investigations"], Politico.com, November 18, 2010.</ref> but a 2010 Associated Press story stated that CREW "has a history of targeting members of Congress representing different races, philosophies and both major parties."<ref>{{cite news|last=McGill|first=Kevin|title=Watchdog group seeks Senate probe of Vitter|url=http://www.sulphurdailynews.com/article/20100923/NEWS/309239969|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=Sulphur Daily News|agency=Associated Press|date=September 22, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130719153401/http://www.sulphurdailynews.com/article/20100923/NEWS/309239969|archivedate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

After CREW named him one of the "13 most corrupt members of Congress" in 2005, U.S. Senator [[Conrad Burns]] (R-MT) called the group "partisan hacks" and their allegations "maliciously false". The ''[[Billings Gazette]]'' reported that CREW defended itself:<ref name="bill">{{cite web|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_052d5c44-e769-5e49-a056-d9c85abc56a8.html|title=Burns calls 'corrupt' label from group 'maliciously false'|accessdate=2008-07-31|last=Johnson|first=Charles S.|date=2005-10-02|work=[[Billings Gazette]]}}</ref> Naomi Seligman, the group's deputy director, said "We've gone after a fair number of Democrats, even in this study" [and Burns] "should be answering the charges, not slinging charges."

In 2006, ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' reported, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has taken aim almost exclusively at GOP members of Congress. Since its founding in 2003, it [helped] investigate 21 lawmakers, only one of them a Democrat" (Senator [[Blanche Lincoln]] of Arkansas, in a complaint that also targeted Senator [[Bill Frist]] (R-TN), then Senate Majority Leader).<ref name=TheHill0306>{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Watchdog's tax status, politics are questioned|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 14, 2006}}</ref><ref>''Congressional Quarterly Weekly'', volume 65, p. 107</ref> A report by ''[[McClatchy News Service]]'' called CREW "a Democratic-leaning watchdog group".<ref name="McClatchy3">Greg Gordon,[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/incoming/article24458383.html "Congressman in tight race for re-election comes under federal investigation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208234747/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/incoming/article24458383.html |date=2015-12-08 }}, mcclatchydc.com, October 13, 2006.</ref>

In 2007, ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' quoted longtime Democratic pollster [[Celinda Lake]] as saying, "Corruption was a top issue in the [2006] midterm elections, and CREW was critical to the Democrats' success. The fact that they were bipartisan and had created this dirty-dozen list of corrupt politicians really helped people process that these politicians were acting well outside the norm."<ref name="burstyn"/>

The journal ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' described CREW's former chief legal counsel, Anne Weismann, as "a Democrat-recommended witness and so the closest to an administration defender".<ref name="Transparency">[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/467737-House_Republicans_Hammer_White_House_on_Transparency.php online "House Republicans Hammer White House on Transparency"], Broadcasting & Cable magazine, May 3, 2011.</ref> In April 2011, CREW was described as "left-leaning" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''.

When asked in 2014 if CREW would continue pursuing complaints against Democrats, Brock responded, "No party has a monopoly on corruption and at this early juncture, we are not making categorical statements about anything that we will and won't do. Having said that, our experience has been that the vast amount of violations of the public trust can be found on the conservative side of the aisle."<ref name=vogel/> During a span of "recent months" in early 2016, Republicans were reportedly the target of the vast majority of CREW's campaign-finance allegations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Bill |title=CREW's Watchdog Status Fades After Arrival of Democrat David Brock |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/washington-watchdog-adjusts-to-life-with-partisan-roommates |accessdate=17 July 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

===''Roll Call'' article===
''[[Roll Call]]'' reported in January 2008 that CREW files most of its complaints against members of Congress, and "all but a handful ... have targeted Republicans". The article stated that CREW had issued press releases against Democrats but had usually not filed complaints against them, with the exception of now former Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA), a conservative Democrat.<ref name="RollCall">{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_85/-21796-1.html|title=Watchdog, Donors Share Common Foes|accessdate=2010-04-02|last=Singer|first=Paul|date=2008-01-29|work=[[Roll Call]]|quote=CREW has named Democratic Reps. [[John Murtha]] (Pa.), [[Alan Mollohan]] (W.Va.) and [[Maxine Waters]] (Calif.) to its "most corrupt" list, but never has released a separate ethics complaint against any of them.
}}</ref> CREW defended itself to ''Roll Call'':

{{quote|"CREW is a nonpartisan organization that targets unethical conduct", [Deputy Director Naomi] Seligman wrote... "Now that the Democrats are in power, they will have opportunities for corruption that were previously reserved to Republicans and it is likely we will see more Democratic corruption."}}

After the article was published, CREW stated that it was "baseless" and "omitted key facts". CREW suggested the ''Roll Call'' reporter had been prompted by a conversation with Landrieu, the target of a recent CREW lawsuit at the time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101202034914/http://citizensforethics.org/taxonomy/term/1200 CREW archives]; accessed November 11, 2015.</ref>

==Funding==
''Roll Call'' reported that CREW doesn't disclose its donor list, and quoted former Deputy Director Naomi Seligman as saying that "donors play no role in CREW's decisions as to the groups or politicians we target."<ref name="RollCall"/> Donors to CREW have included such groups as [[Democracy Alliance]], [[Service Employees International Union]], the [[Arca Foundation]],<ref>[http://www.arcafoundation.org/history.htm Arca Foundation]</ref> and the [[Gill Foundation]].<ref name=RollCall/><ref name=ADG>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2009/sep/24/inquiry-sought-ross-deal-20090924|title=Inquiry is sought in Ross deal|accessdate=2010-04-03|last=Daniels|first=Alex|date=2009-09-24|work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]}}</ref><ref name=WP>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html|title=A New Alliance Of Democrats Spreads Funding: But Some in Party Bristle At Secrecy and Liberal Tilt|accessdate=2010-04-04|last=VandeHei|first=Jim|date=2006-07-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In January 2012, [[Democracy Alliance]] dropped a number of prominent organizations, including CREW, from their list of recommended organizations to receive donations. Support was withdrawn because these groups are more apt to work outside the Democratic Party's infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/democracy-alliance-dumps-_n_1306867.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Ryan|last=Grim|title=Liberal Donor Network Dumps Progressive Organizations|date=2012-02-28}}</ref>
