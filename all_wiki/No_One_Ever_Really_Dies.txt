''No One Ever Really Dies'' received positive reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 74, based on 17 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="Metacritic"/>

In a four out of five star review for [[AllMusic]], critic Andy Kellman claimed that "Tied together with recurring declarations of "mad ethnic right now," sampled from Retch's 2016 viral clip, the album is all raucous resistance to issues ranging from anti-immigration to police brutality to transgender rights. When Williams barks "You fuckin' with survivors!" like an activist Rockwell, he perfectly summarizes the indignant optimism that dominates the best N.E.R.D album since the original version of [[In Search of... (N.E.R.D album)|In Search of....]]"<ref name="AllMusic"/>
