[[Referendum]]s (or referenda) are held only occasionally by the Government of [[New Zealand]]. Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.

==Government referendums==
The government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.

This has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.

Recent examples are the [[2015–2016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.

===Constitutional referendums===
There is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].

There are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.

===Liquor licensing referendums===
In New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.

===Other referendums===
The government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]]. For the 2020 referendum on Voluntary Euthanasia, it was originally meant to be passed as a bill of parliament but New Zealand First threatened to vote it down if it wasn't considered to be voted by the people during the [[2020 New Zealand general election| 2020 election]]. The 2020 Cannabis referendum was based on the Confidence and Supply agreement between the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]].

==Citizens Initiated Referenda==
{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}
The [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.

There are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.

Within one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.

New Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of "direct democracy". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, "In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System "Towards a Better Democracy" [1986–1987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>

A total of 48 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.

===Firefighters===
The first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question "Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?" aimed to elicit a "no" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted "Yes" and almost 88% voted "No".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>

===1999 election===
At the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.

The other referendum held in 1999 asked "Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>

===Parental corporal punishment===
{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}
Following the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached. Supporters were hoping for the referendum to be held alongside the 8 November general election, but it was decided by Parliament to hold the referendum by postal ballot between 31 July and 21 August 2009.

The question asked was "Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?"

Voter turnout was 56.1 percent. While 87.4 percent of votes answered 'no',<ref name="results">{{cite web |url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/2009_citizens_referendum/2009_referendum_results.html |title=Final Result by Electorate for the Citizens Initiated Referendum 2009 on the question "Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?" |publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2009}}</ref> the question drew widespread criticism from the public, parliament, and even the Prime Minister John Key for being a [[loaded question]] and for the use of the value-judgement 'good'.<ref name=DrSeuss>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10580151 |title=Key sees merit in Greens' referendum bill |author=Trevett, Claire |date=23 June 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

===Opponents of citizens initiated referendums===
The perceived lack of implementation<!----The fire-fighters was implemented and you could argue that the criminal justice one has been implemented.  The only clear cases of non-implementation are the 99MP and smacking CIRs----> of successful referendums has led to calls for such referendums to be made binding on the government of the day, similar to the direct democracy said to exist in [[Switzerland]]. [[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].

By contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="3News_131865">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: "Heidi Ho": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>

Even amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious. The [[Maxim Institute]] has announced its opposition to binding citizens referendums, citing the adverse fiscal management consequences that have ensued in the state of [[California]] in a recent paper from Richard Ekins, a [[University of Auckland]] legal academic.<ref>Richard Ekins: "A Government for the People: The Value of Representative Democracy": http://www.maxim.org.nz/files/pdf/a_government_for_the_people.pdf</ref> Former New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Binding-referenda-not-a-good-idea---Key/tabid/419/articleID/130818/Default.aspx |title=New Zealand's latest news, sport, entertainment, politics, business |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, a key problem with that argument is that ballot initiatives only make up 2% of the Californian state budget, once Proposition 98 is removed from the equation (Proposition 98 locks in education spending which probably would have been spent anyway and had always occupied about one-third of the Californian budget).<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=476443</ref>

During 2009, there was additional criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at [[Otago University]]. They argue that CIRs are no substitute for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of [[representative democracy]], such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions.<ref>Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton: "Citizens Initiated Referenda" New Zealand Law Journal (October 2009): 334-6</ref>
