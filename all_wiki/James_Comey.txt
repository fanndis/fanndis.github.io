In an October 23 speech at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], Comey said:<blockquote>I remember being asked why we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs. My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These are the guys we lock up because they are the predators choking off the life of a community. We did this work because we believed that all lives matter, especially the most vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web |first=James |last=Comey |title=Law Enforcement and the Communities We Serve: Bending the Lines Toward Safety and Justice |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/law-enforcement-and-the-communities-we-serve-bending-the-lines-toward-safety-and-justice |accessdate=November 10, 2019 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=October 23, 2015 }}</ref></blockquote>

According to reports, Trump had been openly talking to aides about finding a reason to fire Comey for at least a week before both the dismissal and the request of memoranda from Sessions and Rosenstein the day prior. Trump was angry and frustrated when, in the week prior to his dismissal, Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He felt Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not enough to internal leaks to the press from within the government.<ref name="auto"/><ref name=anger>{{cite news |last1=Rucker |first1=Philip |last2=Parker |first2=Ashley|last3=Barrett|first3=Devlin|last4=Costa|first4=Robert|title=Inside Trump's anger and impatience – and his sudden decision to fire Comey |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trumps-anger-and-impatience-prompted-him-to-fire-the-fbi-director/2017/05/10/d9642334-359c-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html |date=May 10, 2017 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 10, 2019 }}</ref> Shortly before Comey was fired, he had requested additional money and resources to further expand the probe into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference into the Presidential election]].<ref name=NYT11may17/> Trump had long questioned Comey's loyalty to him personally and Comey's judgment to act accordingly.<ref name=enough/> Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President [[Barack Obama]] had his campaign offices wiretapped.<ref name=anger /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/fbi/332880-trump-mad-comey-would-not-back-wiretap-claims-report |title=Trump angry Comey would not back wiretap claims about Obama: report |first=Mark |last=Hensch |date=May 10, 2017 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=November 10, 2019 }}</ref>

On June 22, after the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary committee]] threatened the White House with a potential [[subpoena]] for the alleged tapes, Trump issued a tweet stating "I have no idea [...] whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings."<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 22, 2017 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/22/trump-says-he-has-no-recordings-of-his-comey-talks-239862 |title=Trump says he has no Comey tapes |work=[[Politico]] |first1=Nolan D. |last1=McCaskill |first2=Josh |last2=Dawsey |access-date=November 6, 2018 }}</ref> Hours later, when asked to clarify the [[non-denial denial]] wording of Trump's tweet regarding the tapes, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] stated that Trump's tweet was "extremely clear" and that she did "not have anything to add."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/22/donald-trump-says-he-has-no-tapes-james-comey-conv/ |title=Donald Trump says he has no tapes of James Comey's conversations |work=[[The Washington Times]] |first=Dave |last=Boyer |date=June 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 10, 2019 }}</ref> Questions raised for clarification on Trump's tweet centered principally on whether Trump ever had knowledge of said tapes having ever existed and whether he is simply no longer privy to the knowledge of whether said tapes still exist; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump having made said tapes or recordings; and whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump currently having or previously having had in their possession said tapes or recordings. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] [[Adam Schiff]] (D-CA), stated that Trump's tweet "raises as many questions as it answers," and that in any event, the tweet did not comply with the June 23 deadline, and that Schiff would move forward with subpoenas for the tapes, adding that "[r]egardless of whether the President intends his tweets to be an official reply to the House Intelligence Committee, the White House must respond in writing to our committee as to whether any tapes or recordings exist."<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Edelman |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-denies-comey-tapes-won-deny-recordings-exist-article-1.3269174 |title=Trump denies having Comey tapes — but won't deny recordings exist |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=January 29, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 2017, Comey gave the convocation speech and a series of lectures at [[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black university]] in Washington, D.C., In the fall of 2018, Comey returned to his alma mater, [[the College of William & Mary]], to teach a course on ethical leadership. He became an executive professor in education, a non-tenured position at the College.

In February 2019, in the midst of controversy surrounding a [[blackface]] picture in new Virginia governor [[Ralph Northam]]'s medical school [[yearbook]], and a national debate about the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]], Comey published an [[op-ed]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', suggesting that Virginia should get rid of [[List of Confederate monuments and memorials in Virginia#Monument Avenue|the Confederate statues in Richmond]]: "Expressing bipartisan horror at blackface photos is essential, but removing the statues would show all of America that Virginia really has changed."<ref>{{cite news |title=Take down the Confederate statues now |first=James |last=Comey |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 7, 2019 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/blackface-is-a-tool-of-white-oppression-there-are-many-moer-towering-over-us/2019/02/07/4ea303b6-2b11-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html |accessdate=November 10, 2019 }}</ref>

In a May 2019 op-ed published in the ''New York Times'', as Attorney General William Barr was scheduled to be questioned in congressional hearings, Comey wrote: "Accomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2019/05/02/former-fbi-director-james-comey-trump-eats-your-soul-in-small-bites/ |title=Former FBI Director James Comey: "Trump eats your soul in small bites" |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=May 2, 2019 |first=Shira |last=Tarlo |accessdate=November 10, 2019 }}</ref> He concluded with, "Of course, to stay, you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises.
