The '''Ministry for State Security''' ({{lang-de|Ministerium für Staatssicherheit}}, '''MfS''' ({{IPA-de|ɛmɛfˈʔɛs|lang|De-MfS.ogg}}) or '''State Security Service''' ({{lang|de|Staatssicherheitsdienst}}, SSD), commonly known as the '''{{lang|de|Stasi}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaːziː|lang|De-Stasi.ogg}}),<ref group="n">An abbreviation of {{lang|de|'''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit}}.</ref> was the official state security service of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).

The Stasi motto was {{lang|de|Schild und Schwert der Partei}} (Shield and Sword of the Party), referring to the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands}}, SED) and also echoing a theme of the [[KGB]], the Soviet counterpart and close partner, with respect to its own ruling party, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)]]. [[Erich Mielke]] was the Stasi's longest-serving chief, in power for 32 of the 40 years of the GDR's existence.

One of the Stasi's main tasks was spying on the population, primarily through a vast network of citizens turned informants, and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures, including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents ({{lang|de|[[Zersetzung]]}}, literally meaning "decomposition"). It arrested 250,000 people as political prisoners during its existence.<ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/east-germanys-inescapable-hohensch%C3%B6nhausen-prison/a-17982535 East Germany's inescapable Hohenschönhausen prison], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 9 October 2014.</ref> Its [[Main Directorate for Reconnaissance]] ({{lang|de|Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung}}) was responsible both for [[espionage]] and for conducting [[covert operation]]s in foreign countries. Under its long-time head [[Markus Wolf]], this directorate gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the [[Cold War]].

Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990. After [[German reunification]], the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were opened, so that all citizens could inspect their personal file on request. These files are now maintained by the [[Stasi Records Agency]].

==Creation==
The Stasi was founded on 8 February 1950.<ref name="Glees1996">{{cite book|last=Glees|first=Anthony|title=Reinventing Germany: German political development since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-f-6xq2mvQC&pg=PA213|year=1996|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-185-7|page=213}}</ref> [[Wilhelm Zaisser]] was the first Minister of State Security of the GDR, and [[Erich Mielke]] was his deputy. Zaisser tried to depose SED General Secretary [[Walter Ulbricht]] after the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany|June 1953 uprising]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzmNb84n7sUC |pages=53–85 |title=The East German Leadership, 1946-73: Conflict and Crisis |isbn=9780719054983 |last1=Grieder |first1=Peter |year=1999 }}</ref> but was instead removed by Ulbricht and replaced with [[Ernst Wollweber]] thereafter. Following the June 1953 uprising, the [[Politburo|Politbüro]] decided to downgrade the apparatus to a State Secretariat and incorporate it under the Ministry of Interior under the leadership of [[Willi Stoph]]. The Minister of State Security simultaneously became a State Secretary of State Security. The Stasi held this status until November 1955, when it was restored to a ministry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gieseke |first=Jens |date=2014 |title=The History of the Stasi: East Germany's Secret Police, 1945-1990 |location=[[Oxford]] |edition=1st |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |pages=41–42 |isbn=978-1-78238-254-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ghouas |first=Nessim |date=2004 |title=The Conditions, Means and Methods of the MfS in the GDR; An Analysis of the Post and Telephone Control|location=[[Göttingen]] |edition=1st |publisher=Cuvillier Verlag  |page=80 |isbn=3-89873-988-0 }}</ref> Wollweber resigned in 1957 after clashes with Ulbricht and [[Erich Honecker]], and was succeeded by his deputy, Erich Mielke.

In 1957, [[Markus Wolf]] became head of the [[General Reconnaissance Administration|Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung]] (HVA) (Main Reconnaissance Administration), the foreign intelligence section of the Stasi. As intelligence chief, Wolf achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of [[West Germany]] with spies. The most influential case was that of [[Günter Guillaume]], which led to the downfall of West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] in May 1974. In 1986, Wolf retired and was succeeded by [[Werner Grossmann]].

==Relationship with the KGB==
{{see also|Eastern Bloc politics|Eastern Bloc information dissemination|Active measures}}

Although Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the [[KGB]] continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany.<ref name="koehler74">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=74}}</ref> Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]] to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as "[[Cheka|Chekists]] of the Soviet Union".<ref name="koehler74"/> In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers that they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.<ref name="koehler74"/>

==Organization==
The Ministry for State Security was organized according to the ''Line principle''. A high-ranking official was in charge of a particular mission of the Ministry and headed a division in the '''''Central Apparatus''''' (''Zentrale''). A corresponding division was organized in each of the 15 '''''District Departments for State Security''''' (''Bezirksverwaltungen für Staatssicherheit'' in the Berlin Capital Region and 14 regional districts ([[Administrative divisions of East Germany|''Bezirke'']])). At the local level the Stasi had '''''Area Precincts for State Security''''' (''Bezirksverwaltungen für Staatssicherheit'' - one each for the 227 cities and municipal districts and the 11 city boroughs (''Stadtbezirken'') of East Berlin). A single case officer held responsibility for the particular mission in each area precinct. The line principle meant that the case officers were subordinated to the specialized divisions at the district departments. The specialized divisions at the district departments were subordinated to the specialized division in the central apparatus and the whole line was under the direct command and control of the high-ranking Stasi officer in charge of the mission. The Stasi also fielded '''''Location Detachments''''' (''Objektdienststellen'') at state-owned enterprises of high importance (such as the joint USSR-East German Wismar uranium mining company). Shortly before the transformation of the Stasi into the Office of National Security the Ministry had the following structure:

Selected Stasi departments:

* ''Administration 12'' was responsible for the surveillance of mail and telephone communications.
* ''Administration 2000'' was responsible for the reliability of [[National People's Army]] (''Nationale Volksarmee'', NVA) personnel. ''Administration 2000'' operated a secret, unofficial network of informants within the NVA. ''Administration 2000'' was the name of the division in NVA documentation. Its actual Stasi name was ''Main Division I''.
* ''Administration for Security of Heavy Industry and Research'' and ''Main Administration for Security of the Economy:'' protection against sabotage or espionage.
* ''Division of Garbage Analysis:'' was responsible for analyzing garbage for any suspect western foods and/or materials.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot find this division referenced in Stasi materials|date=March 2018}}
* [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]]: the armed force at disposal of the ministry, named for the founder of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik secret police. The members of this regiment, who served at least three years, were responsible for protecting high government and party buildings and personnel. The regiment was composed of six motorized rifle battalions, one artillery battalion, and one training battalion. Its equipment included [[PSZH-IV]] armored personnel carriers, 120&nbsp;mm mortars, 85&nbsp;mm and 100&nbsp;mm antitank guns, ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, and helicopters. A Swiss source reported in 1986 that the troops of the Ministry of State Security also had commando units similar to the Soviet Union's [[Spetsnaz GRU]] forces. These East German units were said to wear the uniform of the airborne troops, although with the violet collar patch of the Ministry for State Security rather than the orange one of paratroopers. They also wore the sleeve stripe of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-5174.html|title=East Germany - Agencies of the Ministry of State Security|publisher=Country-data.com|date=July 1987|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>
* Guard and Security Unit (''Wach- und Sicherungseinheit'' (''WSE'')) each of the 15 district departments had its own GSU, directly subordinated to the district department chief. The manpower of the units ranged roughly between 200 and 400 men. They had four roles - security of the Stasi headquarters in the district, combat training of personnel of the district department, initial posting for newly appointed Stasi officers for a couple of years until their careers advance to specialized positions and (most importantly) Quick Reaction Alert tactical intervention units. As such the GSUs were armed and equipped as motor rifle units with APCs, automatic rifles, grenade launchers etc.
*HVA: focused its efforts primarily on [[West Germany]] and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], but it also operated East German intelligence in all foreign countries.
* ''Main Administration for Struggle Against Suspicious Persons'' was charged with the surveillance of foreigners—particularly from the West—legally traveling or residing within the country. This included the diplomatic community, tourists, and official guests.
* ''Main Coordinating Administration of the Ministry for State Security:'' coordinated its work with Soviet intelligence agencies.
* ''Main Department for Communications Security and Personnel Protection:'' provided personal security for the national leadership and maintained and operated an internal secure communications system for the government.
* ''Penal System:'' to facilitate its mission of enforcing the political security of East Germany, the Stasi operated its own penal system, distinct from that of the Ministry of the Interior. This system comprised prison camps for political, as opposed to criminal, offenders.

Between 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy.<ref name="koehler8">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|pp=8–9}}</ref><ref name="Fulbrook 2005 228">{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|pp=228}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Political prisoners in the German Democratic Republic|url=https://communistcrimes.org/en/political-prisoners-german-democratic-republic|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Political prisoners in the German Democratic Republic  {{!}} Communist Crimes|language=en}}</ref> In 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 people full-time, including 2,000 fully employed unofficial collaborators, 13,073 soldiers and 2,232 officers of GDR army,<ref>Gieseke 2001, pp. 86–87</ref> along with 173,081 unofficial informants inside GDR<ref>Müller-Enbergs 1993, p. 55</ref> and 1,553 informants in West Germany.<ref>Gieseke 2001, p. 58</ref>

Regular commissioned Stasi officers were recruited from conscripts who had been honourably discharged from their 18 months' compulsory military service, had been members of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]], had had a high level of participation in [[Free German Youth|the Party's youth wing's]] activities and had been Stasi informers during their service in the Military. The candidates would then have to be recommended by their military unit political officers and Stasi agents, the local chiefs of the District ([[Bezirk]]) Stasi and [[Volkspolizei]] office, of the district in which they were permanently resident, and the District Secretary of the SED. These candidates were then made to sit through several tests and exams, which identified their intellectual capacity to be an officer, and their political reliability. University graduates who had completed their military service did not need to take these tests and exams. They then attended a two-year officer training programme at the Stasi college (''Hochschule'') in Potsdam. Less mentally and academically endowed candidates were made ordinary technicians and attended a one-year technology-intensive course for non-commissioned officers.

By 1995, some 174,000 [[informal collaborator|''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' (IMs)]] Stasi informants had been identified, almost 2.5% of East Germany's population between the ages of 18 and 60.<ref name="koehler8"/> 10,000 IMs were under 18 years of age.<ref name="koehler8"/> From the volume of material destroyed in the final days of the regime, the office of the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] (BStU) believes that there could have been as many as 500,000 informers.<ref name="koehler8"/> A former Stasi colonel who served in the counterintelligence directorate estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included.<ref name="koehler8"/> There is significant debate about how many IMs were actually employed.

===Infiltration===
[[image:Main entrance to the Stasi Museum October 2015.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The main entrance to the Stasi headquarters in Berlin]]
Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants (the extensiveness of any surveillance largely depended on how valuable a product was to the economy)<ref name="Fulbrook 2005 228"/> and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the [[Volkspolizei]] (Vopo). Spies reported every relative or friend who stayed the night at another's apartment. Tiny holes were drilled in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras. Schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated,<ref name="koehler9">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=9}}</ref> as were organizations, such as [[computer club (user group)|computer club]]s where teenagers exchanged Western video games.<ref name="gießler20181121">{{Cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/digital/games/2018-11/computer-games-gdr-stasi-surveillance-gamer-crowd/komplettansicht |title=Video Games in East Germany: The Stasi Played Along |last=Gießler |first=Denis |date=2018-11-21 |work=Die Zeit |access-date=2018-11-30 |language=de}}</ref>

The Stasi had formal categorizations of each type of informant, and had official guidelines on how to extract information from, and control, those with whom they came into contact.<ref>{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|p=241}}</ref> The roles of informants ranged from those already in some way involved in state security (such as the police and the armed services) to those in the dissident movements (such as in the arts and the [[Protestant Church]]).<ref name="Fulbrook 2005 242–243">{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|pp=242–243}}</ref> Information gathered about the latter groups was frequently used to divide or discredit members.<ref>{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|pp=245}}</ref> Informants were made to feel important, given material or social incentives, and were imbued with a sense of adventure, and only around 7.7%, according to official figures, were coerced into cooperating. A significant proportion of those informing were members of the SED. Use of some form of blackmail was not uncommon.<ref name="Fulbrook 2005 242–243"/> A large number of Stasi informants were tram conductors, janitors, doctors, nurses and teachers. Mielke believed that the best informants were those whose jobs entailed frequent contact with the public.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>

The Stasi's ranks swelled considerably after [[Eastern Bloc]] countries signed the 1975 [[Helsinki accords]], which GDR leader [[Erich Honecker]] viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect "human and basic rights, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction".<ref name="koehler142">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=142}}</ref> The number of IMs peaked at around 180,000 in that year, having slowly risen from 20,000 to 30,000 in the early 1950s, and reaching 100,000 for the first time in 1968, in response to ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' and [[Protests of 1968|protests worldwide]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|pp=240}}</ref> The Stasi also acted as a proxy for KGB to conduct activities in other Eastern Bloc countries, such as [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], where the Soviets were despised.<ref name="koehler76">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=76}}</ref>

The Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of GDR life. In the mid-1980s, a network of IMs began growing in both German states. By the time that East Germany collapsed in 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 employees and 173,081 informants.<ref>Gieseke 2001, p. 54</ref> About one out of every 63 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi. By at least one estimate, the Stasi maintained greater surveillance over its own people than any secret police force in history.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6692895.stm Computers to solve stasi puzzle]''-[[BBC]], Friday 25 May 2007.</ref> The Stasi employed one secret policeman for every 166 East Germans. By comparison, the [[Gestapo]] deployed one secret policeman per 2,000 people. As ubiquitous as this was, the ratios swelled when informers were factored in: counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one agent per 6.5 people. This comparison led Nazi hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] to call the Stasi even more oppressive than the Gestapo.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/koehler-stasi.html|title=Stasi|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany's government and spy agencies.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In some cases, spouses even spied on each other. A high-profile example of this was peace activist [[Vera Lengsfeld]], whose husband, Knud Wollenberger, was a Stasi informant.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

===''Zersetzung''===
{{main|Zersetzung}}
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2012}}
The Stasi perfected the technique of [[psychological harassment]] of perceived enemies known as ''Zersetzung'' ({{IPA-de|ʦɛɐ̯ˈzɛtsʊŋ|pron}}) – a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means "[[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]]".
{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#E9F7FF; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 90%;" cellspacing="5"
|style="text-align: left;"| ...the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung, and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally "biodegradation". But actually, it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people, for example by damaging their reputation, by organizing failures in their work, and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them, and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions.

|style="text-align: left;"|—Hubertus Knabe, German historian <ref name="ted.com">[http://www.ted.com/talks/hubertus_knabe_the_dark_secrets_of_a_surveillance_state/transcript Hubertus Knabe: The dark secrets of a surveillance state], TED Salon, Berlin, 2014</ref>
|}

By the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that the methods of overt persecution that had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even its exact nature. ''Zersetzung'' was designed to side-track and "switch off" perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any "inappropriate" activities.

Tactics employed under ''Zersetzung'' generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks, such as breaking into homes and subtly manipulating the contents, in a form of [[gaslighting]] – moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, [[smear campaign]]s including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, [[False accusation|denunciation]], [[Agent provocateur|provocation]], [[psychological warfare]], [[psychological subversion]], [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]], [[Covert listening device|bugging]], mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] to a target's wife. Usually, victims had no idea that the Stasi were responsible. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result.

One great advantage of the [[harassment]] perpetrated under ''Zersetzung'' was that its subtle nature meant that it was able to be [[Plausible deniability|plausibly denied]]. This was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 80s, especially in conjunction with the ''Ostpolitik'' of West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] massively improving relations between the two German states.

==Fall of the Soviet Union==
Recruitment of informants became increasingly difficult towards the end of the GDR's existence, and, after 1986, there was a negative turnover rate of IMs. This had a significant impact on the Stasi's ability to survey the populace, in a period of growing unrest, and knowledge of the Stasi's activities became more widespread.<ref>{{harvnb|Fulbrook|2005|pp=242}}</ref> Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country's economic difficulties becoming a political problem, through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced, but it failed to do so.<ref name="Fulbrook 2005 228"/>

Stasi officers reportedly had discussed re-branding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West, which in actuality would have been taken over by Stasi officers. The plan specified 2,587 OibE officers (''Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz'', "officers on special assignment") who would have assumed power as detailed in the Top Secret Document 0008-6/86 of 17 March 1986.<ref name="Spiegel 12.03.1990"/><ref name="From Russia With Death"/> According to [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], the chief intelligence officer in [[communist Romania]], other communist intelligence services had similar plans.<ref name="From Russia With Death">"Symposium: From Russia With Death" (a partial transcript: [http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/fp/ARTICLES/Read4190-2.html?ID=26509&p=1 part1]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, [http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/fp/ARTICLES/Read91ff.html?ID=26510&p=1 part2]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}) on 19 January 2007.

On 7 November 1989, in response to the rapidly changing political and social situation in the GDR in late 1989, Erich Mielke resigned. On 17 November 1989, the Council of Ministers ''([[Ministerrat]] der DDR)'' renamed the Stasi the "Office for National Security" ''(Amt für Nationale Sicherheit'' – AfNS), which was headed by ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Wolfgang Schwanitz]]. On 8 December 1989, GDR [[Prime Minister]] [[Hans Modrow]] directed the dissolution of the AfNS, which was confirmed by a decision of the ''Ministerrat'' on 14 December 1989.

As part of this decision, the ''Ministerrat'' originally called for the evolution of the AfNS into two separate organizations: a new foreign intelligence service ''(Nachrichtendienst der DDR)'' and an "Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR" ''(Verfassungsschutz der DDR)'', along the lines of the West German ''[[Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz]]'', however, the public reaction was extremely negative, and under pressure from the "Round Table" ''(Runder Tisch)'', the government dropped the creation of the ''Verfassungsschutz der DDR'' and directed the immediate dissolution of the AfNS on 13 January 1990. Certain functions of the AfNS reasonably related to law enforcement were handed over to the GDR Ministry of Internal Affairs. The same ministry also took guardianship of remaining AfNS facilities.

When the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], it found out that East Germany had transferred large amounts of money to [[Martin Schlaff]] through accounts in [[Vaduz]], the capital of [[Liechtenstein]], in return for goods "under Western embargo".

Moreover, high-ranking Stasi officers continued their post-GDR careers in management positions in Schlaff's group of companies. For example, in 1990, Herbert Kohler, Stasi commander in Dresden, transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for "harddisks" and months later went to work for him.<ref name="Martin Schlaff">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-laundered-funds-business-ties-to-the-stasi-1.312799|title=The Schlaff Saga / Laundered funds & 'business' ties to the Stasi|date=7 September 2010|work=Haaretz}}</ref><ref name="gazoviki"/>

During the [[Peaceful Revolution (German)|Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989, Stasi offices and prisons throughout the country were occupied by citizens, but not before the Stasi destroyed a number of documents (approximately 5%)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/16-02/ff_stasi|work=Wired|title=Piecing Together the Dark Legacy of East Germany's Secret Police|date=18 January 2008}}</ref> consisting of, by one calculation, 1 billion sheets of paper.<ref name="godsjury">{{cite book |last= Murphy |first= Cullen |date= 17 January 2012 |title= God's Jury: The Inquisition and the Making of the Modern World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXywBrmhPTUC&pg=PP1 |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn= 978-0-618-09156-0 |accessdate= 3 January 2014 }}</ref>

===Storming the Stasi headquarters===

With the fall of the GDR the Stasi was dissolved. Stasi employees began to destroy the extensive files and documents they held, by hand, fire and with the use of shredders. When these activities became known, a protest began in front of the Stasi headquarters,<ref>[http://www.stasimuseum.de/en/enindex.htm The Stasi Headquarters] now a museum open to the public.</ref> The evening of 15 January 1990 saw a large crowd form outside the gates calling for a stop to the destruction of sensitive files. The building contained vast records of personal files, many of which would form important evidence in convicting those who had committed crimes for the Stasi. The protesters continued to grow in number until they were able to overcome the police and gain entry into the complex. Once inside, specific targets of the protesters' anger were portraits of Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke which were trampled on or burnt. Among the protesters were former Stasi collaborators seeking to destroy incriminating documents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Controversy of the Stasi files===
With the [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, a new government agency was founded called the ''[[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records|Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Bundesbeauftragte für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik}}), officially abbreviated "BStU".<ref>[http://www.bstu.bund.de/cln_029/nn_710332/EN/Office/office__node.html__nnn=true Functions of the BStU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209050838/http://www.bstu.bund.de/cln_029/nn_710332/EN/Office/office__node.html__nnn=true |date=9 December 2008 }}, from the English version of the official BStU website</ref> There was a debate about what should happen to the files, whether they should be opened to the people or kept closed.

Those who opposed opening the files cited privacy as a reason.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} They felt that the information in the files would lead to negative feelings about former Stasi members, and, in turn, cause violence. Pastor [[Rainer Eppelmann]], who became Minister of Defense and Disarmament after March 1990, felt that new political freedoms for former Stasi members would be jeopardized by acts of revenge. Prime Minister [[Lothar de Maizière]] even went so far as to predict murder. They also argued against the use of the files to capture former Stasi members and prosecute them, arguing that not all former members were criminals and should not be punished solely for being a member. There were also some who believed that everyone was guilty of something. [[Peter-Michael Diestel]], the Minister of Interior, opined that these files could not be used to determine innocence and guilt, claiming that "there were only two types of individuals who were truly innocent in this system, the newborn and the alcoholic". Other opinions, such as the one of West German Interior Minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], believed in putting the Stasi behind them and working on German reunification.

|style="text-align: left;"| But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives? The main purpose was to control the society. In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who, which meant who thinks what. He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime. He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning. The East Germans knew, of course, that they were surrounded by informers, in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear, the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship.

Others argued that everyone should have the right to see their own file, and that the files should be opened to investigate former Stasi members and prosecute them, as well as not allow them to hold office. Opening the files would also help clear up some of the rumors that were currently circulating. Some also believed that politicians involved with the Stasi should be investigated.

The fate of the files was finally decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and West Germany. This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more access and use of the files. Along with the decision to keep the files in a central location in the East, they also decided who could see and use the files, allowing people to see their own files.<!-- Will they ever be unsealed and generally public? This seems like an important aspect of any agreement. -->

In 1992, following a declassification ruling by the German government, the Stasi files were opened, leading people to look for their files. [[Timothy Garton Ash]], an English historian, after reading his file, wrote ''The File: A Personal History''.<ref>[http://www.timothygartonash.com/books.html The File], Information about "The File"</ref>

Between 1991 and 2011, around 2.75 million individuals, mostly GDR citizens, requested to see their own files.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/east-germany-stasi-files-zirndorf|title=Germans piece together millions of lives spied on by Stasi|first=Helen|last=Pidd|date=13 March 2011|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> The ruling also gave people the ability to make duplicates of their documents. Another big issue was how the media could use and benefit from the documents. It was decided that the media could obtain files as long as they were depersonalized and not regarding an individual under the age of 18 or a former Stasi member. This ruling not only gave the media access to the files, but also gave schools access.

===Tracking down former Stasi informers with the files===
Even though groups of this sort were active in the community, those who were tracking down ex-members were, as well. Many of these hunters succeeded in catching ex-Stasi; however, charges could not be made for merely being a member. The person in question would have to have participated in an illegal act, not just be a registered Stasi member. Among the high-profile individuals who were arrested and tried were Erich Mielke, Third Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Honecker, head of state for the GDR. Mielke was sentenced to six years prison for the murder of two policemen in 1931. Honecker was charged with authorizing [[Schießbefehl|the killing of would-be escapees]] on the east–west frontier and the [[Berlin Wall]]. During his trial, he went through cancer treatment. Because he was nearing death, Honecker was allowed to spend his final time in freedom. He died in Chile in May 1994.

===Reassembling the destroyed files===
Reassembling the destroyed files has been relatively easy due to the number of archives and the failure of shredding machines (in some cases "shredding" meant tearing paper in two by hand and documents could be recovered easily). In 1995, the BStU began reassembling the shredded documents; 13 years later, the three dozen archivists commissioned to the projects had reassembled only 327 bags; they are now using [[Paper shredder#Unshredding and forensics|computer-assisted data recovery]] to reassemble the remaining 16,000 bags{{spaced ndash}}estimated at 45 million pages. It is estimated that this task may be completed at a cost of 30 million dollars.<ref>''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': [http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/16-02/ff_stasi?currentPage=all "Piecing Together the Dark Legacy of East Germany's Secret Police"]</ref>

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] acquired some Stasi records during the looting of the Stasi's archives. West Germany asked for their return and received some in April 2000.<ref>[[BBC]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/703303.stm "MfS files return to Germany."]</ref> See also [[Rosenholz files]].

===Lobbying===
<!-- Translated from German Wiki -->
Former Stasi officers continue to be politically active via the ''[[Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanitären Unterstützung]]'' (GRH, Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support). Former high-ranking officers and employees of the Stasi, including the last Stasi director, [[Wolfgang Schwanitz]], make up the majority of the organization's members, and it receives support from the [[German Communist Party]], among others.

Impetus for the establishment of the GRH was provided by the criminal charges filed against the Stasi in the early 1990s. The GRH, decrying the charges as "victor's justice", called for them to be dropped. Today the group provides an alternative if somewhat utopian voice in the public debate on the GDR legacy. It calls for the closure of the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial and can be a vocal presence at memorial services and public events. In March 2006 in Berlin, GRH members disrupted a museum event; a political scandal ensued when the Berlin Senator (Minister) of Culture refused to confront them.<ref>''Stasi Offiziere Leugnen den Terror''. ''Berliner Morgenpost'' 16 March 2006. [http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article266203/Stasi_Offiziere_leugnen_den_Terror.html]{{subscription required}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, the GRH also lobbies people and institutions promoting opposing viewpoints. For example, in March 2006, the Berlin Senator for Education received a letter from a GRH member and former Stasi officer attacking the Museum for promoting "falsehoods, anticommunist agitation and psychological terror against minors".<ref>Backmann, Christa.
