The '''2010 Nobel Peace Prize''' was awarded to imprisoned Chinese [[human rights activist]] {{nowrap|[[Liu Xiaobo]]}} "for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental [[human rights in China]]".<ref name="NPP"/> The laureate, once an eminent scholar, was reportedly little-known inside the People's Republic of China (PRC) at the time of the award due to official censorship;<ref name=guardian20101215>Sautman, Barry; Yan, Hairong (15 December 2010).

Liu, who was backed by former Czech president [[Václav Havel]] and [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid activist]] and cleric [[Desmond Tutu]], also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, received the award among a record field of more than 200 nominees.

The decision, while widely praised by foreign intellectuals and politicians, was quickly condemned by [[Government of China|the Chinese government]] and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also denounced the award and what they regarded as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China—on the Internet, television and in print media. The government strongly denounced the award and summoned the [[Norwegian ambassador to China|Norwegian ambassador in Beijing]] to make a formal protest. The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate.<!--<ref name=stack/> --> Liu's wife was put under house arrest before the decision of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee|Nobel Committee]] was announced.

Chinese diplomats moved to pressure other countries not to attend the award ceremony, which was scheduled for 10 December. The diplomatic missions of democratic countries in Oslo received warning letters from their Chinese counterparts; the deputy foreign minister also warned countries of "the consequences".<ref name=deshayes/> In December, the [[Chinese Foreign Ministry]] continued the rhetorical assault, stating "more than 100 countries and international organisations [had] expressed explicit support of China's position". In the end, 46 countries attended of the 65 invited (the People's Republic of China and 19 other nations declined invitations). China's official news agency, [[Xinhua]], attacked the West for its "[[Cold-War]] or even colonial mentality" and for daring to "regard themselves as the judge, the teacher [who] assume that they can forever distort the fact and block the truth by using political maneuvers."<ref name=xinhua20101211/> Strong rhetoric and denunciations of the West continued from official sources until after the ceremony.

===Chinese media===
The Chinese media avoided the story of Liu's Peace Prize, in marked contrast with their previous announcements of other recipients of Nobel Prizes. The official [[Xinhua News Agency]] downplayed all but the literature prize, and most other mainland news portals followed the Xinhua lead; popular internet portals such as [[Sina.com]] and [[NetEase]] deleted pages dedicated to stories related to all five Nobel Prizes.<ref name=twitter/><ref name=filters>Clem, Will; Staff reporters (9 October 2010).

There was also no mention of Liu on the Xinhua homepage. The only references to the Nobel Prizes on the site's opening page referred to the literature award, while a search of the website only brought up a short report about a foreign ministry spokesman denouncing Liu's selection—filed under international news. Most other mainland news portals, including Sina and NetEase, deleted pages dedicated to stories related to the five Nobel Prizes."</ref> According to a well-informed Twitter user, cited by the China Media Project at the [[University of Hong Kong]], the Information Office of the State Council issued a directive immediately after the announcement that "Liu Xiaobo" and "Peace Prize" would be prohibited search terms for microblog services across the country; fora, blogs and other interactive media were forbidden from releasing any information.<ref name=twitter>'Bei Feng' (11 October 2010).

His views are largely omitted to avoid a discussion about them, resulting in a one-sided debate."

==Runup to the Award ceremony==

===Diplomatic pressure===
In the lead-up to the award ceremony, the Chinese authorities began a campaign through state media to criticise both Liu and the prize; the Chinese foreign service in Beijing and abroad targeted Western government officials, urging them to stay away from the award ceremony in [[Oslo]] on 10 December and refrain from issuing any statements of support for Liu. At least two European embassies in Norway were sent letters by their Chinese counterparts, denouncing the prize for being an interference in China's internal affairs and reaffirming their stance that Liu had committed crimes in China. One diplomat said his embassy's letter from the Chinese embassy requested obliquely that they "refrain from attending any activity directed against China." The Norwegian Nobel Committee said its invitation to the Chinese ambassador to attend the prize-giving was returned unanswered.<ref>McDonald, Scott (5 November 2010).
