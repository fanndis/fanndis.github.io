'''California's 8th congressional district''' is a [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional district]] in the U.S. state of [[California]].

[[Paul Cook (politician)|Paul Cook]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Yucca Valley]], has represented the district since January 2013. Currently, the 8th district encompasses most of the eastern desert regions of the state. It stretches from [[Mono Lake]] to [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]].  It consists of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo]] and [[Mono County, California|Mono]] counties plus most of the land in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-congressional-districts.html|title=Maps: Final Congressional Districts|accessdate=February 24, 2013|publisher=Citizens Redistricting Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310180458/http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-congressional-districts.html|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It is the largest and thus the most thinly-populated congressional district in California.{{citation needed | reason=Size does not necessarily mean most thinly-populated|date=December 2019}} The largest city in the district is [[Victorville, California|Victorville]].

Prior to redistricting by the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]] of 2011, the 8th district was in [[San Francisco]].  The new district lines went into effect for the [[California elections, June 2012|June 2012 elections]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-drafts.html |title=Current Status of Commission's Final Certified District Maps |publisher=California Citizens Redistricting Commission |accessdate=February 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916000652/http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-drafts.html# |archive-date=September 16, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Competitiveness==
Before the 2011 redistricting, the 8th district was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold.  It gave [[John Kerry]] his best performance in [[California]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], backing the Democrat with 84.2% of the vote. [[Barack Obama]] continued on this trend in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] when he received 85.22% of the vote in the district while [[John McCain]] received 12.38%.

The new 8th district lies in a politically conservative region of the state with a "Strongly Republican" [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+10.  The Cook Political Report ranks it the 87th most Republican-leaning congressional district in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cookpolitical.com/application/writable/uploads/2012_PVI_by_District.pdf |title=Partisan Voting Index Districts of the 113th Congress: 2004 & 2008 | publisher=The Cook Political Report |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref>

In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012 election]], the first after the state's adoption of [[top-two primaries]], the 8th district was one of only two in California where two Republicans faced each other in a runoff election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://graphics.latimes.com/2012-election-results-california/#/us_house/5698 |title=California Election Results, Nov. 6th, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> In 2018, it was the only such California district.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-primary-june-live-democrats-look-likely-to-get-locked-out-1528328518-htmlstory.html|title=Democrats look likely to get locked out of this Republican-held congressional district in California|last=Panzar|first=Javier|website=latimes.com|access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref>
