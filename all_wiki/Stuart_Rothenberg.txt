Rothenberg is known for his prediction in early 2009 that the GOP's chances of winning back the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 were "zero".<ref>Rothenberg, Stuart. [http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/news/article/april-madness-can-gop-win-back-the-house-in-2010 "April Madness: Can GOP win Back the House in 2010?"] ''The Rothenberg Political Report'', April 27, 2009. Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> Rothenberg later would change his prediction as the economy worsened and polls reflected increasing support for Republicans through the [[Tea Party protests]]. The Rothenberg Political Report projected Republicans would gain 55–65 seats in the House of Representatives<ref>{{cite news |date=November 1, 2010 |title=House Ratings |publisher=Inside Elections with Nathan Gonzales |url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house/november-1-2010-house-ratings}}</ref> (they gained 63) and 6–8 seats in the Senate<ref>{{cite news |date=November 1, 2010 |title=Senate Ratings |publisher=Inside Elections with Nathan Gonzales |url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/senate/november-1-2010-senate-ratings}}</ref> (they gained 6).

In the weeks before the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President, Rothenberg wrote an opinion piece for the ''Washington Post'' headlined "Trump's path to an electoral college victory isn't narrow. It’s nonexistent". Rothenberg stated, "Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, once part of the Trump scenario, have never been 'in play'". Trump would go on to win all three of the battleground states.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/18/trump-electoral-college-victory-non-existent/</ref>
