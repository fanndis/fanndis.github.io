==Personal life==
Goldberg was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], to a [[Jewish]] family.<ref>{{cite web|first=Naomi|last=Pfefferman|url=http://jewishjournal.com/mobile_20111212/118128/|title=Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen: Friends for the end of the world|work=Jewish Journal|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ijpr.org/post/seth-rogen-evan-goldberg-friends-till-end|title=Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg: Friends Till 'The End'|work=[[Jefferson Public Radio]]|date=December 26, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> He was raised in [[Marpole]].<ref>Rachel Fox, [http://heebmagazine.com/evan-goldberg-talks-goon/34629 ''Goon'' Writer Evan Goldberg talks Vancouver, Hockey and his Bar Mitzvah], ''[[Heeb]]'', March 30, 2012.</ref> He attended [[Point Grey Secondary School]] (where he met and befriended Rogen) and [[McGill University]], and is married to Lisa (Yadavaia) Goldberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/evandgoldberg/status/541311293458640896|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newhouse.syr.edu/featured-alumni/lisa-yadavaia-goldberg|title=Lisa Yadavaia Goldberg - Newhouse School - Syracuse University - Syracuse University|website=Newhouse School - Syracuse University|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
Goldberg started his writing career joining the staff of ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' for its 2004 season, along with his childhood friend and comedy partner [[Seth Rogen]]. They collaborated on the films, ''[[Knocked Up]]'', ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', ''[[Funny People]]'', and ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'' with their production company [[Point Grey Pictures]], named after [[Point Grey Secondary School]].<ref>[http://video.about.com/movies/Seth-Rogen-and-Evan-Goldberg.htm Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg Interviews – Superbad Movie Video – About.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128053518/http://video.about.com/movies/Seth-Rogen-and-Evan-Goldberg.htm |date=November 28, 2007 }}</ref>

In a strategy to garner interest and funding, Goldberg created a pre-production trailer for ''[[Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse]]'', which was later made as ''[[This Is the End]]'', and was released in June 2013.

Goldberg and Rogen are both "obsessed" fans of ''The Simpsons''. After learning that ''The Simpsons'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] was a fan of ''Superbad'', they decided to ask the producers of the show if they could write an episode.<ref name="Keveney">{{cite news|title=Rogen gets a dream gig: 'Simpsons' writer, voice|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-09-23-rogen-simpsons_N.htm|author=Keveney, Bill|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref><ref name="Wagner">{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/show-patrol/2009/09/seth-rogen-kicks-off-21st-season-of-the-simpsons.html|title=Seth Rogen kicks off 21st season of 'The Simpsons'|last=Wagner |first=Curt|date=2009-09-25|work=Chicago Now|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref> They were invited to ''The Simpsons'' writers room, where they pitched several episode ideas.
