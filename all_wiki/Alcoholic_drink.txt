An '''alcoholic drink''' (or '''alcoholic beverage''') is a [[drink]] that contains [[ethanol]], a type of [[alcohol]] produced by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] of grains, fruits, or other sources of sugar. The consumption of alcohol plays an important [[Drinking culture|social role]] in many cultures. Most countries have [[Alcohol law|laws]] regulating the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages.<ref name="IARD">{{cite web |title=Minimum Legal Age Limits |url=http://www.iard.org/policy-tables/minimum-legal-age-limits/ |website=IARD.org |publisher=International Alliance for Responsible Drinking |access-date=23 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504144607/http://www.iard.org/policy-tables/minimum-legal-age-limits/ |archive-date=4 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[List of countries with alcohol prohibition|Some countries]] [[prohibition|ban such activities entirely]], but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world.

Alcohol is a [[depressant]], which in low doses causes [[euphoria]], reduces anxiety, and increases sociability. In higher doses, it causes [[drunkenness]], [[stupor]], [[unconsciousness]], or [[death]]. Long-term use can lead to [[alcohol abuse]], [[Alcohol and cancer|cancer]], [[physical dependence]], and [[alcoholism]].

==Fermented drinks==
[[File:Lady relaxing next to glass of red wine and glass of 1664 beer.jpg|thumb|Wine (left) and beer (right) are served in different glasses.]]

===Beer===
{{Main|Beer}}
{{See also|Beer styles|List of beer styles}}
[[Beer]] is a beverage fermented from [[grain]] [[Mashing|mash]]. It is typically made from [[barley]] or a [[Mixture|blend]] of several grains and flavored with [[hops]]. Most beer is naturally carbonated as part of the fermentation process. If the fermented mash is distilled, then the drink becomes a [[Distilled beverage|spirit]]. In the Andean region, the most common beer is [[chicha]], made from grain or fruits.<ref>John C. Super, "Alcoholic Beverages" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 45. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world.<ref name="Nelson 2005">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xul0O_SI1MC&q=most+consumed+beverage&pg=PA1|title=The Barbarian's Beverage: A History of Beer in Ancient Europe|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-31121-2|page=1|access-date=21 September 2010|last=Nelson|first=Max}}</ref>

===Wine===
{{Main|Wine}}
{{See also|Wine and health}}
[[Wine]] is a fermented beverage produced from [[grape]]s and sometimes other fruits. Wine involves a longer fermentation process than beer and a long [[aging of wine|aging process]] (months or years), resulting in an alcohol content of 9%–16% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]].

===Cider===
[[Cider]] or cyder ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|d|ər}} {{respell|SY|dər}}) is a [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] alcoholic drink made from any [[fruit juice]]; [[apple juice]] (traditional and most common), [[peach]]es, [[pear]]s ("[[Perry]]" cider) or other fruit. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "[[apple wine]]".<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sTsC65kCJbUC&pg=PA169 |title=The Prokaryotes: Proteobacteria: alpha and beta subclasses |page=169|author=Martin Dworkin, Stanley Falkow|publisher=Springer|year= 2006|access-date=29 July 2011|isbn=978-0-387-25495-1 }}</ref>

===Fermented tea===
[[Fermented tea]] (also known as post-fermented tea or dark tea) is a class of [[tea]] that has undergone microbial [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], from several months to many years. The tea leaves and the liquor made from them become darker with oxidation. Thus, the various kinds of fermented teas produced across [[China]] are also referred to as dark tea, not be confused with [[black tea]]. The most famous fermented tea is [[kombucha]] which is often [[homebrewed]], [[pu-erh]], produced in [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]],<ref name="Haizhen, Yang Zhu 2008">Mo, Haizhen, Yang Zhu, and Zongmao Chen. "Microbial fermented tea–a potential source of natural food preservatives." Trends in food science & technology 19.3 (2008): 124-130.</ref><ref name="Hai-peng, 2013">Lv, Hai-peng, et al. "Processing and chemical constituents of Pu-erh tea: A review." Food Research International 53.2 (2013): 608-618.</ref> and the [[Anhua dark tea]] produced in [[Anhua County]] of [[Hunan Province]]. The majority of kombucha on the market are under 0.5% [[ABV]].

===Mead===
[[Mead]] ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|d}}) is an alcoholic drink made by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the drink's fermentable sugar is derived from honey.

===Pulque===
[[Pulque]] is the [[Mesoamerica]]n fermented drink made from the "honey water" of [[maguey]], ''[[Agave americana]]''. The drink distilled from pulque is [[tequila]] or [[Mezcal|mescal]] Mezcal.<ref>Super, "Alcoholic Beverages", pp. 45–46.</ref>

===Rice wine===

[[Sake]], [[huangjiu]], [[mijiu]], and [[Cheongju (beverage)|cheongju]] are popular examples of [[East Asian]] [[rice wine]].

===Others===
"[[Fruit wine]]s" are made from fruits other than grapes, such as plums, cherries, or apples.

[[Sparkling wine]] like French [[Champagne]], Catalan [[Cava (Spanish wine)|Cava]] or Italian [[Prosecco]] can be made by means of a [[Sparkling wine#Secondary fermentation|secondary fermentation]].

==Distilled drinks==
{{Main|Distilled beverage}}
A distilled drink or liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by [[distillation|distilling]] (i.e., [[Concentration|concentrating by distillation]]) [[ethanol]] produced by means of [[Ethanol fermentation|fermenting]] grain, fruit, or vegetables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106006/distilled-spirit|title=Distilled spirit/distilled liquor|publisher=Britannica.com|access-date=2013-02-05}}</ref> Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% [[ABV]] are called ''[[Distilled beverage|spirits]]''.<ref>Lichine, Alexis. ''Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits'' (5th edition) (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1987), 707–709.</ref> For the most common distilled drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term ''hard liquor'' is used in North America to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). [[Vodka]], [[gin]], [[baijiu]], [[shōchū]], [[soju]], [[tequila]], [[whisky|whiskey]], [[brandy]] and [[rum]] are examples of distilled drinks. Distilling [[concentration|concentrates]] the alcohol and eliminates some of the [[Congener (alcohol)|congeners]]. [[Freeze distillation]] concentrates ethanol along with [[methanol]] and [[fusel alcohol]]s (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]].

[[Fortified wine]] is wine, such as [[Port wine|port]] or [[sherry]], to which a distilled beverage (usually [[brandy]]) has been added.<ref name=ALE>{{cite book|last=Lichine|first=Alexis|title=Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits|edition=5th|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1987|page=236|isbn=978-0-394-56262-9}}</ref> Fortified wine is distinguished from [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of [[distillation]], while fortified wine is simply wine that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including [[Port wine|port]], sherry, [[Madeira wine|madeira]], [[Marsala wine|marsala]], [[commandaria]], and the aromatized wine [[vermouth]].<ref name="Oxford pg 279">{{cite book|editor-last=Robinson|editor-first=J.|title=The Oxford Companion to Wine|edition=3rd|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/279 279]|isbn=978-0-19-860990-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/279}}</ref>

===Rectified spirit===
[[Rectified spirit]], also called "neutral grain spirit", is alcohol which has been purified by means of "rectification" (i.e. repeated distillation). The term ''neutral'' refers to the spirit's lack of the flavor that would have been present if the mash ingredients had been distilled to a lower level of alcoholic purity. Rectified spirit also lacks any flavoring added to it after distillation (as is done, for example, with [[gin]]). Other kinds of spirits, such as [[whiskey]], are distilled to a lower alcohol percentage to preserve the flavor of the mash.

Rectified spirit is a clear, colorless, flammable liquid that may contain as much as 95% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]. It is often used for [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicinal purposes]]. It may be a grain spirit or it may be made from other plants. It is used in [[mixed drinks]], [[liqueurs]], and [[tincture]]s, and also as a household [[solvent]].

===Congeners===
{{See also|Congener (alcohol)|Wine chemistry|Hangover}}
In the alcoholic drinks industry, congeners are substances produced during [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]]. These substances include small amounts of chemicals such as occasionally desired other alcohols, like [[propanol]] and [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], but also compounds that are never desired such as [[acetone]], [[acetaldehyde]] and [[glycols]]. Congeners are responsible for most of the taste and aroma of distilled alcoholic drinks, and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks.<ref>[http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=features&content=74439&ftitle=Understanding%20Congeners%20in%20Wine Understanding Congeners in Wine], Wines & Vines. Accessed 2011-4-20</ref> It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a [[hangover]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8416431.stm Whisky hangover 'worse than vodka, a study suggests'], BBC News. Accessed 2009-12-19</ref> [[Tannins in wine|Tannins]] are congeners found in wine in the presence of phenolic compounds. Wine tannins add bitterness, have a drying sensation, taste herbaceous and are often described as [[astringent]]. Wine tannins adds balance, complexity, structure and makes a wine last longer, so they play an important role in the [[aging of wine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/wine-characteristics/|title=The 5 Basic Wine Characteristics |work=Wine Folly|access-date=6 May 2015|date=2012-07-23}}</ref>

==Food energy==
Alcoholic drinks are a source of food energy. The [[USDA]] uses a figure of {{convert|6.93|kcal|lk=in|}} per gram of alcohol ({{convert|5.47|kcal|disp=or|abbr=on}} per [[millilitre|ml]]) for calculating food energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Composition of Foods Raw, Processed, Prepared USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 26 Documentation and User Guide|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR26/sr26_doc.pdf|publisher=[[USDA]]|page=14|date=August 2013}}</ref> In addition to alcohol, many alcoholic drinks contain carbohydrates. For example, in {{convert|12|USoz|0|lk=in|abbr=on}} of 5% ABV beer, along with approximately 18 [[millilitre|ml]] of alcohol ({{convert|96|kcal|lk=in|disp=or}}), there are usually 10–15&nbsp;g of carbohydrates (about {{convert|40|-|60|kcal|lk=in|abbr=on|disp=or}}).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Excessive daily calorie intake may contribute to an increase in body weight and "[[beer belly]]". In addition to the direct effect of its caloric content, alcohol is also known to potentiate the [[Insulin|insulin response]] of the human body to [[glucose]], which, in essence, "instructs" the body to convert consumed carbohydrates into fat and to suppress carbohydrate and fat oxidation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Potentiation of the Plasma Insulin Response to Glucose by Prior Administration of Alcohol|author=Robert Metz|journal=Diabetes|year=1969|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/18/8/517.full.pdf|display-authors=etal|doi=10.2337/diab.18.8.517|pmid=4897290|volume=18|issue=8|pages=517–22|s2cid=32072796}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ethanol Causes Acute Inhibition of Carbohydrate, Fat, and Protein Oxidation and Insulin Resistance|journal=J.

==Reasons for use==

===Apéritifs and digestifs===
{{main|Apéritif and digestif}}

An [[Apéritif and digestif#Apéritifs|apéritif]] is any alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the [[appetite]],<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 15059684| year = 2004| last1 = Caton| first1 = S.J.| title = Dose-dependent effects of alcohol on appetite and food intake| journal = Physiology & Behavior| volume = 81| issue = 1| pages = 51–58| last2 = Ball| first2 = M| last3 = Ahern| first3 = A| last4 = Hetherington| first4 = M.M.| doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2003.12.017| s2cid = 22424908}}</ref> while a [[Apéritif and digestif#Digestifs|digestif]] is any alcoholic beverage served after a meal for the stated purpose of improving digestion. [[Fortified wine]], [[liqueur]]s, and [[Champagne (wine)|dry champagne]] are common apéritifs. Because apéritifs are served before dining, they are usually dry rather than sweet. One example is [[Cinzano]], a brand of [[vermouth]]. Digestifs include brandy, fortified wines and herb-infused spirits ([[Drambuie]]).

===Flavoring===
[[File:Réduction du vin rouge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reduction (cooking)|Reduction]] of red wine for a sauce by cooking it on a stovetop. It is called a reduction because the heat boils off some of the water and most of the more volatile alcohol, leaving a more concentrated, wine-flavoured sauce.]]
Pure ethanol tastes [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitter]] to humans; some people also describe it as sweet.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 10940547| year = 2000| last1 = Scinska| first1 = A| title = Bitter and sweet components of ethanol taste in humans| journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence| volume = 60| issue = 2| pages = 199–206| last2 = Koros| first2 = E| last3 = Habrat| first3 = B| last4 = Kukwa| first4 = A| last5 = Kostowski| first5 = W| last6 = Bienkowski| first6 = P | doi=10.1016/s0376-8716(99)00149-0}}</ref> However, ethanol is also a moderately good [[solvent]] for many fatty substances and essential oils. This facilitates the use of flavoring and coloring compounds in alcoholic drinks as a taste mask, especially in [[distilled drinks]]. Some flavors may be naturally present in the beverage's raw material. Beer and wine may also be flavored before fermentation, and spirits may be flavored before, during, or after distillation. Sometimes flavor is obtained by allowing the beverage to stand for months or years in oak barrels, usually made of American or French oak. A few brands of spirits may also have fruit or herbs inserted into the bottle at the time of bottling.

Wine is important in cuisine not just for its value as an accompanying beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in [[stock (food)|stocks]] and [[braising]], since its acidity lends balance to rich [[Basic taste#Savouriness|savory]] or [[sweet]] dishes.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/6-secrets-of-cooking-with-wine#1 | title=6 Secrets of Cooking with Wine}}</ref> [[Wine sauce]] is an example of a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHp1GJk8IMcC&pg=PA15 | title=Parker's Wine Buyer's Guide, 7th Edition | publisher=Simon and Schuster | author=Parker, Robert M. | year=2008 | page=15 | isbn=978-1-4391-3997-4}}</ref> Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], with most wines being in the 12.5–14.5% range.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jancis Robinson |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} See ''alcoholic strength'' at p. 10.</ref> [[Fortified wine]]s (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.

{{Main|Alcohol by volume}}
The [[concentration]] of alcohol in a beverage is usually stated as the percentage of [[alcohol by volume]]&nbsp; (ABV, the number of milliliters (ml) of pure ethanol in 100 ml of beverage) or as [[Alcohol proof|''proof'']]. In the United States, ''proof'' is twice the percentage of alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (e.g. 80 proof = 40% ABV). ''Degrees proof'' were formerly used in the United Kingdom, where 100 degrees proof was equivalent to 57.1% ABV. Historically, this was the most dilute spirit that would sustain the [[combustion]] of [[gunpowder]].

Ordinary [[distillation]] cannot produce alcohol of more than 95.6% by weight, which is about 97.2% ABV (194.4 proof) because at that point alcohol is an [[azeotrope]] with water. A spirit which contains a very high level of alcohol and ''does not contain any added flavoring'' is commonly called a [[Neutral grain spirit|neutral spirit]]. Generally, any distilled alcoholic beverage of 170 US proof or higher is considered to be a neutral spirit.<ref>Lichine, Alexis. ''Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits'' (5th edition) (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1987), 365.</ref>

Most [[yeast]]s cannot reproduce when the concentration of alcohol is higher than about 18%, so that is the practical limit for the strength of fermented drinks such as wine, beer, and [[sake]]. However, some strains of yeast have been developed that can reproduce in solutions of up to 25% ABV.<ref>Stewart, Graham G. "Biographical Review: Seduced by Yeast". ''Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists'' (2015): 1–21. ''American Society of Brewing Chemists''. 21 Jan. 2015. Web. 14 May 2017.</ref>

===Serving measures===
{{See also|Alcohol equivalence}}

====Shot sizes====
[[Shot glass#Sizes|Shot sizes]] vary significantly from country to country. In the United Kingdom, serving size in [[Licensing laws of the United Kingdom|licensed premises]] is regulated under the [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act (1985)]]. A single serving size of spirits ([[gin]], [[whisky]], [[rum]], and [[vodka]]) are sold in 25 ml or 35 ml quantities or multiples thereof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifefire.gov.uk/topics/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.display&subjectid=8133D50D-A872-4A5B-9C65EE07BBF04E7E&objectid=6DDC0AD4-C85A-2F07-BE70B5A0D64D0A58|title=fifedirect – Licensing & Regulations – Calling Time on Short Measures!|publisher=Fifefire.gov.uk|date=2008-07-29|access-date=2010-02-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722175012/http://www.fifefire.gov.uk/topics/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.display&subjectid=8133D50D-A872-4A5B-9C65EE07BBF04E7E&objectid=6DDC0AD4-C85A-2F07-BE70B5A0D64D0A58|archive-date=2011-07-22}}</ref> Beer is typically served in [[pint]]s (568&nbsp;ml), but is also served in half-pints or third-pints. In Israel, a single serving size of spirits is about twice as much, 50 or 60 mL.

The shape of a glass can have a significant effect on how much one pours. A [[Cornell University]] study of students and bartenders' pouring showed both groups pour more into short, wide glasses than into tall, slender glasses.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wansink, Brian |author2=van Ittersum, Koert|year=2005|title=Shape of glass and amount of alcohol poured: comparative study of effect of practice and concentration|journal=BMJ|volume=331|issue=7531|pages=1512–14|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1512|pmid=16373735|pmc=1322248}}</ref> Aiming to pour one shot of alcohol (1.5 ounces or 44.3 ml), students on average poured 45.5 ml & 59.6 ml (30% more) respectively into the tall and short glasses. The bartenders scored similarly, on average pouring 20.5% more into the short glasses. More experienced bartenders were more accurate, pouring 10.3% less alcohol than less experienced bartenders. Practice reduced the tendency of both groups to over pour for tall, slender glasses but not for short, wide glasses. These misperceptions are attributed to two perceptual biases: (1) Estimating that tall, slender glasses have more volume than shorter, wider glasses; and (2) Over focusing on the height of the liquid and disregarding the width.

====Standard drinks====
[[File:Glass of whisky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A "standard drink" of [[hard liquor]] does not necessarily reflect a typical serving size, such as seen here]]
A [[Standard drink#Pure alcohol measure|standard drink]] is a notional drink that contains a specified amount of pure [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. The standard drink is used in many countries to quantify alcohol intake. It is usually expressed as a measure of beer, wine, or spirits. One standard drink always contains the same amount of alcohol regardless of serving size or the type of alcoholic beverage. The standard drink varies significantly from country to country. For example, it is 7.62&nbsp;ml (6&nbsp;grams) of alcohol in Austria, but in Japan it is 25&nbsp;ml (19.75&nbsp;grams).
* In the United Kingdom, there is a system of [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] which serves as a guideline for alcohol consumption. A single [[unit of alcohol]] is defined as 10 ml. The number of units present in a typical drink is sometimes printed on bottles. The system is intended as an aid to people who are regulating the amount of alcohol they drink; it is not used to determine serving sizes.
* In the United States, the standard drink contains {{convert|0.6|USoz|ml}} of alcohol. This is approximately the amount of alcohol in a {{convert|12|USoz|ml|adj=on}} glass of beer, a {{convert|5|USoz|ml|adj=on}} glass of wine, or a {{convert|1.5|USoz|ml|adj=on}} glass of a 40% [[ABV]] (80 US proof) spirit.

==Laws==
{{anchor|Legal considerations}}
{{main|Alcohol laws}}
Alcohol laws regulate the manufacture, packaging, labelling, distribution, sale, consumption, blood alcohol content of motor vehicle drivers, open containers, and transportation of alcoholic drinks. Such laws generally seek to reduce the adverse health and social impacts of alcohol consumption. In particular, alcohol laws set the [[legal drinking age]], which usually varies between 16 and 25 years, sometimes depending upon the type of drink (e.g., beer vs. hard liquor). Some countries do not have a legal drinking or purchasing age, but most countries set the minimum age at 18 years.<ref name="IARD"/> Some countries, such as the U.S., have the drinking age higher than the legal age of majority (18), at age 21 in all 50 states. Such laws may take the form of permitting distribution only to licensed stores, [[Alcohol monopoly|monopoly stores]], or [[pub]]s and they are often combined with taxation, which serves to reduce the demand for alcohol (by raising its price) and it is a form of revenue for governments. These laws also often limit the hours or days (e.g., "[[blue laws]]") on which alcohol may be sold or served, as can also be seen in the "[[last call (bar term)|last call]]" ritual in US and Canadian bars, where bartenders and servers ask patrons to place their last orders for alcohol, due to serving hour cutoff laws. In some countries, alcohol cannot be sold to a person who is already intoxicated. Alcohol laws in many countries prohibit [[drunk driving]].

In some jurisdictions, alcoholic drinks are totally prohibited for reasons of [[religion]] (e.g., Islamic countries with [[Sharia|sharia law]]) or for reasons of [[local option]], [[public health]], and [[Morality|morals]] (e.g., [[Prohibition in the United States]] from 1920 to 1933). In jurisdictions which enforce sharia law, the consumption of alcoholic drinks is an [[Crime|illegal offense]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Lizzie|title=Nigeria: The Bradt Travel Guide|page=101}}</ref> although such laws may exempt non-Muslims.<ref>''Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History'' p. 329 David M.
