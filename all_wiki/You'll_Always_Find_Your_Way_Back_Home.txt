It reached its highest international peak in the [[Canadian Hot 100]], at number thirty-six. The song received a music video to coincide with the home release of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''.

==Development==
Singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] became involved with ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' when filmmakers emailed her specifically to request the use of her music in the film. Swift agreed to make a [[cameo appearance]] in the film to sing "[[Crazier (Taylor Swift song)|Crazier]]" as well as to co-write a song with [[Boys Like Girls]] lead singer [[Martin Johnson (vocalist)|Martin Johnson]].<ref name="prod">{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2009/hanna_montana/notes.pdf |title=Hannah Montana The Movie Production Notes |work=[[Walt Disney Pictures]] |publisher=VisualHollywood.com |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lNC4Dlzi?url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2009/hanna_montana/notes.pdf |archivedate=November 18, 2009 }}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV]], Johnson described working with Swift:
{{quote|"She's awesome. She's one of the most talented songwriters to work with, if not, the best. For such a young girl, she's so creative and spot-on. She knows the audience, she truly understands the kind of pop music that is from the heart and done in a tasteful way. She knows ways to make things pop and also make you feel it at the same time. We wrote a bunch of songs together and it was a lot of fun."<ref name="interview">{{Cite interview|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200908/25018372.html |subject-link=Martin Johnson (vocalist) |first=Martin |last=Johnson |title=Boys Like Girls Interview: Love Drunk and In High Spirits |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2009 |interviewer=[[MTV]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001020530/http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200908/25018372.html |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}</ref>}}

"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" is used as the closing number of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. In the film, Cyrus performs as popstar Hannah Montana onstage at an outdoor fundraiser to save her hometown's treasured park from developers. More than 2,000 [[Extra (actor)|extras]] were used to film the scene.<ref name="prod" />

"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home", according to [[AllMusic]], embodies the album's theme of merging [[Country music|country]] and [[pop music]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1479519|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Macrovision Corporation]]|accessdate=November 6, 2009|title=Hannah Montana: The Movie [Soundtrack<nowiki>]</nowiki> > Review|first=Heather|last=Phares}}</ref> It is set in [[common time]] with a fast rock [[tempo]] of 160 [[beats per minute]].<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0076644|title=Hannah Montana – You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home She Music (Digital Download)|work=MusicNotes.com|publisher=[[Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> The song is written in the key of [[E♭ major]].<ref name="sheet" /> Cyrus' vocals span one [[octave]], from B♭<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="sheet" /> The song has the following [[chord progression]], E♭5—D5—E♭5.<ref name="sheet" /> Like the film, the lyrics discuss importance of one's roots.<ref name="prod" /> Warren Truitt of [[About.com]] believed it conveyed "the sentiment that even pop stars find safe haven in their home town".<ref name="tophmsongs">{{cite web|url=http://kidsmusic.about.com/od/toppicks/tp/top10hannahmontanasongs.htm|title=Music by Miley Cyrus' Alter Ego, Hannah Montana|first=Warren|last=Truitt|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref>
The first few lyrics of the song's chorus are almost identical to the opening verse in [[Hilary Duff]]'s song "[[So Yesterday]]", which was released in 2003.

==Critical reception==
The song received positive reviews from critics. Simon Weaving of Screenwize.com said the film's conflicts are "mostly expressed in the simple, sugared lyrics of a series of pop hits that seamlessly find their way into the story– including '[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]' and 'You’ll Always Find a Way Back Home'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenwize.com/archives/431 |title=Review of "Hannah Montana: the Movie" |first=Simon |last=Weaving |publisher=ScreenWize.com |accessdate=November 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712143158/http://www.screenwize.com/archives/431 |archivedate=July 12, 2009 }}</ref> James Plath of Dvdtown.com described the song as being "integrated pretty well into the narrative".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtown.com/review/hannah-montana-the-movie/blu-ray/7250 |title=Hannah Montana: The Movie (Blu-ray) |date=August 22, 2009 |publisher=DVDTown.com |first=James |last=Plath |accessdate=November 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826202032/http://www.dvdtown.com/review/hannah-montana-the-movie/blu-ray/7250 |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}</ref> Peter Canavese of Grouncho Reviews said "the story makes way  for [...] 'You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home'", which would attract "the film's target audience of pre-teen girls".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grouchoreviews.com/reviews/3519|title=Hannah Montana: The Movie|first=Peter|last=Canavese|publisher=Grouncho Reviews|accessdate=November 28, 2009}}</ref> Warren of Truitt of About.com listed the song as the third best song by Hannah Montana.<ref name="tophmsongs" /> The song was included on the [[short list]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i5a83a539b5b67442326fd65b32cf3abd|archive-url=https://archive.is/20100331200102/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i5a83a539b5b67442326fd65b32cf3abd|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 31, 2010|title=Academy unveils original song candidates|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Trade Entertainment|date=December 16, 2009|author= Kilday, Gregg|accessdate=December 19, 2009}}</ref>

==Music video==
A promotional music video for "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" was filmed in correlation to the ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' soundtrack.<ref name="miley sessions">{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/hannah-montana/videos/view/youll-always-find-your-way-back-home-the-miley-sessions--208575477 |title=You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home (The Miley Sessions) |work=[[Disney.com]] |publisher=[[Yahoo!

An excerpt from ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' premiered as the song's music video in August 2009 on [[Disney Channel]] to promote the home release of the film. The video begins with Cyrus and her backup dancers atop a stage in a crowded outdoor concert. Cyrus is dressed as Hannah Montana and is wearing a [[Suit (clothing)|business suit]]. As Cyrus begins singing, she and the dancers engage in intricate choreography. The video then transitions to a clip from ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' in which Cyrus' character is getting down from a private airplane. The video continues to alternate between Cyrus performing and more film clips; scenes include Stewart taking off her Hannah Montana wig and interacting with Travis Body, her love interest in the film, portrayed by actor [[Lucas Till]]. Midway through the video, Cyrus and her dancers exit the stage through a back door and instantly enter sporting [[Western wear|western clothing]] with Cyrus in a western teal button up shirt, a checkered red and white table cloth with purple ruffles pettiskirt or a [[petticoat]], and [[cowboy boots]]. Meanwhile, as the video ends, it shows that Miley wakes up and realizes (after the earlier events from the film) it's just a dream, with Jackson's car driving through the road, and the video ends.
