==Background==
{{main|Use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war|Destruction of Syria's chemical weapons}}
Use of chemical weapons in the [[Syrian Civil War]] has been confirmed by the local sources in Syria and by the [[United Nations]]. Deadly attacks by chemical weapons during the war include the Ghouta attack in the suburbs of [[Damascus]] in August 2013 and the [[Khan al-Assal chemical attack|Khan al-Assal attack]] in the suburbs of [[Aleppo]] in March 2013. While no party took responsibility for the chemical attacks, [[Use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war#The UN mission to investigate alleged use of chemical weapons|a U.N. fact-finding mission]] and [[Use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war#The UNHRC commission of inquiry|a UNHRC Commission of Inquiry]] have both investigated the attacks.

The U.N. mission found likely use of the [[nerve agent]] [[sarin]] in the case of [[Khan al-Asal|Khan al-Asal (19 March 2013)]], [[Saraqib chemical attack|Saraqib (29 April 2013)]], [[Ghouta chemical attack|Ghouta (21 August 2013)]], [[Jobar sarin attack|Jobar (24 August 2013)]] and [[Ashrafiyat Sahnaya chemical attack|Ashrafiyat Sahnaya (25 August 2013)]]. The UNHRC commission later confirmed the use of sarin in the Khan al-Asal, Saraqib and Ghouta attacks, but did not mention the Jobar and the Ashrafiyat Sahnaya attacks. The UNHRC commission also found the sarin used in the Khan al-Asal attack bore "the same unique hallmarks" as the sarin used in the Ghouta attack and indicated the perpetrators likely had access to chemicals from the Syrian Army's stockpile. Those attacks prompted the international community to pressure disarmament of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] from chemical weapons, which was executed during 2014. Despite the disarmament process, dozens of incidents with suspected use of chemical weapons followed throughout Syria, the majority being attributed to anti-government fighters, in particular the Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front.<ref name="RitterPost"/>

In August and October 2016, United Nations reports explicitly blamed the Syrian military of [[Bashar al-Assad]] for dropping chlorine bombs on the towns of [[Talmenes chemical attack|Talmenes on 21 April 2014]], [[Sarmin chemical attack|Sarmin on 16 March 2015]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/syria-used-chlorine-in-bombs-against-civilians-report-says.html Syria Used Chlorine in Bombs Against Civilians, Report Says] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416015617/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/syria-used-chlorine-in-bombs-against-civilians-report-says.html |date=16 April 2019 }}.

The immediate context for the Khan Shaykhun attack was the intensified aerial campaign in March and April 2017 by the government and its Russian ally to gain control of Kafr Zeita, Murek and [[al-Lataminah]], then the three remaining rebel-held towns in the northern [[Hama Governorate]].<ref name="CoI">[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A_HRC_36_55_EN.docx Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826203550/https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A_HRC_36_55_EN.docx |date=26 August 2018 }}, 8 August 2017</ref> (See [[Hama offensive (March–April 2017)]].)

==Responsibility==
On 6 September 2017, the UN [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]' [[Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic]] concluded that a [[Syrian Air Force]] aircraft was responsible the sarin attack, saying "the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib, killing dozens, the majority of whom were women and children".<ref name=dozen>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18W|title=Syrian government forces used chemical weapons more than two dozen times: U.N.|work=[[Reuters]]|first=Stephanie|last=Nebehay|date=6 September 2017|access-date=19 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223120945/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18W|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It dismissed claims by Damascus and Moscow that a bomb struck an opposition chemical weapons depot on the outskirts of the northern town as “fabricated”. The report found that a [[Sukhoi 22]] jet, which is only flown by the Syrian airforce, had carried out four airstrikes at 6.45am on 4 April. Three bombs carried conventional explosives, but one, which struck a road, carried the deadly nerve agent, which was carried as far as 600 metres away on a gentle wind.
“Weather conditions at 6.45am on 4 April were ideal for delivering a chemical weapon,” the report said. “The wind speed was just over 3km/h, with no rain and practically no cloud cover. Under such conditions, the agent cloud would have drifted slowly downhill following the terrain features at the location.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/syrian-regime-dropped-sarin-on-rebel-held-town-in-april-un-confirms |title=The Guardian, 6 September 2017 |access-date=15 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909181732/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/syrian-regime-dropped-sarin-on-rebel-held-town-in-april-un-confirms |archive-date=9 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons, but the report said the Syrian regime’s version of events, that an unknown weapons depot had been hit, was “extremely unlikely”. It said sarin stored in such circumstances would have mostly burned off or been absorbed by rubble, and that there was no evidence of the building being contaminated.

A visit by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to Khan Sheikhun two days after the attack revealed that the site officials claimed had been hit had been empty for many months, and contained only animal feed and a volleyball net. Witnesses described the frantic aftermath of a series of airstrikes, which overwhelmed the limited capacity of local medics and rescue workers. This finding was confirmed in a report released on 26 October 2017 by the [[OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism]].<ref name="Guardian2017" />

{{Quote|text=The United Kingdom’s assessment is that it is almost certain that the Syrian Government was responsible for a sarin attack on Khan Shaykhun on 4 April. (...) There is no evidence to suggest that any party to the conflict in Syria, other than the Syrian Government, has access to a complex nerve agent such as sarin. We note that the FFM’s report refers to testimony from witnesses describing the presence of jets in the area at the time of the attack. Only the Syrian Air Force has the capability to launch a chemical weapons attack from aircraft, and it has already been condemned by this Council for having been found to have used chemical weapons, deployed from aircraft, on at least three occasions in 2014 and 2015.|sign=Sir Geoffrey Adams, UK Permanent Representative to the OPCW|source=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/55th-special-session-of-opcw-executive-council|title=55th Special Session of OPCW Executive Council - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705145113/https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/55th-special-session-of-opcw-executive-council|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

==Claims by the Syrian government, Syrian opposition and Russian government==
===Syrian opposition claims===
According to the Idlib Media Centre, the chemical agent had the characteristics of sarin.
