'''Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych''' ({{lang-uk|Ві́ктор Фе́дорович Януко́вич}}, {{Audio|Uk-Янукович.oga|listen}}; born 9 July 1950) is a Ukrainian politician who was elected as the fourth [[President of Ukraine]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Ukraines_Tymoshenko_Slams_Rival_No_Comment_On_Election_Result/1954993.html Ukraine's Tymoshenko Slams Rival, No Comment On Election Result], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (11 February 2010): "International observers and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have called the election transparent and honest."</ref> He was removed from the office in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]].

Yanukovych served as the governor of [[Donetsk Oblast]], a province in [[eastern Ukraine]], from 1997 to 2002. He was [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] from 21 November 2002 to 7 December 2004 and from 28 December 2004 to 5 January 2005, under President [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Yanukovych first ran for president in [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004]]: he advanced to the runoff election and was initially declared the winner against former Prime Minister [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. However, the election was fraught with allegations of [[electoral fraud]] and [[voter intimidation]]. This caused widespread citizen protests and [[Kyiv]]'s [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] was occupied in what became known as the [[Orange Revolution]]. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukrainian Supreme Court]] nullified the runoff election and ordered a second runoff. Yanukovych lost this second election to Yushchenko. He served as Prime Minister for a second time from 4 August 2006 to 18 December 2007, under President Yushchenko.

Yanukovych was [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|elected President in 2010]], defeating Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]. The election was judged free and fair by international observers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275 | title= Ukraine crisis: Timeline}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/08/viktor-yanukovych-ukraine-president-election|title=Yanukovych set to become president as observers say Ukraine election was fair}}</ref> November 2013 saw the beginning of a series of events that led to his ousting as president.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ukraine-yanukovych-finished-9775?page=2|title=Ukraine: Is Yanukovych Finished?|author=Rajan Menon|page=3|date=28 January 2014|magazine=The National Interest|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ousted-ukraine-president-warns-of-civil-war-criticizes-us-for-aiding-current-government/2014/03/11/13fd0482-a907-11e3-b61e-8051b8b52d06_story.html|title=Ousted Ukraine president warns of civil war, criticizes U.S. for aiding current government|author=Kathy Lally|date=11 March 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/02/how-ukraine-s-parliament-brought-down-yanukovych.html|title=How Ukraine's Parliament Brought Down Yanukovych|author=Maxim Eristavi|work=The Daily Beast|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> Yanukovych rejected a pending [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement|EU association agreement]], choosing instead to pursue a Russian loan bailout and closer ties with Russia.

Viktor Yanukovych was born in the village of Zhukovka near [[Yenakiieve]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]].

==Political career: 1996–2010==
Yanukovych's political career began when he was appointed as a Vice-Head of Donetsk Oblast Administration in August 1996. On 14 May 1997, he was appointed as the Head of the Administration (i.e. Governor).<ref name="BBCprofile">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4038803.stm "Profile: Viktor Yanukovych"], [[BBC News]] (regularly updated)</ref>

===Prime Minister (2002–2004)===
President [[Leonid Kuchma]] appointed Yanukovych to the post of Prime Minister following [[Anatoliy Kinakh]]'s resignation.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B3bwDpegCCYC&pg=PA549 "The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century: the Baltic and European states in transition" (page 556)] by Ian Jeffries, {{ISBN|0-415-25230-X}}, 9780415252300 (published in 2004)</ref> Yanukovych began his term as Prime Minister on 21 November 2002 following a 234-vote confirmation in the Verkhovna Rada, eight more than needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.from-ua.com/politics/42a9194b28012|title=Political career of Viktor Y.|accessdate=2009-06-13|work=from-ua.com|language=Russian}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC&pg=PA152 "How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy"] by [[Anders Åslund]], [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-88132-427-3}} (page 153)</ref>

In foreign affairs, Yanukovych's cabinet was considered to be politically close to [[Russia]], although declaring support for Ukrainian membership in the [[European Union]]. Although Yanukovych's parliamentary coalition was not supporting Ukrainian membership in the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), his cabinet agreed to the commission of Ukrainian troops to the [[Iraq War]] in support of the United States' [[War on Terrorism]].

{{further|Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Orange Revolution}}

In 2004, as the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]], Yanukovych participated in the controversial [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election]] as the [[Party of Regions]] candidate. Yanukovych's main base of support emerged from the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine, which favor close ties with neighbouring Russia. In the first round of voting held on 31 October 2004, Yanukovych took second place with 39.3 percent of the votes to [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|opposition leader]] [[Viktor Yuschenko]] with 39.8 percent. Because no candidate passed the 50 percent threshold, a second round of voting was scheduled.
In the second round of the election, Yanukovych was initially declared the winner. However, the legitimacy of the election was questioned by many Ukrainians, international organizations, and foreign governments following allegations of [[electoral fraud]]. The resulting widespread protests became known as the [[Orange Revolution]]. The second round of the election was subsequently annulled by the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]], and in the repeated run-off, Yanukovych lost to Yushchenko with 44.2 percent to Yushchenko's 51.9 percent.<ref>Paton Walsh, Nick. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/29/ukraine.nickpatonwalsh "Pressure Mounts on Yanukovych to yield."] ''[[The Guardian]]''. 29 December 2004.</ref>

After the election, the Ukrainian parliament passed a non-binding [[motion of no confidence]] in Yanukovych's government, urging outgoing President [[Leonid Kuchma]] to dismiss Yanukovych and appoint a caretaker government. Five days after his electoral defeat, Yanukovych declared his resignation from the post of Prime Minister. In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that he conceded defeat only to avoid violence. "I didn't want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn't want dead bodies from Kyiv to flow down the [[Dnieper River|Dnipro]]. I didn't want to assume power through bloodshed."<ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26340/ "Yanukovych says presidential election scenario of 2004 won't be repeated in 2010"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116221809/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26340/ |date=16 November 2012 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 November 2009)</ref>

===After the Orange Revolution===
Following his electoral defeat in 2004, Yanukovych led the main opposition party against the Tymoshenko government made up of Yushchenko's Our Ukraine, the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]], and [[Oleksandr Moroz]]'s Socialist Party.

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in the United States 14 April 2010-2.jpeg|thumb|Before the beginning of the Nuclear Security Summit with President of France [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and Dmitry Medvedev.]]
During the [[2010 Nuclear Security Summit]], Yanukovych announced that Ukraine would give up its 90-kilogram stock of [[Enriched uranium|highly enriched uranium]] and convert its [[research reactor]]s from highly enriched to low-enriched uranium. It intended to accomplish these goals by 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/12/AR2010041202752.html |last=Wilson |first=Scott |title=Ukraine to Give up Highly Enriched Uranium, Convert Nuclear Reactors |work=The Washington Post |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref>

====Cultural policy====

=====East/West Ukraine unification=====
Yanukovych stated that his "aim and dream" was to unify Ukraine, although in his opinion "there are already no borders between the East and West of the country today".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-338335.html Yanukovych said about his big dream].

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Kyiv - 17 May 2010.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Yanukovych and then Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] on 17 May 2010 near Memorial to the Holodomor Victims in Kyiv.]]
The [[Soviet famine of 1932–33]], called "Holodomor" in Ukrainian, claimed up to 10 million lives, mostly in Ukraine but also in some other parts of the Soviet Union, as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by [[Stalin]]'s regime via the [[NKVD]] secret police.<ref>{{cite news |title=Holodomor: Memories of Ukraine's silent massacre |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25058256 |work=BBC News |date=23 November 2013}}</ref><ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm Ukraine remembers famine horror]". BBC News. 24 November 2007.</ref>

Yanukovych's stance on the [[Holodomor]] was: "Holodomor took place, was denounced and the international society gave an evaluation of the [[famine]], but it was never labeled as a [[genocide]] of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine's attempts to do so by blaming one of our neighbors are unjust."<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100116/157568707.html Ukraine must not blame neighbors for famine – Yanukovych], [[RIA Novosti]] (16 January 2010)</ref> "The Holodomor was in Ukraine, [[Russia]], Belarus and [[Kazakhstan]].

=====Russian as an official language=====
{{Further|Language policy in Ukraine}}
Yanukovych stated in the past that he wanted Russian to become the second [[state language]] in Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-334266.html Yanukovych imagines how he signs law on Russian language], [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] (3 September 2009)</ref> Currently [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the only official language of Ukraine.

He said that this law would need 226 votes in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] (half of the votes instead of two-thirds of the votes needed to change the [[constitution of Ukraine]]) and that voters told him that the current status of [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian in Ukraine]] created "problems in the hospital, school, university, in the courts, in the office".<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=1289144 "Доверия к Тимошенко у меня нет и быть не может"], ''[[Kommersant]]'' (9 December 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160523/http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=1289144 |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>

=====Religion=====
In a late July 2013 speech Yanukovych stated: "All [[Church of Ukraine#Main religious groups|churches and religious organizations]] are equal for the state. We respect the choice of our citizens and guarantee everyone's Constitutional right to [[Human rights in Ukraine#Situation|freedom of religion]]. We will not allow the use of churches and religious organizations by some political forces for their narrow interests. This also refers to foreign centres through which religious organizations sometimes seek to affect the internal political situation in Ukraine. This is a matter of the state's national security".<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/86131 Mission: Impossible], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (6 August 2013)</ref>

During his second foreign visit to Moscow in March, Yanukovych vowed to end [[Russia–Ukraine relations|years of acrimony with Russia]], saying that ties between Russia and Ukraine "should never be the way they were for the past five years". He indicated that he was open to compromise with Russia on the [[Black Sea Fleet#Recent history|Black Sea Fleet's future]] (this led to the April [[2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty]]), and reiterated that Ukraine would remain a "European, non-aligned state", referring to NATO membership.<ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=227513 Ukraine vows new page in ties with Russia], ''[[The News International]]'' (6 March 2010) {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Both [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] (April 2010<ref name="HappyD">[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100516/159038589.html Russia and Ukraine improve soured relations – Russian President], [[RIA Novosti]] (16 May 2010)</ref>) and [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] (June 2010<ref name="HappyP">[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140826014855/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/putin-satisfied-with-state-of-ukrainian-russian-re-71180.html Putin satisfied with state of Ukrainian-Russian relations], ''Kyiv Post'' (28 June 2010)</ref>) soon stated they noticed a big improvement in relations with Ukraine since Yanukovych's presidency.

On 21 April 2010, in [[Kharkiv]], Yanukovych and [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the [[Russian President]], signed the [[2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty]], whereby the Russian lease on naval facilities in Crimea would be extended beyond 2017 by 25 years with an additional 5-year renewal option (to 2042–47) in exchange for a multi-year discounted contract to provide Ukraine with Russian natural gas. This treaty was approved by both the [[Russian parliament|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian parliament]]s (Verkhovna Rada) on 27 April 2010.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/65128 Update: Ukraine, Russia ratify Black Sea naval lease], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411091421/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/65128 |date=11 April 2012 }}</ref>

On 22 April 2010, Yanukovych stated he did not rule out the possibility of holding a [[referendum]] on the stationing of the [[Russian Black Sea Fleet]] in Ukraine after the necessary legislative framework is adopted for this in future. Yanukovych did plan to hold plebiscites also on other subjects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/64714/|title=Yanukovych: Referendum on Russian Black Sea Fleet's stationing in Ukraine may be held|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=22 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424051034/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/64714/|archive-date=24 April 2010}}</ref> Opposition members accused Yanukovych of "selling out national interests".<ref name=defending/> According to Yanukovych the main priority of his foreign policy was to integrate Ukraine "into the European mainstream", while improving relations with Russia.<ref name=defending/> According to Yanukovych the only way out of holding the state budget deficit down, as requested by the [[International Monetary Fund]], while protecting pensioners and minimal wages was to extend the Russian Navy lease in Crimea in exchange for cheaper natural gas.<ref name="defending">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66624/ Yanukovych snipes at opponent, defends fleet move], ''Kyiv Post'' (13 May 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606044816/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66624/ |date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>

==Background to removal==

===Euromaidan protests===
{{Main|Euromaidan|Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement}}
{{see also|Timeline of the Euromaidan|February 2014 Euromaidan riots|2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots|2014 Ukrainian Regional State Administration occupations}}

The [[Euromaidan]] protests started in November 2013 when Ukrainian citizens demanded stronger integration with the European Union. The origins of Euromaidan began as a smaller protest that had started in [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] in the center of Kiev on 21 November, the day Yanukovych abruptly changed his mind on an Association Agreement with the European Union, deciding to strengthen economic ties with Russia instead.<ref>{{cite web|author=Denise Forsthuber|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/11/27/ukraines-surprising-rejection-of-the-european-union-reflects-russias-power|title=From Russia Without Love: The Ukrainian president's decision not to sign the Association Agreement illustrates Russia's ongoing power in the region|work=US News & World Report|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> However, it was not until 30 November, when a group of student protesters were attacked by police leading to several injuries and hospitalizations, that the protest became a national movement. Many people joined the protest in Independence Square, whose numbers had swelled to nearly 1 million by 8 December.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[File:Yanukovych Capitulation2.jpg|thumb|Yanukovych signing the [[Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine]] with representatives of the parliament opposition]]

The protesters refused to leave the square until their demands were met. These included items that the government should release jailed protesters, sign the EU agreement, and change the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], and that Yanukovych should resign.

The protestors were attacked by police, resulting in civil unrest across Western Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Yanukovych dismissed this as the work of his political opponents; instead, protesters called all the more for his resignation, saying he was "aloof" and unresponsive.

Violence escalated after 16 January 2014 when Yanukovych signed the Bondarenko-Oliynyk laws, also known as [[Anti-protest laws in Ukraine|Anti-Protest Laws]]. Demonstrators occupied provincial administration buildings in at least 10 regions, sending the police fleeing through rear exits in some instances. [[Verkhovna Rada]] lawmakers repealed nine of the 12 restrictive laws that had been passed on 16 January by a show of hands, without debate. Outrage ensued at the limits the laws imposed on free speech and assembly in the country. In a striking concession aimed at defusing Ukraine's civil uprising and preserving his own grip on power, President Yanukovych offered to install opposition leaders in top posts in a reshaped government, but they swiftly rebuffed the offer to the delight of thousands of protesters on the streets craving a fuller victory in the days ahead.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[Mykola Azarov]], the [[prime minister of Ukraine]], resigned on 28 January. In a statement he wrote that he was resigning "for the sake of a peaceful resolution" to the civil unrest.<ref>{{cite web|author=2014-01-28T10:27+02:00 10:27 28.01.2014 |url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/187663.html |title=Ukrainian Prime Minister Azarov resigns |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>

Talks with Yanukovych failed in February 2014, and, according to the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]], Ukraine appeared to be on the brink of [[civil war]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/ukraine-military-forces-russia-live-blog Ukraine crisis: Kiev launches 'anti-terror operation' in east – live updates].

===Reports of corruption and cronyism===
Yanukovych has been widely criticized for "massive" corruption and cronyism.<ref name="SL-OD">{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/serhij-leschenko/yanukovych-luxury-residence-and-money-trail-that-leads-to-london|title=Yanukovych, the luxury residence and the money trail that leads to London|author=Sergii Leshchenko|date=8 June 2012|publisher=Open Democracy|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="AslundBBC">{{cite news|author=Anders Aslund|author-link=Anders Åslund|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25323964|title=Ukraine crisis: Yanukovych and the tycoons|date=11 December 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140491/alexander-j-motyl/yanukovych-must-go | title= Yanukovych Must Go Ukrainians Will Protest as Long as His Corrupt Regime Exists |author=Alexander J.

By January 2013, more than half of the ministers appointed by Yanukovych were either born in the [[Donbas]] region or made some crucial part of their careers there, and Yanukovych has been accused of "regional cronyism" for his staffing of police, judiciary, and tax services "all over Ukraine" with "Donbas people".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://expres.ua/main/2012/01/31/59312 |title=Спецтеми &#124; Експрес - онлайн |publisher=Expres.ua |accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref> Over 46% of the budget subventions for social and economic development was allotted to the Donbas region's [[Donetsk Oblast]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]] administrations – 0.62 billion UAH ($76.2 million) versus 0.71 billion UAH ($87.5 million) for the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epravda.com.ua/columns/2012/12/24/352306/ |title=Бюджет-2013: золоті гори для сходу, заходу - мізер &#124; Економічна правда |publisher=Epravda.com.ua |accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref>

[[Anders Åslund]], a Swedish economist and Ukraine analyst, described the consolidation of Ukrainian economic power in the hands of a few "elite industrial tycoons", one of the richest and most influential of whom has become President Yanukovych's own son [[Oleksandr Yanukovych]]. The exact distribution of wealth and precise weight of influence are difficult to gauge, but most of the country's richest men were afraid to cross the Yanukovich family, even in cases where their own economic interests favored an economically pro-EU Ukraine.<ref name="AslundBBC" /> The Yanukovych family, a group of young businessmen described as "robber capitalists", have been buying up both public and private businesses at "rock bottom" prices available in the stagnating economic conditions brought on by Yanukovych's economic policies."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/yanukovych-opts-for-robber-capitalism-332326.html |title=Yanukovych opts for robber capitalism |newspaper=Kyiv Post |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> According to Åslund, one notable exception to the Yanukovych family's influence was [[Petro Poroshenko]], who is described as "uncommonly courageous", although his confectionery empire is less susceptible to ruin by the substantial power the Yanukovych family wielded in the heavy industry sectors located in Yanukovych's geographic power base of [[Donetsk]].<ref name="AslundBBC" />

Yanukovych had an estimated net worth of $12 billion,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and has been accused by Ukrainian officials of misappropriating funds from Ukraine's treasury. [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] has claimed that treasury funds of up to $70 billion were transferred to foreign accounts during Yanukovych's presidency.
<ref>[http://news.sky.com/story/1218041/ukraine-treasury-stripped-by-ousted-regime], [[Sky News]] (27 February 2014)</ref>
Authorities in Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein froze the assets of Yanukovych and his son Oleksander on 28 February 2014 pending a [[money laundering]] investigation. Yanukovych has denied that he [[embezzled]] funds and has said that his alleged foreign accounts do not exist.

===Personal excesses===
Yanukovych abandoned his large estate, [[Mezhyhirya (residence)|Mezhyhirya]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/viktor-yanukovych-ukraine-secret-documents | title=With Viktor Yanukovych gone, Ukraine hunts for secrets of former leader | accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref> when he fled the capital. The estate is located in a former forest preserve on the outskirts of Kyiv.

He had acquired the property in 2007, according to critics, through a convoluted series of companies and transactions. Yanukovych did not reveal the price he paid, although he called it a "very serious price".<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66006/ "Ukrayinska Pravda exposes president’s Mezhygirya deal"], ''Kyiv Post'' (6 May 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314151108/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66006/ |date=14 March 2012 }}</ref> Mezhyhirya is estimated to have been sold for more than 75 million U.S. dollars.

Protesters walked unchallenged into the former president's office and residential compounds after police and security left their posts in Kyiv. Protesters had free access to government buildings, and to the presidential mansion and estate. They were amazed at the opulence and extravagance of what they found, including a private zoo, a fleet of cars, and a large boat.<ref>{{cite news|author=Oliver Poole |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-uprising-the-private-zoo-the-galleon-moored-on-a-private-lake-the-fleet-of-vintage-cars--ukrainians-left-openmouthed-at-the-opulence-of-yanukovychs-country-estate-9146886.html |title=Ukraine uprising: The private zoo, the galleon moored on a private lake, the fleet of vintage cars - Ukrainians left open-mouthed |newspaper=The Independent |date= 23 February 2014|accessdate=2014-02-25 |location=London}}</ref>

In a feature with photos on Yanukovych's Mezhyhirya mansion, Sergii Leshchenko notes "For most of [Yanukovych's] career he was a public servant or parliament deputy, where his salary never exceeded 2000 US dollars per month." Under a photo showing the new home's ornate ceiling, Leschenko remarks, "In a country where 35% of the population live under poverty line, spending 100,000 dollars on each individual chandelier seems excessive, to say the least." Crowned with a pure copper roof, the mansion was the largest wooden structure ever created by Finnish log home builder [[Honkarakenne|Honka]], whose representative suggested to Yanukovych that it be nominated for the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]. The property contained a private zoo, underground shooting range, 18-hole golf course, tennis, and bowling. After describing the mansion's complicated ownership scheme, the article author noted, "The story of Viktor Yanukovych and his residence highlights a paradox. Having completely rejected such European values as human rights and democracy, the Ukrainian president uses Europe as a place to hide his dirty money with impunity."<ref name="SL-OD" />

Documents recovered from Yanukovych's compound show among other expenses $800 medical treatment for fish, $14,500 spent on tablecloths, and a nearly 42 million dollar order for light fixtures. Also recovered were files on Yanukovych's perceived enemies, especially media members, including beating victim [[Tetyana Chornovol]]. The cost of monitoring the mass media was reportedly $5.7 million just for the month of December 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yanukovych Spent $800 on Fish Medical Treatment, Leaked Documents Show |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/yanukovych-spent-800-on-fish-medical-treatment-leaked-documents-show/495245.html|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=26 February 2014}}</ref>

When the former president departed, 35 cars and seven motorbikes were left behind. Kyiv's District Court seized 27 vintage cars in 2016 from the fleet stationed at Mezhyhirya, some worth more than $US 1 million.

Yanukovych told ''[[BBC Newsnight]]'' (in June 2015) that stories that Mezhyhirya cost the Ukrainian taxpayer millions of dollars were "political technology and [[Spin (public relations)|spin]]" and that the estate did not belong to him personally; he claimed that the ostriches in the residence's petting zoo "just happened to be there"<ref name="vybbcij15">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33224138 Ukraine crisis: Yanukovych regrets bloodshed in Kiev], [[BBC News]] (22 June 2015)</ref> and remarked "I supported the ostriches, what’s wrong with that?".

===Accusations of police abuse and vote rigging===
Yanukovych has been accused, by [[Amnesty International]] among others, of using the [[Berkut (Ukraine)|Berkut]] to threaten, attack, and torture Ukrainian protesters. The Berkut, disbanded on 25 February 2014, were a controversial national police force under his personal command and were accused of promoting Russian interests. The [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] confirmed witness accounts of voters being blocked from access to polls and being attacked along with local election officials who tried to frustrate the Berkut's practice of falsifying voters' ballots in favor of Yanukovych's Party of Regions candidates. Individual cases have been reported of citizens grouping together and fighting back against the Berkut in order to preserve election integrity and results.<ref name="BRP18Feb" /> Upon coming to power Yanukovych had reversed oversight measures established during the Yushchenko administration to restrain the Berkut's abuse of citizens whereupon the special force "upped its brutality."<ref name="Business Insider">{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-ukraines-brutal-berkut-police-force-2014-1 | title=Why Ukraine's Berkut Special Police Force Is So Scary |author=Harrison Jacobs|date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>

==Removal from presidency==
{{Main|Ukrainian Revolution of 2014}}

===Parliamentary vote===
On 22 February 2014, 328 of 447 members of the Ukrainian parliament (MPs)—or about 73% of the MPs—voted to "remove Viktor Yanukovych from the post of president of Ukraine" on the grounds that he was unable to fulfill his duties<ref>{{cite web|title=On Self-Removal of the President of Ukraine from his Constitutional Authority and Early Elections of the President of Ukraine|url=http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18|website=zakon.rada.gov.ua|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="EnUkrRev" /> and to hold early presidential elections on 25 May.<ref name="EnUkrRev"/><ref name="interfax1">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/192030.html "Rada removes Yanukovych from office, schedules new elections for May 25"], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (24 February 2014)</ref><ref name="SternBBC" /><ref name="w1.c1.rada.gov.ua"/><ref name="pravda.com.ua"/> The vote came an hour after Yanukovych said in a televised address that he would not resign. He subsequently declared himself to still be "the legitimate head of the Ukrainian state elected in a free vote by Ukrainian citizens".<ref name="KyivPost"/>

The constitutionality of Yanukovych's removal from office has been questioned by constitutional experts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yanukovych's removal was unconstitutional|url=https://gpforecasts.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/yanukovychs-removal-was-unconstitutional/|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> According to Daisy Sindelar from Radio Free Europe, the impeachment may have not followed the procedure provided by the constitution: ''"[I]t is not clear that the hasty February 22 vote upholds constitutional guidelines, which call for a review of the case by Ukraine's Constitutional Court and a three-fourths majority vote by the Verkhovna Rada -- i.e., 338 lawmakers."'' The vote, as analyzed by Sindelar, had ten votes less than those required by the constitutional guidelines. However, Sindelar noted in the same article that, "That discrepancy may soon become irrelevant, with parliament expected to elect a new prime minister no later than February 24." The decision to remove Yanukovich was supported by 328 deputies.{{efn|Feffer (2014) "Article 11 maintains that a vote on impeachment must pass by two-thirds of the members, and the impeachment itself requires a vote by three-quarters of the members.

==Former criminal convictions and new criminal cases==
On 15 December 1967, at the age of 17, Yanukovych was sentenced to three years incarceration for participating in a robbery<!--(Article 141, part 2 [[Criminal Code]] of [[Ukrainian SSR]]) --> and assault.<!-- (Article 102 [[Criminal Code]] of [[Ukrainian SSR]])--><ref name="Gorina" />

On 8 June 1970, he was convicted for a second time on charges of assault. He was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and did not appeal against the verdict. Decades later, Yanukovych characterized his arrests and incarceration as "mistakes of youth".<ref name="polit.ru" />

After the [[Euromaidan]] events the General Prosecutor opened at least four new criminal cases against the former president of Ukraine. This included multiple cash payments to a number of Ukraine's top officials which were investigated as suspected bribes. The payments totalled $2 billion over years, ranging from $500k to $20m paid in cash, the recipients included "ministers, heads of agencies, Verkhovna Rada members, civic activists, representatives of international organizations, top judges, including those of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, and the Central Election Commission".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/ex-official-says-he-filed-documents-on-party-of-regions-2-billion-graft-scheme-414895.html|title=Ex-official says he filed documents on Party of Regions' $2 billion graft scheme|website=Kyiv Post|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>

===Signing of the Kharkiv treaty===
{{details|Kharkiv Pact}}
Since the summer of 2014, the prosecutor's office has investigated the signing the Kharkiv treaty by Yanukovych that allowed the [[Black Sea Fleet]] to stay in Ukraine for an additional 25 years.<ref name="kharkiv_treaty">[https://web.archive.org/web/20141021190906/http://lb.ua/news/2014/10/21/283338_gpu_zavela_delo_yanukovicha.html GPU opened a case on Yanukovych for the Kharkiv treaty].

===Mass murder at Maidan===
Accusations of mass murder at Maidan included a group of Criminal Code articles including an attempt to relocate a headquarters of Supreme Commander-in-Chief, National Bank and Foreign Ministry to [[Sevastopol]] (Article 109, part 2) as well as Yanukovych's statements about the illegitimacy of higher state authorities after his overthrow (Article 109, part 3).<ref name=kharkiv_treaty/>

===Property theft through conspiracy===
Yanukovych is also charged with property theft in a conspiracy with the chairman of the Nadra Ukrainy state company (Articles 109 and 209), which has been under investigation since March 2014.<ref name=kharkiv_treaty/>

===Interpol===
For several years, Interpol refused to place Viktor Yanukovych on the wanted list as a suspect by the new [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] for the mass killing of protesters during Euromaidan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/interpol_vidmovivsya_ogolositi_u_rozshuk_yanukovicha_i_k_1999551|script-title=uk:Інтерпол відмовився оголосити у розшук Януковича і К°|trans-title=Interpol has declined putting Yanukovych and Co on wanted list|language=uk|agency=[[Ukrinform]]|date=8 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810043657/http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/interpol_vidmovivsya_ogolositi_u_rozshuk_yanukovicha_i_k_1999551|archivedate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

However, on 12 January 2015, Viktor Yanukovych was [[Interpol notice|listed by Interpol]] as "wanted by the judicial authorities of Ukraine for prosecution / to serve a sentence" on charges of "misappropriation, embezzlement or conversion of property by malversation, if committed in respect of an especially gross amount, or by an organized group".<ref name=rednotice/><ref>[http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/interpol_ogolosiv_u_rozshuk_yanukovicha_azarova_i_k_2009190 Interpol announced search for Yanukovych, Azarov, and Co] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112215108/http://www.ukrinform.ua/ukr/news/interpol_ogolosiv_u_rozshuk_yanukovicha_azarova_i_k_2009190 |date=12 January 2015 }}.

On 16 July 2015, some Russian media reported that Interpol had suspended its Red Notice for Yanukovych.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/279256.html|title=Yanukovych no longer listed as wanted person by Interpol|date=2015-07-21|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|accessdate=2015-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/world/20150721/1140672034.html|title=Интерпол подтвердил, что приостановил международный розыск Януковича|date=2015-07-21|agency=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=2015-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/interpol-snyal-nukovicha-mezhdunarodnogo-1437471031.html|title=Интерпол снял Януковича с международного розыска|date=2015-07-21|publisher=[[RBC Information Systems|RBC]] - Ukraine|accessdate=2015-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/1588826-echo.html|title=Former President of Ukraine Yanukovych no longer wanted by Interpol|date=2015-07-21|publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]]|accessdate=2015-07-21}}</ref> According to the Ukrainian Interpol office, this was a temporary measure due to Yanukovych's complaints that the charges were politically motivated.<ref>[http://www.unian.info/politics/1103190-yanukovych-disappears-from-interpol-wanted-list.html Yanukovych disappears from Interpol wanted list temporarily], [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] (21 July 2015)</ref>

Interpol later confirmed that Yanukovych and Oleksandr Yanukovych were no longer subject to an Interpol red notice or diffusion, and that they are unknown on Interpol's databases. Interpol's action followed an application to Interpol by Joseph Hage Aaronson on behalf of Yanukovych seeking his removal from the Interpol wanted list, as according to the law firm, the criminal charges brought by the Ukrainian government against Yanukovych were "part of a pattern of political persecution of him."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/yanukovych-no-longer-listed-as-wanted-person-by-interpol-393931.html|title=Yanukovych no longer listed as wanted person by Interpol - Jul. 21, 2015|date=2015-07-21|website=Kyiv Post|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> In 2017, Yanukovych's son was removed from Interpol's wanted list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/1905766-yanukovych-son-off-interpols-wanted-list.html|title=Yanukovych, son off Interpol's wanted list|date=3 May 2017|website=unian.info|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>

===Treason trial===
In November 2016, Prosecutor General [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] questioned Yanukovych via video link in connection with the former [[Berkut (special police force)|Berkut]]. During the questioning, Lutsenko told Yanukovych that he was being accused of treason.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/treason-trial-against-yanukovych-begins-in-ukraine/a-38682124|title=Treason trial against Yanukovych begins in Ukraine|last=Hubenko|first=Dmytro|date=4 May 2017|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>

On 14 March 2017, the Prosecutor General submitted to court documents of the Yanukovych's case on state [[treason]].<ref>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/03/14/7138115/ Case against Yanukovych was submitted to court (Справу проти Януковича передали до суду)].

More than 100 witnesses were interviewed for the case. One was [[Denis Voronenkov]], who was shot in downtown Kyiv at the end of March 2017.<ref name=":0" />

On 4 May 2017 the first preliminary session commenced in Kyiv's [[Obolonskyi District]] Court under Judge Vladyslav Devyatko. Yanukovych was not present and was tried ''in absentia''. He gave evidence via video link from Russia.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2017/05/04/ukraine-s-former-president-viktor-yanukovich-on-trial-what-is-he-being-accused-of|title=Ukraine's former president Viktor Yanukovich on trial.

Ukrainian prosecutors asked the court in Kyiv to sentence the former leader to 15 years in prison. Prosecutors Ruslan Kravchenko and Maksym Krym made the request on 16 August, during closing arguments of the trial. The judge then adjourned the trial until 13 September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/prosecutors-seek-15-years-in-prison-for-ukraine-s-ex-president/29437344.html|title=Prosecutors Seek 15 Years in Prison For Ukraine's Ex-President|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rferl.org/a/former-ukrainian-president-viktor-yanukovych-convicted-of-treason/29728084.html |title=Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych Convicted of Treason|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]| date=24 January 2019| accessdate =24 January 2019}}</ref>

However the former leader was hospitalized in Moscow days before he was scheduled to give the final statement. Yanukovych was taken to Moscow's [[wikidata:Q4304061|Sklifosovsky Institute of Emergency Medicine]] by ambulance on 16 November in an immobilized condition. He allegedly sustained back and knee injuries while "playing tennis".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10341630-yanukovych-reportedly-hospitalized-in-moscow-russian-media.html|title=Yanukovych reportedly hospitalized in Moscow – Russian media|date=18 November 2018|website=unian.info|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref><!-- Komsomolskaya Pravda reported on Nov. 18 -->

On 24 January 2019 a panel of three judges of the Obolonskyi District Court found Yanukovych guilty of high treason and complicity in Russian military intervention in Ukraine. They stated that "the court, having heard the testimony of witnesses, examined conclusions of experts, documents and material evidence, assessed the arguments of prosecution and defense, considers that the guilt of the accused in committing the crimes under Part 1 Article 111 (high treason), Part 5 Article 27, Part 2 Article 437 (complicity in conducting an aggressive war) of the [[Criminal Code of Ukraine]] is duly proved by relevant and admissible evidence".<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.unian.info/politics/10419795-court-finds-yanukovych-s-guilt-of-high-treason-complicity-in-war-proven.html |title=Court finds Yanukovych's guilt of high treason, complicity in war proven|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]]| date=24 January 2019| accessdate =24 January 2019}}</ref> He was acquitted of the other charge relating to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
