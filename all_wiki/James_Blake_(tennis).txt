'''James Riley Blake'''<ref name=Name>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/player.html?ccode=JBLAKE|title=James Blake stats at Tennis Warehouse|publisher=Tennis-Warehouse.com|accessdate=November 19, 2006}}</ref> (born December 28, 1979) is an American retired professional [[tennis]] player. Blake was known for his speed and powerful, flat forehand. During his career, Blake amassed 24 singles finals appearances (10–14 record), while his career-high singles ranking was World No. 4. Career highlights included reaching the final of the [[2006 Tennis Masters Cup]], the semifinals of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], the quarterfinals of the [[Australian Open]] (2008) and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (2005, 2006), as well as two titles at the [[Hopman Cup]] (2003, 2004) and being the No. 1 ranked American singles player. Blake was a key performer for the United States [[2007 Davis Cup]] championship team, going 2–0 in the championship tie vs. Russia at second singles.

In 2005, Blake was presented with the [[ATP World Tour Awards|Comeback Player of the Year]] award for his remarkable return to the tour. Later, in 2008, Blake was awarded another honor by the ATP, where he was named the [[ATP World Tour Awards|Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year]]. On July 3, 2007, Blake's autobiography, ''Breaking Back: How I Lost Everything and Won Back My Life'', which discussed his comeback after his unlucky 2004 season, was released and debuted at No. 22 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. He co-wrote this book with Andrew Friedman.

Blake announced that he would retire from tennis after competing at the 2013 US Open, where he suffered a first round loss in five sets against [[Ivo Karlovic]]. Blake's career ended on August 29, 2013, after a 6–2, 2–6, 2–6 doubles loss in the 2013 US Open.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2013/08/29/a-fitting-farewell-for-james-blake-in-flushing/ |title=A Fitting Farewell for James Blake in Flushing |magazine=Time |date=August 29, 2013 |first=Eric |last=Dodds |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Blake was born in [[Yonkers, New York]], to an [[African American]] father, Thomas Reynolds Blake, and a British mother, Betty.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/oconnor/2005-09-08-oconnor_x.htm|title=Blake's parents prevented race from jading him|work=USA Today|accessdate=August 30, 2015|date=September 8, 2005}}</ref> He has a brother [[Thomas Blake (tennis)|Thomas]], who has also been a professional tennis player, and three older half-brothers: Jason, Christopher, and Howard, and a half-sister Michelle.

Blake started playing tennis aged five alongside his older brother Thomas. When he was 13, he was diagnosed with severe [[scoliosis]], and for five years as a teenager he was forced to wear a full-length [[back brace]] for 18&nbsp;hours a day, though not while playing tennis.

The Blake family moved to [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] when Blake's father's job selling surgical supplies took him from New York to [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name="wiltononline">{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltononline.com/wilton/articles/print.asp?id=4058 |title=James Blake: Fairfield's Hometown Hero |publisher=Wilton Online |date=May 1, 2006 |first1=Deb |last1=Karazin Owens |first2=Norman |last2=Zeitchick |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}</ref> Blake attended [[Fairfield Warde High School|Fairfield High School]], where a schoolmate and childhood friend was future musician [[John Mayer]]. Blake was inspired to pursue tennis after hearing his role model [[Arthur Ashe]] speak to the [[Harlem]] Junior Tennis Program. Brian Barker was his first (and longtime) coach. Blake left [[Harvard University]], where he was a member of the [[A.D. Club]], after his [[sophomore year]] to pursue a career in professional tennis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/7/9/crimson-tennis-star-blake-becomes-pro/|title=Crimson Tennis Star Blake Becomes Pro - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/1/21/blake-talks-harvard-before-aussie-open/|title=Blake Talks Harvard Before Aussie Open - Sports - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com}}</ref>

==Career==

===2001–2004: Making name and breaking neck===

====2001====
At the age of 21, Blake saw his first [[Davis Cup]] action in 2001 against India and became the third person of [[African-American]] heritage to play for the [[Davis Cup]] for the United States (after [[Arthur Ashe]] and [[MaliVai Washington]]). Ranked no. 120 in the world, Blake accepted a wild card into [[Cincinnati Masters]]. He beat a qualifier and [[Arnaud Clément]] to reach the round of 16, where he met [[Patrick Rafter]]. Blake came close to winning the first set (falling in a tiebreak), and after dropping the second set, Rafter, according to Blake's autobiography, complimented him at the net and boosted his confidence immeasurably by saying, "Now do you believe you can beat someone like me, or even me?" Blake's name became more recognizable worldwide after he pushed the eventual champion [[Lleyton Hewitt]] to five sets at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].

====2002====
In January 2002, Blake won the 2002 [[USTA Waikoloa Challenger]] in Hawaii. A month later in Memphis he posted his first win over a top-10 ranked opponent, [[Tommy Haas]], who was then ranked no. 5, and reached the final, losing to [[Andy Roddick]]. He reached the quarterfinals at the [[ATP Masters Series]] (AMS) event in Rome in May and the final at Newport in July. In August, in [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], he won his first career ATP Tour title and his first ATP Masters Series title: it came in doubles with [[Todd Martin]], making Blake the first African-American male to win a title of any kind in Cincinnati's 101-year history. He was also the first African-American to reach a final in Cincinnati since 1969, when [[Arthur Ashe]] reached the doubles finals with [[Charlie Pasarell]]. The next week in Washington, he won his first ATP Tour singles title, beating [[Andre Agassi]] in the semifinals and [[Paradorn Srichaphan]] in the final. At the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], he reached the third round, where he again faced the top-ranked and world number one [[Lleyton Hewitt]] for the rematch of the previous year. In an entertaining match Blake was again defeated in five sets.

====2003====
In 2003, his best results were a quarterfinals appearance at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]]; a round of 16 finish at the [[Australian Open]], [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], and [[Miami Masters|Miami]]; a semifinal appearance at San Jose, and a finals appearance at Long Island, where he lost to Srichaphan. Blake was eliminated from the US Open in the 3rd round by [[Roger Federer]].

====2004====
2004 was a difficult year for Blake. In May, while practicing with [[Robby Ginepri]] for the Masters event in [[Rome Masters|Rome]], he broke his neck when he slipped on the clay and collided with the net post.  Blake fractured his seventh vertebra, but did not sustain any nerve damage and was ultimately able to make a full recovery from the injury.  In July, his father died of [[stomach cancer]]. At the same time, Blake developed [[Herpes zoster|shingles]], which temporarily paralyzed half his face and blurred his vision.<ref name="wiltononline"/>

===2005–2008: Rising to the elite and Top 10 years===

====2005====
Blake's injuries and personal issues caused him to post relatively poor results for the first half of 2005. By April his ranking was 210. He decided to play the Challenger circuit, the "minor leagues" of tennis, in order to regain confidence and get more matches. In May he entered events in Tunica, Mississippi and Forest Hills, New York, and won both. He rejoined the ATP circuit and by August reached the final at the International Series event in Washington, D.C., where he fell to Roddick. He was given a wild card into AMS [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], drawing Federer in the first round. He then won the [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], defeating [[Feliciano López]] in the final. After New Haven he was ranked 49.

Blake accepted a wildcard into the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] where he had a memorable run. After defeating No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]] in the round of 32, Blake beat [[Tommy Robredo]] in four sets to reach the quarterfinals where he faced [[Andre Agassi]]. The late-evening match is considered one of the greatest classics in the tournament's history. Blake was up two sets and a break in the third when Agassi made a comeback to eventually win in a fifth-set tiebreak. After the match Agassi said, "I wasn't the winner, tennis was".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen05/news/story?id=2155291|title=Agassi outlasts Blake in five sets|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=8 September 2005}}</ref> Later in October at the [[Stockholm Open]], Blake won his third ATP tour title, defeating Srichaphan in the final. Blake finished 2005 ranked 22 in the world.

====2006====
At the beginning of 2006, Blake won the title at [[Sydney International|Sydney]], taking his fourth [[ATP tour]] title defeating Russian [[Igor Andreev]] in the final. At the [[Australian Open]] he was seeded 20th, and despite losing in the third round to Spaniard [[Tommy Robredo]] he broke into the Top 20 for the first time in his career. In March he beat Hewitt in the final at [[Las Vegas Open|Las Vegas]] for his fifth ATP tour title. At the first AMS event of the year [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]], Blake defeated Robredo in the third round and world No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, reaching his first career ATP Masters Series singles final, losing in the final to Federer. By reaching the final, Blake became the first African-American man since [[Arthur Ashe]] to reach the world's top 10.

At the [[French Open (tennis)|French Open]] he defeated Spaniard [[Nicolás Almagro]] in four sets in the second round, to become the last remaining American, and then was beaten by Frenchman [[Gaël Monfils]] in five sets. Beginning the grass court season at the [[Stella Artois Championships]], he defeated [[Andy Roddick]] in the semifinals, losing to [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the final. Ranked No. 5, Blake took part in the [[ATP International Series|International Series]] at Indianapolis. He won the singles title, defeating Roddick (for the second time in 2006). At the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] he reached the quarterfinals, losing to top seed and defending champion [[Roger Federer]]. In that match Blake won his first ever set against Federer, winning the third set in a tiebreaker 11–9.

In his debut appearance at the [[PTT Thailand Open (ATP)|Thailand Open]] in [[Bangkok]], Blake won his seventh singles title, defeating [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the quarterfinals, [[Marat Safin]] in the semifinals, and [[Ivan Ljubičić]] (for the first time) in the final.
Two weeks later Blake won his fifth title of 2006, defending his 2005 title in [[Stockholm]], defeating [[Jarkko Nieminen]]. For the first time, Blake qualified for the [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in Shanghai. He went 2–1 in the Gold Group, defeating No. 2 Nadal and No. 3 [[Nikolay Davydenko]], while losing to No. 6 [[Tommy Robredo]]. He qualified for the semifinals, beating defending champion [[David Nalbandian]], losing the final to Federer. Blake finished 2006 at a career-high World Number 4 and as the highest-ranked American tennis player.

====2007====
In 2007 Blake won at the [[Sydney International]] for the second consecutive year. However, he then suffered a disappointing loss in the Round of 16 at the Australian Open, losing to tenth seed and eventual finalist [[Fernando González]]. In February, Blake made it to the final of the Delray Beach tournament, but lost it to the Belgian [[Xavier Malisse]] in three tight sets.

At the [[2007 Tennis Channel Open]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], as the defending champion, he was involved with a deep controversy. It was one of the several tournaments experimenting with the new round robin format,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/en/news/2007/round_robin1.asp|title=Round Robin 1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321145658/http://www.atptennis.com/en/news/2007/round_robin1.asp|archive-date=March 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Blake had lost his first match to Evgeny Korolev. Korolev lost his other match to Juan Martín del Potro. In order to advance to the quarterfinals, Blake had to defeat Del Potro in straight sets while losing five games or less. This would result in a three-way tie, with Blake losing the fewest games. With Blake leading 6–1, 3–1, Del Potro retired. This eliminated Del Potro from the three-way tie as he failed to complete one of his matches. Korolev then moved on to the next round, breaking the tie as he had defeated Blake in their direct match. Soon after, the organizers overruled the tournament guidelines, giving Blake a place in the quarterfinals. The following morning however, they changed the decision once again and as a result, Korolev re-advanced to the quarterfinals, while Blake was sent away from the tournament. Shortly after this incident, the ATP decided to cancel the round robin format, reverting any tournaments planning a round robin draw to the standard single-elimination draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/en/news/2007/roundrobin.asp|title=Round Robin|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328171427/http://www.atptennis.com/en/news/2007/roundrobin.asp|archive-date=March 28, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the summer hardcourt season, he advanced to his second career ATP Masters Series final. At AMS [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], he beat Alejandro Falla, Nicolas Kiefer, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Sam Querrey and Nikolay Davydenko en route to the final before falling to [[Roger Federer]]. He won the singles title at Penn Pilot in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and reached the final at Los Angeles, losing to [[Radek Štěpánek]] in three sets after having three set points in the first set. In the second round of the 2007 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], he won his first career five-set match against [[Fabrice Santoro]]. Blake made it to the fourth round, where he lost to No. 10 [[Tommy Haas]] in five sets, despite having match points in the fifth set. In September Blake and the rest of the US Davis Cup team [[2007 Davis Cup World Group#Sweden vs. United States|defeated Sweden]] to reach the finals against Russia.

Blake lost in the third round of Paris to [[Richard Gasquet]] and thus finished outside the top eight players, losing his chance to defend the points he gained as finalist in the 2006 [[Tennis Masters Cup]]. In the [[2007 Davis Cup]] finals Blake won his match against [[Mikhail Youzhny]] after [[Andy Roddick]] had beaten [[Dmitry Tursunov]] in the first rubber. The next day Bob and Mike Bryan won the doubles rubber over [[Igor Andreev]] and [[Nikolay Davydenko]], sealing the Davis Cup win for the United States.<ref name="Roddick, Blake Place USA in Reach of Davis Cup Title">{{cite news|author=[[Association of Tennis Professionals]] |title=Roddick, Blake Place USA in Reach of Davis Cup Title |url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2007news/dc_final1.asp |date=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |publisher=Association of Tennis Professionals |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206095400/http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2007news/dc_final1.asp |archive-date=December 6, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Davis Cup - World Group 2007 Final Results">{{cite news|author=[[International Tennis Federation]]|title=Davis Cup – World Group 2007 Final Results|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100008940|date=December 2, 2007|accessdate=December 5, 2007|publisher=International Tennis Federation }}</ref> Blake also defeated Tursunov in the last match of the finals to give Team USA 4–1 win.

====2008====
At the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Blake defeated his first round opponent, Chilean [[Nicolás Massú]]. He then defeated compatriot [[Michael Russell (tennis)|Michael Russell]]. In the third round, he fought back from two sets down to beat French veteran [[Sébastien Grosjean]] who had beaten him in each of their three previous meetings. In the fourth round, Blake beat [[Marin Čilić]] in three sets to advance to the quarterfinals, his best showing yet down under. In the quarterfinal, Blake faced world No. 1 Roger Federer, and fell in straight sets. Although out of the Australian Open, Blake's ranking jumped back into the Top 10 to No. 9 following his best performance in the tournament yet.

In Delray Beach, Blake made it to the final for the second consecutive year, but fell to No. 244 [[Kei Nishikori]] of Japan in three sets in the final. At the [[2008 Pacific Life Open]], Blake reached the quarter-finals before losing to [[Rafael Nadal]] in three sets. They met again in the next tournament at the [[2008 Miami Masters]] also in the quarter-finals, and again Blake lost to Nadal in three sets. Blake then started the clay court season at the River Oaks International tournament in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. In his second ATP final of the year and his first career clay-court final, Blake fell to Spaniard [[Marcel Granollers Pujol]].

In August 2008, Blake represented the United States as one of its three men's singles tennis players in the [[tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]. In the quarterfinals, he gained one of the biggest wins of his career with his first ever win over Roger Federer 6–4, 7–6. At the time, Federer was ranked as the world's No. 1 men's player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214542934.shtml|title=Blake eliminates Federer from Olympic Tennis|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815172556/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214542934.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His semifinal match was against [[Fernando González]], the Men's Singles bronze medalist at the [[tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]]. Blake had a triple match point in the final set, but would go on to lose 11–9. He then lost the bronze medal match to Serbian [[Novak Djokovic]].

In the US Open, Blake was stretched to a 5 set thriller against American teenager [[Donald Young (tennis)|Donald Young]] in the first round. Blake easily won his second round match after [[Steve Darcis]] retired and then lost to friend and fellow American [[Mardy Fish]] in the third round in straight sets.

=== 2009–2013: Later years ===

====2009====
[[File:Blake Estoril Open 2009 3.jpg|thumb |right|Blake in 2009]]
Blake defeated [[Frank Dancevic]] in the first round of the [[Australian Open]]. His success continued in the second round after deposing of Frenchman [[Sébastien de Chaunac]] in a match laden with spectator noise and bad line calls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldOfSport/idINIndia-37598420090122|title=Blake into third round after noisy encounter|agency=Reuters|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Blake went on to face the 18th seed, [[Igor Andreev]], in the third round and beat him. He lost in the fourth round in straight sets to the 2008 runner-up [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]].

[[File:Blake Roland Garros 2009 1.jpg|right|thumb|Blake at the [[2009 French Open]].]]
At the [[2009 Estoril Open]] Blake advanced to his first clay-court final on European soil, after beating second seed and former Estoril Open champion [[Nikolay Davydenko]] in a rain-interrupted semi-final that was carried over due to bad light. Blake was defeated by Spain's [[Albert Montañés]] later that day in the finals.  The 28-year-old Montanes saved two match points at 4–5 in the second set and fought back to beat fourth-seeded Blake in two hours and 14 minutes.

At the [[Aegon Championships]] at [[Queen's Club]], Blake defeated [[Ivan Ljubičić]], [[Sam Querrey]], and [[Mikhail Youzhny]] to reach the semi-finals. He then reached the final after [[Andy Roddick]] retired with an ankle injury in the first set when the score was tied at 4 games all. He then went on to lose in the final to [[Andy Murray]]. After being eliminated in the first round of the singles, Blake partnered with compatriot [[Mardy Fish]] at the Wimbledon Men's Doubles. The Americans advanced to the semi-finals where they lost to defending champions [[Daniel Nestor]] and [[Nenad Zimonjić]] despite winning the first two sets.

Following a 3rd round loss at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] to Spain's [[Tommy Robredo]], Blake split with longtime coach Brian Barker. He was replaced by Kelly Jones.

====2010====
At the [[2010 Australian Open]], Blake lost to fourth seed and US Open champion [[Juan Martín del Potro]] in the second round in five sets (8–10 final set). He then missed the clay court season due to a knee injury. Blake returned to action at [[2010 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]], where he lost in the first round to [[Robin Haase]], during which Blake accused [[ESPN]] commentator and former WTA player [[Pam Shriver]] of disrupting play due to her overly loud commentary from the box situated above the court behind him. This led to a verbal exchange between the two during the match. After the match, Blake declared that if his knee problems did not subside he would consider retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protennisfan.com/2010/06/james-blake-contemplating-retirement.html|title=James Blake Contemplating Retirement|publisher=Pro Tennis Fan|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref> Blake, who refused to take any anti-inflammatories for his knee, called his performance "embarrassing" and said "I can't beat these guys at 80 percent." Despite these comments, Blake played the US Summer hard court season, and reached the third round of the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]], where he lost to eventual finalist [[Novak Djokovic]]. Blake finished the year ranked outside the Top 100 for the first time since 2000.

====2011-2013====
Between the beginning of 2011-2013, Blake remained ranked outside the world's top 50, due to recurring injuries and loss of form. During the three seasons, he reached a single ATP-tour semifinal, at the [[2011 If Stockholm Open – Singles| 2011 Stockholm Open]]. At the US Open in August 2013, Blake announced his retirement.

==Playing style==

Blake was primarily an offensive baseliner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.co.uk/player/james-blake/index.shtml|title=James Blake Tennis Player Profile|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|website=www.tennis.co.uk}}</ref> Blake was known for possessing one of the most powerful forehands in the game, with a solid transition game, and an effective serve and volley. Blake also possessed extremely quick footwork, although many claimed that he needed to work on changing direction. Blake's reputation as a "shotmaker," combined with potentially high-error flat groundstrokes made his style of play notably flashy, characterized by both a high number of winners and unforced errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-prose.com/bios/the-ups-and-downs-of-james-blake/|title=The Ups and Downs of James Blake ·  Tennis-Prose.com|website=www.tennis-prose.com}}</ref> In turn, this made Blake's game somewhat streaky, as evidenced by his playing history.

==Equipment and endorsements==
Blake worked with [[Prince Sports|Prince]] to create a new racquet with Prince's O3 technology. However, he did not feel comfortable with this racquet. So, he switched back to the [[Dunlop Sport]] Aerogel 200, then the 4D 200, for the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/newspage.html?cref=2311|title=Newspage|publisher=Tennis-warehouse.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626235917/http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/newspage.html?cref=2311|archive-date=June 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He changed to [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] at the start of the 2010 season, using the new Six.One Tour strung with Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 16L strings at high tension (60+ pounds). He did not feel comfortable with this racquet either. Therefore, he switched back to Dunlop again. After the US Open of 2010, he began to test out rackets for [[Head (company)|Head]]. As August 26, 2011, he announced he will use Donnay rackets as his choice and using a customized Donnay X-Dual Pro.

===2015 NYPD incident===
On September 9, 2015, Blake was thrown down to the sidewalk, handcuffed, and arrested by a plainclothes [[New York City Police Department]] officer in front of the [[Grand Hyatt New York]] after being mistaken for a suspect of interest. The officers were relying on a witness and photo of a suspect that looked similar to Blake: they mistook him for a credit-card fraud suspect staying in the same hotel.<ref name="nyt20150911">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/nyregion/james-blake-new-york-police-officer.html |title=Bratton Apologizes for Arrest of James Blake, Ex-Tennis Pro |last1=Mueller |first1=Benjamin |last2=Baker |first2=Al |last3=Robbins |first3=Liz |date=10 September 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> Commissioner [[William Bratton]] apologized for the mistake and stated the "arrest raised serious questions about [the officer's] actions" but denied allegations of racism.<ref name="nyt20150911" /> Blake sued, but withdrew his claim, saying he wasn't looking for financial compensation, "on the condition that the city establish a legal fellowship to investigate police misconduct and advocate for victims of brutality".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tennis-star-james-blake-reveals-dropped-legal-action/story?id=48286646|title=Tennis star reveals why he dropped legal action in wrongful detention case|date=June 27, 2017|website=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/james-blake-withdraws-his-claim-in-nyc-police-brutality-1796368567|title=James Blake Settles NYC Police Brutality Case On Condition That City Creates Fellowship To Take On Cop Misconduct|first=Giri|last=Nathan}}</ref>
