'''Kinmen''', also '''Quemoy''', is a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] ([[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan]]) located in the [[Taiwan Strait]] between the island of Taiwan and [[mainland China]]. The main island of Kinmen County is Kinmen Island.<ref name="GNISkinmenisland">{{GEOnet2|6691ABBF475847DCB142C4937E95ABD5|Kinmen Island (Conventional - C)}}, [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]].</ref> Kinmen is located {{convert|10|km|miles|spell=in}} east of [[Xiamen]], a city located on the southeastern coast of China; the two territories are separated by a small [[bay]]. Kinmen is {{convert|187|km|miles|spell=|abbr=}} west from the nearest part of the island of Taiwan.

Kinmen's position in the Taiwan Strait made it a battlefront in the [[Cold War]]. In August 1958, Kinmen was heavily bombarded by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Communists]] during the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. Travel restrictions between Kinmen and the main island of Taiwan were maintained until 1994. Ferry service to Xiamen was established in January 2001.<ref>"[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/09/30/2003205028 `The Gibraltar of Asia' and a `park in the ocean']", ''Taipei Times'', Sep 30, 2004.</ref>

Kinmen County consists of the Kinmen Islands (including Kinmen and [[Lieyu]]) and the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] (Ockseu), which are located more than {{convert|110|km|miles}} to the northeast. Kinmen is one of two counties that was part of the now-defunct streamlined [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]], the other being [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang (Matsu)]].

The People's Republic of China claims Kinmen as part of [[Fujian|Fujian Province]] and considers Wuqiu to be a separate territory (also claimed as part of Fujian). Taiwan claims the [[Dadeng Subdistrict|Dadeng Islands]] (Tateng), administered by China, as part of Kinmen.

During the [[Ming dynasty]], more migrants settled in Kinmen. [[Koxinga]] used Kinmen as a base to liberate Kinmen and Penghu from the Dutch. He cut down trees to build his navy, resulting in massive deforestation that made Kinmen vulnerable to soil erosion.<ref name=lonelypl/>

The phrase "Quemoy and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]" became part of American political language in the [[1960 U.S. presidential election]]. During the debates, both candidates, Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and Senator [[John F. Kennedy]], pledged to use American forces if necessary to protect Taiwan from invasion by the PRC, which the United States did not recognize as a legitimate government. But in the second debate on October 7, 1960, the two candidates presented different opinions about whether to use American forces to protect [[Taiwan]]'s forward positions, Quemoy and Matsu, also. Senator Kennedy stated that these islands - as little as 9 kilometres (5.5&nbsp;mi) off the coast of China and as much as 170 kilometres (106&nbsp;mi) from Taiwan - were strategically indefensible and were not essential to the defense of Taiwan. Vice-President Nixon maintained that since Quemoy and Matsu were in the "area of freedom," they should not be surrendered to the Communists as a matter of principle.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Norris | first=Robert B. | url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2010/0912/comm/norris_quemoymatsu.html | date=November 29, 2010 | title=Quemoy and Matsu: a historical footnote revisited | journal=American Diplomacy | accessdate=2014-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020144403/http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2010/0912/comm/norris_quemoymatsu.html|archive-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>

{{quotation|Well, the United States has on occasion attempted, mostly in the middle '50s to persuade [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to pull his troops back to Formosa.

We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it is attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa, but it is extremely difficult to make that judgment.<br/>Now, Mr. [[Christian Herter|Herter]], in 1958, when he was [[United States Under Secretary of State|Under Secretary of State]], said they were strategically indefensible. Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Spruance]] and [[J. Lawton Collins|Collins]] in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands in their conference on the Far East. General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgway]] has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a war, if you're going to get into a war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa, we should come to its defense. It leaves this rather in the air that we will defend it under some conditions but not under others, I think it is a mistake.<br/>Secondly, I would not suggest a withdrawal at the point of the Communist guns. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the Island of Formosa. It leaves 100 miles{{efn|The island of Taiwan is separated from the southeast coast of [[China]] by the [[Taiwan Strait]], which ranges from {{convert|220|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its widest point to {{convert|130|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its narrowest.}} between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it is unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.<br/>I think that we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in [[West Berlin|Berlin]]. I believe strongly we should do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line, in case of a war, should be drawn on those islands, but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it has been my judgement ever since 1954, at the time of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.}}

Then-Vice President Nixon retorted:<ref name="cspan"/><ref name="matthews"/><ref name="jointapperances"/>
{{quotation|I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.<br/>I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that, and Secretary [[Dean Acheson|Acheson]] made a very famous speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|Press Club]] early in the year that the Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war, but it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in.<br/>Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate- they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them- they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that, we start a chain reaction, because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're after Formosa. In my opinion, this is the same kind of woolly thinking that lead to disaster for America in Korea, I'm against it, I would never tolerate it as President of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.}}

After the third debate on October 13, 1960, Kennedy's advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the USA would not stand united against aggression. Nixon pointed out the change in Kennedy's position but decided not to press the point due to the importance of the USA's role in what was an extremely tense situation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo/page/272 272]|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-446-93259-0|title=RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon|author=[[Richard Nixon]]|date=1978|via=[[Internet Archive]]|url-access=registration|quote=Once again I hit hard on the Quemoy-Matsu issue, stating that Kennedy's willingness to surrender the islands to the Communists under threat of war was no different from submitting to blackmail. Shortly after the third debate I learned that one of Kennedy's top foreign policy advisers had telephoned Secretary of State Herter to say that Kennedy did not want to give the Communists the impression that America would not stand united against aggression and was therefore prepared to revise his position in order not to appear to oppose the administration on this issue. I saw this as Kennedy's way of trying to slide away from an unpopular position, and my immediate inclination was not to let him get away with it. But the Quemoy-Matsu situation was so tense, and the importance of America's role in discouraging Communist aggression was so great, that I decided not to press the point if Kennedy modified his stand. I pointed out how his changed attitude reflected his lack of experience, and then let the issue drop.}}</ref> Nixon's polls among Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon's position on the issue.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask|page=[https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask/page/444 444]|date=1963|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|author=[[Victor Lasky]]|title=J.F.K. : the man and the myth|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>

Many Taiwanese businessmen use the link through Kinmen to enter the Chinese mainland, seeing it as cheaper and easier than entering through Hong Kong. However, this changed following the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China]] and the 2008 [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential]] and [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|legislative]] victories of the KMT, that allowed easier [[cross-Strait relations]]. Kinmen has experienced a considerable economic boom as businessmen relocate to the island for easier access to the vast markets of the PRC.

== Geology ==
Kinmen, much like the surrounding Chinese mainland, is predominantly composed of [[Cretaceous]] aged [[granite]], with lesser amounts of [[Eocene]]-[[Oligocene]] [[sandstone]], [[Miocene]] [[basalt]] and [[Pleistocene]]-[[Holocene]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], the thickness of the sediments varies from 150 metres in the west to only a few metres in the east.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Liou|first1=Tai-Sheng|last2=Lu|first2=Hsueh-Yu|last3=Lin|first3=Cheng-Kuo|last4=Lin|first4=Wayne|last5=Chang|first5=Yu-Te|last6=Chien|first6=Jeng-Ming|last7=Chen|first7=Wen-Fu|date=October 2009|title=Geochemical investigation of groundwater in a Granitic Island: a case study from Kinmen Island, Taiwan|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00254-008-1664-7|journal=Environmental Geology|language=en|volume=58|issue=7|pages=1575|doi=10.1007/s00254-008-1664-7|s2cid=128799871|issn=0943-0105}}</ref>

The people of Kinmen see themselves as Kinmenese, ''Mínnánrén''<!--ROC pronunciation is Mín, not Mǐn http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/cbdic/gsweb.cgi?o=dcbdic&searchid=Z00000031962-->/''Mǐnnánrén'' (people of Southern Fujian), or [[Chinese people|Chinese]], but not so much as [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]].<ref name="di Genova">Trista di Genova.

===Language===
Many of the county's inhabitants speak [[Hokkien]]; the [[Quanzhou dialect|Quanzhou accent]] is predominant. Most residents will say they speak Kinmenese, which is mutually intelligible with [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]. The residents of Wuchiu Township speak [[Pu-Xian Min]], as opposed to Hokkien for the rest of Kinmen.

===Others===
Kinmen is notable for a number of cultural products. Due to the extensive shelling by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the 1950s, Kinmen is famous for its [[Kinmen knife|artillery shell knives]]. Local artisans would collect the vast amounts of exploded ordnance and make high-quality knives which are still sought after by chefs and connoisseurs.  Kinmen is also home of the regionally famous [[Kinmen Kaoliang]] liquor, a spirit ranging between 38 and 63 percent alcohol, which is highly appreciated by the Taiwanese. Other local culinary specialties include {{ill|Kinmen noodles|zh|金門麵線}}, ''{{ill|kòng-thn̂g|zh|貢糖}}'' and beef [[jerky]] ([[bakkwa]]).

Like the [[Ryukyus]], Kinmen is known for [[shisa]] (wind-lion god) figures (風獅爺).<ref>[http://www.kmnp.gov.tw/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55&Itemid=79 "Wind Lion God"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504061824/http://www.kmnp.gov.tw/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55&Itemid=79 |date=2012-05-04 }} at the [[Kinmen National Park]] website. 6 June 2009.

== Economy ==
Kinmen's economy is mainly based on tourism and services due to its proximity to mainland China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=Interactions&title=Cross-strait+Interactions+and+Exchanges&m_id=29 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423220111/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=Interactions&title=Cross-strait+Interactions+and+Exchanges&m_id=29 |archive-date=2005-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinataiwan.org/english/News/zt/tdl/200310/t20031028_121559.htm |title=news |publisher=Chinataiwan.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216064003/http://www.chinataiwan.org/english/News/zt/tdl/200310/t20031028_121559.htm |archive-date=2012-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Juguanglou.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Juguang Tower]] ("Brightness of Ju"), a famous landmark in Kinmen.]]

Because of its military importance, development on the island was extremely limited. Only by 2003, Kinmen opened up itself to tourists from [[Fujian]] in [[China|Mainland China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwanholidays.com.au/taiwans-kinmen-island-visited-by-chinese |title=Taiwan's Kinmen Island visited by Chinese - Taiwan Holidays - Australia's #1 Taiwan Travel Specialist, Taiwan Tour Wholesaler, Escorted Group Tour, Taiwan Holiday Package, Round Taiwan Island Tour, Taiwan Taipei Stopover, Taiwan Hotels, Taiwan Group Tour, Taipei Day Tour |publisher=Taiwan Holidays |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409221615/http://www.taiwanholidays.com.au/taiwans-kinmen-island-visited-by-chinese |archive-date=2014-04-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is now a popular weekend tourist destination for Taiwanese and is known for its quiet villages, old-style architecture and beaches. Chinese and Taiwanese tour groups also spend a short time touring the island whilst transiting between the ferry and the airport, as an intermediate stop between China and Taiwan. Large parts of Kinmen form the [[Kinmen National Park]] which highlights military fortifications and structures, historical dwellings and natural scenery.

The year 2014 recorded the highest number of passengers traveling by ferry between Kinmen and [[Fujian]] ports for as many as 1.5 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/national-news/2014/12/31/425332/Over-15.htm|title=Over 1.5 mil. have ridden with Kinmen-Fujian ferry|publisher=The China Post|access-date=2015-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621182739/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/national-news/2014/12/31/425332/Over-15.htm|archive-date=2015-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 1 January 2015, [[China|Chinese mainland]] tourists were no longer be required to apply for [[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit]] in advance for visits to Kinmen, [[Penghu]] and [[Matsu Islands]]. Instead, they can apply for it upon arrival at a cost of NT$600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201412100015.aspx|title=Taiwanese offshore islands to ease travel for Chinese from Jan. 1|publisher=Focus Taiwan|access-date=2014-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210170134/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201412100015.aspx|archive-date=2014-12-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 2016, two infrastructure projects are expected to boost tourism and [[meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions]] visitors to the islands. One includes a yet-to-be-named five-star resort spearheaded by Xiamen property developer, Wu Youhua, president of Xiamen Huatian Group, the first time a Chinese interest has been allowed to invest in the Taiwan hotel sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=MICE development hits Kinmen|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/index.php/article-level-2/?article_id=5277|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

===Industry===
Kinmen is famous for the production of [[Kaoliang wine]], which takes up about 75% of Taiwan's market share, in which it is a strong economic backbone of the county. Traditional industries are also being kept and improved, ranging from agriculture, fishery and livestock. It has a good fishery industry also due to its nature being surrounded by unpolluted sea.

Kinmen also produces its unique [[Kinmen knife]], in which the raw material used to produce it is taken from the remaining of shells fired by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in 1958-1978. The knife was made as gift to the visiting Head of [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] [[Zhang Zhijun]] to Kinmen on 23–24 May 2015 to symbolize mutual peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to bury the hatchet left from [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investkinmen.com/eng/about/main.php?mainId=1&proId=2 |title=Invest in Kinmen |publisher=Investkinmen.com |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518135205/http://www.investkinmen.com/eng/about/main.php?mainId=1&proId=2 |archive-date=2014-05-18 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201505240010.aspx|title=Kinmen knives symbolize cross-strait peace: Chinese official|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104921/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201505240010.aspx|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Imported goods===
Kinmen often import more goods from Mainland China than Taiwan Island because of lower costs due to the proximity of the county to the mainland. During the campaign for the [[2014 Taiwan local elections|2014 county magistrate]], all of the magistrate candidates spent their money on campaign materials produced in mainland provinces, such as [[Guangdong]], [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] instead of from Taiwan Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141120000090&cid=1101 |title=Kinmen candidates prefer China-produced campaign materials |accessdate=11 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119204530/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141120000090&cid=1101 |archive-date=19 January 2015 }}</ref>

==Politics==
{{see also|List of county magistrates of Kinmen}}
[[File:Yang Cheng-Wu By Arvin 0002 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|[[Yang Cheng-wu]], the incumbent Magistrate of Kinmen County]]

The island consistently votes for the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). Until the early 1990s, proponents of [[Taiwan independence]] argued that they would consider handing Kinmen over to the PRC in any negotiated settlement. Residents of the island have broadly opposed such measures, fearing the consequences of the PRC government's policies on their standard of living and political freedom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has a minor presence on the island and typically does not present candidates to stand in local elections, although it does hold a single seat in [[Kinmen County Council]] from both of the [[2009 Taiwanese local elections|2009]] and [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|2014 local elections]]. However, the party occasionally lends support to liberal or center-left candidates.

On 29 November 2014 however, independent candidate [[Chen Fu-hai]] won the [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|county magistrate election]] and took office as the [[List of county magistrates of Kinmen|Magistrate of Kinmen County]] on 25 December 2014, the first independent candidate to win the office. He replaced Magistrate [[Lee Wo-shih]] of the [[Kuomintang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141129000118&cid=1101|title=Independent Chen Fuhai wins Kinmen magistrate race|publisher=wantchinatimes.com|access-date=5 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210072639/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141129000118&cid=1101|archive-date=10 December 2014}}</ref> The [[2014 Taiwan local elections|2014 Kinmen County magistrate election]] consisted of 10 candidates, the highest number of nominated candidates in the electoral history of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/analysis/2014/11/27/422758/p1/9-in-1-Elections.htm|title=9-in-1 Elections' campaigns run hot in Taitung and the outlying islands|publisher=The China Post|access-date=2015-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119204009/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/analysis/2014/11/27/422758/p1/9-in-1-Elections.htm|archive-date=2015-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Kinmen - Shuitou Harbor - DSCF9374.JPG|left|thumb|[[Tashan Power Plant]]]]

===Electricity===
The Kinmen Power Company was founded in 1967 and gradually built five power plants in the county and is in charge of providing power resources to all residents in Kinmen. It used to rely on [[Diesel fuel|light diesel oil]] which created high cost burden to its management. Since 1992, the ROC central government approved the power company to authorize [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower) for five-year management. All of the power development projects were invested by Taipower and helped the region economic development. In July 1997, Kinmen Power Company was officially incorporated to Taipower. In 1999, the diesel-fired [[Tashan Power Plant]] was built to supply electricity to Kinmen grid. The other smaller power plants were subsequently discontinued to reduce cost.<ref name=km_aware/>

===Submarine telecommunication cable===
In August 2012, Kinmen and [[Xiamen]] established the first submarine telecommunication cable between the two sides. On Taiwan side, the infrastructure was constructed by [[Chunghwa Telecom]], while on mainland China's side was done by [[China Telecom]], [[China Unicom]] and [[China Mobile]]. The project was initially launched in 1996 and took 16 years to build.<ref name="taipeitimes1">{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/08/22/2003540904 |title=Chunghwa Telecom hails submarine cable to Xiamen |work=Taipei Times |date=22 Aug 2012 |page=3 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511102354/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/08/22/2003540904 |archive-date=11 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The telecommunication system consists of two cables, one is a {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} long cable that runs from Kinmen's Lake Tzu and Xiamen's Mount Guanyin, and the other is a {{convert|9.7|km|abbr=on}} long cable that runs from Guningtou on Greater Kinmen Island (ROC) to Dadeng Island (PRC). The system is a non-repeater system with a bilateral transmission capacity of 90 Gbit/s, which might be expanded in the future if demand arises.<ref name="taipeitimes1"/>

===Water supply===
The current daily water demand for Kinmen is 50,000 tonnes, which are used for households, industries and agriculture sectors. One tonne of water produced for Kinmen costs about NT$50–60 and may surge to NT$70 during summer. In extreme drought condition, water shipment from Taiwan Island may cost as much as NT$200 per tonne. Because Kinmen residents pay only NT$10 for each tonne water they use, the cost of water supply has become a heavy burden for the [[Kinmen County Government|county government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1201&MainCatID=12&id=20150522000075|title=Kinmen-Fujian water pipeline to be agreed at upcoming cross-strait talks|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801024907/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1201&MainCatID=12&id=20150522000075|archive-date=1 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

For decades, Kinmen has been facing difficulties in water supply to its residence due to its shallow lakes, lack of rainfall and geographical constraints which makes building reservoirs and dams unfeasible. Therefore, Kinmen often overuses its groundwater, causing rising tidal flood and [[soil salinity]].
 
In early September 2013, the  [[People's Republic of China]] government agreed to supply Kinmen with water from [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang City]] in [[Fujian]] due to the ongoing [[water shortage]] problem in Kinmen. Kinmen draws more than 8,000 tonnes of [[groundwater]] every day and water from its reservoir is barely enough to support the residents during the dry season. The shortage problem will heavily hit the local economy by 2016 if no mitigation plan is enacted. The water supply agreement was officially signed on 20 July 2015 in Kinmen between Kinmen County Waterworks Director Weng Wen-kuei ({{lang|zh-hant|翁文貴}}) and Fujian Water Supply Co chairman Zhu Jinliang ({{lang|zh|朱金良}}) witnessed by Kinmen County [[List of county magistrates of Kinmen|Magistrate]] [[Chen Fu-hai]] and Fujian Province Governor [[Su Shulin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/21/2003623554|title=Kinmen water deal not a security risk: official|publisher=Taipei Times|access-date=2015-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145555/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/21/2003623554|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Jinjiang–Kinmen Pipeline|water pipeline]] was officially opened on 5 August 2018 when the first water supply was delivered in a ceremony held in both Kinmen County and [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang City]] in Mainland China.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Yi-hsuan|last1=Lu|date=6 August 2018|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2018/08/06/2003698048|title=Kinmen starts importing Chinese water|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420144021/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2018/08/06/2003698048|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Kinmen Airport 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kinmen Airport]]]]
[[File:Kinmen - Shuitou Harbor - DSCF9379.JPG|thumb|[[Shuitou Pier]]]]

===Air===
Kinmen is served by [[Kinmen Airport]], a domestic airport located at [[Jinhu, Kinmen|Jinhu Township]], connecting Kinmen with [[Magong Airport]], Penghu and [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Taipei Songshan]], [[Kaohsiung Airport|Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung Airport|Taichung]], [[Chiayi Airport|Chiayi]] and [[Tainan Airport]] on Taiwan Island.

===Sea===
People coming from Mainland China can also visit Kinmen using ferry via [[Fujian]] from [[Xiamen]] at [[Wutong Ferry Terminal]] or from [[Quanzhou]] arriving at [[Shuitou Pier]] in [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amoytrip.com/ferry-between-xiamen-and-kinmen-taiwan.html |title=Ferry from Xiamen to Kinmen, Taiwan &#124; Travel Guide |publisher=Amoytrip.com |date=2012-08-25 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409172516/http://www.amoytrip.com/ferry-between-xiamen-and-kinmen-taiwan.html |archive-date=2014-04-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kinmen to Xiamen Ferry, is a popular route between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwanese tourists alike, with brisk connections available between the ferry ports and Kinmen Airport (for Taiwanese destinations) and [[Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport|Xiamen's Airport]] and [[Xiamen North Railway Station]] (for Mainland destinations). The Kinmen-Quanzhou Ferry is only available to local travellers and foreigner passport holders are not permitted to use this service.

A new commercial port has been built adjacent to the Shuitou Pier on newly reclaimed land. This will handle the majority of sea freight to and from Kinmen. Previously most of this traffic was handled by a smaller port on the South-East corner of the island in Jinhu Township. In the past, due to constant [[artillery]] shelling from the Chinese mainland, an underground port was used to supply the island in times of conflict at the [[Jhaishan Tunnel]]s on the South-Western tip of the island but this has been decommissioned and turned into a tourist attraction.

Greatly used as a transit route between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan Island, buses also connect to the ferry terminal to allow for quick transfer to the [[Xiamen]].

In October 2019, Mainland China announced a plan to build a bridge linking [[Xiamen]] to Kinmen. Taiwan's [[Mainland Affairs Council]] (MAC) said that the plans were made unilaterally by China as part of its schemes to absorb Taiwan and divide Taiwanese society and that they see no need for bridges linking either [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] or Kinmen to China.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Pei-ju|last1=Teng|date=14 October 2019|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3795498|title=China announces 'initial plans' to build bridges to Taiwan's outlying islands Matsu, Kinmen|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015001758/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3795498|archive-date=15 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
