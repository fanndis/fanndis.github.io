==Early life==
Joseph McGinty Nichol was born in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], and grew up in [[Newport Beach, California]]. As his uncle and grandfather were also named Joe, his mother nicknamed him "McG" to avoid confusion.<ref name=hotwheels/>

McG attended [[Corona del Mar High School]], where he met [[Mark McGrath]]. Initially he wanted to become the lead singer of a band he formed with McGrath. However, he failed as a front man and persuaded McGrath to take over. Instead he worked behind the scenes as producer and marketer for the band until he was 22. He then obtained a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from UC Irvine. The band had several hit singles as [[Sugar Ray]], signed with a label, and went on tour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Borden|first=Mark|title=Hollywood's Rogue Mogul: How Terminator Director McG Is Blowing Up the Movie Business|publisher=FastCompany.com|date=May 1, 2009|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/135/hollywoods-rogue-humanoid.html?page=0%2C0|access-date=September 17, 2009}}</ref>  McG worked as a still photographer, shooting local bands and musicians.

==Career==
===Early work===
In 1995, McG produced [[Sugar Ray]]'s [[Lemonade and Brownies|first album]] and co-[[songwriter|wrote]] several songs on [[Floored|their second]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/135/hollywoods-rogue-humanoid.html?page=0%2C2|title=Hollywood's Rogue Mogul: How Terminator Director McG Is Blowing Up the Movie Business |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=May 1, 2009|access-date=November 14, 2009}}</ref> His music career included directing over fifty music videos such as [[Smash Mouth]]'s "[[All Star (song)|All Star]]", [[The Offspring]]'s "[[Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)]]", and directing documentaries on [[Korn]] and [[Sugar Ray]]. In 1997, he was awarded the [[Billboard Music Award|Billboard]]'s Pop Video of the Year Award for Smash Mouth's "[[Walking on the Sun]]" and the Music Video Production Association's Pop Video of the Year Award for Sugar Ray's "[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]".<ref name="awards">{{cite web|title=McG Hollywood Breakthrough Directing Award|work=HollywoodAwards.com|date=October 1, 2002|url=http://hollywoodawards.com/breakthrough/index.html|access-date=July 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305235601/http://www.hollywoodawards.com/breakthrough/index.html|archive-date=March 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Eventually, this landed him in the television commercial business, directing advertisements for [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Coca-Cola]]. A notable one was a commercial for [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]], which was honored at the 1999 [[London International Film Festival]].<ref name=mcgcareer>{{cite web|title=McG Biography|work=StarPulse.com|date=January 30, 2009|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/McG/Biography/|access-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>

===2000–2007===
Impressed with McG's music videos, [[Drew Barrymore]] approached him about directing a ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' film. He accepted, wanting to take on bigger projects, and pitched the movie to the studio executives, who were initially reluctant but later approved the project after much persistence. The film, for which he was paid $350,000, was released in 2000 and went on to gross over $250 million worldwide with mixed critical reception from critics and fans alike. However, he won the Hollywood Breakthrough Award at the 6th Annual [[Hollywood Film Festival]] held in 2002.<ref name=awards/> Proving himself to be quite bankable, Sony paid him $2.5 million to helm the military action-drama ''Dreadnought'' for Red Wagon Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=McG on ''Fast Track'' with ''Dreadnaught''|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 12, 2001|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/307/307099p1.html|access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref> He was also set to develop a sequel to ''Charlie's Angels'' and present his film producing debut with ''Airshow'', the latter of which has yet to be made.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=''Airshow'' McG's Next|website=[[IGN]]|date=January 11, 2001|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036301p1.html|access-date=September 15, 2009}}</ref>

In February 2002, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] attached him onto the fifth installment in the ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]'' film series that was in [[development hell]], thus putting his previous projects on hold. McG and Peters hired [[J. J. Abrams]] to pen a new script for the film entitled ''Superman: Flyby'', which was submitted in July 2002.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mike White |title=''Superman'': Grounded |work=Cashiers du Cinemart |url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_15/15_superman.asp?IshNum=15 |access-date=January 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216230219/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_15/15_superman.asp?IshNum=15 |archive-date=February 16, 2008 }}</ref> Bailing out of the project in favor of ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' in September 2002, McG was replaced by [[Brett Ratner]].<ref name=superman/> Meanwhile, he developed and co-created a television series with [[John McNamara (writer)|John McNamara]] called ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'' (2002), which was eventually canceled after one season due to the high costs of each episode.<ref name=biography/> [[Josh Schwartz]] approached him and his producing partner, [[Stephanie Savage]], about another television series as well, ''[[The O.C.]]'' (2003), which revolved around the lives of several teenagers based in McG's hometown of Newport Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theocinsider.com/backstage/insidercommentary/archive/01.html|title=Josh Schwartz: "The O.C."

The sequel to ''Charlie's Angels'' followed in 2003, and although not as successful as the first, ''Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'' (2003) also made over $250 million worldwide.<ref name=mcgcareer/> Shortly thereafter, [[Sony]] extended its first-look production deal with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] for an additional three years, with ''Hot Wheels'', ''Airshow'', and ''Radiant'' on their film slate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|title=Col Extends Mcg-savage Prod'n Deal|publisher=AllBusiness.com|date=September 3, 2007|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4802545-1.html|access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref> Since then, none of those films have been developed with the former, which was previously supposed to be a directing vehicle for him in 2003 (he later chose to produce instead in 2006),<ref name=hotwheels/><ref>{{cite web|author=KJB|title=McG to Direct ''Hot Wheels'' Movie|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 30, 2003|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/384/384454p1.html|access-date=January 31, 2009}}</ref> being put into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot Wheels, Barbie, He-Man in Development|work=WorstPreviews.com|date=January 3, 2009|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=11484&count=0|access-date=January 31, 2009}}</ref>

Warner Bros., still satisfied with his bankability, re-hired him to direct ''Superman: Flyby'' in April 2003 after Ratner had dropped out due to casting and pre-production difficulties. During his tenure, McG and the producers spent more than $15 million planning storyboards, concept art, and locations, as well as having script revisions and the film completely pre-visualized. However, McG later left the project, citing his [[fear of flying]] to Sydney.<ref name=herocomplex>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title='Terminator Salvation' director McG: "I have a lot to prove"|newspaper=[[LA Times]]|date=May 14, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/05/mcg-is-at-a-crossroads-with-terminator-salvation-i-have-a-lot-to-prove.html|access-date=November 21, 2009}}</ref> This eventually brought [[Bryan Singer]] on board in July 2004, resulting in ''[[Superman Returns]]''.<ref name=superman>{{cite web|title=The Strange and Evil Tale of the Production of Superman V|work=Electric-Escape.net|date=January 30, 2009|url=http://electric-escape.net/?q=node/1073|access-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref> McG produced the television series, ''[[The Mountain (TV series)|The Mountain]]'' (2004), on the same year, also getting canceled after one season.<ref name=biography/>

His next television work was ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' (2005), for which he served as an executive producer until 2013.<ref name=biography/> The following year saw Warner Bros. allowing McG, who "looked to improve as a storyteller and wanted to get more substantial material," to direct ''[[We Are Marshall]]'' (2006), a [[sports film|sports]] drama film.<ref name=hotwheels/> Although the film received mixed critical reception, McG was complimented for his ability of emotional storytelling. Jessica Reaves of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' noted that "McG shows new maturity. Scenes that could have been played for ghoulish effect, like the plane crash and its fiery aftermath, are handled with skillful efficiency."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-we-are/162977/content |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504135423/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-we-are/162977/content |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> At a budget of $35 million, the film only made $43.5 million.<ref name=mcgcareer/> He had also produced the horror film ''[[Stay Alive]]'' (2006), which received largely negative reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/stay-alive|title=Stay Alive (2006): Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

Along with [[Adam Brody]], McG was next set to produce a remake of the cult comedy hit ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'', planned for a release in 2007 with a budget of $12.5 million and filming to begin at [[Emory University]]. However, after reviewing the script, university officials backed out two weeks before filming, citing it as "too bawdy." This led the film to be shot at [[Agnes Scott College]] for two weeks, but producers [[Fox Atomic]] shelved it due to the "lack of wide open space Emory's campus would have afforded them and [the fact that] winter was fast approaching making the prospect of shooting the movie's many outdoor scenes problematic."<ref>{{cite web|author=Josh Grossberg|title=No ''Revenge'' for New Nerds|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 22, 2006|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b53817_No_Revenge_for_New_Nerds.html|access-date=January 31, 2009}}</ref> Furthermore, studio executive [[Peter Rice (executive)|Peter Rice]] was disappointed with the [[dailies]].<ref>{{cite news|authors=Nicole Laporte, Alex Romanelli|title=Atomic blast to 'Nerds'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 21, 2006|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117954365.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|access-date=January 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202082854/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117954365.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|archive-date=February 2, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2007, McG worked mostly on television, producing ''[[Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll]]'' (2007) and ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' (2007).<ref name=biography/> Co-created by [[Josh Schwartz]], his partner on ''The O.C.'', he directed the latter's pilot and continues to be an executive producer on the ongoing series.

On October 30, 2007, Fox approved a pilot for an American remake of the British cult show ''[[Spaced]]'', which McG served as an executive producer, even though [[Simon Pegg]] and fans were outraged at the prospect of having a remake without the original creators' involvement.

==Personal life==
McG has suffered from [[agoraphobia]]. He was unable to board a plane going to Australia to shoot ''[[Superman: Flyby]]'' and dropped from the film as a result. McG told people he suffered from fear of flying despite the issue being persistent agoraphobia.  "It was easier to say it was a fear of flying because, while it might make me look weak, people can understand it and I don't have to say, 'Well, I'm kind of crazy,'" he told Fast Company.

His brother died of a [[cocaine overdose]] in 2007, which he says has kept him grounded and reminds him not to take life for granted.<ref name=mcgcareer/><ref>{{cite web|author=girl|title=McG on brotherly loss and headbutts|work=CelebUtopia.com|date=June 12, 2009|url=http://www.celebutopia.net/2009/06/mcgs-tragedy-keeps-him-grounded/|access-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref>
