==Music career==

===1992–1995: Early years===
Under stage name Fat Joe da Gangsta and part of the rap group [[D.I.T.C.]], Cartagena was signed to Relativity Records in the early 1990s, recording material and working with many artists whom he would later sign to his own label. In 1993, his debut album ''[[Represent (Fat Joe album)|Represent]]'' was released, featuring production from [[The Beatnuts]], [[Diamond D]], [[Lord Finesse]], and others. Its lead single, "[[Flow Joe]]" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart; other minor singles from the album included "Watch the Sound" and "This Shit Is Real".<ref name="all music"/>

In 1995, Fat Joe released his second studio album, ''[[Jealous One's Envy]]'', which peaked at #71 on The Billboard 200 and at #7 on Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums. The album featured a guest appearance from [[KRS-One]] and production from Diamond D. The lead single was "Success", which did not chart, but his second single, "Envy" peaked at #8 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. One day while writing for the album at [[Chung King Studios]], Fat Joe happened to find that his rap idol, [[LL Cool J]] was in another room with [[Trackmasters]], working on the remix version of LL's single "[[I Shot Ya]]". After being welcomed to contribute a verse, Joe appeared on the record and in its accompanying video along with [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]]. The track is considered by Joe to be one of his career highlights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/interview-fat-joe-25-best-songs/ll-cool-j-f-fat-joe-keith-murray-prodigy-foxy-brown-i-shot-ya-remix-1996|website=www.complex.com|title=Fat Joe Breaks Down His 25 Most Essential Songs|author=Daniel Isenberg|date=December 7, 2011|quote=That sh-- was the craziest collabo.

<ref name="all music"/> During the recording of ''Jealous One's Envy'', Joe discovered fellow [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] rapper [[Big Pun]], who was featured on the song "Watch Out". Joe later explained the rapper's influence on him: "Latinos before us who had the opportunity to do it just didn't know how to do it. They came in trying to do this black music, waving flags. [But] we're trying to kick in the doors for other Latinos and represent our people, and it shows."<ref name="ChicagoTribune">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-28/news/0305290041_1_fat-joe-joe-cartagena-latino-rapper|title=The skinny on Fat Joe|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tony W.

===1998–2005: Signing with Atlantic Records, Terror Squad, feud with 50 Cent===
Released in 1998, ''[[Don Cartagena]]'' was Joe's third album and his first for Atlantic Records. It peaked on the Billboard 200 at #7 and #2 on Top R&B/Hip Hop albums, eventually being certified gold by the RIAA.<ref name="riaa cert">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Fat%20Joe&format=ALBUM&debutLP=&category=SOLO&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=on&before=on&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1993&endYear=2007&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=25|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - March 09, 2015|work=riaa.com|access-date=March 9, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151842/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Fat%20Joe&format=ALBUM&debutLP=&category=SOLO&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=on&before=on&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1993&endYear=2007&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=25|archive-date=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The album featured two hit singles, "Bet Ya Man Can't Triz" and "Don Cartagena". Guest appearances included [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], Big Pun, [[Raekwon]], [[Jadakiss]], and [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]]. On the album, Fat Joe debuted his own group Terror Squad consisting of the late Big Pun, as well as Cuban Link, Triple Seis, Prospect, Armageddon, and later Remy Ma.<ref name="amg terror squad">Birchmeier, Jason. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p366641|pure_url=yes}} Terror Squad biography] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> Joe himself acknowledged, in an interview with HipHopGame.com, that he has received criticism for releasing only one solo album by a former Terror Squad member, Remy Ma, as well as barely featuring original members Prospect and Armageddon on "True Story." Terror Squad singer Tony Sunshine has had possible album release dates pushed back over three years, and Joe had stated that artists Prospect and Armageddon have not released solo albums yet as the result of them being "really lazy".<ref name="joecrack">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=fatjoe2|title=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Audio, Lyrics, Videos, Honeys, Wear, Sneakers, Download Mixtapes|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}</ref> Former Terror Squad member Triple Seis also went on record when asked who had written Fat Joe's lyrics, stating that he and Pun were Joe's ghostwriters, and asserts that Joe continues to hire ghostwriters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/interview/87104.php|title=Triple Seis – Third Times a Charm - Interview|last=Fleury|first=Serge|date=November 1, 2009|website=NobodySmiling.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107004505/http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/interview/87104.php|archive-date=January 7, 2007 |access-date=2016-05-25}}</ref> In 1999, he appeared on [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s single "[[Feelin' So Good]]" from her ''[[On the 6]]'' album with late rapper Big Pun.

Fat Joe released his fourth album ''[[Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.)]]'' in 2001, featuring production from [[Irv Gotti]]. The album featured a star-studded lineup from the likes of Ashanti, [[Ja Rule]], N.O.R.E., [[Busta Rhymes]], Petey Pablo, M.O.P., [[Ludacris]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Buju Banton]], and artists from his Terror Squad label. The lead single "[[We Thuggin']]" featuring R. Kelly was a big hit in late 2001, but would not reach the level of the Irv Gotti-produced "[[What's Luv?]]" which was a massive hit in early 2002 and featured The Inc. superstars [[Ja Rule]] and [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]]. The album was Fat Joe's biggest hit as it was successful from its January release all the way into May, being certified platinum.<ref name="riaa cert"/> However, Fat Joe's fifth album ''[[Loyalty (Fat Joe album)|Loyalty]]'', released later in 2002 and featuring production from Irv Gotti, was not as successful.

In 2003, Fat Joe was featured in the pop single "[[I Want You/Me Pones Sexy|I Want You]]" by Mexican singer [[Thalía]]. The same year, he and Tony Sunshine performed the single "Crush Tonight" from ''Loyalty'' on the Comedy Central program ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', hosted by comedian Dave Chappelle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/chappelles_show/episode_guide/season_1/episode_105.jhtml|title=Chappelle's Show|work=Comedy Central|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

Despite the setback, Fat Joe scored a number-one hit in 2004 with his group Terror Squad, collaborating with Remy Ma on the Scott Storch production "[[Lean Back]]" from the album ''[[True Story (Terror Squad album)|True Story]]''.<ref name="amg terror squad"/> Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] called the song "a perfect club-ready duet between Joe and Remy Ma that boasts a trademark [[Scott Storch]] beat and a memorable singalong hook and dance-along step".<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title="True Story" - Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r703323|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2004|accessdate=November 10, 2007}}</ref> He then began recording material for [[Ivy Queen]]'s debut English-language album ''[[Real (Ivy Queen album)|Real]]'' in support of her goal to compete in the world of English-language hip hop music.<ref name="Caracol">{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/ivy-queen-se-lanza-a-conquistar-el-mercado----ingles/20031111/nota/154264.aspx |title=Ivy Queen se lanza a conquistar el mercado inglés |language=es |work=Caracol Radio |publisher=Caracol S.A |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=December 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152851/http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/ivy-queen-se-lanza-a-conquistar-el-mercado----ingles/20031111/nota/154264.aspx |archive-date=November 5, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/fats-chance/15383/|title=Fat's Chance|work=[[The New York Sun]]|publisher=The New York Sun|author=Edlund, Martin|date=June 14, 2005|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n11/Reggaeton.html |title=It's Reggae, It's Rap, And It's Muy Caliente; This Puerto Rican Sound Is Called Reggaeton, And It's Catching Fire In The U.S. |work=San Antonio Mercury News |publisher=San Antonio Mercury News |author=Pacio, Nerissa |date=April 8, 2005 |access-date=April 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210315/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n11/Reggaeton.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref>

A year later, in 2005, Fat Joe released his sixth album ''[[All or Nothing (Fat Joe album)|All or Nothing]]'', noted for featuring the popular diss track "My Fofo", aimed at fellow New York rapper [[50 Cent]], who had dissed Joe for [[New York (Ja Rule song)|recording with Ja Rule]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kellman|first= Andy|title="All or Nothing" - Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r737946|pure_url=yes}} |publisher= Allmusic|year=2005|accessdate=November 10, 2007}}</ref> ''All or Nothing'' spawned the singles "So Much More" and "[[Get It Poppin' (Fat Joe song)|Get It Poppin]]" featuring [[Nelly]], also with guest appearances from [[Eminem]], Mase, Remy Ma, Mashonda, and R.

Responding to "My Fofo", 50 Cent attacked Fat Joe in his song "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]" from his best-selling 2005 album ''[[The Massacre]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first= David|title="The Massacre" - Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r730909|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic|year=2005|accessdate=November 10, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reid|first= Shaheem|title=50 Cent Album Pushed Up|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497344/20050222/50_cent.jhtml|publisher= MTV News|date=February 22, 2005|accessdate=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225055323/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497344/20050222/50_cent.jhtml|archive-date=February 25, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Jadakiss, Fat Joe Slicing Their 50 Cent Beef Different Ways|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497736/20050303/fat_joe.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=March 3, 2005|accessdate=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305060344/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497736/20050303/fat_joe.jhtml|archive-date=March 5, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fat Joe subsequently attacked 50's street credibility and called him a "coward" on a phone interview with Kay Slay of New York City hip-hop radio station WQHT.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reid|first= Shaheem|title=Fat Joe Calls 50 Cent 'A King'|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497500/20050225/fat_joe.jhtml |work=MTV News|date=February 25, 2005|accessdate=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305230543/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497500/20050225/fat_joe.jhtml|archive-date=March 5, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> The conflict carried on at the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]], while Fat Joe introduced the reggaeton act featuring Daddy Yankee, Joe remarked, "I feel safe with all the police protection—courtesy of [[G-Unit]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Derrick|title=Notorious C.O.P.: The Inside Story of the Tupac, Biggie, and Jam Master Jay From the NYPD's First "Hip-Hop Cop"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIpWyv-IQMkC&q=%22i+feel+safe+with+all+the+police+protection%22+%22fat+joe%22&pg=PA293|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|page=293|isbn=0-312-35251-4}}</ref> Shortly after, when MTV switched to a commercial break, 50 Cent directed an obscenity at Joe, and 50 Cent jumped on stage as Fat Joe was leaving.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Fat Joe Thought VMA Dis Might Lead To Fight With 50 Cent|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1508728/20050831/fat_joe.jhtml|work=MTV he News|date=August 31, 2005|access-date=November 10, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011181036/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1508728/20050831/fat_joe.jhtml|archive-date=October 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''[[Me, Myself & I (album)|Me, Myself & I]]'', released in 2006, is Fat Joe's seventh album. It was his first album released on his new deal with [[Virgin Records]]. It featured the hit single "[[Make It Rain (Fat Joe song)|Make It Rain]]" with southern rapper [[Lil Wayne]], followed by "No Drama (Clap and Revolve)". Fat Joe did a freestyle cipher segment for [[VH1]]'s "Freestyle 59" competition in October 2006 prior to the VH1 Hip Hop Honors featuring New Jersey emcee Neuse.<ref>{{cite press release|title="VH1 Hip Hop Honors" Red Carpet Pre-Show to Air Exclusively on VH1's Broadband Channel with Hosts Salt, Pepa, and Spinderella|url=http://www.vh1.com/press/press_releases/2006_release/hhh_100306.jhtml|publisher=VH1|date=October 3, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211095939/http://www.vh1.com/press/press_releases/2006_release/hhh_100306.jhtml|archive-date=February 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In June 2007, Catholic priest [[Michael Pfleger]] targeted Fat Joe as among several rappers he believed promoted misogyny in his billboard campaign "Stop Listening to Trash", which was launched June 18, 2007, throughout [[Chicago]], where Pfleger preaches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petipas|first=Jolene|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202123430/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/11901|archive-date=February 2, 2008|title="Stop Listening To Trash", Church Calls Out Rappers In New Campaign|url=http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/11901|work=SOHH.com|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> Also that month, Fat Joe was featured in the DJ Khaled singles "[[We Takin' Over]]" alongside [[Akon]], [[T.I.]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], and [[Lil Wayne]] and the remix to Khaled's "[[I'm So Hood]]" with Lil Wayne, [[Young Jeezy]], Rick Ross, [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Big Boi]], [[Ludacris]], and [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]].
