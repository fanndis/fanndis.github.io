[[File:Cecilia Bowes-Lyon - Philip de László.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1931]]
On 16 July 1881, she married [[Claude George Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Claude Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis]], at [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Surrey,<ref>''Civil Registration Indexes: Marriages'' General Register Office, England and Wales Jul–Sep 1881 Richmond, Surrey vol. 2a, p. 549; White, G. H. (1953) ''The Complete Peerage'': Volume XII Part I, p. 402. (St. Catherine Press, London)</ref> and they had ten children. Claude inherited his father's title of [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] in 1904, whereupon Cecilia became Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne.

The Strathmore estates included two grand houses and their surroundings: [[Glamis Castle]] and [[St Paul's Walden Bury]]. Cecilia was a gregarious and accomplished hostess who played the piano exceptionally well.<ref>Forbes, p. 29</ref> Her houses were run with meticulous care and a practical approach,<ref>Forbes, pp. 9, 28</ref> and she was responsible for designing the Italian Garden at Glamis.<ref>Forbes, p. 28</ref> She was deeply religious, a keen gardener and embroiderer, and preferred a quiet family life.<ref name="times" />

During [[World War I]], Glamis Castle served as a convalescent hospital for the wounded, in which she took an active part until she developed [[cancer]] and was forced into invalidity.<ref>Vickers, p. 46</ref> In October 1921 she underwent a [[hysterectomy]],<ref>Vickers, p. 48</ref> and by May 1922 was in recovery. In January 1923 she celebrated the engagement of her youngest daughter, Elizabeth, to the King's son, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], later George VI.<ref name="times">''The Times (London)'' Thursday, 23 June 1938; p. 16; col. D</ref> When asked by pressmen for a photograph during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], she reportedly said, "I shouldn't waste a photograph on me."<ref name="times" /> At the [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation of their son-in-law and daughter]], the Earl and the Countess were seated in the royal box, along with the immediate royal family.

==Death==
She suffered a heart attack in April 1938 during the wedding of her granddaughter, [[Princess Anne of Denmark|Anne Bowes-Lyon]], to Thomas, Viscount Anson.<ref>Vickers, p. 176</ref> She died 8 weeks later, aged 75, at 38 Cumberland Mansions, Bryanston Street, in London. Lady Strathmore outlived four of her ten children. She was buried on 27 June 1938 at [[Glamis Castle]].
