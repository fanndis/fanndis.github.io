{{other uses}}

A '''grand jury''' is a [[jury]]—a group of [[citizen]]s—empowered by law to conduct [[legal proceedings]] and investigate potential [[crime|criminal conduct]], and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may [[subpoena]] physical evidence or a person to testify. A grand jury is separate from the [[court]]s, which do not preside over its functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/36|title=UNITED STATES, Petitioner v. John H. WILLIAMS, Jr.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

The [[United States]] and [[Liberia]] are the only countries that retain grand juries,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nestmann|first1=Mark|title=The Lifeboat Strategy|year= 2011|publisher=The Nestmann Group|isbn=9781891266409|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5VSQl5L78C&pg=PT110|access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zapf|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Roesch|first2=Ronald|last3=Hart|first3=Stephen D.|title=Forensic Psychology and Law|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-57039-5|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hOslS-NSCVEC&pg=PA182|access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> though other [[common law]] jurisdictions formerly employed them, and most others now employ a differing procedure that does not involve a jury: a [[preliminary hearing]]. Grand juries perform both accusatory and investigatory functions. The investigatory functions of grand juries include obtaining and reviewing documents and other evidence, and hearing sworn testimonies of witnesses who appear before it; the accusatory function determines whether there is [[probable cause]] to believe that one or more persons committed a particular offense within the venue of a district court.

A grand jury in the United States is usually composed of 16 to 23 citizens, though in Virginia it has fewer members for regular or special grand juries. In [[Ireland]], they also functioned as local government authorities. In Japan, the Law of July 12, 1948, created the ''Kensatsu Shinsakai'' (Prosecutorial Review Commission or PRC system), inspired by the American system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1699&context=cilj|title=e Rebirth of Japan's Petit Quasi-Jury and Grand Jury Systems: A Cross-National Analysis of Legal Consciousness and the Lay Participatory Experience in Japan and the U.S.|last=Fukurai|first=Hiroshi|date=August 4, 2017}}</ref>

The grand jury is so named because traditionally it has more jurors than a trial [[jury]], sometimes called a [[petit jury]] (from the French word ''petit'' meaning "small").<ref name="LawDict">A Law Dictionary by Henry Campbell Black 2nd ed, publ. by West, St Paul, Minnesota,1910.

==Purpose==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}
The function of a grand jury is to accuse persons who may be guilty of a crime, but the institution is also a shield against unfounded and oppressive prosecution. It is a means for lay citizens, representative of the community, to participate in the administration of justice. It can also make presentments on crime and maladministration in its area. Traditionally, a grand jury numbers 23 members.

The mode of accusation is by a written statement of two types: 1) in solemn form ([[indictment]]) describing the offense with proper accompaniments of time and circumstances, and certainty of act and person, or 2) by a mode less formal, which is usually the spontaneous act of the grand jury, called presentment.<ref name=Blackstone1>Commentaries on the Laws of England, by William Blackstone, Book 4,  Ch.23   (p. 586 in 1840 ed. of John Bethune Bayly)</ref> No indictment or presentment can be made except by concurrence of at least twelve of the jurors. The grand jury may accuse upon their own knowledge, but it is generally done upon the testimony of witnesses under oath and other evidence heard before them. The proceedings of grand jury are, in the first instance, at the instigation of the government or other prosecutors, and [[ex parte]] and in secret deliberation. The accused has no knowledge nor right to interfere with their proceedings.<ref name=britcyclop>British Cyclopedia of Literature, History, Geography, Law, and Politics, publ. by Orr and Smith, London, 1836,  Vol 2, p.591</ref>

If they find the accusation true, which is usually drawn up in form by the prosecutor or an officer of the court, they write upon the indictment the words "a true bill" which is signed by the foreperson of the grand jury and presented to the court publicly in the presence of all the jurors. If the indictment is not proven to the satisfaction of the grand jury, the word "[[Wiktionary:ignoramus|ignoramus]]"<ref>In [[Latin language|Latin]], "ignoramus" literally means “we are ignorant of” or “we do not know” – in the context of a Grand Jury it effectively means “we do not know of any reason why this person should be indicted on these charges”. This use of "ignoramus" long predates its more common English meaning of an ignorant person or dunce.</ref> or "not a true bill" is written upon it by the grand jury, or by their foreman and then said to be ignored, and the accusation is dismissed as unfounded.  (The potential defendant is said to have been "no-billed" by the grand jury.)  If the grand jury returns an indictment as a true bill ("billa vera"), the indictment is said to be founded and the party to stand indicted and required to be put on trial.<ref name=harris1>The Criminal Law. by Seymour F. Harris, 7th ed., Publ. Stevens & Haynes, London, 1896. Book 3, Ch 7 Grand Jury (4th para)</ref>

==Origins==

The first instance of a grand jury can be traced back to the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166, an Act of [[Henry II of England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/aclarendon.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref> Henry's chief impact on the development of the English monarchy was to increase the jurisdiction of the royal courts at the expense of the feudal courts. Itinerant justices on regular circuits were sent out once each year to enforce the "King's Peace". To make this system of royal criminal justice more effective, Henry employed the method of [[inquest]] used by [[William the Conqueror]] in the [[Domesday Book]]. In each shire, a body of important men were sworn (''juré'') to report to the [[sheriff]] all crimes committed since the last session of the circuit court. Thus originated the more recent grand jury that presents information for an indictment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-world.org/midbritain.htm|title=Middle Ages, Making Of Modern Britain|website=www.history-world.org}}</ref> The grand jury was later recognized by [[John of England|King John]] in [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 on demand of the nobility.<ref>[http://www.dcdave.com/article5/070119.htm Turley, Hugh: "The Grand Jury"], Hyattsville Life & Times, 2007</ref>

The Grand Jury can be said to have "celebrated" its 800th birthday in 2015, because a precursor to the Grand Jury is defined in Article 61, the longest of the 63 articles of [[Magna Carta]], also called ''Magna Carta Libertatum'' (Latin: "the Great Charter of Liberties") executed on 15 June 1215 by King John and by the Barons. The document was primarily composed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Stephen Langton]] (1150–1228). He and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed schemas for the division of the Bible into chapters and it is the system of Archbishop Langton which prevailed.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.</ref><ref name=Moore>Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], 1893, at [[JSTOR]].</ref><ref>[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347. Cited in [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2013/06/21/stephen-langton-and-the-modern-chapter-divisions-of-the-bible/ Stephen Langton and the modern chapter divisions of the Bible] by British translator Roger Pearse, 21 June 2013.</ref> He was a Bible scholar, and the concept of the Grand Jury may possibly derive from Deuteronomy 25:1: "If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked." ([[King James Version]]) Thus the Grand Jury has been described as the "Shield and the Sword" of the People: as a "Shield for the People" from abusive indictments of the government- or malicious indictments of individuals- and as the "Sword of the People" to cut away crime by any private individual; or to cut away crime by any public servant, whether in the Judicial, Executive, or Legislative branches.

==Notable cases==
On 2 July 1681, a popular statesman, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] was arrested on suspicion of [[high treason]] and committed to the [[Tower of London]]. He immediately petitioned the [[Old Bailey]] on a writ of [[habeas corpus]], but the Old Bailey said it did not have jurisdiction over prisoners in the Tower of London, so Cooper had to wait for the next session of the [[Court of King's Bench]]. Cooper moved for a writ of habeas corpus on 24 October 1681, and his case finally came before a grand jury on 24 November 1681.

The government's case against Cooper was particularly weak – the government admitted that most of the witnesses brought against Cooper had already perjured themselves, and the documentary evidence was inconclusive, and the jury was handpicked by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] Sheriff of London. For these reasons the government had little chance of securing a conviction, and on 13 February 1682, the case was dropped when the grand jury issued an ''ignoramus'' bill, rather than comply with the king's intent of a "true bill", known as a grand jury indictment.

The grand jury's theoretical function against abuse of [[executive (government)|executive]] power was seen during the [[Watergate]] crisis in America, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled eight-to-zero on 23 July 1974 (Justice [[William Rehnquist]] who had been appointed by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] recused himself from the case) that [[executive privilege]] applied only to the co-equal branches, the legislative and judicial, not to grand jury subpoenas, thus implying a grand jury constituted protections equaled to a "fourth branch of government". The second Watergate grand jury indicted seven lawyers in the White House, including former Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and named President Nixon as a "secret, un-indicted, co-conspirator". Despite evading [[impeachment]], Nixon was still required to testify before a grand jury.

Similarly, in 1998, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] became the first sitting president required to testify before a grand jury as the subject of an investigation by the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Office of Independent Counsel]]. The testimony came after a four-year investigation into Clinton and his wife Hillary's alleged involvement in several scandals including [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] and the [[Rose Law Firm]].  Revelations from the investigation sparked a battle in Congress over whether or not to impeach Clinton.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-testifies-before-grand-jury "This Day in History, 1998:  Clinton Testifies before Grand Jury"] (August 21, 2018).

==By jurisdiction==

===England and Wales ===
The sheriff of every county was required to return to every [[quarter session]]s and [[assizes]] (or more precisely the commission of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' and of gaol delivery), 24 men of the county "to inquire into, present, do and execute all those things which, on the part of our Lord the King (''or'' our Lady the Queen), shall then be commanded them". Grand jurors at the assizes or at the borough quarter sessions did not have property qualifications; but, at the county quarter sessions, they had the same property qualification as petty jurors. However, at the assizes, the grand jury generally consisted of gentlemen of high standing in the county.

After the court was opened by the crier making proclamation, the names of those summoned to the grand jury were called and they were sworn. They numbered at least 14 and not more than 23. The person presiding (the judge at the assizes, the chairman at the county sessions, the recorder at the borough sessions) gave the charge to the grand jury, i.e. he directed their attention to points in the various cases about to be considered which required explanation.

The charge having been delivered, the grand jury withdrew to their own room, having received the bills of indictment. The witnesses whose names were endorsed on each bill were sworn as they came to be examined, in the grand jury room, the oath being administered by the foreman, who wrote his initials against the name of the witness on the back of the bill. Only the witnesses for the prosecution were examined, as the function of the grand jury was merely to inquire whether there was sufficient ground to put the accused on trial. If the majority of them (and at least 12) thought that the evidence so adduced made out a sufficient case, the words "a true bill" were endorsed on the back of the bill. If they were of the opposite opinion, the phrase "not a true bill", or the single Latin word [[Wiktionary:ignoramus|''ignoramus'']] ("we do not know" or "we are ignorant (of)"), was endorsed instead and the bill was said to be "ignored" or thrown out. They could find a true bill as to the charge in one count, and ignore that in another; or as to one defendant and not as to another; but they could not, like a petty jury, return a special or conditional finding, or select part of a count as true and reject the other part. When some bills were "found", some of the jurors came out and handed the bills to the clerk of arraigns (in assizes) or [[clerk of the peace]], who announced to the court the name of the prisoner, the charge, and the endorsements of the grand jury. They then retired and considered other bills until all were disposed of; after which they were discharged by the judge, chairman, or recorder.

If a bill was thrown out, although it could not again be referred to the grand jury during the same assizes or sessions, it could be preferred at subsequent assizes or sessions, but not in respect of the same offense if a petty jury had returned a verdict.

Ordinarily, bills of indictment were preferred after there had been an examination before the [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]. But this need not always take place. With certain exceptions, any person would prefer a bill of indictment against another before the grand jury without any previous inquiry into the truth of the accusation before a magistrate. This right was at one time universal and was often abused. A substantial check was put on this abuse by the [[Vexatious Indictments Act 1859]].<ref>22 & 23 Vict. c. 17, s. l.</ref> This Act provided that for certain offences which it listed (perjury, libel, etc.), the person presenting such an indictment must be bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence against the accused, or alternatively had judicial permission (as specified) so to do.

If an indictment was found in the absence of the accused, and he/she was not in custody and had not been bound over to appear at assizes or sessions, then process was issued to bring that person into court, as it is contrary to the English law to "try" an indictment in the absence of the accused.

The grand jury's functions were gradually made redundant by the development of [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] in magistrates' courts from 1848 onward when the (three) [[John Jervis (politician)|Jervis]] Acts,<ref>See Indictable Offences Act 1848 (11 and 12 Vict c. 42); title: An Act to facilitate the Performance of the Duties of Justices of the Peace out of Sessions within England and Wales with respect to Persons charged with indictable Offences</ref> such as the [[Justices Protection Act 1848]], codified and greatly expanded the functions of magistrates in pre-trial proceedings; these proceedings developed into almost a repeat of the trial itself. In 1933 the grand jury ceased to function in England, under the [[Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/36/contents/data.htm|title=Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933|first=Expert|last=Participation|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> and was entirely abolished in 1948, when a clause from 1933 saving grand juries for offences relating to officials abroad was repealed by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

===Scotland===

The grand jury was introduced in [[Scotland]], solely for [[high treason]], a year after the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]], by the [[Treason Act 1708]], an [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Parliament]] of [[Great Britain]]. Section III of the Act required the Scottish courts to try cases of treason and [[misprision of treason]] according to English rules of procedure and evidence.<ref>Treason Act, 1708 (7 Ann c 21)</ref> This rule was repealed in 1945.<ref>Treason Act 1945 (c. 44), section 2(2) and Schedule.</ref>

The first Scottish grand jury under this Act met at Edinburgh on 10 October 1748 to take cognisance of the charges against such rebels as had not surrendered, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].

An account of its first use in Scotland illustrates the institution's characteristics. It consisted of 23 good and lawful men, chosen out of 48 who were summoned: 24 from the county of [[Edinburgh]] ([[Midlothian]]), 12 from [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] ([[East Lothian]]) and 12 from [[Linlithgow]] ([[West Lothian]]). The court consisted of three judges from the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (Scotland's highest criminal court), of whom [[Charles Erskine, Lord Tinwald|Tinwald]] ([[Lord Justice Clerk|Justice Clerk]]) was elected  ''preses'' (presiding member). [[Subpoena]]s under the seal of the court and signed by the clerk were executed on a great number of persons in different shires, requiring them to appear as witnesses under the penalty of £100 each. The ''preses'' named Sir John Inglis of [[Cramond]] as Foreman of the Grand Jury, who was sworn first in the English manner by kissing the book; the others followed three at a time; after which Lord Tinwald, addressing the jurors, informed them that the power [[Lord Advocate|His Majesty's advocate]] possessed before the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]], of prosecuting any person for high treason, who appeared guilty on a precognition taken of the facts, being now done away, power was lodged with them, a grand jury, 12 of whom behoved to concur before a true bill could be found. An indictment was then preferred in court and the witnesses endorsed on it were called over and sworn; on which the jury retired to the exchequer chambers and the witnesses were conducted to a room near it, whence they were called to be examined separately. Two solicitors for the crown were present at the examination but no one else; and after they had finished and the sense of the jury was collected, the indictment was returned a "true bill", if the charges were found proved, or "[[wikt:ignoramus|ignoramus]]" if doubtful. The proceedings continued for a week, in which time, out of 55 bills, 42 were sustained and 13 dismissed.<ref>The  "History of Scotland, With Notes, and a Continuation to the Present Time", by George Buchanan (up to 16th Century) and James Aikman, Edinburgh 1829. See Vol. 6, p.486</ref>

Further Acts of Parliament in the 19th century regarding treason did not specify this special procedure and the Grand Jury was used no longer.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], grand juries were active from the [[Middle Ages]] during the [[Lordship of Ireland]] in parts of the island under the control of the English government ([[The Pale]]), that was followed by the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. They mainly functioned as local government authorities at the [[Counties of Ireland|county]] level. The system was so-called as the grand jurors had to present their [[public works]] proposals and budgets in court for official sanction by a [[judge]]. Grand jurors were usually the largest local payers of [[Rates (tax)|rates]], and therefore tended to be the larger [[landlord]]s, and on retiring they selected new members from the same background.

Distinct from their public works function, as property owners they also were qualified to sit on criminal juries hearing [[Jury trial|trials by jury]], as well as having a pre-trial judicial function for serious criminal cases. Many of them also sat as [[Justice of the peace|magistrates]] judging the less serious cases.

They were usually wealthy "country gentlemen" (i.e. landowners, [[landed gentry]], farmers and merchants):
{{quote|A country gentleman as a member of a Grand Jury...levied the local taxes, appointed the nephews of his old friends to collect them, and spent them when they were gathered in. He controlled the boards of guardians and appointed the dispensary doctors, regulated the diet of paupers, inflicted fines and administered the law at petty sessions.<ref>{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=R.

From 1691 to 1793, [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] and [[Roman Catholic]]s were excluded from membership. The concentration of power and wealth in a few families caused resentment over time. The whole local government system started to become more representative from the passing of the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]]. The growing divergence of opinions can be seen in the House of Commons debate on 8 March 1861 led by [[Isaac Butt]].<ref>https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1861/mar/08/select-committee-moved-for HC Deb 08 March 1861 vol 161 cc1676-83</ref> Grand juries were eventually replaced by democratically elected [[County council#Ireland (1899 - 1922)|County Councils]] by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], as regards their administrative functions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=J.

After the formation of [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, grand juries were not required, but they persisted in [[Northern Ireland]] until abolished by the Grand Jury (Abolition) Act of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1969.<ref>Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliament, 1969 c.15</ref>

===United States===
{{main|Grand juries in the United States}}
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]] reads, "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury{{nbsp}}..."

[[File:Grand jury at Arcadia Hotel fire (LOC).jpg|thumb|A grand jury investigating the fire that destroyed the Arcadia Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts in 1913]]
In the early decades of the United States, grand juries played a major role in public matters. During that period counties followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least 12 of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a 23-person grand jury, 12 people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations.

In that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found that there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise essentially the same authority as a state attorney general has, that is, a [[private attorney general|general power of attorney]] to represent the state in the case.

The grand jury served to screen out incompetent or malicious prosecutions.<ref name=gje>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=George John|title=The Grand Jury: Considered from an Historical, Political and Legal Standpoint, and the Law and Practice Relating Thereto|year=1906|publisher=G.T.

An American federal grand jury has from 16 to 23 jurors, with twelve votes required to return an indictment. All grand jury proceedings are conducted behind closed doors, without a presiding judge.

===Canada===
Grand juries were once common across Canada.  The institution of British civil government in 1749 at [[Nova Scotia]] brought the judicature system peculiar to that form, and the grand jury was inherent to it.  A similar form derived in Quebec from the promise of the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] that a faithful copy of '''Laws of England''' would be instituted in the North American possessions of the Crown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/rp_1763.html|title=The Royal Proclamation, 1763|website=www.solon.org}}</ref> Archival records are found that document the presentments of a grand jury in Quebec as early as 16 October 1764.

In point of fact, the second law passed in Upper Canada relates to (petit) jury trial.  This was continued so that Chapter 31 of the 1859 Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada specifies the constitution of Grand and Petit Juries in the province (now known as Ontario).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924016981684|title=The consolidated statutes for Upper Canada|last=Upper Canada|date=31 December 2018|publisher=Toronto : Printed by S.

===Australia===
The grand jury existed in [[New South Wales]] for a short period in the 1820s.<ref>{{Cite book |title= The Establishment of Jury Trial in New South Wales |first= J.M. |last= Bennett |publisher= Faculty of Law, University of Sydney |year= 1961}}</ref>  The [[New South Wales Act 1823]] (UK) enabled the establishment of [[quarter session]]s, as a subsidiary court structure below that of the Supreme Court. [[Francis Forbes]], [[Chief Justice]], reasoned that this entailed the creation of quarter sessions as they existed in England. Thus, inadvertently, [[trial by jury]] and indictment by grand jury were introduced, but only for these subsidiary courts. Grand juries met in [[Sydney]], [[Parramatta]], [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and other places. This democratic method of trial proved very popular, but was resented by conservatives. Eventually, conservative elements in the colony were successful in having these innovations suppressed by the Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK). [[George Forbes (New South Wales politician)|George Forbes]], a member of the Legislative Council, unsuccessfully moved for the reintroduction of grand juries in 1858, but this was thwarted by the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice.<ref>''A History of Criminal Law in New South Wales: The Colonial Period, 1788–1900'', by G.D. Woods QC, Federation Press 2002, p.56-59.</ref>

In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], grand juries existed for longer periods of time.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Grand Jury of South Australia |first= Greg |last= Taylor |journal= American Journal of Legal History |volume= 45 |issue= 4 |date= October 2001 |pages= 468–516 |doi=10.2307/3185314|jstor= 3185314 |hdl= 2440/109282 |hdl-access= free }}</ref> In South Australia, the first grand jury sat on 13 May 1837, but they were abolished in 1852. In Western Australia, by the Grand Jury Abolition Act Amendment Act 1883 (WA), grand juries were abolished (section 4: A Grand Jury shall not be summoned for the Supreme Court of Western Australia, nor for any General Quarter Sessions for the said Colony).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_10315_homepage.html|title=Grand Jury Abolition Act Amendment Act 1883|access-date=9 May 2013}}</ref>

The Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] maintained, until 2009, provisions for a grand jury in the [[Crimes Act 1958]] under section 354 indictments, which had been used on rare occasions by individuals to bring other persons to court seeking them to be committed for trial on indictable offences. Grand juries were introduced by the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873|Judicature Act 1874]] and have been used on a very limited number of occasions. Their function in Victoria particularly relates to alleged offences either by bodies corporate or where magistrates have aborted the prosecution.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Legal History |date= September 1987 |title=The introduction and use of the grand jury in Victoria |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |first= Elise |last= Histed |doi=10.1080/01440368708530896 |pages=167–177}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] abolished the grand jury in 1961.<ref name="sd"/>

===Cape Colony===

[[Trial by jury]] was introduced in the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] by [[Richard Bourke]], Lieutenant Governor and acting Governor of the colony between 1826 and 1828. The acting Governor, who was later influential in the establishment of jury trial in [[New South Wales]], obtained the consent of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in August 1827 and the first Charter of Justice was issued on 24 August 1827.<ref>Crown Commission of Inquiry into the Administration of Justice in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope (Records of the Cape Colony xxviii (1905) I-III, George McCall Theale)</ref>

Jury trial was brought into practical operation in 1828 and the 1831 Ordinance 84 laid down that criminal cases would be heard by a panel of nine, selected from males aged between 21 and 60, owning or renting property to a value of £1.17s (37 shillings) per annum or having liability for taxes of 30 shillings in Cape Town and 20 shillings outside the town. Black (i.e. non-white) jurors were not entirely excluded and sat occasionally.<ref>E. Kahn: South African Law Journal(1991), pp.672–87; SALJ(1992), pp.87–111, 307–318, 666–679; SALJ(1993), pp.322–337</ref> This is not to imply, however, that juries did not operate in an oppressive manner towards the Black African and Asian residents of the Cape, whose participation in the jury lists was, in any event, severely limited by the property qualification.<ref name="ReferenceA">Richard Vogler (2001). "The international development of the jury: the role of the British empire". ''Revue internationale de droit pénal'', vol 72.</ref> The property qualification was amended in 1831 and 1861 and, experimentally, a grand jury came into operation.

The grand jury was established for Cape Town alone.<ref>''Cape Law Journal'', 10 Cape L.J. page 216 (1893)</ref> It met quarterly. In 1842 it was recorded<ref>''Wilkes Narrative of the U.S. Exploring Expedition''. Page 302</ref> that it served a district of 50,000 inhabitants and in one quarterly session there were six presentments (1 homicide, 2 assaults, 1 robbery, 1 theft, 1 fraud).

As elsewhere, the judge could use his charge to the grand jury to bring matters of concern to him to the attention of the public and the government.<ref>George Edwards (1906). ''Grand Jury'', Part IV. p.124. Philadelphia.</ref> In May 1879 Mr. Justice Fitzpatrick, returning from circuit in the northern and western parts of Cape Colony, gave a charge to the grand jury at the Criminal Sessions at Cape Town, in which, after congratulating them upon the lightness of the calendar, he observed there were indications in the country of a growing mutual bad feeling between the races, etc. This was reported in the ''Cape Argus'' and was a subject of a question to the government in the House of Commons in London.<ref>HC Deb 19 June 1879 vol 247 cc. 169–171</ref>

The grand jury continued in operation until 1885, by which time the Cape was under [[responsible government]], when it was abolished by Act 17 of 1885<ref>Statutes of the Cape of Good Hope, 1652–1895: Vol 1872–1886. Cape Town: J.C. Juta, 1895</ref> of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]].

===France===
Grand juries were established in [[France]] in 1791 under the name ''jury d'accusation'', but they were abolished with the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code#Code of criminal instruction|Code of Criminal Instruction]] in 1808.<ref>History of Trial by Jury, by William Forsyth, pub J.W. Parker, London 1852. Page 348.</ref>

The jury law of 1791 created an eight-man ''jury d'accusation'' in each ''[[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]'' (a subdivision of the ''departement'') and a 12-man ''jury de jugement'' in each ''[[Departments of France|departement]]''. In each ''arrondissement'' the ''procureur-syndic'' drew up a list of 30 jurors from the electoral roll every three months for the ''jury d'accusation''. There was no public prosecutor or ''[[juge d'instruction]]''. Instead the police or private citizens could bring a complaint to the [[Justice of the Peace]] established in each [[Cantons of France|canton]] (a subdivision of the arrondissement). This magistrate interrogated the accused to determine whether grounds for prosecution existed and if so sent the case to the ''directeur du jury'' (the director of the ''jury d'accusation''), who was one of the ''arrondissement's'' civil court judges, and who served in the post for six months on a rotating basis. He decided whether to dismiss the charges or, if not, whether the case was a ''[[delict|délit]]'' ([[misdemeanour]]) or a crime ([[felony]], i.e. imprisonable for 2 years or more). ''Délits'' went to the ''tribunal de police correctionnelle'' of the ''arrondissement'', while for ''crimes'' the ''directeur de jury'' convoked the ''jury d'accusation'' of the ''arrondissement'', in order to get an [[indictment]]. The ''directeur du jury'' drew up the [[bill of indictment]] (''acte d'accusation'') summarising the charges to be presented to the ''jury d'accusation''. The ''directeur'' made a presentation to the jury in the absence of the accused and the jury heard the witnesses. The jury then decided by majority vote whether there were sufficient grounds for the case to go to the ''tribunal criminel'' of the ''departement''. Between 1792–5 there was no property qualification for jurors.<ref>{{cite book |title= Juries and the Transformation of Criminal Justice in France in the 19th and 20th Centuries |first= James |last= Donovan |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-8078-3363-6 |at= Ch. 1}}</ref>

The functions of the ''jury d’accusation'' were prescribed in the law of 1791 passed by the [[Constituent Assembly]] and were maintained and re-enacted in the ''Code des Délits et des Peines'' of 3 Brumaire, Year 4 (25 October 1795) and this was the operative law until it was abolished in 1808.<ref>{{cite book |title= Théorie du Jury |first= Charles-François |last=Oudot |publisher= Joubert |location= Paris |year= 1845 |page= 327}}</ref> [[Special jury|Special juries]] and special grand juries were originally defined in law, for cases thought to require more qualified jurors, but these were abolished in Year 8 (1799).<ref>Archives de Droit et de Legislation, Tome 5, 2nd Semester, Brussels 1841.

===Belgium===
From 1795 to 1808 grand juries also operated in [[Belgium]],<ref>Archives de Droit et de Legislation, Tome 5, 2nd Semester, Brussels 1841. Page 73: ''Loi Belge du 15 Mai 1838 Relative au Jury Expliquée''</ref>  which was divided into French ''[[departements]]''  in October 1795.

===Japan===

After [[World War II]], under the influence of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[Japan]] passed the Prosecutorial Review Commission Law on July 12, 1948, which created the ''Kensatsu Shinsakai'' (or Prosecutorial Review Commission (PRC) system), a figure analogue to the grand jury system. However, until 2009 the PCR's recommendations were not binding, and were only regarded as advisory.<ref name="fukurai-lay-over">{{cite journal|last1=Fukurai|first1=Hiroshi|title=Japan's Prosecutorial Review Commissions: Lay Oversight of the Government's Discretion of Prosecution|journal=University of Pennsylvania East Asia Law Review|date=2011|pages=5–10|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&context=ealr|access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> Additionally, a survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet Office on October 1990 showed that 68. 8% of surveyed Japanese citizens were not familiar with the PRC system.<ref name="fukurai-lay-over" /> On May 21, 2009, the Japanese government introduced new legislation which would make the PRC's decisions binding.

===Sierra Leone===
Under the administration of the [[Sierra Leone Company]], which began in 1792, the Governor and Council or any two members thereof, being also [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]], held [[quarter session]]s for the trial of offences committed within the colony. The process for indictment etc. was the same as the practice in England or as near as possible thereto. To effect this, they were empowered to issue their warrant or precept to the Sheriff, commanding him to summon a grand jury to sit at the court of quarter sessions. Grand juries continued in operation after the transfer to the colony to the Crown in 1807.<ref name=CGeorge>{{cite book |title=The Rise of British West Africa: Comprising the Early History of the Colony of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lagos, Gold Coast, etc|url=https://archive.org/details/risebritishwest00georgoog|first=Claude |last=George |publisher=Houlston & sons |location=London |year=1904 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/risebritishwest00georgoog/page/n162 146], 147, 171}}</ref>

[[Arthur Kennedy (governor)|Governor Kennedy]] (1852–1854) was concerned that jurors were frustrating government policy by being biased in certain cases; in particular he felt that liberated Africans on the grand jury would never convict another liberated African on charges of owning or importing slaves.<ref name= BlackLoyalists>{{cite book |title=The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783–1870 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackloyalistsse0000walk |url-access=registration |first=James W.

A public meeting launched a petition with 550 names to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] in London, and the opposition declared that the Kennedy ordinance was a reproach upon the loyalty of the community. Grand juries have been considered one colonial body representative of local opinion and the Colonial Secretary's support for Kennedy upholding the abolition inspired a round of agitation for a local voice in government decision-making.<ref name= BlackLoyalists/>
