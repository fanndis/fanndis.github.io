A '''coronet''' is a small [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] consisting of ornaments fixed on a metal ring. By one definition, a coronet differs from other kinds of crowns in that a coronet never has arches, and from a [[tiara]] in that a coronet completely encircles the head, while a tiara does not.  By a slightly different definition, a crown is worn by an emperor, empress, king or queen; a coronet by a [[nobleman]] or lady. See also [[diadem]].

In other languages, this distinction is not made as usually the same word for ''crown'' is used irrespective of rank (Krone in German, kroon in Dutch, krona in Swedish, couronne in French, etc.)

The main use is now actually not on the head (indeed, many people entitled to a coronet never have one made; the same even applies to some monarchs' crowns, as in Belgium) but as a [[rank symbol]] in [[heraldry]], adorning a [[coat of arms]].
{{Heraldic achievement}}

==Etymology==
The word stems from the Old French ''coronete'', a diminutive of ''co(u)ronne'' ("crown"), itself from the Latin ''corona'' (also "wreath"), from the [[Ancient Greek]] κορώνη (korōnē, "garland, wreath").

Traditionally, such headgear is – as indicated by the German equivalent ''Adelskrone'' (literally "crown of nobility") – used by [[Nobility|noble]]s and by princes and princesses in their [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], rather than by [[monarch]]s, for whom the word ''crown'' is customarily reserved in formal English, while many languages have no such terminological distinction. Other than a crown, a coronet shows the rank of the respective noble. Hence, in [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavia]]n languages there is also the term ''Rangkrone''.

For equivalents, both physical and emblematic, in other languages and cultures, see under [[crown (headgear)]].

==Commonwealth usage==
[[File:St Mary Magdalene, Croome, Worcs - Memorial to 4th Baron Coventry (1654–1687) coronet.JPG|thumb|Depiction of a baron's coronet on a 17th-century funerary monument]]

In the United Kingdom, a [[Peerage|peer]] wears his or her coronet on one occasion only: for a [[Coronation of the British monarch|royal coronation]], when it is worn along with [[Robes of the British peerage|coronation robes]], equally standardised as a luxurious uniform.

In the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerages of the United Kingdom]]<!-- please do not link to "Peerage of the United Kingdom"; that only refers to the titles created in the last 200 years -->, the design of a coronet shows the rank of its owner, as in German, French and various other heraldic traditions.  Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name="cox">Cox, Noel (1999). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060415084228/http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/coronets.htm "The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage."] ''The Double Tressure, the Journal of The Heraldry Society of Scotland''. No. 22, pp. 8–13. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>

Since a person entitled to wear a coronet customarily displays it in his or her [[coat of arms]] above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and below the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], this can provide a useful clue as to the owner of a given coat of arms. In [[Canadian heraldry#United Empire Loyalists|Canadian heraldry]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalists]] are entitled to use a Loyalist military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others) in their arms.

===Royal usage===
[[File:Crown of the British Heir Apparent.svg|right|thumb|The crown of the [[Prince of Wales|British heir apparent]]]]
Members of the [[British Royal Family]] often have coronets on their coats of arms, and may wear actual coronets at coronations (e.g., Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] at the 1937 coronation of their father as [[George VI]]). They were made, according to regulations made by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1661, shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] started monumental work at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] that year) during [[the Restoration]]. They vary depending upon the prince's relationship to the monarch. Occasionally, additional royal warrants vary the designs for individuals. The most recent (and most comprehensive) royal warrant concerning coronets was the 19 November 1917 warrant of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 1917 royal warrant]</ref>

Rather than a coronet, the [[heir apparent]] receives a crown with a single arch.

There is evidence to support the wearing of coronets amongst Welsh royalty and nobility, particularly in the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. [[Llywelyn's coronet]] was for a while kept with the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|English crown jewels]].

== Former monarchies ==

=== Kingdom of France usage ===
This hierarchy among the [[French nobility]], which was identical for non-royal titles to the British hierarchy of peers, should not be understood to be as rigid in the ranking of titleholders as the latter. In particular, title was not a good indication of actual preeminence or precedence: Ancestry, marriages, high office, military rank and the family's historical renown (as documented, e.g., in the ''[[Honneurs de la Cour]]'' or in [[Père Anselme]]'s histories of the nobility)  counted far more than the precise title. Some distinguished families held no higher title than count or even baron, but were proud of their ancient origin. Moreover, most of the nobility was legally untitled, some hereditary titles could be acquired by a nobleman who purchased a "titled" [[fief]], while ''[[courtesy title|titres de courtoisie]]'' were freely assumed in the absence of strict regulation by the French crown and became more numerous than titles legally borne. As an example, the title of ''marquis'' ranks in principle immediately after ''duke'', but was so ridiculed by the late 18th century (cf. the phrase "petit marquis" meaning a presumptuous and vain person) that Napoleon omitted it from his own scale of titles. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people assumed and used freely coronets of ranks that they did not have; and, in the 19th and 20th centuries abuse was still made of "courtesy titles". Titles continued to be granted until the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] fell in 1870, and legally survive among their descendants.

The only title that was never usurped under the'' [[ancien régime]]'', and rarely without some excuse afterwards, was the title of ''duc'', because it was so often attached to the rank [[peer of France]], which carried specific legal prerogatives such as the right to a seat in the [[Parliament of Paris]]. As a result, the title of ''duc'' was actually, as well as nominally, at the top of the scale after the royal family and foreign princes, and a cut above all of the other nobility.

Prince: this was not a title in Old Regime France, but a rank, hence there was no coronet.

*[[King|Roi]]: closed crown of [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]] (the crown was open until the early 16th century).
*[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (or heir apparent): initially an open crown of fleurs-de-lis; starting with Henri IV's son (1601–10), the crown is closed with dolphins instead of arches.
*[[Fils de France]] et [[Petit-Fils de France]] (children and grandchildren of a sovereign): open coronet of fleurs-de-lis.
*[[Prince du Sang]] (Prince of the Blood – descended in male line from a sovereign): first a coronet alternating fleurs-de-lis and [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves (called strawberry leaves in English blazon), e.g., on François de Montpensier's coinage in Dombes, c. 1575. In the 17th and 18th centuries they used a coronet of fleurs-de-lis like the enfants de France. The legitimized princes (descended from legitimized children of sovereigns) ranked immediately after the princes of the blood (from 1694 to 1717 and from 1723 onward), and were given the same coronet.
*[[Pair de France]] (Peer of the Realm): a coronet of the title (usually duke) with a crimson velvet cap, a mantle armoyé (reproducing the arms) fringed with gold and lined with ermine.
*[[Duc]] (duke): a coronet of acanthus leaves.
*[[Marquis]]: a coronet of alternating acanthus leaves and groups of three pearls in trefoil (or two pearls side by side in some versions).
*[[Count|Comte]] (count): a coronet of pearls.
*[[Vicomte]] (viscounts): 4 large pearls (3 visible) alternating with smaller pearls.
*[[Vidame]] (a peculiar French title, for protectors of the temporal estates of a bishopric): a small coronet with 4 crosses (3 visible).
*[[Baron]]: a circle of gold wreathed with a string of small pearls.
*[[Knight|Chevalier]] (knight): coronet, but a helm.
*[[Ecuyer]] (squire): no coronet, but a helm. Helms were reserved for nobles, titled or untitled, by the 16th century regulations that were universally ignored. In principle, a helm without coronet indicated an untitled noble, chevalier or écuyer (on this distinction, see  a discussion of the French nobility).

=== Holy Roman Empire ===
The [[Holy Roman Empire]], and consequently its successor states (Austria, Germany and others), had a system very similar to that of the British, although the design varied.

*''Herzogskrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Herzog]]'' (duke) displays five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by five visible arches and a ''[[globus cruciger]]''.
*''Fürstenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Fürst]]'' (prince) shows five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by three visible arches and a ''globus cruciger''.
*''Landgrafenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Landgrave|Landgraf]]'' (landgrave) shows five visible leaves, surmounted by three visible arches and a ''globus cruciger''.
*''Grafenkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Graf]]'' (count) displays nine visible tines with pearls. Some of the senior comital houses used coronets showing five leaves and four pearls (some mediatized counties and minor principalities had other types of coronets that distinguished them from regular counts).
*''Freiherrnkrone'': the coronet of a ''[[Freiherr]]'' (baron) shows seven visible tines with pearls.
*''Adelskrone'': the coronet of ''[[German nobility|Adel]]'' members (untitled nobility) displays five visible tines with pearls. Sometimes, the central and outer tines are leaves and the other tines are headed by pearls. In the southern states of [[Bavaria]] and [[Württemberg]], usually all tines are headed by pearls.

Considering the religious nature of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one can say that, except for the short-lived Napoleonic states, no continental secular system of heraldry historically was so neatly regulated as under the British crown. Still, there are often traditions (often connected to the Holy Roman Empire, ''e.g.'', those in Sweden, Denmark or Russia) that include the use of crown and coronets. While most languages do not have a specific term for coronets, but simply use the word meaning ''crown'', it is possible to determine which of those crowns are for peerage or lower-level use, and thus can by analogy be called coronets.

Precisely because there are many traditions and more variation within some of these, there is a plethora of continental coronet types. Indeed, there are also some coronets for positions that do not exist or entitle one to a coronet in the [[Commonwealth]] tradition. Such a case in French (''ancien'', ''i.e.'', royal era) heraldry, where coronets of rank did not come into use before the 16th century, is the [[vidame]], whose [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/vidame.htm coronet (illustrated)] is a metal circle mounted with three visible crosses (there is no documentary or archeological evidence that such a coronet was ever made).

Often, coronets are substituted by [[helmet]]s, or only worn on a helmet.
