== Overview ==
{{unrefsection|date=March 2020}}
The firm was founded in New York City in 1931 by [[Frank Weil]], [[Sylvan Gotshal]], and [[Horace Manges]]. Since 1968, Weil has been headquartered in the [[General Motors Building (Manhattan)|General Motors building]], overlooking [[Central Park]], in New York City's [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]].
 
After its founding in 1931, the firm grew steadily in the following decades, taking on clients including [[General Electric]] and [[General Motors]], and becoming one of the largest law firms in the country. In 1975, the firm opened an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], its first outside New York City, followed in the 1980s by locations in [[Miami]], [[Houston]] and [[Dallas]]. In 1991, the year that the internet became publicly available, Weil was the first global, non-California law firm to open a Silicon Valley office, in [[Redwood Shores]], [[California]]. Later, the firm further spread its practice, notably in non-contentious finance and private equity practice.

The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and the subsequent move by Central and Eastern European countries toward market-based economies prompted the firm to launch its international expansion. It established offices in [[Budapest]], [[Prague]] and [[Warsaw]] in the early 1990s, followed by the establishment of offices in [[Frankfurt]], [[London]], [[Munich]] and [[Paris]]. In the 21st century, the firm established offices in [[Beijing]], [[Dubai]], 29/F, [[Alexandra House]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Shanghai]]. {{As of|2012}} one-quarter of the firm's lawyers practiced outside the U.S.
