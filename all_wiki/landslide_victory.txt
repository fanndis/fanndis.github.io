{{Split|List of Landslide victories by nations|date=November 2020}}
A '''landslide victory''' is an [[election]] result in which the victorious candidate or party wins by an overwhelming margin.<ref name=Murse>{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-a-landslide-election-3367585 |title=Landslide Victory: Definition in Elections |first=Tom |last=Murse |date=8 October 2020 |work=ThoughtCo |publisher= |accessdate=18 October 2020}}</ref> The term became popular in the 1800s to describe a victory in which the opposition is "buried",<ref name=Murse/> similar to the way in which a geological [[landslide]] buries whatever is in its path. What constitutes a landslide varies by the type of [[electoral system]]. Even within an electoral system, there is no consensus on what sized margin makes for a landslide.<ref name=Murse/>

In a Canadian federal election, a landslide victory occurs when a political party gains a significant majority of the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. 

Landslide victories may also occur during provincial elections, and territorial elections in [[Yukon]].

== New Zealand ==
Before 1993, New Zealand used the traditional [[first-past-the-post]] system as in the U.K. to determine representation in its [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]]. Thus, landslide elections at that time were defined in an identical fashion, i.e. where one party got an overwhelming majority of the seats. Since 1993, New Zealand has used the [[mixed member proportional]] system as in Germany, making landslides much less likely.<ref>{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uk44aykGg4 | title=Mixed Member Proportional Representation in New Zealand | date=17 July 2014 | people=Electoral Commission | medium=Video | location=Wellington}}</ref>

== Philippines ==
[[File:1953 Philippine presidential election results per province.png|thumb|Ramon Magsaysay (light green)'s 1953 landslide victory.]]In [[1941 Philippine general election|1941]], the [[Nacionalista Party]] won the presidency, vice presidency, all seats in the Senate, and all but 3 seats in the House of Representatives. This was the biggest landslide in Philippine history. The legislators won't serve until 1945 though, due to World War II.

Starting in 1987, the Philippines evolved into a [[multi-party system]], and coupled with the introduction of [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party-list elections]] in 1998, no party was able to win a landslide, much less a majority of seats, in the House of Representatives since then. This has also meant that no presidential and vice presidential election winner won a majority of votes, although, in 1998, the winners were described as having landslide victories, despite winning less than a majority of votes, due to large winning margins. Senatorial landslides are more possible though in midterm elections, as voters are usually presented with two distinct choices.

=== Presidential and vice presidential elections ===
In the Philippines, while there are presidential tickets, the positions of president and vice president are elected separately.

* [[1935 Philippine presidential election|1935 election]] – [[Manuel L. Quezon]] won with 68% of the vote. His running mate, [[Sergio Osmeña]], won with 86% of the vote. Their second placers had 18% and 8% of the vote, respectively.
* [[1941 Philippine presidential election|1941 election]] – [[Manuel L. Quezon]] won with 82% of the vote. His running mate, [[Sergio Osmeña]], won with 92% of the vote. Their opponents had 18% and 8% of the vote, respectively. This was the biggest landslide in an election where major opposition parties participated.
* [[1953 Philippine presidential election|1953 election]] – [[Ramon Magsaysay]] won with 69% of the vote. His running mate, [[Carlos P. Garcia]], won with 63% of the vote. Their opponents had 31% and 37% of the vote, respectively.
* [[1981 Philippine presidential election and referendum|1981 election]] – [[Ferdinand Marcos]] won with 89% of the vote, and won in every province. Major opposition parties boycotted this election. This is the largest landslide in history.
* [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998 election]] – [[Joseph Estrada]] won with 40% of the vote. His main opponent, [[Jose de Venecia Jr.|Jose de Venecia]], received just 16%, or a margin of 24%. De Venecia's running mate, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], won with almost 50% of the vote. Her main opponent, Estrada's running mate [[Edgardo Angara]], received just 22%, or a margin of about 28%.

=== Senate ===

* [[1941 Philippine Senate election|1941 election]] – [[Nacionalista Party]] won all 24 seats in the Senate. This was the only time that the Senate had no members from the opposition.

* [[1951 Philippine Senate election|1951 election]] – The [[Nacionalista Party]] won all 9 seats contested.

* [[1987 Philippine Senate election|1987 election]] – [[Lakas ng Bayan]] won 22 of 24 seats. Their main opponents, the [[Grand Alliance for Democracy]], won 2.
* [[2019 Philippine Senate election|2019 election]] – [[Hugpong ng Pagbabago]] won 9 of the 12 seats contested. Their main opponents, [[Otso Diretso]] won no seats. The other 3 seats went to other parties.

=== House of Representatives ===

* [[1907 Philippine Assembly elections|1907 election]] – The [[Nacionalista Party]] won 59 of 80 seats. The [[Progresista Party]] won 16. From 1907 to 1919, the Nacionalistas won every election in large margins, as they advocated Philippine independence from the United States, over their opponents' more conservative approach to the issue. From 1922 to 1935, the Nacionalistas were split into factions, until they were reunited in time for the 1938 election.
* [[1938 Philippine legislative election|1938 election]] – The [[Nacionalista Party]] won all 98 seats. This was the only time that the House of Representatives had no members from the opposition.
* [[1941 Philippine House of Representatives elections|1941 election]] – The [[Nacionalista Party]] won 95 seats. The other 3 seats were won by independents.

The early elections followed the fall of Prime Minister [[Iveta Radičová]]'s [[Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party]]-led coalition in October 2011 over a [[no confidence]] vote her government had lost because of its support for the [[European Financial Stability Fund]].

== Spain ==
*[[1982 Spanish general election|1982]] and [[1986 Spanish general election|1986]]: [[Felipe González]]'s [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) won two consecutive blowouts, with advantages of 22 and 18 percentage points over the second party, [[Manuel Fraga]]'s right-wing [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]], which scored just over one hundred seats and won only one region, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. In 1982, PSOE won over 200 seats, the only time this has been achieved by a sole party.

*[[2000 Spanish general election|2000]]: Ruling [[José María Aznar]]'s [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) won by 10 percentage points to the PSOE.
