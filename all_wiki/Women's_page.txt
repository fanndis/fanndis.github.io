{{short description|Newspaper section}}
[[File:Image 4-15-19 at 10.53 AM.jpg|thumb|"The Kansas Women's Page" section of the ''[[Topeka Daily Capital]]'' in 1920]]
The '''women's page''' (sometimes called home page or women's section) of a [[newspaper]] was a section devoted to covering news assumed to be of interest to women. Women's pages started out in the 19th century as [[Society reporting|society pages]] and eventually morphed into [[Feature story|features sections]] in the 1970s. Although denigrated during much of that period, they had a significant impact on journalism and in their communities.

===Early women's pages===
{{Main|Society reporting}}
[[File:"Doings in Pittsburg Society" The Pittsburg Press February 1, 1920.png|thumb|"Doings in Pittsburg Society," the society page of ''[[The Pittsburg Press]]'', on February 1, 1920]]
In 1835 ''[[New York Herald]]'' publisher [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]], created the first newspaper society page.<ref name="Ogden1986">{{cite book|author=Annegret S.

In the 1880s and 1890s, newspaper publishers such as [[Joseph Pulitzer]] started developing sections of their papers to attract women readers,<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}}<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|38}} who were of interest to advertisers.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|5}} Industrialization had profoundly increased the number of branded consumer products, and advertisers recognized that women were the primary purchasing decision makers for their households.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|5}} Advertising within women's sections focussed on department stores.<ref name="Whitt2008">{{cite book|author=Jan Whitt|title=Women in American Journalism: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTwVxoEyL3MC|year=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07556-8}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Proprietors of newspapers competed for women readers, who both boosted subscription sales but were of great interest to advertisers, who recognized that women were important decisionmakers for family purchases.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|32}} News historian Gerald Baldasty put it that, "For the newspaper industry, a woman's charm was purely financial."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCG98jIAG_MC&q=for+the+newspaper+industry%2C+a+woman%27s+charm+was+purely+financial|title=The Commercialization of News in the Nineteenth Century|last=Baldasty|first=Gerald J.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|year=1992|isbn=9780299134006|location=|pages=|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Rp|126}}

Sections focused on the "Four F's" – family, food, furnishings, and fashion – and on society news and advice and recipe columns.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}} Most women covered by the sections were wives, daughters, or brides of prominent men.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|40}} Newspapers typically hired women to staff these sections.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}}

The popularization of women's pages coincided with the [[First-wave feminism|first wave of feminism.]]<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|10}} Media scholar [[Dustin Harp]] said she found no evidence that women of the time viewed these sections otherwise than positively, as they offered a rare opportunity for expression, but also surmised that feminists may have viewed them with mixed reactions as the sections also reinforced stereotypes.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|10}}

By 1886 the ''[[New York World]]'' carried columns aimed at women.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|39}} By 1891 the Sunday issues featured a page of fashion and society coverage.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|39}} By 1894 the daily issues featured a page headlined "For and About Women."<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|39}}

By 1900, many metropolitan newspapers had a women's section covering society and fashion.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|42}}

By 1920 women's page journalism, sometimes called "home page journalism" was being taught in colleges.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|39}} As late as 1949 women's page journalism classes at Columbia University included instruction that news of "crises, disaster, tragedies" belonged on the front pages while the inside pages were "like the inside of a home" and that women journalists should contribute by focussing on wholesome, uplifting topics in the women's sections.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|39-40}} According to media scholar Jan Whitt, the implication was that only male journalists understood and could write about [[hard news]].<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|40}}

In addition to being prevented from working in other departments, women journalists working in the women's section were often denigrated by male journalists. Their working spaces were given names such as the "hen coop."<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|40}} For decades, the majority of women journalists worked in women's sections.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|viii}}

===World War II===
{{See also|American women in World War II}}
As in many fields, journalism opportunities for US women changed dramatically during World War II.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|41}} Many men left their jobs to go to war, and women were tapped to perform those jobs, which before the war had only been open to men.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|41}} Many women were required to sign waivers agreeing to leave these jobs when the war ended, but during the war women journalists developed their skills and interests to include coverage of hard news, and they returned to their former positions with that new knowledge.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|5-6}} Many, like [[Dorothy Misener Jurney|Dorothy Jurney]], were asked to train their male replacements before being relegated back to the women's section.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|41}} Jurney was told by the managing editor that she was not a candidate for city editor because she was a woman.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|5}}

===Post World War II===
In the years after World War II, many women's page journalists and editors, many of whom had covered hard news during the war, attempted to change the focus of women's sections to cover substantive, important news of interest to women.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|41}} Media scholar Kimberly Wilmot Voss said of this period that women's sections "came into their own."<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|vii}} Sections became larger and covered increasingly progressive content, but "the perceptions that the sections were fluff continued for years."<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|vii}}

Post-1960, the trend continued and some newspapers' sections were covering stories that weren't being covered in news sections, such as exposés of county foster homes, stories about domestic abuse,<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|42}} reproductive rights,<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|119}} and other substantive topics. [[Marie Anderson]] of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' led her section to discontinue society coverage. Under her leadership the section won so many Penney-Missouri Awards (see below) in the 1960s that the paper was asked to retire from the competition.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018">{{cite book |last1=Voss |first1=Kimberly Wilmot |title=Re-Evaluating Women's Page Journalism in the Post World War II Era: Celebrating Soft News |date=2018 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |isbn=9783319962139 |url=https://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9783319962139 |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref> These trends were pioneered by smaller metropolitan newspapers such as the ''Herald'', the ''[[Dallas Times-Herald]]'', and the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|42-43}} Many major US papers were slow to follow,<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|42-43}} including the ''[[New York Times]]'', whose women's section was named "Food, Fashion, Furnishings, and Family" until 1971.<ref name="svachulaNYT20sep2018">{{cite web |last1=Svachula |first1=Amanda |title=When The Times Kept Female Reporters Upstairs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/insider/times-womens-section-female-reporters.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref>

===J. C. Penney-Missouri Awards===
{{main|Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards}}

In the US, the J. C. Penney-Missouri Awards (often called the Penney-Missouri Awards and later the Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards) were the most prestigious awards for women's page writing and editing<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|3}} and the only nationwide recognition specifically for women's page journalism.<ref name="vossJHspring06p44">{{cite journal |last1=Voss |first1=Kimberly Wilmot|title=The Penney-Missouri Awards: Honoring the Best in Women's News |journal=Journalism History |date=Spring 2006 |volume=32 |issue=1 |page=44|doi=10.1080/00947679.2006.12062697|s2cid=140928882}}</ref> The awards were inaugurated in 1960 to recognize women's sections with progressive content<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|34}} that covered stories other than society, club, and fashion news. They were often described as the Pulitzers of women's page journalism at a time when most women's page coverage wasn't considered for other prestigious journalism awards.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|32}}<ref name="taftENCxiv">{{cite book |last1=Taft |first1=William H |title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century Journalists |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |page=xiv |isbn=9781317403258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fecsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR14 |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>

The awards presentations each year were accompanied by influential workships that encouraged women's page editors to focus on more substantive, progressive issues.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|34}} 1966 keynote speaker [[Marjorie Paxson]] told attendees, "It's time we started putting some hard news into (our pages.) It's time we accepted the responsibility of making our readers aware."<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|119}} Because women were not at the time accepted into the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], these workshops represented an important networking opportunity that wasn't otherwise available to women journalists.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|34}}

Rodger Streitmatter, writing in the scholarly journal ''[[Journalism History (journal)|Journalism History]]'', credits the awards for helping to change women's pages journalism from the traditional types of coverage to covering more substantive stories.<ref name="streitmatterJH1998su">{{cite journal |last1=Streitmatter |first1=Rodger |title=Transforming the Women's Pages: Strategies that Worked |journal=Journalism History |date=Summer 1998 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=72-80 |doi=10.1080/00947679.1998.12062493 |url=https://libraryh3lp.com/file/j4yx2hzrfdte3f@web.libraryh3lp.com/1545855411440.pdf?t=503qKK73EPZ2BA0zU9m1Fx |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref>

===Women's movement===
{{See also|Second-wave feminism}}
The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with newspapers' movements to replace women's pages with features and lifestyles sections. While women's page editors were pushing their management to allow them to cover issues of importance to women, many feminists were criticizing the very idea of "women's" news, arguing that news important to women was news that should be covered in the main section of the newspaper and that segregating women's news to within one section marginalized that news and implicitly indicated the rest of the newspaper was for men.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|11}} They believed so-called "women's sections" should be eliminated.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|38}}

Many women's page editors considered themselves part of or supporters of the women's movement and were proud of their role in covering topics important to women readers.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|41}} In many newspapers the only coverage of the women's movement was within the women's section. The 1965 announcement of the formation of the [[National Organization for Women]] ran between an article about [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] and a recipe for turkey stuffing.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|45}}

Women's pages of the time were accused of talking down to women. A 1971 ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' editorial asked, "What has your women's page editor done for you lately?" and said the sections reduced women to traditional roles.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|12}}

In 1978, sociologist [[Cynthia Fuchs Epstein]] argued that news of the women's movement did not belong in the women's section because "just by appearing there, the stories maintain the status quo, for they tell both men and women that news of the women's movement is not of general concern."<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|46}} That same year [[Harvey Molotch]] wrote that news was "essentially men talking to men. The women's pages are a deliberate exception: Here it is the case that women who work for men talk to women. But in terms of the important information...women are not ordinarily present."<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|47}}

According to media scholar Voss, the argument that if women's pages were eliminated, news of importance to women would end up on the front pages turned out to be incorrect, and that instead much of it simply did not appear in the newspapers after the elimination of the women's section.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|163}}

As late as 1993 media scholar M. Junior Bridge found that the incidence of references to women on the front page of the ''New York Times'' had only risen to 13% of names mentioned, up from 5% in 1989.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|49}} ''Times'' executive editor [[Max Frankel]] reacted the announcement of this study by suggesting more women would appear on the front page if the front page were "covering local teas."<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|49}}

===Features sections===
{{Main|Feature story}}
In 1969, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' under the leadership of [[Ben Bradlee]] replaced the women's page,"For and About Women"<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|160}} with a section called "Style", which was designed to attract a broader audience.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}} The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' followed suit with "View" the next year<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}} and soon metropolitan newspapers through out the US stopped publishing explicitly-named women's sections in favor of "lifestyle" sections.<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|2}}  According to Harp, this represented the "birth of the modern-day feature section."<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|1}} Society news all but disappeared from these sections, and wedding announcements and club news became minor segments of most newspapers. 

In many cases the editors who had been managing the women's sections were demoted and male editors installed to manage the new features sections.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|48}} This happened twice to Paxson, when two different newspapers eliminated their women's sections, which she had been editing, demoted her, and hired a man as features editor.<ref name="Whitt2008" />{{rp|44}}

===Resumption of women's sections===
In the late 1980s, some newspapers reintroduced sections explicitly designed to attract female readers.<ref name="harpDSWR">{{cite book|last1=Harp|first1=Dustin|url=|title=Desperately Seeking Women Readers|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739114902|location=|pages=|accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called their section "WomanNews."<ref name="harpDSWR" />{{rp|2}} As late as 2006 the section was being included within the "Tempo" features section on Wednesdays.<ref name="TRIB1jan2006">{{cite web |title=Fans of WomanNews |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-01-01-0601010481-story.html |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref>

==Impact==
Women's sections, while marginalized by other journalists and by members of the women's movement, made major contributions in their communities. Working with local [[Women's club movement|women's clubs]] – another group often denigrated<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|51}} – some women's sections pinpointed community problems and helped develop solutions.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|viii-ix}} Women's sections in some metropolitan areas were instrumental in establishing social programs and libraries.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|viii}} In a 1960s-era speech, [[Marie Anderson]] told women's page journalists, "be a motivating source in your community. If your town doesn't do something, call attention to it."<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|9}} Club editors in many metropolitan areas held workshops to train local club leaders how to create and describe projects that would make their work newsworthy. The journalists encouraged the clubwomen first to tackle newsworthy work, and then to write press releases useful in the selection and development of stories. This work encouraged women's clubs to upgrade their programming, resulting in meaningful work being done by women's clubs which had formerly been primarily social groups.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|51-58}}

Some women's page editors developed inclusive policies, often before the other sections of the newspaper. The ''Miami Herald'' ran a series profiling black residents in 1962, "well before the front pages of the newspaper addressed societal inequities."<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|11}} Edee Greene of the ''Fort Lauderdale News'' rans photos of black brides before it was done at most newspapers.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|11}} In 1968 ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' editor Ponchitta Pierce was invited by [[Theta Sigma Phi]] to write a piece for the professional association's publication ''Matrix'' on including black women in women's pages.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|14}}

By the 1960s, many metropolitan women's pages were covering social issues, which weren't typically being covered in news sections.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|3}} Women's pages in some newspapers covered domestic violence, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], abortion, syphilis, women's prison, prostitution, child molestation, and other issues before their papers' news sections did.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|3, 11}}

Media scholar Julie Golia concluded that women's page journalism has been "dismissed by contemporaries and scholars as homogenouse drivel" and "long been misunderstood because no one has conducted an in-depth multi-decade analysis of content and evolution.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|20}}

Voss concluded they helped change the newspaper industry.<ref name="vossREEVAL2018" />{{rp|21}}
