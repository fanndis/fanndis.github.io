{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
The '''War Powers Resolution''' (also known as the '''War Powers Resolution of 1973''' or the '''War Powers Act''') ([[Title 50 of the United States Code|50 U.S.C.]] 1541–1548)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html|title=50 U.S. Code Chapter 33 - WAR POWERS RESOLUTION}}</ref> is a [[Law of the United States|federal law]] intended to check the [[U.S. President|U.S. president]]'s power to commit the United States to an [[armed conflict]] without the consent of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. The resolution was adopted in the form of a United States congressional [[joint resolution]]. It provides that the [[President of the United States|president]] can send the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] into action abroad only by [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]], "statutory authorization," or in case of "a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."

The War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 [[days]], with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a [[declaration of war by the United States]]. The resolution was passed by two-thirds each of the House and Senate, overriding the [[Veto#United States|veto]] of the bill by President [[Richard Nixon]].

It has been alleged that the War Powers Resolution has been violated in the past–for example, by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, during [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|the bombing campaign]] in Kosovo. Congress has disapproved all such incidents, but none has resulted in any successful legal actions being taken against the president for alleged violations.<ref name="Library of Congress War Powers Reference">{{cite web|url=http://loc.gov/law/help/war-powers.php|title=War Powers - Law Library of Congress - Library of Congress}}</ref>

==Background==
Under the [[United States Constitution]], war powers are divided. Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]], Congress has the power to:

*declare War
*grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal (i.e., license private citizens to capture enemy vessels)
*raise and support Armies (for terms up to two years at a time)
*provide and maintain a Navy
*make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces
*provide for calling forth the [[Militia (United States)|Militia]]
*make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water
*provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia; and
*govern such Part of [the militia] as may be employed in the Service of the United States.

Section 8 further provides that the [[U.S. State|states]] have the power to:

*Appoint the Officers of the militia; and
*train the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Presidential Powers|Article II, Section 2]] provides that:

*"The president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States"

It is generally agreed that the commander-in-chief role gives the President power to repel attacks against the United States<ref name="ReferenceA">The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 318-19 (Max Farrand ed., rev. ed. 1966)(1911)</ref><ref name="justice.gov">[https://www.justice.gov/olc/warpowers925.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215114422/http://www.justice.gov/olc/warpowers925.htm|date=December 15, 2008}}</ref> and makes the President responsible for leading the armed forces. The President has the right to sign or veto congressional acts, such as a declaration of war, and Congress may override any such presidential veto. Additionally, when the president's actions (or inactions) provide "Aid and Comfort" to enemies or levy war against the United States, then Congress has the power to impeach and remove (convict) the president for treason. For actions short of treason, they can remove the president for "Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors", the definition of which the Supreme Court has left up to Congress. Therefore, the war power was intentionally split between Congress and the Executive to prevent unilateral executive action that is contrary to the wishes of Congress, or unilateral legislative action that is contrary to the wishes of the president.

==History==

===Background and passage===

During the [[Vietnam War]], the United States found itself involved for many years in situations of intense conflict without a declaration of war. Many members of Congress became concerned with the erosion of congressional authority to decide when the United States should become involved in a war or the use of armed forces that might lead to war. It was prompted by news leaking out that President Nixon conducted [[Operation Menu|secret bombings of Cambodia]] during the Vietnam War without notifying Congress.<ref name=HistoryChannel>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/.amp/topics/vietnam-war/war-powers-act|title=War Powers Act|date=30 November 2017}}</ref>

The War Powers Resolution was passed by both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] but was vetoed by President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=ConCenter>{{cite web| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/when-congress-once-used-its-powers-to-declare-war|title=When Congress last used its powers to declare war|date=8 December 2018|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=HistoryChannel></ref> By a two-thirds vote in each house, Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto and enacted the joint resolution into law on November 7, 1973.<ref name=ConCenter></ref>

===Implementation, 1993–2002===
Presidents have submitted 130<ref name="ReferenceB">U.S. Library of Congress. Congressional Research Service. War Powers Resolution: Presidential Compliance. Washington: The Service, 2011 (RL33532), Summary.</ref> reports to Congress as a result of the War Powers Resolution, although only one (the [[Mayagüez incident|''Mayagüez'' incident]]) cited Section 4(a)(1) and specifically stated that forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent danger.

Congress invoked the War Powers Resolution in the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]] Act (P.L. 98-119), which authorized the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to remain in [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanon]] for 18 months during 1982 and 1983. In addition, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]] ({{USPL|102|1}}), which authorized United States combat operations against Iraqi forces during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], stated that it constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.

On November 9, 1994, the House used a section of the War Powers Resolution to state that U.S. forces should be withdrawn from [[History of Somalia#Somali Civil War|Somalia]] by March 31, 1994;{{citation-needed|date=June 2019}} Congress had already taken this action in appropriations legislation. More recently, under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], war powers were at issue in [[Yugoslav Wars|former Yugoslavia]], [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Iraq]], and [[Operation Uphold Democracy|Haiti]], and under President [[George W. Bush]] in responding to terrorist attacks against the U.S. after [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. "[I]n 1999, President Clinton kept the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign in Kosovo]] going for more than two weeks after the 60-day deadline had passed. Even then, however, the Clinton legal team opined that its actions were consistent with the War Powers Resolution because Congress had approved a bill funding the operation, which they argued constituted implicit authorization. That theory was controversial because the War Powers Resolution specifically says that such funding does not constitute authorization."<ref name="thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com">[[Charlie Savage|Savage, Charlie]] (2011-04-01) [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/clock-ticking-on-war-powers-resolution/ Clock Ticking on War Powers Resolution], ''[[The New York Times]]'' The Caucus Blog</ref> Clinton's actions in Kosovo were challenged by a member of Congress as a violation of the War Powers Resolution in the D.C.

After the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the use of force to obtain Iraqi compliance with [[United Nations]] resolutions, particularly through enforcement of [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], remained a war powers issue. In October 2002 Congress enacted the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]] {{USStatute|107|243}}, which authorized President [[George W. Bush]] to use force as necessary to defend the United States against Iraq and enforce relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions.<ref name="PL107-243">{{USPL|107|243}}</ref> This was in addition to the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001]].

===Libya, 2011===
Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] testified to congress in March 2011 that the Obama administration did not need [[Declaration of war by the United States|congressional authorization]] for its [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]] or for further decisions about it, despite congressional objections from members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/30/congress.libya.briefing/ |title=Congress members grill administration officials on Libya mission |publisher=CNN |date=March 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/152891-white-house-briefing-changes-few-minds-on-libya |title=White House briefing changes few minds on Libya involvement |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |author=Lillis, Mike |date=March 30, 2011|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  During that classified briefing, she reportedly indicated that the administration would sidestep the Resolution's provision regarding a 60-day limit on unauthorized military actions.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/clinton-to-congress-obama-would-ignore-your-war-resolutions?ref=fpblg |title=Clinton To Congress: Obama Would Ignore Your War Resolutions |publisher=Talking Points Memo |author=Crabtree, Susan |date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>  Months later, she stated that, with respect to the military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the [[sorties]], and the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions – a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://web.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/world/middleeast/26powers.html |title=Libya Effort Is Called Violation of War Act |work=The New York Times |author=Charlie Savage |date=May 26, 2011 |page=A8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/africa/18powers.html |title=2 Top Lawyers Lost to Obama in Libya War Policy Debate |work=The New York Times |last=Savage |first=Charlie |date=June 18, 2011 |page=A1 |url-access=limited}}</ref> The State Department publicly took the position in June 2011 that there was no "hostility" in Libya within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, contrary to legal interpretations in 2011 by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Office of Legal Counsel|Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/president-overruled-2-key-lawyers-on-debate-over-libya-war-policy/ |title=President overruled 2 key lawyers on debate over Libya war policy |author=Savage, Charlie |date=June 18, 2011 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref><ref name=Cosgrove>Cosgrove, Maureen [http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/06/state-department-legal-adviser-obama-acting-lawfully-in-libya.php "State Department legal adviser: Obama acting lawfully in Libya"], [[JURIST]] (June 28, 2011).</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Defining War in an Ill-Defined World|first1=Nikolas|last1=Gvosdev|first2=Andrew|last2=Stigler|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/opinion/29iht-edgvosdev29.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 2011|department=Opinion|access-date=February 13, 2020|url-access=limited}}</ref>

===Syria, 2012–2017===
{{See also|2017 Shayrat missile strike|Syrian Train and Equip Program|Timber Sycamore}}
In late 2012 or early 2013, at the direction of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was put in charge of [[Timber Sycamore]], a covert program to arm and train the rebels who were fighting against [[Syria|Syrian]] [[President of Syria|President]] [[Bashar Assad]],<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-give-some-syria-rebels-ability-to-call-airstrikes-1424208053 |title=U.S. to Give Some Syria Rebels Ability to Call Airstrikes |work= The Wall Street Journal |date=February 17, 2015 |access-date=February 17, 2015 |last=Barnes|first=Julian E. |last2=Entous |first2=Adam |url-access=subscription}}</ref> while the State Department supplied the [[Free Syrian Army]] with non-lethal aid. Following the [[use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War]] on several occasions, including the [[Ghouta chemical attack]] on 21 August 2013, Obama asked Congress for authorization to use military force in Syria, which Congress rejected. Instead, Congress passed a bill that specified that the Defense Secretary was authorized "...to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals...." The bill specifically prohibited the introduction of U.S. troops or other U.S. forces into hostilities. The bill said: "Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances."<ref>{{USPL|113|164}}</ref>

In spite of the prohibition, Obama, and later U.S. President [[Donald Trump|Trump]], introduced ground forces into Syria, and the United States became fully engaged in the country, though these troops were primarily for training allied forces. On April 6, 2017, the United States launched 59 [[Tomahawk (missile)|BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles]] at Shayrat airbase in Syria in response to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons. Constitutional scholar and law professor [[Stephen Vladeck]] has noted that the strike potentially violated the War Powers Resolution.<ref>{{cite news|title=Was Trump's Syria Strike Legal?

The Trump Administration stated that the attack on [[Qasem Soleimani]] was carried out in accordance with the War Powers Resolution under the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] (AUMF) resolution of 2001. The legalities of using the AUMF for endless conflicts has been a source of debate.

On February 13, 2020, the Senate passed a similar legally-binding privileged resolution by a vote of 55–45. Trump vetoed the Senate resolution on May 6, 2020, stating the resolution mistakenly "implies that the president’s constitutional authority to use military force is limited to defense of the United States and its forces against imminent attack." Kaine stated Trump's veto could enable "endless wars" and "unnecessary war in the Middle East".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Crowley |first1=Michael |title=Trump Vetoes Measure Demanding Congressional Approval for Iran Conflict |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/us/politics/trump-vetoes-iran-war-powers.html |access-date=10 May 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

==Questions regarding constitutionality==
{{See also|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|War Powers Clause}}
The War Powers Resolution has been controversial since it was passed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_n2140_v88/ai_6876296 |title=The war powers resolution |publisher=US Department of State Bulletin |date=1988-09-15 |access-date=2008-07-09}} "The War Powers Resolution has been controversial from the day it was adopted over President Nixon's veto. Since 1973, executive officials and many Members of Congress have criticized various aspects of the law repeatedly."</ref> In passing the resolution, Congress specifically cites the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] for its authority.<ref>War Powers Joint Resolution, §2(b).</ref> Under the Necessary and Proper Clause, it is specifically provided that the Congress shall have the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not only its own powers but also all other powers vested by the Constitution in the ''Government of the United States'', or in ''any department or officer'' thereof.

Because the Constitution Article 1 Section 8 limits the President's authority in the use of force without a [[declaration of war]] by Congress, there is controversy as to whether the provisions of the resolution are consistent with the Constitution. Presidents have therefore drafted reports to Congress required of the President to state that they are "consistent with" the War Powers Resolution rather than "pursuant to" so as to take into account the presidential position that the resolution is unconstitutional.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

One argument for the unconstitutionality of the War Powers Resolution by [[Philip Bobbitt]]<ref>"War Powers: An Essay on [[John Hart Ely]]'s ''War and Responsibility: Constitutional Lessons of Vietnam and Its Aftermath''," ''Michigan Law Quarterly'' 92, no. 6 (May 1994): 1364–1400.</ref> argues "The power to make war is not an [[enumerated power]]" and the notion that to "declare" war is to "commence" war is a "contemporary textual preconception". Bobbitt contends that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] of the Constitution believed that statutory authorization was the route by which the United States would be committed to war, and that 'declaration' was meant for only [[total war]]s, as shown by the history of the [[Quasi-War]] with France (1798–1800). In general, constitutional powers are not so much separated as "linked and sequenced"; Congress's control over the armed forces is "structured" by appropriation, while the President commands; thus the act of declaring war should not be fetishized.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Bobbitt also argues that "A democracy cannot ... tolerate secret policies" because they undermine the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of governmental action.

A second argument concerns a possible breach of the 'separation of powers' doctrine, and whether the resolution changes the balance between the Legislative and Executive functions.
This type of constitutional controversy is similar to one that occurred under President [[Andrew Johnson]] with the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)]]. In that prior instance, the Congress passed a law (over the veto of the then-President) that required the President to secure Congressional approval for the removal of Cabinet members and other executive branch officers. The Act was not declared unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court of the United States]] until 1926.<ref>{{cite web |title=Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926)|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/272/52/case.html}}</ref> When Andrew Johnson violated the Act, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] [[impeachment|impeached]] him; action in the Senate to remove him [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|failed by one vote]].

Here, the separation of powers issue is whether the War Powers Resolution requirements for Congressional approval and presidential reporting to Congress change the constitutional balance established in Articles I and II, namely that Congress is explicitly granted the sole authority to "declare war", "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" (Article 1, Section 8), and to control the funding of those same forces, while the Executive has inherent authority as Commander in Chief. This argument does not address the other reporting requirements imposed on other executive officials and agencies by other statutes, nor does it address the provisions of Article I, Section 8 that explicitly gives Congress the authority to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces".

The constitution specifically states that Congress is authorized "to provide and maintain a Navy" (Article 1 Section 8). The idea of "maintenance" of a Navy implies that Naval Forces would be a permanent fixture of national defense. Two types of Land Forces are described by the Constitution (Article 1 Section 8): the Militia (armed citizenry organized into local defense forces and state volunteer regiments) which Congress can "call forth" and prescribe the "organizing, arming, and disciplining [training]" of, as Congress did in the Militia acts of 1792; and the Army, which Congress can "raise and support", through regular appropriation acts limited to no more than two years. This division matches how the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was fought, by the [[Continental Army]], raised and supported by the [[Continental Congress]], and local Militias and Volunteer Regiments, raised by the separate Colonies. After the war, under the Articles of Confederation, a small standing Army, the [[First American Regiment]] was raised and gradually increased in size over time by Congress before, following the Constitution's ratification, being transformed into the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. The availability of a standing Army, and the President of the United States being authorized as "Commander in Chief", implies his ability as a military commander to employ forces necessary to fulfill his oath to defend the constitution.

There is also an unresolved legal question, discussed by [[Byron Raymond White|Justice White]] in ''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha|INS v. Chadha]]'' of whether a "key provision of the War Powers Resolution", namely [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1544- 50 U.S.C. 1544(c)], constitutes an improper legislative veto. (See ''Chadha'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=462&invol=919 462 U.S. 919, 971].) That section 1544(c) states "such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution". Justice White argues in his dissent in ''Chadha'' that, under the ''Chadha'' ruling, 1544(c) would be a violation of the [[Presentment Clause]]. The majority in ''Chadha'' does not resolve the issue. Justice White does not address or evaluate in his dissent whether that section would fall within the inherent Congressional authority under Article I Section 8 to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.launchknowledge.com/constitution/|title=The Constitution of the United States - We the People - an easy to read and use version|website=launchknowledge.com|language=en-us}}</ref><!--(disputed see talk)-->
