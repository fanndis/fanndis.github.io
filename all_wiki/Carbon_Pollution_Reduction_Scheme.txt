The '''Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme''' (or '''CPRS''') was a cap-and-trade [[emissions trading]] scheme for anthropogenic [[greenhouse gas]]es proposed by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]], as part of its [[climate change]] policy,<ref>{{cite news

The policy began to be formulated in April 2007, when the federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] was in Opposition and the six Labor-controlled states commissioned an independent review on energy policy, the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]], which published a number of reports. After Labor won the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] and formed government, it published a [[Green Paper]] on climate change for discussion and comment. The Federal Treasury then modelled some of the financial and economic impacts of the proposed CPRS scheme.

The Rudd government published a final [[White Paper]] on 15 December 2008, and announced that legislation was intended to take effect in July 2010; but the legislation for the CPRS (aka ETS) failed to gain the numbers in the Senate and was twice rejected creating a [[double dissolution]] election trigger. A bitter political debate within the Coalition Opposition saw Opposition leader [[Malcolm Turnbull]] lose the leadership to the anti-CPRS [[Tony Abbott]]. The Rudd government did not call an election and in April 2010, Rudd deferred plans for the CPRS.

After the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]], the [[Gillard Government]] was able to get the [[Carbon pricing in Australia|Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM)]] passed into law as part of the Clean Energy Futures Package (CEF) in 2011, and became effective on 1 July 2012. However, after the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] there was a change in government, and the [[Abbott Government]] repealed the CEF package on 17 July 2014.<ref name='ets-off'>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/ets-off-the-agenda-until-late-next-term-20100426-tnbc.html

==History==
In the 2007 election year, both the Liberal-led Coalition government and the Labor opposition promised to introduce carbon trading. Opposition leader Rudd commissioned the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]] on 30 April 2007, while Prime Minister [[John Howard]] announced his own plan for a carbon trading scheme on 4 June 2007,<ref>{{cite web

==Green Paper==
The [[Garnaut Climate Change Review|draft Garnaut Report]], issued on 4 July 2008, was only one of many inputs into the policy-making process. The Labor government also issued a "[[Green Paper]]" on 16 July 2008<ref>{{cite web

|title= Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper 
|date=16 July 2008 
|publisher= Department of Climate Change 
|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}</ref>

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, was a market-based approach to [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas pollution]], to be implemented in 2010 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 9). The main concern for the [[Australian Labor Party|Australian government]] was getting the design of such a scheme correct, so that it would have complemented the integrated economic policy framework, and would have been consistent with the Government's commercial strategy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 10).

The objective of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was to meet Australia's emissions reduction targets in the most flexible and cost-effective way; to support an effective global response to climate change; and to provide for transitional assistance for the most affected households and firms (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 14).

The basis of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was a [[emissions trading|cap and trade system]], and was a way of limiting [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas pollution]], as well as giving individuals and businesses incentives to reduce their emissions (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11). The Australian Government would have set a cap on carbon emissions, consistent with longer-term goals of reducing Australia's emissions by 60% compared with 2000 levels by 2050 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11).

There were two definite elements of the cap and trade scheme: the cap itself, and the ability to trade (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The cap is the limit on greenhouse gas emissions imposed by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The system aims at achieving the environmental outcome of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the idea being that capping emissions creates a price for carbon and the ability to trade ensures that emissions are reduced at the lowest possible price (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). Setting a limit means that the right to emit greenhouse gases becomes scarce, and scarcity entails a price. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would have put a price on carbon in a systematic way throughout the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).

The 'covered' sectors are sources of emissions subject to the cap, which were specified in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). After setting the cap, the Government would have then issued permits that are equal to the cap. The Green Paper gives the example "if the cap were to limit emissions to 100 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>-e in a particular year, 100 million 'permits' would be issued that year" (2008, 12). For every tonne of emissions emitted, a source of emissions would have been required to acquire and surrender a permit (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). About one thousand firms were expected to have obligations from the Scheme.

The price of emissions would increase the cost of those goods and services that are most emissions-intensive (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). This means that there will be a change across the prices of goods and services across the economy, reflecting how emission-intensive the goods or service is. That therefore provides businesses and consumers with incentives to use and invest in low-emissions technologies.

The second essential element of a cap and trade scheme is the ability to trade. Since carbon pollution permits will be tradable, the price of permits will be determined by the market (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). The main idea behind this part of the scheme is that a firm who can undertake abatement more cheaply than the permit price will do so, and that a company will pay for permits if the cost to it of lowering its emissions exceeds the cost of the permits. By trading among themselves, firms achieve the scheme cap at the least cost to the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).

The cap would only achieve the desired environmental objectives if it is enforced. This means that firms responsible for emissions covered by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme must monitor their emissions and report them accurately to government (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The reported emissions data would need to be monitored and verified.

==Treasury report on the economics of climate change mitigation==
The Australian Treasury's report on the [[economics of climate change mitigation]] was released on 30 October 2008.<ref name='low'>{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/lowpollutionfuture/ |title=Australia's Low Pollution Future: The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation |publisher=Treasury |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718083633/http://www.treasury.gov.au/lowpollutionfuture/ |archivedate=18 July 2010}}</ref> The report was a key input in determining the structure and targets for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

The Treasury's modeling demonstrated that early global action to reduce carbon emissions would be less expensive than later action and stated that a market-based approach allows robust economic growth into the future as emissions fall.

The report also stated that:
* many of Australia's industries would maintain or improve their competitiveness under an international agreement to combat climate change
* even ambitious goals would have limited impact on national and global economic growth
* Australia and the world can continue to prosper while making the emission cuts required to reduce the risks of dangerous climate change.
* Households would face increased prices for emission-intensive products such as electricity and gas, however real household income would continue to grow.
* Strong coordinated global action would reduce the economic cost of achieving environmental objectives, reduce distortions in trade-exposed sectors, and provide insurance against climate change uncertainty.
* There are advantages to Australia acting early if emission pricing expands gradually across the world: economies that defer action face higher long-term costs, as global investment is redirected to early movers.
* Australia's aggregate economic costs of mitigation are small, although the costs to sectors and regions vary. Growth in emission-intensive sectors slows and growth in low- and negative-emission sectors accelerates.
* Allocation of some free permits to emission-intensive trade-exposed sectors, as the Government proposes, eases their transition to a low-emission economy in the initial years.
* Broadly based market-oriented policies, such as emissions trading, allow the market to respond as new information becomes available.<ref name='low'/>

==White Paper==
The White Paper was released on 15 December 2008.<ref name="whitepaper">{{cite web 
|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/report/index.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/102841/20090728-0000/www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/report/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2009 |title=White Paper |work=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia's Low Pollution Future |publisher=Department of Climate Change |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2008}}</ref> The White Paper included the Rudd Labor government's targets for Greenhouse gas emission reductions, 5% below 2000 by 2020 on a unilateral basis or up to 15% below 2000 by 2020 if also agreed by the other major emitters. This compares to the 25 to 40% cut compared to 1990 emissions recommended by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] as needing to be made by developed countries to keep CO<sub>2</sub> below 450 ppm and to have a reasonable chance of keeping global warming at less than a 2-degree Celsius increase above pre-industrial times.

The White Paper also set an indicative national emissions trajectory for the first few years of the scheme:<ref name="whitepaper"/>
* in 2010–11, 109% of 2000 levels;
* in 2011–12, 108% of 2000 levels;
* in 2012–13, 107% of 2000 levels.
For comparison, in 2006, Australia's emissions were 104% of 2000 levels (under Kyoto accounting).<ref>[http://www.climatechange.gov.au/inventory/index.html Australia's National Greenhouse Accounts].

===Criticism===
[[Image:ClimateSummitParliament.jpg|thumb|Climate Summit protest against CPRS and other climate change issues]]
The national Climate Action Summit of 500 participants representing 140 climate groups Australia wide has condemned the CPRS and agreed to campaign to prevent it becoming law. Major concerns included announced targets, granting of property rights to pollute and providing free permits to major polluters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatesummit.org.au/campaignstrategyanddevelopmentstreamoutcomes|title=Summit Outcomes|accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref> Summit participants were joined by 2,000 other people in surrounding parliament house to express dissatisfaction with the Rudd Government climate change policies.

====Criticism of the targets====
Several organisations criticised the choice of emission reduction targets in the CPRS. Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wilderness Society and the Climate Institute were joined by the Greens and other environmentalists in calling for more ambitious 2020 targets of 25 to 45 per cent reductions.<ref>{{cite news

Professor Barry Brook, the Director of the Research Institute for Climate Change and Sustainability at the University of Adelaide, stated that "the 14% cut in our total emissions by 2020 announced today is such a pitifully inadequate attempt to stop dangerous climate change that we may as well wave the white flag now."<ref name="asmc">{{cite web

Dr Regina Betz, Joint Director of the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets at UNSW, stated "The proposed 2020 targets of emission reductions of 5 to 15% are, according to the climate science, entirely inadequate for an equitable global response to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous global warming]]."<ref name="asmc"/>
Dr Frank Jotzo, deputy director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, and former advisor to the Garnaut Climate Change Review, said "ruling out a 25% reduction is a mistake, since Australia's overwhelming interest is strong global climate action. An international agreement with deep cuts has just become a little bit more unlikely, as a result of Australia not putting a compatible offer on the table" and "the Treasury modelling has shown that even deep cuts won't carry big economic costs for Australia, if the policies are sound."<ref name="asmc"/>

====Industry criticism====
Australian industrialists were concerned about cost impacts. Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry chief executive Peter Anderson said his members were "apprehensive" about the scheme because it was "too risky" and warned the costs would be borne not only by emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries but also by "small and medium businesses through higher energy costs and the flow-on from restructuring of larger industries".<ref name="rentseekersreview">{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24805156-643,00.html |title=Business leaders fear extra instability from carbon cuts |first=Cath |last=Hart |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2008 |newspaper=The Australian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106055205/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24805156-643,00.html |archive-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said the scheme was "a big ask and will have a big impact on the Australian economy" and estimated it would add about $7 billion to business costs by 2010.<ref name="rentseekersreview"/>

====Other criticism====
Other sources of criticism included concerns over coverage of agriculture, impacts on the minerals sector and implications for international agreements. Dr Hugh Saddler, Managing Director of Energy Strategies Pty Ltd, stated "the white paper does not include measures to reduce emissions from the major non-energy sectors such as agriculture and land clearing. While it is a good decision not to include these emission sources within the CPRS, it is essential that there be other strong programs specifically directed at these sectors."<ref name="asmc"/>
[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Mitch_Hooke Mitch Hooke], the head of the [[Minerals Council of Australia]], said his organisation was "profoundly disappointed that the white paper was not better aligned with progress towards a global agreement on reduction commitments, new low emissions technologies and emissions trading schemes in other countries"<ref name="rentseekersreview"/> South Africa's environment minister, [[Marthinus Van Schalkwyk]], described the scheme as an inadequate "opening bid", and warned that it is not "nearly good enough to bring developing countries to the table".<ref>{{cite news

Professor [[Ross Garnaut]], previously an adviser to the Government on climate change, 'damned' the Rudd Government's carbon policy because of the gross over-compensation of coal-fired electricity generators; the possibility of taking 25% emission reduction targets off the table when they are in Australia's best interest; the lack of a principled basis for support of trade-exposed industries and the potential threat to public finances of the proposed compensation to industry.<ref>{{cite news

==May 2009 changes==
On 4 May 2009, the government announced a number of modifications to the proposed Scheme, including a delayed start, a deeper conditional target (25% by 2020, in the event of a global agreement aiming at 450 ppm), more assistance for industry, and a "carbon trust" to enable voluntary action by households.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/wong/2009/mr20090504.html |title=New measures for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme |publisher=Environment.gov.au |accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref>

==November 2009 changes==
There were a number of significant changes made to the scheme in November 2009 after Malcolm Turnbull negotiated with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These changes included large increases in compensation for polluting industries, including the coal and aluminium smelting industries. $4 billion was proposed for the manufacturing sector and $1.5 billion was proposed for electricity generators.

==Withdrawal of bill==
On 30 November 2009, the Senate failed to pass the CPRS (Senate Hansard page 9602), giving Kevin Rudd a potential reason for calling a [[double dissolution]] election.<ref>{{cite news

On 27 April 2010, the Prime Minister Rudd announced that the Government had decided to delay the implementation of the CPRS until after the current commitment period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (which ended in 2012).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/media/whats-new/cprs-delayed.aspx |title=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme  |publisher=Australian Government Department of Climate Change and Energy |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010 }}</ref> The Government cited the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay. The Prime Minister announced that the CPRS would be introduced only when there was greater clarity on the actions of other major economies including the US, China and India.

In June 2010, the [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts]], [[Peter Garrett]], told [[Sky News Australia]] that he first learned of the scrapping of the CPRS when he read about it in a newspaper after it was [[news leak|leak]]ed by a Government source.<ref>{{cite news
