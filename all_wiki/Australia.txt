Until the early 19th century, Australia was best known as "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]", a name first applied by the Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] in 1644 (as ''Nieuw-Holland'') and subsequently anglicised. ''Terra Australis'' still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.{{refn|For instance, the 1814 work ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''.|group="N"}} The name ''Australia'' was popularised by the explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], who said it was "more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth".<ref>Flinders, Matthew (1814). ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''. G. and W. Nicol.</ref> Several famous early cartographers also made use of the word Australia on maps. [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1512–1594) used the phrase ''climata {{not a typo|australia}}'' on his double cordiform map of the world of 1538, as did [[Gemma Frisius]] (1508–1555), who was Mercator's teacher and collaborator, on his own cordiform wall map in 1540.

The first time that ''Australia'' appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58549315 |title=Who Named Australia? |newspaper=The Mail (Adelaide, SA)|location=Adelaide|date=11 February 1928 |accessdate=14 February 2012 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the [[Colonial Office]] that it be formally adopted.<ref>Weekend Australian, 30–31 December 2000, p. 16</ref> In 1824, the [[Admiralty]] agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Department of Immigration and Citizenship |title=Life in Australia |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2007 |page=11 |isbn=978-1-921446-30-6 |url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/values/book/english/lia_english_part1.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017070336/http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/values/book/english/lia_english_part1.pdf |archive-date=17 October 2009 }}</ref> The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of ''The Australia Directory'' by the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|Hydrographic Office]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=P5m4zNxaaSUC&pg=PA40&dq=the+australia+directory+1830+name#v=onepage&q=the%20australia%20directory%201830%20name Brian J.

Colloquial names for Australia include "[[Name of Australia#Oz|Oz]]" and "the Land Down Under" (usually shortened to just "[[Down Under]]"). Other epithets include "the Great Southern Land", "[[the Lucky Country]]", "the Sunburnt Country", and "the Wide Brown Land". The latter two both derive from [[Dorothea Mackellar]]'s 1908 poem "[[My Country]]".<ref>[http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins/w Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608152641/http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins/w |date=8 June 2017 }}, ANU</ref>

=== States and territories ===
{{Main|States and territories of Australia}}
[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|A map of Australia's states and territories]]

Australia has six states—[[New South Wales]] (NSW), [[Queensland]] (QLD), [[South Australia]] (SA), [[Tasmania]] (TAS), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC) and [[Western Australia]] (WA)—and two major mainland territories—the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT). In most respects, these two territories function as states, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s122.html |title=COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT – SECT 122 Government of territories |publisher=[[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] }}</ref>

Under the constitution, the states essentially have [[Plenary power|plenary legislative power]] to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]]. For example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-government/state-and-territory-government|title=State and Territory Government|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=23 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112011823/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-government/state-and-territory-government|archive-date=12 November 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.<ref>[[Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution, section 109]].</ref> In addition, the Commonwealth has the [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|power to levy income tax]] which, coupled with the [[Section 96 of the Constitution of Australia|power to make grants to States]], has given it the financial means to incentivise States to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the Commonwealth does not have legislative power.

Each state and major mainland territory has its own [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]—[[unicameralism|unicameral]] in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the [[Legislative Assembly]] (the [[House of Assembly]] in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the [[Legislative council|Legislative Council]]. The [[head of government|head of the government]] in each state is the [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] and in each territory the [[Chief Minister]]. The Queen is represented in each state by a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]]; and in the Northern Territory, the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/administrator.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430111225/http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/administrator.shtml|archive-date=30 April 2013|publisher=Government House Northern Territory|title=Role of the Administrator|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2|publisher=Governor–General of the Commonwealth of Australia|title=Governor-General's Role|accessdate=30 March 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804130529/http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2| archive-date = 4 August 2008}}</ref>

Between 1788 and the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the [[Anglo-Celtic Australians|British Isles]] (principally [[English Australians|England]], [[Irish Australians|Ireland]] and [[Scottish Australians|Scotland]]), although there was significant immigration from [[Chinese Australians|China]] and [[German Australians|Germany]] during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a [[Post-war immigration to Australia|large wave of immigration]] from across [[European Australians|Europe]], with many more immigrants arriving from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] than in previous decades.

Before European settlement, the animist beliefs of Australia's indigenous people had been practised for many thousands of years. Mainland Aboriginal Australians' spirituality is known as the [[Dreamtime]] and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. [[Indigenous Australian art|Aboriginal art]], story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. The spirituality and customs of [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s790117.htm |title=Indigenous Traditions – Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=14 December 1999 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>

Since the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] of British ships in 1788, Christianity has become the major religion practised in Australia. Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia. For much of Australian history, the [[Church of England]] (now known as the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]) was the largest religious denomination, with a large [[Roman Catholic]] minority. However, multicultural immigration has contributed to a steep decline in its relative position since the [[Second World War]]. Similarly, [[Islam in Australia|Islam]], [[Buddhism in Australia|Buddhism]], [[Hinduism in Australia|Hinduism]], [[Sikhism in Australia|Sikhism]] and [[History of the Jews in Australia|Judaism]] have all grown in Australia over the past half-century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/CO-61?opendocument&navpos=620|title=2011 Census reveals Hinduism as the fastest growing religion in Australia|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>
