'''''The StarPhoenix''''' is a daily [[newspaper]] that serves [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, and is a part of [[Postmedia Network]]. The ''StarPhoenix'' puts out six editions each week and publishes one weekly, ''Bridges''. It is also part of the canada.com [[Web portal]].

== History ==
The ''StarPhoenix'' was first published as '''''The Saskatoon Phoenix''''' on October 17, 1902 (following a short-lived attempt at a local newspaper, the ''Saskatoon Sentinel''). In 1909, it became a daily paper and, in 1910, was renamed the '''''Saskatoon Capital'''''.

The paper was sold and bought several times between its inception and the 1920s, at one point being owned by [[W. F. Herman]], the future owner and publisher of the ''[[Windsor Star]]''.<ref name=NYTimes>[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/01/17/issue.html "W. F. Herman, Editor of the Windsor Star,"] ''The New York Times'' (Jan. 17, 1938).</ref>

By 1927, there were two daily papers in Saskatoon: the ''Saskatoon Daily Star'' and the ''Daily Phoenix''. In January 1928, both papers were bought by the Sifton family of [[Winnipeg]] and amalgamated into the ''Saskatoon Star-Phoenix''. In the early 1980s the spelling of the newspaper name was modified to ''StarPhoenix''. Between the 1928 amalgamation and the launch of the Saskatoon edition of ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' in April 2012, the ''StarPhoenix'' was the city's only daily newspaper.

In 1996, the ''StarPhoenix'' was bought by the Hollinger newspaper chain. It was subsequently sold to [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications]] in 2000 and became part of the [[Postmedia Network|Southam Newspapers]] division now called [[Postmedia News|CanWest News Service]]. CanWest was acquired by Postmedia News, Inc. and is the current owner of ''The StarPhoenix''.

In 2015, the StarPhoenix press began printing the ''[[Regina Leader-Post]]'' in addition to its own print edition, after the Regina press was shut down.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Leader-Post to stop printing its newspaper in Regina|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/leader-post-to-stop-printing-its-newspaper-in-regina-1.3259881|access-date=2017-12-05|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2015-10-06}}</ref>
