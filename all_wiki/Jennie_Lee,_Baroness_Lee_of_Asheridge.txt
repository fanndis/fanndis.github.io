'''Janet Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge''', [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] [[Royal Academy of Arts|HonFRA]] (3 November 1904 – 16 November 1988), known as '''Jennie Lee''', was a Scottish politician. She was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament from [[1929 North Lanarkshire by-election|a by-election in 1929]] until [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] and then from [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] to [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]].

As Minister for the Arts in [[Harold Wilson]]'s government of 1964–1970, she played a leading role in the foundation of the [[Open University]]  working directly with Harold Wilson to establish the principle of open access: Enrolment as a student of the University should be open to everyone … irrespective of educational qualifications, and no formal entrance requirement should be imposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/historyofou/story/1963-65-the-university-the-air|title=Featured articles Betty Boothroyd Baroness Boothroyd was Chancellor of The Open University from 1995 to 2006.

She was married to the Welsh Labour politician [[Aneurin Bevan]] from 1934 until his death in 1960.

==Early life==
Born in [[Lochgelly]], in [[Fife]], to Euphemia Grieg and James Lee, a miner who held the post of fire and safety officer,<ref name="Hollis, Patricia 2014">Hollis, Patricia (2014).

She inherited her father's socialist inclinations, and like him joined the Scottish [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libraryarchive.open.ac.uk/ead/html/gb-2315-jl-p1.shtml|title=LibraryServices|website=libraryarchive.open.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002032222/http://libraryarchive.open.ac.uk/ead/html/gb-2315-jl-p1.shtml|archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> Her grandfather Michael Lee, born in 1850 to Irish Catholic parents, was a friend of [[Keir Hardie]], a disputes secretary of the miners' union and founder of the [[Fifeshire]] ILP federation.<ref>Matthew Brown, [http://www.independentlabour.org.uk/main/2013/04/24/ilp120-jennie-lee-%E2%80%93-a-child-of-the-ilp/ "ILP@120: Jennie Lee – A Child of the ILP"], Independent Labour Publications, 24 April 2013.</ref> She later joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and served as an MP from 1929 to 1931 and from 1945 to 1970.

==Education==
Lee was educated at [[Beath High School]] and was [[Valedictorian|dux]] of the school in her final year.<ref name="Hollis, Patricia 2014"/> The [[Carnegie Trust]], Fife County Council and the Fife Education Authority agreed to pay her university fees and she attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] as a student teacher.<ref name="Hollis, Patricia 2014"/> She later won a bursary to study law.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/l/jennielee.html "Jennie Lee"], Undiscovered Scotland.</ref>

At university she joined the Labour Club, the [[Edinburgh University Women's Union]] and the editorial board of the student newspaper. One of her first campaigns was to elect [[Bertrand Russell]] as [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh|Rector of the University]]. After graduating initially in 1927 with a [[MA (Scotland)|MA]], a [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] and a [[teaching certificate]], she worked as a teacher in [[Cowdenbeath]].

== First term as MP ==
Lee was adopted as the ILP candidate for the [[North Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Lanarkshire]] constituency, which she won at a [[1929 North Lanarkshire by-election|1929 by-election]], becoming the youngest woman<ref name=":1" /> member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. At the time of the by-election, women under the age of 30 were not yet able to vote.<ref name="Hollis, Patricia 2014"/> She was re-elected at the subsequent [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]].

In Westminster she immediately came into conflict with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s leadership in the commons.  She insisted on being sponsored by [[Robert Smillie]] and her old friend [[James Maxton]] to be introduced to the Commons, rather than by the leadership's preferred choice of sponsors. Lee also associated with [[Ellen Wilkinson]].<ref name=":1" />

Lee's first speech was an attack on the budget proposals of [[Winston Churchill]] (accusing him "of 'cant, corruption, and incompetence', her gestures more fitting to the storming of platforms than the measured tones expected from a young MP in the house")<ref>Kathryn Perera, [http://labourlist.org/2010/11/the-labour-party-or-nothing-jennie-lee/ "The Labour Party or nothing: Jennie Lee"], History of labour women, Labour List, 22 November 2010.</ref> that met even with his approval, with him offering his congratulations after their exchange in the Commons. Lee forged a parliamentary reputation as a left-winger, allying herself to Maxton and the other ILP members.  She was totally opposed to [[Ramsay MacDonald|Ramsay MacDonald's]] decision to form a coalition [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], and in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] lost her seat in parliament to [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] candidate [[William Anstruther-Gray, Baron Kilmany|William Anstruther-Gray]].

==Out of the Commons==
In her private life at the time she had formed a close relationship with fellow Labour MP [[Edward Frank Wise]], a married man who considered divorcing his wife for Lee, but who did not do so in the end. Wise died in 1933 and the following year Lee married the left-wing Welsh Labour MP [[Aneurin Bevan]], with whom she remained until his death in 1960. Her biography suggests that she to some extent suppressed her own career after marriage and that 'Jennie's suppression of her own career was the more remarkable precisely because as a woman in politics she had always laid claim to a 'male' life, public, itinerant and unencumbered by family responsibilities'.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=Patricia|title=Jennie Lee : a life|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0192881051|pages=Preface}}</ref>  And she was herself supported by her mother.<ref name=":1" /> She had no history in the women's movement and did not align herself with  the separate women's branches within the Labour Party, and stated that she voted on policy not candidate gender <ref name=":1" /> believing that equality for women would follow from the introduction of true socialism; it was not a separate cause.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perera|first1=Kathryn|title=The Labour Party or nothing: Jennie Lee|url=http://labourlist.org/2010/11/the-labour-party-or-nothing-jennie-lee/|website=History of Labour Women|publisher=Labour List|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref> Nonetheless she practised feminism 'of a sort' and was known to walk out of dinner parties if it was expected that women were to withdraw to another room when the port was circulated.<ref name="auto"/>

Despite being out of the Commons Lee remained active politically, trying to secure British support for the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Spanish Popular Front]] government under threat from [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. She also remained active inside the ILP and took their side in their split from the Labour Party, a decision that did not meet with her husband's approval.  She attempted re-election in North Lanarkshire at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], coming second behind [[William Anstruther-Gray, Baron Kilmany|Anstruther-Gray]] but ahead of the Labour Party's candidate. Attending the Labour Party Conference in Edinburgh in 1936, Lee met the Spanish Republican delegates who attended with a petition for support against the fascists, including meeting with [[Isabel Oyarzábal Smith|Isabel de Valencia]], who had a Scottish mother.  Lee went to Spain herself in 1937 to report as a war journalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_9XvI6FzQIkEyM8qvQCt0fPh_wEZb25v6vn-hGUydE/edit|title=Exhibition labels – Conectando|last=Item 57|date=20 June 2019|website=Conectando Exhibition labels|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>  She travelled in Aragon and Barcelona with [[George Orwell]] and the teenage grandson of her Commons sponsor, [[Robert Smillie]], MP, while reporting for ''New Leader'' and they were all caught up in some violent incidents. Young [[Robert Smillie|Bob]] died a year later in a Communist prison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jennie Lee: A Life|last=Hollis|first=Patricia|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2014}}</ref>  Lee attended a torchlit parade of the British Battalion of the [[International Brigades]] volunteers at [[Mondéjar (DO)|Modejar]] with [[Clement Attlee]] and others in the Labour Party, during the war.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Voices from the Spanish Civil War : personal recollections of Scottish volunteers in Republican Spain, 1936–39|publisher=Polygon|others=MacDougall, Ian, 1933–|year=1986|isbn=0948275197|location=Edinburgh [Lothian]|pages=149|oclc=18835004}}</ref>

She was again unsuccessful in seeking re-election as an "Independent Labour" candidate in a [[1943 Bristol Central by-election|1943 by-election]] at [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]], being defeated by the Conservative [[Violet Bathurst, Lady Apsley|Lady Apsley]] and opposed by the ILP. She also worked as a journalist for the [[Daily Mirror]].

==Re-election==
She later returned to the Labour Party from the ILP, and at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] she was once again elected to the Commons, this time to represent the [[Cannock (UK Parliament constituency)|Cannock]] constituency in [[Staffordshire]]. She remained a convinced left-winger, and this brought her sometimes into opposition with her husband, with whom she usually agreed politically. Lee was critical of Bevan for his support of the UK acquiring a [[nuclear deterrent]], something she did not support.

She was appointed as the first [[Minister for the Arts]] in [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] government of 1964, and played a key role in the formation of the [[Open University]],<ref>Kenneth O'Morgan, [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/politics-jennie-and-the-awkward-squad-1292834.html "Politics: Jennie and the awkward squad"], ''The Independent'', 8 November 1997.</ref> an act described by Wilson as the greatest of his time in government.

==Role in the foundation of the Open University==
The Open University was based on the idea of a 'University of the Air'. It was intended as a correspondence university reaching out to those who had been denied the opportunity to study. Lee produced a [[White Paper]] in 1966 outlining university plans, which would deliver courses by correspondence and broadcasting as teaching media. Prime minister [[Harold Wilson]] was an enthusiastic supporter because he envisioned The Open University as a major marker in the Labour Party's commitment to modernising British society. He believed that it would help build a more competitive economy while also promoting greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. The planned utilisation of television and radio to broadcast its courses was also supposed to link The Open University to the technological revolution underway, which Wilson saw as a major ally of his modernisation schemes. However, from the start Lee encountered widespread scepticism and even opposition from within and without the Labour Party, including senior officials in the DES; her departmental boss, [[Anthony Crosland]]; the Treasury; Ministerial colleagues, such as [[Richard Crossman]]; and commercial broadcasters. The Open University was realised due to Lee's unflagging determination and tenacity in 1965–67, the steadfast support from Wilson, and the fact that the anticipated costs, as reported to Lee and Wilson by Arnold Goodman, seemed very modest. By the time the actual, much higher costs became apparent, it was too late to scrap the fledgling Open University.<ref>Pete Dorey,  "‘Well, Harold Insists on Having It!’—The Political Struggle to Establish The Open University, 1965–67." Contemporary British History 29#2 (2015): 241–272.</ref>

The university was granted its [[Royal Charter]] by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 23 April 1969.<ref name="Hollis, Patricia 2014"/> Applications opened in 1970 and the first students began their studies in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robbins Committee and Open University|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/robbins-committee-open-university.htm|website=The Cabinet Papers|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>

In 1973, as she laid the foundation stone for the first Open University library, she described the University as :'a great independent university which does not insult any man or any women whatever their background by offering them the second best, nothing but the best is good enough.'<ref>{{cite web|title=Jennie Lee|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/historyofou/story/jennie-lee|website=About the OU|publisher=Open University,UK|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>

==Role in the expansion of the Arts Council==

[[File:Foundation plaque at Birmingham Repertory Theatre - 2013-11-19 - Andy Mabbett.jpg|thumb|Foundation stone at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]], laid by lee on 25 October 1969]]

Lee renewed the charter of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] in 1967 which saw an expansion of its work in the regions as well of the creation of the new arts institutions at London's [[South Bank Centre]]. She also introduced the only UK [[White Paper]] for the Arts to be published for the next half-century<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-arts-white-paper-no-direction-home Analysis of 2016 Arts White Paper, editorial, ''The Guardian'' 27 March 2016 ]</ref> and following the 1967 reshuffle was promoted to [[Minister of State]] at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department of Education and Science]] after two years as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]]. Between 1964 and 1965 Lee had been [[Parliamentary Secretary]] at the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Public Building and Works]].

==Retirement and later life==
[[File:Jennie Lee Building at Open University Campus in Milton Keynes, spring 2013 (1).JPG|thumb|Jennie Lee Building at Open University Campus in Milton Keynes, spring 2013 (1)]]Lee was defeated at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] election in [[Cannock]] by the Conservative candidate [[Patrick Cormack]]. Political scientist [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] called Lee's loss of her seat, which had been held by Labour since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]], on a well above average swing of 10.7% "the biggest upset" of the 1970 general election.<ref name="TimesGuide1970Rose">{{cite book |author1=Richard Rose |author-link1=Richard Rose (political scientist) |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd |location=London |page=31 |chapter=Voting Trends Surveyed}}</ref> She retired from front-line politics when she was made '''Baroness Lee of Asheridge''', of the [[City of Westminster]] on 5 November 1970.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=45229 |date=10 November 1970 |page=12333}}</ref>

A community resource centre in [[Wednesfield]], which formed part of Lee's Cannock constituency, was named the "Jennie Lee Centre" in her honour. It opened in a former secondary school in 1989, the year after Lee's death, and closed in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/01/15/former-wednesfield-school-is-demolished-to-make-way-for-homes/|title=Former Wednesfield school is demolished to make way for homes|work=[[Express and Star]]|place=Wolverhampton|date=15 January 2014|accessdate= 20 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, the Students' Association of the newly created [[Adam Smith College]] in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]] refused to name themselves after [[Adam Smith]], and instead chose the name "Jennie Lee Students' Association".
