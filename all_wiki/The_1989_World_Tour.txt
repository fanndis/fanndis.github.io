'''The 1989 World Tour''' was the fourth [[concert tour]] by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], in support of her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). Swift announced the tour's first dates in North America, Europe, Japan, and Ocenia in November and December 2014. She announced additional dates for Singapore and China in June 2015, and a final announcement of the third show in [[Melbourne]] was made in July 2015.

The tour took seven months to plan to plan before three months of rehearsals. As with her previous tours, Swift was involved in the tour's planning and stage design. She aimed to create an intimate experience for concertgoers, which she found challenging for shows held in stadiums. The [[set list]] included songs predominantly taken from ''1989'', with additional songs from Swift's older albums transformed into a more [[synthesizer|synth]]-oriented production. For different shows, she incorporated a random song from her back catalog. The tour began on May 5, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan, and concluded on December 12, 2015, in Melbourne, Australia, running 85 shows. For many of the shows, Swift invited special guests onstage with her including musicians, actors/actresses, athletes, and models whom the media called her "squad".

The world's highest-grossing tour of 2015, the 1989 World Tour sold over 2.278&nbsp;million tickets and grossed over US$250.7&nbsp;million. It was acclaimed by critics, receiving praise for Swift's stage presence and connection with the audience. Swift's appearances with an array of special guests, meanwhile, attracted commentary regarding her new image as a pop star—having been known as a [[country music|country]] singer-songwriter—and her sense of authenticity that she had maintained. On December 20, 2015, Swift released a [[concert film]] entitled ''The 1989 World Tour Live'' in partnership with [[Apple Music]]. It was filmed at the November 28, 2015 show at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] in Sydney, Australia, and features additional scenes of special guests from other shows throughout North America and Europe.

[[Taylor Swift]] released her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', on October 27, 2014.

In a November 2014 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Swift said that the [[set list]] would primarily consist of songs from ''1989''.

The shows featured a nearly identical set list, with the exception of "You Are in Love" (a ''1989'' deluxe album track), and different shows had different guest stars intertwined between Swift's performances. The concert began with black-and-white projections of skyscrapers, which subsequently served as the backdrop to the performance of "[[Welcome to New York (song)|Welcome to New York]]".<ref name="SunSentinel"/> Swift them emerged from beneath the stage to sing "Welcome to New York", and subsequently "[[New Romantics (song)|New Romantics]]", surrounded by a dozen of male dancers.<ref name="SunSentinel"/><ref name="SMH"/> For the followup performance of "[[Blank Space]]", Swift sang the song while her dancers were hidden under shadowboxes, before erupting into a [[call-and-response]] climax where Swift stroke a golf club against a black lacquer cane.<ref name="RS"/><ref name="Vulture">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/live-review-taylor-swift-delivers-in-new-jersey.html|title=Live Review: Taylor Swift Is the Cheer Captain of the Universe|first=Lindsay|last=Zoladz|date=2015-07-11|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=2020-12-02}}</ref><ref name="Dallas"/> Swift proceeded with an [[industrial rock]]-oriented version of "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]", which she performed as the shirtless male dancers performed a sensual choreography.<ref name="RS"/><ref name="Vulture"/><ref name="Caramanica"/>

For different shows, Swift replaced "You Are in Love" with "Wonderland", another ''1989'' deluxe album track,<ref name="Wonderland"/> or songs from her earlier albums. The songs included "[[Should've Said No]]" (from 2006's ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'');<ref name="Riff"/> "[[You Belong with Me]]",<ref name="Belong"/> "[[Fifteen (song)|Fifteen]]"<ref name="Fifteen"/> and "[[Fearless (Taylor Swift song)|Fearless]]" (from 2008's ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'');<ref name="Fearless"/> "[[Mean (song)|Mean]]",<ref name="Mean"/> "[[Sparks Fly (song)|Sparks Fly]]"<ref name="Sparks"/> and "[[Mine (Taylor Swift song)|Mine]]" (from 2010's ''[[Speak Now]]'');<ref name="Mine"/> "Holy Ground",<ref name="Ground"/> "[[All Too Well]]"<ref name="Well"/> and "[[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]]" (from 2012's ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'').<ref name="Red"/> During the second show in [[Santa Clara, California]] on August 15, 2015, Swift dedicated "Never Grow Up" (from 2010's ''Speak Now'') to her godson, the second child of her friend, actress [[Jaime King]].<ref name="Grow"/>

A feature of the 1989 World Tour that attracted media attention was its array of unannounced special guests that Swift invited onstage with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/why-taylor-swift-brings-special-guests/|title=This Is Why Taylor Swift Brings Surprise Guests Onstage|work=Taste of Country|first=Laura|last=McCleallan|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}</ref> Swift explained during an interview with [[Apple Music]]'s Beats 1 Radio that, since her fans could have expected what the show would look like through social media posts prior to attending, she wanted to incorporate an element of surprise.

As the tour went on, special guests ranged from Hollywood actress [[Julia Roberts]] to counterculture figure [[Joan Baez]].<ref name="bbclevine"/> The [[BBC]] observed that while these special guests were well appreciated by Swift's fans, it gave the impression to others that Swift did so to prove her star power of her new image as a pop star—having abandoned her previous image as a country artist.<ref name="bbclevine"/> In doing so, Swift's sense of authenticity began to slip while her global fame continued to expand.<ref name="bbclevine"/> Kristy Fairclough, a professor in popular culture and film, commented: Her shifting aesthetic and allegiances appear confusing in an overall narrative that presents Taylor Swift as the centre of the cultural universe. She has often presented an underdog status, but for all of the qualities that make audiences root for her, there are others that make them question her – and these are ones that she can't easily shift away from. As a globally famous, attractive, thin, white, very wealthy woman, she is a profoundly unsympathetic underdog."<ref name="bbclevine"/> When the tour ended, Swift acknowledged that "people might need a break from [her]".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Maryn|last=Wilkinson|date=2017|title=Taylor Swift: the hardest working, zaniest girl in show business|journal=Celebrity Studies|doi=10.1080/19392397.2019.1630160|pages=441–444|volume=10|issue=3|doi-access=free}}</ref>

<!--It was released and is listed by Apple Music as a concert film, not a live album.-->
'''''The 1989 World Tour Live''''' is a concert film by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on December 20, 2015, exclusively via [[Apple Music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taylorswift.com/news/265083 |title=The 1989 World Tour Live Coming to Apple Music |publisher=taylorswift.com |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> Directed by [[Jonas Åkerlund]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6813932/taylor-swift-1989-tour-film-wildest-dreams-karlie-kloss-video|title=Taylor Swift's 1989 Tour Film Is Here: Watch 'Wildest Dreams' and a Behind-the-Scenes Video|work=Billboard  |date=December 20, 2015 |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref> the film follows the [[Sydney]] stop of Swift's fourth headlining concert tour, The 1989 World Tour. The show, which was attended by 75,980 fans, remains Swift's most attended concert to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/taylor-swift-26-birthday-1989-concert-film |title=Taylor Swift Announces Release of 1989 Concert Film |work=People |date=December 13, 2015 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/current-boxscore |title=Billboard Boxscore :: Current Scores |date=November 10, 2015 |work=Billboard |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6cwTD0cl1 |archivedate=November 10, 2015 |accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref>

Signs were displayed at the sold out [[Sydney]] concert on November 28, 2015 at [[ANZ Stadium]] which said "Today's events are being recorded and filmed for global streaming, and may also form part of a television program... for commercial and promotional purposes." Although there was no further information about what the filming was for at the time, there was speculation that it would form a DVD of the 1989 World Tour to be released once the tour concludes its run in [[Melbourne]] in late 2015. Later speculation involved an Apple Music Video launch, which was proved to be correct. Coincidentally, "All You Had To Do Was Stay" and "This Love" were added back into the show after having been left off the set list for several months. This makes the Sydney setlist identical to that of Tokyo when the tour premiered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tayloralisonswift111.blogspot.com/2020/02/taylor-alison-swift-taylor-alison-swift.html|title=The Real Reason There Were No Special Guests At Taylor Swift's Concert|author=Julia|date=November 28, 2015|work=[[2DayFM]]}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

On December 13, 2015—Swift's 26th birthday—she announced she had partnered with [[Apple Music]] to release a concert film entitled ''The 1989 World Tour Live'' in one weeks' time. It contains over two hours of concert, interview, and never-before seen backstage and rehearsal footage with some of the musical and surprise guests from previous shows. Celebrities making appearances in the film include [[Mick Jagger]], [[Jason Derulo]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Alison Krauss]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Natalie Maines]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], and [[Alanis Morissette]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-birthday-announces-1989-concert-film/ |title=Taylor Swift Birthday: Announces 1989 Concert Film |date=December 13, 2015 |website=People}}</ref> It was directed by [[Jonas Åkerlund]]. Clips from the film were later compiled for the music video for the seventh and final single from the album, "[[New Romantics (song)|New Romantics]]."

===Performances===
Eighteen songs, most of them from ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', were performed in the following order in the film:
