'''''Keeping Up with the Kardashians''''' (often abbreviated '''''KUWTK''''') is an American [[reality television]] series that airs on the [[E!]] cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the [[Kardashian family|Kardashian–Jenner]] [[Stepfamily|blended family]]. Its premise originated with [[Ryan Seacrest]], who also serves as an [[executive producer]]. The series debuted on October 14, 2007, and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians (season 18)|eighteenth season]] premiered on March 26, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video: E!'s "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" Moves to a New Night and Time Beginning Thursday, March 26 at 8:00PM ET/PT|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/video/2020/02/25/video-es-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-moves-to-a-new-night-and-time-beginning-thursday-march-26-at-800pm-et-pt-124312/20200225e01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> On February 27, Kris Jenner confirmed on the ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show|Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' that filming for the nineteenth season, which premiered on September 17, had begun.

The series focuses mainly on sisters [[Kim Kardashian|Kim]], [[Kourtney Kardashian|Kourtney]], and [[Khloé Kardashian|Khloé]] and their half-sisters [[Kendall Jenner|Kendall]] and [[Kylie Jenner|Kylie]]. It also features their parents [[Kris Jenner|Kris]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner|Caitlyn]], and brother [[Rob Kardashian|Rob]]. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend [[Scott Disick]], Kim's ex-husband [[Kris Humphries]], and current husband [[Kanye West]], Khloé's ex-husband [[Lamar Odom]], ex-boyfriend [[French Montana]], and ex-boyfriend [[Tristan Thompson]] along with Rob's ex-girlfriend [[Adrienne Bailon]] and ex-fiancé [[Blac Chyna]]. Caitlyn's son [[Brody Jenner]] made a cameo in season 1, before appearing regularly between the 8th and 11th seasons, along with brother [[Brandon & Leah#Brandon Jenner|Brandon]] and Brandon's wife [[Brandon & Leah#Leah Jenner|Leah]]. Kim's friend [[Jonathan Cheban]], the sisters’ maternal grandmother Mary-Jo “MJ”, and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.

''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' has been critically panned since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the "[[famous for being famous]]" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Will |title=7 TV Shows That May Be Lowering Your IQ |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/tv-shows-may-lowering-iq.html/?a=viewall |website=Cheatsheet.com |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=20 July 2016}}</ref> However, some critics recognized the reality series as a "[[guilty pleasure]]" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians '' has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several [[audience award]]s.

The series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, including: ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take Miami]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take New York]]'', ''[[Khloé & Lamar]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons]]'', ''[[Dash Dolls]]'', ''[[Rob & Chyna]]'', ''[[Life of Kylie]]'', and ''[[Flip It Like Disick]]''. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.

On September 8, 2020, the family announced via Instagram that the show will end in 2021, after 20 seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|last=White|first=Peter|date=2020-09-08|title=‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ To End In 2021 With Season 20|url=https://deadline.com/2020/09/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-to-end-2021-1234573102/|access-date=2020-09-09|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref>

The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In the early 2000s Kim worked as a personal assistant for hotel heiress and reality TV star, [[Paris Hilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/this-kim-kardashian-paris-hilton-timeline-explains-everything-about-their-tumultuous-friendship-8271056|title=This Kim Kardashian & Paris Hilton Timeline Explains Everything About Their Tumultuous Friendship |page=Bustle |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref> During her employment for Hilton, Kim briefly developed a very close friendship with Hilton during a high point in Hilton's fame. This friendship helped boost Kim's personal fame by allowing her to occasionally appear in episodes of Hilton's TV show ''[[The Simple Life]]''. Furthermore, Kim and Hilton's close friendship ensured that Kim would appear in public, notably in [[paparazzi]] shots, with Hilton. Kim also worked for several other celebrities in the early 2000s, further boosting her fame and connections.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.suggest.com/celebs/5202/9-celebs-that-were-once-kim-kardashians-bosses/|title=9 Celebs That Were Once Kim Kardashian's Bosses |page=Suggest |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref> Notably, in 2004, Kim became a personal stylist for singer [[Brandy Norwood]].

Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney ventured further into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique [[Dash (boutique)|Dash]] in [[Calabasas, California]]. Throughout Kim's early career, she was involved in some high-profile relationships including Brandy Norwood's brother, singer [[Ray J]], and later, singer [[Nick Lachey]].<ref name="KimBio">{{cite web |title=Kim Kardashian Biography |url=http://www.people.com/people/kim_kardashian/biography/ |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223224144/http://www.people.com/people/kim_kardashian/biography |url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2016}}</ref> In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, ''[[Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive]]''.<ref name="Announcement" />

The idea of creating a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/kris-jenner/#_ |url-status=live|title = Kris Jenner |first = Dimitri |last = Ehrlich |date = August 28, 2012 |work = [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120901091634/http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/kris-jenner |archive-date = September 1, 2012 }}</ref> Jenner commented: "Everybody thinks that [my children] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about.

He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: "They were all together—as crazy and as fun as loving as they are," Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with [[E!]], an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and [[reality television]] series; the show was eventually picked up.<ref name="creation" /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ryan-seacrest-talks-about-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians |title = Ryan Seacrest reveals how the Kardashian's landed a reality show |first = Alice |last = Howarth |accessdate = August 23, 2015 |date = January 20, 2015 |work = [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]] }}</ref> In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a "new non-scripted family [[sitcom]]", being produced by [[Ryan Seacrest Productions|Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Bunim/Murray Productions]].

The show, titled ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'', premiered on October 14, 2007.<ref name="2nd" /> The reality series centers around the members of the Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé.

Most of the Kardashian sisters' significant others have appeared on the reality series. Kim's relationship with football player [[Reggie Bush]] was featured on the early seasons of the show when they were dating; after the breakup, Bush commented on appearing on the show saying that he never felt comfortable being followed by cameras, adding: "I do it because it's important to [Kim]."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://people.com/celebrity/reggie-bush-on-relationship-hurdles-with-kim-kardashian/ |title = Reggie Bush on Relationship Hurdles with Kim Kardashian |work = People |first = Liza |last = Hamm |date = March 24, 2010 |accessdate = August 22, 2015 }}</ref> Rob's relationship with singer [[Adrienne Bailon]] has also been documented on the show when they were dating from 2007 to 2009; although Bailon later admitted that the decision to appear on the show, and be associated with the family, hurt her career.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-adrienne-bailon-rob-kardashian-feud-latina-kim-khloe-20140801-story.html |title = Adrienne Bailon's Rob Kardashian remarks have Kim's, Khloé's claws out |accessdate = August 22, 2015 |date = August 1, 2014 |first = Nardine |last = Saad |work = Los Angeles Times }}</ref> Kim's eventual husband [[Kris Humphries]] first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event".<ref name="weddingtimeline">{{cite web |accessdate = August 22, 2015 |url = http://www.mtv.com/news/1673479/kim-kardashian-kris-humphries-timeline/ |title = Kim Kardashian And Kris Humphries: A Timeline |date = October 31, 2011 |first = Jocelyn |last = Vena |publisher = [[MTV News]] }}</ref> They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a negative way and that the short-lived marriage was staged for the cameras as a ploy to generate money.<ref>{{cite web |last = Finn |first = Natalie |title = Kim Kardashian "Very Happy" With Apology From Blogger Who Called Her Marriage "Staged" |url = http://www.eonline.com/news/296078/kim-kardashian-very-happy-with-apology-from-blogger-who-called-her-marriage-staged |work = E!

==Spin-offs==
The success of the reality series resulted in the development of several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' titled ''Kourtney and Khloé in Miami'', which was later renamed ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take Miami]]''. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new [[Dash (boutique)|Dash]] boutique. [[Ted Harbert]], president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. "It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. […] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami," Harbert added.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate = August 21, 2015 |url = http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/e-adds-kardashians-lamases-roster-ratings-rise-111984/ |title = E!
