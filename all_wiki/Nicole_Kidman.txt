In 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of [[Virginia Woolf]] in [[Stephen Daldry]]'s ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', which stars [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Julianne Moore]].

The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE6DE113CF934A15751C1A9649C8B63|title= 'The Hours' (2002), FILM REVIEW; Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf?|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Award]], third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in ''[[Dogville]]'', by Danish director [[Lars von Trier]], was an [[experimental film]] set on a bare [[soundstage]].
