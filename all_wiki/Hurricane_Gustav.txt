'''Hurricane Gustav''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʊ|s|t|ɑː|v}}) was the second most destructive [[hurricane]] of the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The seventh [[tropical cyclone]], third [[hurricane]], and second major hurricane of the season, Gustav caused serious damage and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba and the United States. Gustav caused at least $8.31&nbsp;billion (2008&nbsp;USD) in damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20080914/HURBLOG/809149971?p=1&tc=pg |title=Jindal to survey local storm damage, asks Congress for hurricane-protection money |publisher=HoumaToday.com |accessdate=2015-06-05}}</ref>

<!--History-->It formed on the morning of August 25, 2008, about {{convert|260|mi|km}} southeast of [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on August 26. Later that day it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near the Haitian town of [[Jacmel]]. It inundated Jamaica and ravaged Western Cuba and then steadily moved across the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="AP">{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gVWjsPEiqe1tEu2mhBIRaxxGi8owD92SMF9O0|title=Gustav swells to dangerous Cat 3 storm off Cuba|last=Weissert|first=Will|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902005650/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gVWjsPEiqe1tEu2mhBIRaxxGi8owD92SMF9O0 |archive-date=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref name="CNN">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/08/30/gustav/index.html |title=Hurricane Gustav reaches Category 4 as it nears Cuba |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831200309/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/08/30/gustav/index.html |archive-date=August 31, 2008 }}</ref>

Once into the Gulf, Gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air. It weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on August 31, and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of September 1 near [[Cocodrie, Louisiana]].<ref name="GustavTCR">{{cite web|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL072008_Gustav}}|title= Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Gustav|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref> Weakening continued, and Gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central US.

==Meteorological history==
{{Main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Gustav}}
{{storm path|Gustav 2008 track.png}}
Gustav formed out of a [[tropical wave]] that had previously produced t-rain and [[squall]]s in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It developed well-defined [[Tropical Cyclone#Banding|curved bands]] and briefly exhibited an upper-level [[Eye (cyclone)|eye feature]]. The NHC designated it [[Tropical Depression]] Seven and dispatched a [[hurricane hunter]] aircraft to investigate the system.<ref name="disc001"/> At the time, the system had a well-defined [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant,<ref name="disc001"/><ref name="wndspd01">{{cite web

In the [[Cayman Islands]], a hurricane watch was issued at 6&nbsp;pm August 25 and upgraded that to a warning on 6&nbsp;pm August 27. Banks and non-essential government services were closed Friday to allow residents to prepare. Extra flights were organized to get tourists off the island and, per usual practice, further visits were banned until the All Clear was given. Stores and gas stations were busy and each district office offered free plywood to protect windows and residents hurried about to secure their business interests and property.

===United States===
On August 31, the NHC predicted with 45% probability that Gustav would remain at Category&nbsp;3 or above on September 1. This influenced preparations, although in fact Gustav had dropped just below the Category&nbsp;3 threshold to Category&nbsp;2 by landfall, and Category&nbsp;1 shortly afterwards. [[Direct Relief]], an emergency response organization, committed $250,000 in special hurricane response funds to assist nonprofit clinics, community health centers, and evacuation and shelter areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.directrelief.org/2008/09/direct-relief-makes-25000-available-u-s-gulf-coasts-medical-safety-net/|title=Direct Relief Makes $250,00 Available to U.S. Gulf Coast's Medical "Safety Net"|last=Hutain|first=Jenny|date=2008-09-01|website=Direct Relief|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>

On Saturday August 30, 2008, Gustav made landfall on mainland Cuba near the community of [[Los Palacios, Cuba|Los Palacios]] in Pinar del Río—a region that produces much of the [[tobacco]] used to make the nation's [[Cuban cigars#Cuban cigars|famed cigars]]. In Los Palacios some 7,000 homes were roofless and many with their walls collapsed. The rice and banana farms sustained much damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/RMOI-7J2MCB?OpenDocument&rc=2|title=Gustav leaves mass destruction in western Cuba|date=2008-08-31|author=Staff Writer for [[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref>

At least 300,000&nbsp;people were evacuated from Gustav's path as 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) winds toppled telephone poles and fruit trees, shattered windows and tore off the tin roofs of homes. Cuban authorities declared that Gustav is the worst hurricane to hit the country in 50&nbsp;years. Authorities called the storm damage the worst since 1956. The 211&nbsp;mph (341&nbsp;km/h) wind gusts registered in the city of [[Paso Real de San Diego]] were the highest in Cuba's history, according to the provincial newspaper, the ''[[Guerrillero (newspaper)|Guerrillero]]''. Winds were so strong that the weather station instruments broke.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/AP/story/667180.html|title=Cuba: Gustav the worst hurricane in 50 years|date=August 31, 2008|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref>  Gustav is considered Cuba's worst hurricane in 45&nbsp;years, the last hurricane that was worse than Gustav for Cuba was [[Hurricane Flora]] in 1963, which was the deadliest Cuban storm since the [[1932 Cuba Hurricane]].

Cuban Civil defense authorities initially stated that there were "many people injured" on Isla de la Juventud, an island of 87,000&nbsp;people south of the mainland. Nearly all the island's roads were washed out and some regions were heavily flooded.

By September 3, Cuba's President [[Raul Castro]] said that 20,000 of the 25,000 houses on Isla de la Juventud were damaged. More than 90,000 homes were damaged in the western province of Pinar del Río according to government news agency AIN. 3,306 tobacco houses were destroyed, with 906 tons of tobacco leaves wet. More than {{convert|32000|acre|km2}} of crops were ruined, including {{convert|7239|acre|km2}} of grain and nearly 1,500 of fruit. 42,000 cans of coffee were destroyed, and 3,100 tons of grapefruit lost. 930,000 chickens had to be euthanized.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robles |first=Francis |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/cuba/story/670254.html |title=Losses in Cuba from Gustav are enormous |date=2008-09-03 |publisher=Miami Herald |accessdate=2008-09-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The National Weather Service reported 14 confirmed tornadoes spun by Gustav from [[Biloxi]] to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].

In Mississippi, damage from Gustav was far less severe than that caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], with its 2005 storm surge of 27&nbsp;ft (7&nbsp;m); however, Gustav's storm surge was high as 15&nbsp;feet (4.5&nbsp;m) in places on the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]]. Sections of [[U.S. Route 90]] (including [[Gulfport, MS|Gulfport]] and Biloxi) were flooded and some houses were flooded.<ref name="CBS42">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs42.com/news/local/27762854.html |title=Authorities Report at least Seven Deaths Related to Gustav |last=Staff writer |date=2008-09-02 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070018/http://www.cbs42.com/news/local/27762854.html |archive-date=May 24, 2011 }}</ref> Two people from [[Metairie, Louisiana]] died near [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] in an automobile accident while evacuating from the storm.<ref name="KTBS">{{cite news

A fuller assessment of damage can be expected when more residents return to the coastal areas and further [[insurance claim]]s are filed.

====Florida====
The state of Florida was affected by both the Cuba landfall, with Gustav traveling past the [[Florida Keys]], and the Louisiana landfall (September 1), affecting the [[Florida panhandle]], with storm surge and outer band tornadoes and thunderstorms. Several tornado warnings were issued around the [[Pensacola]] area. Panhandle beaches had rip currents,<ref name=WKRGfla/> and officials in [[Pensacola Beach]] had been passing out pamphlets warning of deadly rip currents that could continue for days.<ref name="WKRGfla">

==Political implications==

===United States===
Hurricane Gustav was expected to make landfall near New Orleans almost exactly three years after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the same region. It also arrived in the midst of the campaign for the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential elections]] and during the week the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] was scheduled to start. The federal and state administrations, as well as the candidates for the 2008 presidential election were sensitive that Gustav was likely to remind U.S. voters of the [[Hurricane Katrina disaster relief|"botched response" by state and local municipalities and subsequent federal aid authorities]] to the earlier storm.<ref>{{cite news|last=Balz| first= Dan| title = The Hurricane In Question Is Still Called Katrina|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083102069.html| work = Washington Post | date = 2008-09-01|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

Louisiana's Congressional primary election, originally scheduled for September 6, was delayed to October 4, which then delayed the general election for two races that required a runoff vote to December 6, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2008/09/louisiana_primary_delayed_afte.html|title=Louisiana Primary Delayed After Hurricane|last=Pershing|first=Ben|date=2008-09-03|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref>

===Cuba===
[[Fidel Castro]] addressed in a "reflection," published on September 1 in the official daily ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]''. "Two days ago [[...]] out of 11 international press reports devoted to Cuba, none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our Civil Defense," Castro writes. Instead, the news services, "echoing a Yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against Cuba," reported about the defection of TV actor [[Yamil Jaled]]. (The "Yankee press organization" appears to be an allusion to ''[[El Nuevo Herald]]'', which broke the news of Jaled's arrival in Miami.) "What a patriot! What a democrat! What a brilliant example," wrote Castro. "This way, the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than Hurricane Gustav. They want to make a sacred cow out of him."<ref>{{cite web|last=Pérez Pizarro|first=Renata|title=Is Jaled 'newsier' than Gustav?, Fidel asks|url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/cuban_colada/2008/09/is-jaled-newsie.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|date=2008-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907045627/http://miamiherald.typepad.com/cuban_colada/2008/09/is-jaled-newsie.html|archive-date=September 7, 2008}}</ref>

==Retirement==
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the damage and deaths, on April 22, 2009, the name ''Gustav'' was retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. It will never again be used to name an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with [[Hurricane Gonzalo|Gonzalo]] which was first used in [[2014 Atlantic hurricane season|2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml|accessdate = September 4, 2011|date = April 22, 2009|title = Retired Hurricane Names Since 1954|publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref>
