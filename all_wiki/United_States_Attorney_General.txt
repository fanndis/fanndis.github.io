The '''United States attorney general''' ('''AG''') is the head of the [[United States Department of Justice]], the chief lawyer of the [[federal government of the United States]], and a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]].

Under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], the officeholder is nominated through the power of appointment by the [[President of the United States]], then appointed with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate]]. The attorney general is supported by the Office of the Attorney General, which includes executive staff and several deputies.

The 85th and current United States attorney general is [[William P. Barr]], appointed by [[Donald J. Trump]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/william-barr-confirmed.html|title=Senate Confirms William Barr as Attorney General |last=Fandos|first=Nicholas|date=2019-02-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-14|last2=Benner|first2=Katie|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|United States Department of Justice#History}}
[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] which, among other things, established the Office of the Attorney General. The original duties of this officer were "to prosecute and conduct all suits in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon [[questions of law]] when required by the president of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments".<ref>[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], section 35.</ref>  Some of these duties have since been transferred to the [[United States Solicitor General|solicitor general]] and the [[White House Counsel|White House counsel]].

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] was established in 1870 to support the attorneys general in the discharge of their responsibilities.

The attorney general, the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|secretary of the treasury]], and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] are generally regarded as the four most important [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials in the United States because of the size and importance of their respective departments.<ref>''Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch'' (1997). [[Congressional Quarterly]]. p. 87.</ref>

The title "Attorney General" is an example of a noun (''attorney'') followed by a [[postpositive adjective]] (''general'').<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Herz|first=Michael|date=2002|title=Washington, Patton, Schwarzkopf and ... Ashcroft?|url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/concomm/771|journal=Constitutional Commentary}}</ref> "General" is a description of the type of attorney, not a title or rank in itself ([[General officer|as it would be in the military]]).<ref name=":1" /> Even though the attorney general (and the similarly titled [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]]) is often referred to as "General" or "General [last name]" by senior government officials, this is considered incorrect in standard [[American English]] usage.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-116-whats-the-plural-form-of-attorney-general-and-what-is-the-plural-possessive/|title=LawProse Lesson #116: What’s the plural form of attorney general? And what is the plural possessive?|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|website=Above the Law|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> For the same reason, the correct American English plural form is "attorneys general" rather than "attorney generals."<ref name=":2" />

==Presidential transition==
It is the practice for the attorney general, along with the other Cabinet secretaries and high-level [[Political appointments in the United States|political appointees of the president]], to tender a resignation with effect on the [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]] (January 20) of a new president. The [[Deputy Attorney General of the United States|deputy attorney general]] is also expected to tender a resignation, but is commonly requested to stay on and act as Attorney General pending the [[Advice and consent#United States|confirmation by the Senate]] of the new attorney general.

For example, on the inauguration of President [[Donald Trump]] on January 20, 2017, the then-Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] left her position, so the then-Deputy Attorney General [[Sally Yates]], who had also tendered her resignation, was asked to stay on to serve as Acting Attorney General until the confirmation of the new attorney general [[Jeff Sessions]], who had been nominated for the office in November 2016 by then-[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Donald Trump.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-us-attorneys-233740|title=Trump will allow U.S. attorneys to stay past Friday |last=Gerstein |first=Josh |website=POLITICO |language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>{{Efn|Unusually for a transitional acting appointment, Yates was dismissed and replaced with another Acting Attorney General before Sessions was confirmed because she refused to defend an [[executive order]] of the incoming administration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/meet-the-acting-attorney-general-fired-by-trump-and-accused-of-betraying-the-justice-department/2017/01/30/05d4478c-e750-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html|title=Who is Sally Yates?
