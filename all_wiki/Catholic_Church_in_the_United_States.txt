{{Catholic Church by country}}
The '''Catholic Church in the United States''' is composed of ecclesiastical communities in [[Communion (religion)|full communion]] with the [[Holy See]]. With 23% of the United States population {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, the Catholic Church is the country's second largest religious grouping, after [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestantism]], and the country's largest church or religious [[Christian denomination|denomination]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=September 27, 2018}}</ref> The United States has the fourth largest [[Catholic Church by country|Catholic population in the world]], after [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cara.georgetown.edu/CARAServices/requestedchurchstats.html|title=Catholic Data, Catholic Statistics, Catholic Research|website=cara.georgetown.edu}}</ref>

Likewise, France founded settlements with missions attached to them in the Mississippi River region, notably, [[St. Louis]] (1764) and [[New Orleans]] (1718). [[English people|English]] Catholics, on the other hand, "harassed in England by the Protestant majority,"<ref>Taylor, 137</ref> settled in Maryland (1634) and founded the first state capitol, [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]].<ref>Taylor, 137.</ref><ref> Richard Middleton, ''Colonial America: A History, 1565-1776'' (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell, 2002) 95.</ref> In 1789, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was the first diocese in the newly independent nation. [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] became the first American bishop. His brother [[Daniel Carroll]] was the leading Catholic among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. George Washington in the army and as president set a standard for religious toleration. No religious test was allowed for holding national office, and colonial legal restrictions on Catholics holding office were gradually abolished by the States. However, in the mid-19th century there was political [[anti-Catholicism in the United States]], sponsored by pietistic Protestants fearful of the pope. In the 20th century anti-Catholicism seldom appeared except when a Catholic was running for president as in 1928 and 1960. The number of Catholics grew rapidly in the 19th century through high fertility and immigration, especially from [[Irish Americans|Ireland]], [[German Americans|Germany]], and after 1880, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Italian Americans|Italy]]. Large scale Catholic immigration from [[Mexico]] began after 1910 and in 2019 Latinos comprise 37 percent of American Catholics.  By 1900, it was the largest denomination. [[Parish]]es set up [[parochial school]]s, and over a hundred [[Jesuit]] and other colleges were established. [[Nun]]s were very active in teaching and hospital work. Since 1960, the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has fallen slowly from about 25% to 22%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.adw.org/2010/12/is-the-bottom-really-falling-out-of-catholic-mass-attendance-a-recent-cara-survey-ponders-the-question/|title=Is the Bottom Really Falling Out of Catholic Mass Attendance?

Roman Catholics gather as local communities called parishes, headed by a priest, and typically meet at a permanent church building for liturgies every Sunday, weekdays and on holy days. Within the 196 geographical dioceses and archdioceses (excluding the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|Archdiocese for the Military Services]]), there were 17,007 local Catholic [[parishes]] in the United States in 2018.<ref name="CARA">{{cite web|url=https://cara.georgetown.edu/frequently-requested-church-statistics/ |title=Frequently Requested Church Statistics |work=cara.georgetown.edu |publisher=Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate |quote=Parishes [...] 17,007}}</ref> The Catholic Church has the third highest total number of local congregations in the US behind [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]] and [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]]. However, the average Catholic parish is significantly larger than the average Baptist or Methodist congregation; there are more than four times as many Catholics as Southern Baptists and more than eight times as many Catholics as United Methodists<!-- (7,853,987) [Commenting this out: Why show UMC numbers without showing SBC numbers?] -->.<ref>''Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches 2010''(Nashville: Abington Press, 2010), 12.</ref>

In the United States, there are 197 ecclesiastical jurisdictions:
* 177 [[Latin Church|Western Catholic]] [[dioceses]]
** including 32 Latin Catholic [[archdioceses]]
* 18 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] [[dioceses]] [[Eparchy|(eparchies)]]
** including 2 Eastern Catholic [[archdioceses]] [[Archeparchy|(archeparchies)]]
** including 1 [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada|Eparchy]] (for the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]])
* 2 [[personal ordinariate]]s
** one for former [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who came into full [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion
** one for members of the military (though equivalent to an archdiocese, it is technically a [[military ordinariate]])

[[Eastern Catholic Churches]] are churches with origins in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa that have their own distinctive liturgical, legal and organizational systems and are identified by the national or ethnic character of their region of origin. Each is considered fully equal to the Latin tradition within the Church. In the United States, there are 15 Eastern Church dioceses (called [[Eparchy|eparchies]]) and two Eastern Church archdioceses (or [[Archeparchy|archeparchies]]), the [[Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh]] and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia]].

The apostolic exarchate for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the United States is headed by a bishop who is a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. An apostolic exarchate is the Eastern Catholic Church equivalent of an apostolic vicariate. It is not a full-fledged diocese/eparchy, but is established by the Holy See for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in an area outside the territory of the Eastern Catholic Church to which they belong. It is headed by a bishop or a priest with the title of [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|exarch]].

The [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]] was established January 1, 2012, to serve former Anglican groups and clergy in the United States who sought to become Catholic. Similar to a diocese though national in scope, the ordinariate is based in [[Houston]], Texas, and includes parishes and communities across the United States that are fully Catholic, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage and traditions.

{{As of|2017}}, 8 dioceses out of 195 are vacant (''[[sede vacante]]''). None of the current bishops or archbishops are past the retirement age of 75.

The central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the United States is the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], made up of the hierarchy of [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] (including [[archbishop]]s) of the United States and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], although each bishop is independent in his own [[diocese]], answerable only to the [[Holy See]]. The USCCB elects a president to serve as their administrative head, but he is in no way the "head" of the Church or of Catholics in the United States. In addition to the 195 dioceses and one [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States|exarchate]]<ref name=exarchate>On July 14, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI erected the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States]].</ref> represented in the USCCB, there are several dioceses in the nation's other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]], the bishops in the six dioceses (one [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[archdiocese]] and five suffragan dioceses) form their own [[episcopal conference]], the [[Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference]] (''Conferencia Episcopal Puertorriqueña'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholic Church in Puerto Rico|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/pr.html |last=Cheney|first=David M. |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref> The bishops in US [[insular area]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]—the Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the Territory of [[American Samoa]], and the Territory of [[Guam]]—are members of the [[Episcopal conference#Episcopal Conferences|Episcopal Conference of the Pacific]].

No [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] exists for Catholics in the United States. In the 1850s, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore#Episcopate|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was acknowledged a ''Prerogative of Place'', which confers to its archbishop some of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries. The Archdiocese of Baltimore was the first diocese established in the United States, in 1789, with [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] (1735–1815) as its first bishop. It was, for many years, the most influential diocese in the fledgling nation. Now, however, the United States has several large archdioceses and a number of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]-archbishops.

By far, most Catholics in the United States belong to the [[Latin Church|Latin or Western Church]] and the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church. Rite generally refers to the form of worship ("liturgical rite") in a church community owing to cultural and historical differences as well as differences in practice. However, the Vatican II document, ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'' ("Of the Eastern Churches"), acknowledges that these Eastern Catholic communities are "true Churches" and not just rites within the Catholic Church.<ref>Richard McBrien, THE CHURCH/THE EVOLUTION OF CATHOLICISM (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2009), 450. Also see: BASIC VATICAN COUNCIL II: THE BASIC SIXTEEN DOCUMENTS (Costello Publishing, 1996).</ref> There are 14 other Churches in the United States (23 within the global Catholic Church) which are in communion with Rome, fully recognized and valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. They have their own bishops and [[eparchy|eparchies]]. The largest of these communities in the U.S. is the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].<ref name="cnewastat">{{cite web

==Personnel==

The Church employs people in a variety of leadership and service roles. Its ministers include ordained clergy ([[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests. and]] [[deacon]]s) and non-ordained [[lay ecclesial ministers]], [[theologians]], and [[catechists]].

Some Catholics, both lay and clergy, live in a form of [[consecrated life]], rather than in marriage. This includes a wide range of relationships, from monastic ([[monk]]s and [[nun]]s), to mendicant ([[friar]]s and sisters), apostolic (priests, [[Brother (Christian)|brother]][[Brothers|s]], and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|sisters)]], and secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the Church. Consecrated life – in and of itself – does not make a person a part of the clergy or a minister of the Church.

Additionally, many lay people are employed in "secular" careers in support of Church institutions, including educators, health care professionals, finance and human resources experts, lawyers, and others.

===Bishops===

Leadership of the Catholic Church in the United States is provided by the bishops, individually for their own dioceses and collectively through the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. There are some mid-level groupings of bishops, such as ecclesiastical provinces (often covering a state) and the fourteen geographic regions of the USCCB, but these have little significance for most purposes.

The ordinary office for a bishop is to be the bishop of a particular diocese, its chief pastor and minister, usually geographically defined and incorporating, on average, about 350,000 Catholic Christians. In [[canon law]], the bishop leading a particular diocese, or similar office, is called an "ordinary" (i.e., he has complete jurisdiction in this territory or grouping of Christians).

There are two non-geographic dioceses, called "ordinariates", one for [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|military personnel]] and one for [[List of Catholic dioceses in the United States|former Anglicans]] who are in full communion with the Catholic Church.

Dioceses are grouped together geographically into provinces, usually within a state, part of a state, or multiple states together (see map below). A province comprises several dioceses which look to one ordinary bishop (usually of the most populous or historically influential diocese/city) for guidance and leadership. This lead bishop is their [[archbishop]] and his diocese is the [[archdiocese]]. The archbishop is called the "metropolitan" bishop who strives to achieve some unanimity of practice with his brother "suffragan" bishops.

Some larger dioceses have additional bishops assisting the diocesan bishop, and these are called "auxiliary" bishops or, if a "[[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor" bishop]], with right of succession.

Additionally, some bishops are called to advise and assist the bishop of Rome, the [[pope]], in a particular way, either as an additional responsibility on top of their diocesan office or sometimes as a full-time position in the [[Roman Curia]] or related institution serving the universal church. These are called [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], because they are "incardinated" onto a second diocese (Rome). All cardinals under the age of 80 participate in the election of a new pope when the office of the papacy becomes vacant.

There are 428 active and retired Catholic bishops in the United States:

* 67 auxiliary bishops
* 8 apostolic or diocesan administrators

173 retired bishops:
* 33 retired archbishops
* 95 retired diocesan bishops
* 45 retired auxiliary bishops

====Cardinals====

There are 15 U.S. cardinals.

Six archdioceses are currently led by archbishops who have been created cardinals:
* [[Blase J. Cupich]] – [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]]
* [[Daniel DiNardo]] – [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Galveston-Houston]]
* [[Timothy M. Dolan]] – [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|New York]]
* [[Seán Patrick O'Malley]] – [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Boston]]
* [[Joseph W. Tobin]] – [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark|Newark]]
* [[Wilton Daniel Gregory]] - [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Washington, D.C.]]

Three cardinals are in service to the pope, in the Roman Curia or related offices:
* [[Raymond Leo Burke]] – patron of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]
* [[Kevin Farrell]] – [[Prefect]] of the [[Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life]]
* [[James Michael Harvey]] – [[Archpriest]] of the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]]

Six cardinals are retired:
* [[Roger Mahony]] – [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop Emeritus]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]]
* [[Adam Maida]] – [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop Emeritus]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Detroit]]
* [[Edwin Frederick O'Brien]] – [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master Emeritus]] of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Equestrian Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem]]
* [[Justin Francis Rigali]] – [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop Emeritus]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]]
* [[James Stafford]] – [[Apostolic Penitentiary|Major Penitentiary Emeritus of the Apostolic Penitentiary]] and [[Archbishop Emeritus]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver|Denver]]
* [[Donald Wuerl]] – [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop Emeritus]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Washington, D.C.]]

===Clergy and ministers===

In 2018,<ref name="CARA"/> there were approximately 100,000 clergy and ministers employed by the Church in the United States, including:
* 36,580 presbyters (priests)
** 25,254 diocesan
** 11,326 religious/consecrated
* 18,291 ordinary (permanent) deacons
* 39,651 lay ecclesial ministers (2016)<ref>This number is conservative, as it only counts those in parish ministry, but there are many in deanery, diocesan, or chaplaincy work</ref>
** 23,149 diocesan
** 16,502 religious/consecrated

There are also approximately 30,000 seminarians/students in formation for ministry:
* 3,526 candidates for priesthood
* 2,088 candidates for diaconate
* 16,585 candidates for lay ecclesial ministry

===Lay employees===
The 630 Catholic hospitals in the U.S. have a combined budget of $101.7 billion, and employ 641,030 full-time equivalent staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/general-files/mini_profile-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Untitled Page|website=www.chausa.org}}</ref>

The 6,525 Catholic primary and secondary schools in the U.S. employ 151,101 full-time equivalent staff, 97.2% of whom are lay and 2.3% are consecrated, and 0.5% are ordained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncea.org/NCEA/Proclaim/Catholic_School_Data/Catholic_School_Data.aspx|title=Catholic School Data|first=Advanced Solutions International|last=Inc.|website=www.ncea.org|access-date=2017-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320053953/http://www.ncea.org/NCEA/Proclaim/Catholic_School_Data/Catholic_School_Data.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 261 Catholic institutions of higher (tertiary) education in the U.S. employ approximately 250,000 full-time equivalent staff, including faculty, administrators, and support staff.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accunet.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3797#sthash.xHjNPgWO.dpbs |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143331/http://www.accunet.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3797#sthash.xHjNPgWO.dpbs |archive-date=2017-03-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Overall, the Catholic Church employs more than one million employees with an operating budget of nearly $100 billion to run parishes, diocesan primary and secondary schools, nursing homes, retreat centers, hospitals, and other charitable institutions.<ref>Thomas Healy, "A Blueprint for Change," ''America'' September 26, 2005, 14.</ref>

===Parochial schools===
{{Main|Catholic schools in the United States|History of Catholic education in the United States}}
By the middle of the 19th century, the Catholics in larger cities started building their own parochial school system. The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools.<ref>Thomas E. Buckley, "A Mandate for Anti-Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment," ''America'' September 27, 2004, 18–21.</ref> The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262–74</ref>

In the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the [[Catholic University of America]] in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286–91</ref> However, by the later half the 20th century Catholic schools began to perform significantly better than their public counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edpolicy.education.jhu.edu/is-the-catholic-school-effect-real-new-research-challenges-the-catholic-primary-school-advantage/|title=Is the "Catholic School Effect" Real?

{{Main|List of Catholic seminaries#United States}}

According to the ''2016 Official Catholic Directory'', {{as of|2016|lc=y}} there were 243 [[Seminary|seminaries]] with 4,785 students in the United States; 3,629 diocesan seminarians and 1,456 religious seminarians. By the official 2017 statistics, there are 5,050 seminarians (3,694 diocesan and 1,356 religious) in the United States. In addition, the American Catholic bishops oversee the [[Pontifical North American College]] for American seminarians and priests studying at one of the [[Pontifical University|Pontifical Universities]] in [[Rome]].

===Healthcare system===
In 2002, Catholic health care system, overseeing 625 hospitals with a combined revenue of 30 billion dollars, was the nation's largest group of nonprofit systems.<ref>Arthur Jones, "Catholic health care aims to make 'Catholic' a brand name," ''National Catholic Reporter'' July 18, 2003, 8.</ref> In 2008, the cost of running these hospitals had risen to $84.6 billion, including the $5.7 billion they donate.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sister Mary Ann | last=Walsh | title=Catholic health care for a broken arm; a cast and new shoes | publisher=The Florida Catholic | location=Orlando, Florida | page= A11 | date=August 28 – September 10, 2009 }}</ref> According to the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States]], 60 health care systems, on average, admit one in six patients nationwide each year.<ref>Alice Popovici, "Keeping Catholic priorities on the table," ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' June 26, 2009, 7.</ref> According to Merger Watch (2018), Catholic facilities make up about 10% of all "sole community providers" in the US (49 out of 514).

[[Catholic Charities]] is active as the largest voluntary social service networks in the United States. In 2009, it welcomed in New Jersey the 50,000th refugee to come to the United States from [[Myanmar|Burma]].

===Catholic Church and labor===
{{Main|Catholic social activism in the United States}}
The church had a role in shaping the U.S. labor movement, due to the involvement of priests like [[Charles Owen Rice]] and [[John P. Boland (priest)|John P. Boland]]. The activism of Msgr. [[Geno Baroni]] was instrumental in creating the [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development]]. The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] was founded in 1933 by [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Peter Maurin]]. It campaigns on various social justice issues and aims to "live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicworker.org/cw-aims-and-means.html | title=The Aims and Means of the Catholic Worker | website=Catholicworker.org}}</ref>

==Demographics==
There were 70,412,021 registered Catholics in the United States (22% of the US population) in 2017, according to the American bishops' count in their ''Official Catholic Directory 2016''.<ref name="renodioc">{{cite web|url=http://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%202017%20directory.pdf|title=Diocese of Reno, 2016–2017 Directory|page=72|quote=Total Catholic Population [...] 70,412,021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726211319/https://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%202017%20directory.pdf|archive-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref> This count primarily rests on the parish assessment tax which priests evaluate yearly according to the number of registered members and contributors. Estimates of the overall American Catholic population from recent years generally range around 20% to 28%. According to Albert J. Menedez, research director of "Americans for Religious Liberty," many Americans continue to call themselves Catholic but "do not register at local parishes for a variety of reasons."<ref>Albert J. Mendedez, "American Catholics, A Social and Political Portrait," THE HUMANIST, September/October, 1993, 17–20.</ref> According to a survey of 35,556 American residents (released in 2008 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life), 23.9% of Americans identify themselves as Catholic (approximately 72 million of a national population of 306 million residents).<ref>Michael Paulson, "US religious identity is rapidly changing," ''[[Boston Globe]]'', February 26, 2008, 1</ref> The study notes that 10% of those people who identify themselves as Protestant in the interview are former Catholics and 8% of those who identity themselves as Catholic are former Protestants.<ref>Ted Olsen, "Go Figure," ''[[Christianity Today]]'', April, 2008, 15</ref> In recent years, more parishes have opened than closed.

The northeastern quadrant of the US (i.e., New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, and West North Central) has seen a decline in the number of parishes since 1970, but parish numbers are up in the other five regions (i.e., South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Pacific, and Mountain regions) and are growing steadily.<ref>Dennis Sadowski, "When parishes close, there is more to deal with than just logistics," ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' 7 July 2009, 6.</ref><ref>Robert David Sullivan, "Parishes without pastors decline, but only because more churches have closed," ''AMERICA'', May 24, 2019, p.14</ref> Catholics in the US are about 6% of the church's total worldwide 1.2 billion membership.

A poll by The Barna Group in 2004 found Catholic ethnicity to be 60% non-Hispanic white (generally of mixed ethnicity, but almost always includes at least one historically Catholic ethnicity such as [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Italian Americans|Italian]], [[German Americans|German]], [[Polish Americans|Polish]], or [[French Americans|French]]), 31% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] of any nationality (mostly [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] but also many [[Cuban Americans|Cubans]], [[Puerto Ricans]], [[Dominican Americans|Dominicans]], Central Americans and [[Colombian Americans|Colombians]] among others), 4% [[African Americans|Black]] [including [[African immigration to the United States|Africans]], [[Haitian Americans|Haitians]], [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|black Latino]] and [[West Indian American|Caribbean]]], and 5% other ethnicity (mostly [[Filipino Americans|Filipinos]], [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese]] and other [[Asian Americans]], [[Multiracial Americans|Americans who are multiracial and have mixed ethnicities]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]).<ref>[http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=Topic&TopicID=15]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305223609/http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=Topic&TopicID=15 |date=March 5, 2005 }}</ref> Among the non-Hispanic whites, about 16 million Catholics identify as being of [[Irish Americans|Irish descent]], about 13 million [[German Americans|as German]], about 12 million [[Italian Americans|as Italian]], about 7 million [[Polish Americans|as Polish]], and about 5 million [[French Americans|as French]] (note that many identify with more than one ethnicity). The roughly 7.8 million Catholics who are converts (mainly from Protestantism, with a smaller number from irreligion or other religions) are also mostly non-Hispanic white, including many people of [[British Americans|British]], [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]], and [[Scandinavian American|Scandinavian]] ancestry.<ref>Pew Report, March 17, 2012. 2.6% of all Americans (320 million) are former Protestants, currently Catholic. 7.8 million.</ref>

Between 1990 and 2008, there were 11 million additional Catholics. The growth in the Latino population accounted for 9 million of these. They accounted for 32% of all American Catholics in 2008 as opposed to 20% in 1990.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Patricia | last=Zapor | title=Study finds Latinos who leave their churches are choosing no faith | url=http://www.jknirp.com/nofaith.htm | publisher=the Florida Catholic | location=Orlando, Florida | pages=A11 | date=March 25 – April 8, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225161416/http://jknirp.com/nofaith.htm | archive-date=December 25, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref><!---note that print ref does not match online as to source but they are both the same---> The percentage of Hispanics who identified as Catholic dropped from 67% in 2010 to 55% in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/05/07/the-shifting-religious-identity-of-latinos-in-the-united-states/|title=The Shifting Religious Identity of Latinos in the United States|date=7 May 2014}}</ref>

According to a more recent Pew Forum report which examined American religiosity in 2014 and compared it to 2007,<ref name=pew>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/|title=America's Changing Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Research|date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> there were 50.9 million adult Catholics {{as of|2014|lc=y}} (excluding children under 18), forming about 20.8% of the U.S. population, down from 54.3 million and 23.9% in 2007. Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those "young" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants,<ref>"Statistics on Religion in America Report," Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, 3/17/12</ref> 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since [[Vatican II]], where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education. Still, according to the 2015 Pew Research Center, "the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys<ref>"America's Changing Religious Landscape," Pew Research Center, May 12, 2015.</ref> By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American. Conversely, 19% of non-Hispanic whites were Catholic in 2014 (down from 22% in 2007), whereas 55% of Hispanics were (versus 58% in 2007). In 2015, Hispanics were 38%, while blacks and Asians were at 3% each.<ref name=manilatimes_afp>{{cite news|title=Immigration boosting US Catholic numbers|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/immigration-boosting-us-catholic-numbers/220344/|work=[[The Manila Times]]|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>"Religion in Latin American [and among the US Hispanic population]" Pew Research Center, Nov. 13, 2014.</ref> Because conversion away from Catholicism as well as dropping out of religion completely is presently occurring much more quickly among Hispanics than among Euro-American whites, Black (2.9% of US Catholic population)<ref>"'Act Justly, love goodness': Black Catholics in America," AMERICAMAGAZINE.ORG</ref> and Asian-American Catholics, it is doubtful they will outnumber the latter three categories of Catholics in the foreseeable future.

There has never been a Catholic religious party in the United States, either local, state or national, similar to [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] parties in Europe.

Historically, a majority of the Catholics in the United States supported the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] before 1968. Since the election of the Catholic [[John F. Kennedy]] as President in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], Catholics have split about 50-50 between the two major parties, but the Democrats have a slight lead due to the growing population of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]].

On social issues, the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]], which was partly [[Roe v. Wade|legalized in 1973 by the Supreme Court]], and [[same-sex marriage]], which was [[Obergefell v. Hodges|fully legalized in June 2015]]. The Church also condemns embryo-destroying research and [[In vitro fertilization]] as immoral. The Church is allied with conservative evangelicals and other Protestants on these issues.

However, the Catholic Church throughout its history has taken special concern for all vulnerable groups. This has led to progressive alliances, as well, with the church championing causes such as a strong welfare state, [[Rerum novarum|unionization]]{{cn|date=June 2020}}, immigration for those fleeing economic or political hardship,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/06/13/catholic-bishops-call-trumps-new-asylum-rules-immoral-with-one-suggesting-canonical-penalties-for-those-involved/|title=Catholic bishops call Trump's asylum rules 'immoral,' with one suggesting 'canonical penalties' for those involved|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2019|date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|opposition to capital punishment]],<ref name="Revision2">{{cite web|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/08/02/180802a.html|title=New revision of number 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church on the death penalty – Rescriptum "ex Audentia SS.mi"|date=2 August 2018|website=Summary of Bulletin|publisher=Holy See Press Office|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref> environmental stewardship,<ref>Stewardship of God's Creation, Major themes from Catholic Social Teaching, Office for Social Justice, Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.</ref> <!-- It's not clear that this is a policy of the Catholic Church.

The Catholic Church's teachings, coming from the perspective of a global church, do not conform easily to the American political binary of "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]" and "[[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]." A majority of pro-choice Catholics support the Democrats, while many pro-life Catholics support the Republicans.

===Social issues===
The Catholic Church's involvement in social or political movements was not very prominent until bishops in the United States addressed problems on racism in 1958 in a written piece called "Discrimination and Christian Conscience". In the 1960s, the Catholic Church showed support in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], which involved the attendance of Dutch priest [[Henri Nouwen]].<ref>Roman Catholicism in America Page 81-83</ref>

The number of Catholics surged starting in the 1840s as [[German Americans|German]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and other European Catholics came in large numbers. After 1890, [[Italian Americans|Italians]] and [[Polish Americans|Poles]] formed the largest numbers of new Catholics, but many countries in Europe contributed, as did Quebec. By 1850, Catholics had become the country's largest single denomination.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Between 1860 and 1890, their population tripled to seven million.

Some [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] political movements appeared: the [[Know Nothing]]s in the 1840s. [[American Protective Association]] in the 1890s, and the [[Ku Klux Klan#Second era|second Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s, were active in the United States. Animosity by Protestants waned as Catholics demonstrated their patriotism in [[World War I]], their commitment to charity, and their dedication to democratic values.<ref>Tyler Anbinder, "Nativism and prejudice against immigrants" in Reed Ueda, ed., ''A companion to American immigration'' (2006) pp: 177–201.</ref>

The bishops began standardizing discipline in the American Church with the convocation of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore]] in 1852, 1866 and 1884. These councils resulted in the promulgation of the [[Baltimore Catechism]] and the establishment of The [[Catholic University of America]].

Jesuit priests who had been expelled from Europe found a new base in the U.S. They founded numerous secondary schools and 28 colleges and universities, such as Georgetown University (1789), [[St. Louis University|St. Louis University (1818)]], [[Boston College]],  the [[College of Holy Cross]], the [[University of Santa Clara]], and several Loyola Colleges.<ref>Peter McDonough, ''Men astutely trained: A history of the Jesuits in the American Century'' (2008).</ref> Many other religious communities like the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Congregation of Holy Cross]], and [[Franciscans]] followed suit.

In the 1890s the [[Americanism (heresy)|''Americanism'' controversy]] roiled senior officials. The Vatican suspected there was too much liberalism in the American Church, and the result was a turn to conservative theology as the Irish bishops increasingly demonstrated their total loyalty to the Pope, and traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges were suppressed.<ref>James Hennessy, S.J.,  ''American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States'' (1981) pp 194–203</ref><ref>Thomas T.

====Nuns and sisters====
{{main|Catholic sisters and nuns in the United States}} [[Nun]]s and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|sisters]] played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century. In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. But there were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 congregations in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different congregations by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.<ref>James M. O'Toole, ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2008) p 104</ref> Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.<ref>Margaret M. McGuinness, ''Called to Serve'' (2013), ch 8</ref>

According to Laurie Goodstein, the investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a "vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities", was ultimately closed in 2015 by Pope Francis.<ref name="Goodstein2015">{{cite web|location=New York|publisher=The New York Times|website=nytimes.com|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Vatican ends battle with U.S. Catholic nuns' group|date=April 16, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/us/catholic-church-ends-takeover-of-leadership-conference-of-women-religious.html}}</ref>

===20th–21st centuries===
{{Main|20th-century history of the Catholic Church in the United States}}
In the era of intense emigration from the 1840s to 1914, bishops often set up separate parishes for major ethnic groups, from Ireland, Germany, Poland, French Canada and Italy. In Iowa, the development of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archdiocese of Dubuque]], the work of [[Mathias Loras|Bishop Loras]] and the building of [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], to meet the needs of Germans and Irish, is illustrative.
By the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. This multiculturalism and diversity has influenced the conduct of Catholicism in the United States. For example, most dioceses offer [[Masses (liturgy)|Mass]] in a number of languages, and an increasing number of parishes offer Masses in the official language of the Church, Latin, due to its universal nature.

Sociologist [[Andrew Greeley]], an ordained Catholic priest at the University of Chicago, undertook a series of national surveys of Catholics in the late 20th century.  He published hundreds of books and articles, both technical and popular.  His biographer summarizes his interpretation:
:He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in "sacramental" terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition—its stories, imagery, and rituals—kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. Despite the unchanging nature of Church doctrine, Greeley insisted that Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception is solely responsible for the sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975.<ref>Leslie Woodcock Tentler, "Greeley, Andrew Moran" [http://www.anb.org/articles/08/08-02390.html in ''American National Biography Online'' April 2016; Access Apr 30 2017]</ref>

In 1965, 71% of Catholics attended Mass regularly.<ref name="cch">{{Cite book |first = Tom |last = Peterson |title = Catholics come home |publisher = Image |date = 2013 |location = New York City |pages = 23|isbn = 978-0-385-34717-4 }}</ref><!-- regularly means at least weekly. -->

Sheen]] became a media personality with his own television show ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]'' which aired during the 1950s, as the Church in the United States attempted to present its message before a wider audience in the [[mass media]] age.]]
In the later 20th century "[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in the United States|clerical child abuse of children and adolescents]], of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages."<ref>Patrick W. Carey, ''Catholics in America. A History'', Westport, Connecticut and London: Praeger, 2004, p. 141</ref> Because of this, higher scrutiny and governance as well as protective policies and diocesan investigation into seminaries have been enacted to correct these former abuses of power, and safeguard parishioners and the Church from further abuses and scandals.

One initiative is the "[[National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management]]" (NLRCM), a lay-led group born in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal and dedicated to bringing better administrative practices to 194 dioceses that include 19,000 parishes nationwide with some 35,000 [[Lay Ecclesial Ministry|lay ecclesial ministers]] who log 20 hours or more a week in these parishes.<ref>David Gibson, "Declaration of interdependence," ''The Tablet'' 4 July 2009, 8–9.</ref>

<!-- In 2008, 17% of Catholics attended Mass regularly. -->{{when|date=May 2017}}<!-- regularly means at least weekly.-->According to a 2015 study by Pew Researchers, 39% of Catholics attend church at least once a week and 40%, once or twice a month.<ref>"Attendance at Religious Service" in Religious Landscape Study, Pew Research, May 12, 2015.</ref>

Although the issue of trusteeism was mostly settled in the 19th century, there have been some related issues. In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)]] in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]]. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over [[Connecticut Raised Bill 1098]] as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Related to issues of asset ownership, some parishes have been liquidated and the [[Parish in the Catholic Church#Opposition to suppressions|assets taken by the diocese]] instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.

In 2009 [[John Micklethwait]], editor of ''[[The Economist]]'' and co-author of ''[[God is Back|God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World]]'', said that American Catholicism, which he describes in his book as "arguably the most striking Evangelical success story of the second half of the nineteenth century," has competed quite happily "without losing any of its basic characteristics." It has thrived in America's "pluralism."<ref>Austin Ivereigh, "God Makes a Comeback: An Interview with John Micklethwait, ''America'', 5 October 2009, 13–14.</ref>

In 2011, an estimated 26 million American Catholics were "[[Lapsed Catholic|fallen-away]]", that is, not practicing their faith. Some religious commentators commonly refer to them<!---not quite accurately since they seem to be outnumbered by Baptists--> as "the second largest religious denomination in the United States."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://chnonline.org/special-sections/parenting/10172-why-wont-my-kids-go-to-church.html |title=Why won't my kids go to church |author=Karen Mahoney |date=February 23, 2011 |publisher=Archdiocese of Milwaukee Catholic Herald }}</ref> Recent Pew Research survey results in 2014 show about 31.7% of American adults were raised Catholic, while 41% from among that group no longer identify as Catholic.<ref name=pew/>

About 25% of US Catholics say they attend Masses once a week or more, and about 38% went at least once a month. The study found that the number of US Catholics has increased by 3 to 6% each decade since 1965, and that the Catholic Church is "the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the US," with Hispanics accounting for 38% of Catholics and blacks and Asians 3% each.<ref name=manilatimes_afp/> The Catholic Church in the US represents perhaps "the most multi-ethnic organization of any kind, and so is a major laboratory for cross-cultural cooperation and cross-cultural communication completely within the nation's borders."<ref>Mark A. Noll. THE NEW SHAPE OF WORLD CHRISTIANITY (Downers Grove, IL.: IVP Academic, 2009), 74</ref> It is as if it wishes to forge a broader ecclesial identity to give newcomers a more inclusive welcome, similar to the aspirations of 19th century church leaders like Archbishops John Ireland and James Gibbons who "wanted Catholic immigrants to become fully American, rather than 'strangers in a strange land.' "<ref>Arthur Meyers, "Social Justice Warrior," Commonweal, July 6, 2018.</ref> Only 2 percent of American Catholics go to confession on a regular basis, while three-quarters of them go to confession once a year or less often; a valid confession is required by the Church after committing [[mortal sin]] in order to return to the State of Grace, necessary to receive Holy Communion.<ref>[http://religiondispatches.org/american-sin-why-pope-francis-mercy-is-not-our-mercy/ AMERICAN SIN: WHY POPE FRANCIS' MERCY IS NOT OUR MERCY] Religion Dispatches, February 8, 2016</ref> As one of the Precepts of the Church, it is also required that every Catholic makes a valid confession at least once a year.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P75.HTM The Precepts of the Church] Catechism of the Catholic Church</ref>

According to Matthew Bunsen’s analysis of a Real
Clear poll of American Catholics in late 2019:
:Catholicism has been battered by the winds of secularism, materialism, and relativism. Failures in catechesis and formation have created wide gaps in practice and belief that stretch now into every aspect of Catholic life.<ref> Matthew Bunson, [https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/12/11/ewtnrealclear_poll_us_catholics_open_to_reelecting_trump_141926.html?mc_cid=a3b10cd93e&mc_eid=3c4e629a8d “EWTN/RealClear Poll: U.S. Catholics Open to Reelecting Trump” ‘’Real Clear Politics’’ Dec 11, 2019].  The poll of 1,223 Catholics was taken in November 2019> </ref>

The RealClear poll data indicates that the Latino element has now reached 37 percent of the Catholic population, and growing. It is 60 percent Democratic, while the non-Latinos are split about 50-50 politically. Although many Americans still identify as Catholics, their religious participation rates are declining.  Today only 39% of all Catholics go to Mass at least weekly.  Nearly two-thirds of Catholics say that their trust in the church leadership has been undermined by the clergy sex abuse crisis.  Nevertheless, 86% of all Catholics still consider religion important in their own lives.<ref> Bunsen, 2019</ref>
