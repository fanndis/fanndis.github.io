==History==
The magazine was founded in 1990 (and initially called ''The Liberal Prospect'') by [[Robert Kuttner]], [[Robert Reich]], and [[Paul Starr]] as a response to the perceived ascendancy of [[conservatism]] in the 1980s. Kuttner and Starr currently serve as Co-Editors. [[David Dayen]] serves as Executive Editor. Ellen J. Meany serves as Publisher.<ref name="TAPstaff">{{cite web |title=Meet the Staff |url=https://prospect.org/meet-staff |website=The American Prospect |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>

''The American Prospect'' runs a writing fellows program that offers young journalists the opportunity to spend two years at the magazine, contributing online and print content. Past fellows have included [[Matt Yglesias]],<ref name=post>{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=The fate of the American Prospect and what keeps a journalism ecosystem healthy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/05/30/the-fate-of-the-american-prospect-and-what-keeps-a-journalism-ecosystem-healthy/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=Washington Post|date=May 30, 2014}}</ref> [[Ezra Klein]],<ref name=post/> [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], [[Joshua Micah Marshall]], [[Dana Goldstein]], [[Nicholas Confessore]], and Kate Sheppard. [[Staff writer]]s and contributors include [[Gabriel Arana]], [[Steve Erickson]], Adele Stan, [[Paul Waldman]], [[EJ Dionne]], and [[Harold Meyerson]].

In March 2010, ''The American Prospect'' entered into an affiliation with [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]], a public policy research and advocacy center based in New York City. The official affiliation ended in 2012. That year, the magazine nearly folded due to financial struggles, but it was able to raise enough money to stay afloat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Calderone|first1=Michael|title=American Prospect Exceeds Fundraising Goal, Raises Enough To Stay Alive|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/american-prospect-fundraising_n_1612373.html|accessdate=10 December 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In 2014, the magazine re-purposed itself as a "quarterly journal of ideas." [[Kit Rachlis]] announced he was leaving the editorship of the magazine, senior writer Monica Potts and editor Bob Moser were laid off, while several other editorial staffers left the publication.<ref name="buzz">{{cite news|last1=Tanzer|first1=Myles|title=American Prospect Mass Exodus Begins|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mylestanzer/american-prospect-mass-exodus-begins#.kdBbnNMEnV|accessdate=10 December 2015|publisher=BuzzFeed|date=June 2, 2014}}</ref> New staff were hired and the organization built back up. In its early years, the Prospect also undertook a cutting-edge project to connect progressive organizations through its Moving Ideas Network (www.movingideas.org), originally called the Electronic Policy Network, where staff wrote policy statements, advocacy actions, and reports from the late 1990s through 2006 when the project was "adopted" by Care2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.care2services.com/care2blog/care2-adopts-the-moving-ideas-network|title=Care2 Adopts the Moving Ideas Network|last=Care2|website=www.care2services.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref> The network was absorbed into Care2's Frogloop and general operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7322|title=Moving Ideas Network - Discover the Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

In 2010, ''The American Prospect'' was the recipient of ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine's Utne Independent Press Award for Political Coverage.<ref name="utne">{{cite web|title=Winners of the 2010 Utne Independent Press Awards|url=http://www.utne.com/utne-independent-press-awards-winners-2010.aspx|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref>

==Format==
Originally ''The American Prospect'' published quarterly, then bimonthly. In 2000, thanks to a grant from the [[Schumann Center for Media and Democracy]], it became biweekly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodison|first=Donna L.|title=Just what are the prospects for The American Prospect? |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2002/06/17/newscolumn1.html|newspaper=Boston Business Journal|date=June 14, 2002}}</ref> Financial and logistical difficulties ensued, and the magazine moved to a 10-issue-per-year format in spring 2003 and a bimonthly format in summer 2012. The online version of the magazine includes an active blog called TAPPED (derived from TAP, the acronym of ''The American Prospect''), as well as a blog by [[Adam Serwer]]. Facing financial issues, the magazine reduced its bi-monthly publication schedule to a quarterly publication schedule in 2014.<ref name=buzz/>
