==Toponymy==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: B|Other names of Brussels]]}}

===Etymology===
The most common theory of the origin of the name ''Brussels'' is that it derives from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|Bruocsella}}, {{lang|odt|Broekzele}} or {{lang|odt|Broeksel}}, meaning "marsh" ({{lang|odt|bruoc}} / {{lang|odt|broek}}) and "home" ({{lang|odt|sella}} / {{lang|odt|zele}} / {{lang|odt|sel}}) or "home in the marsh".<ref>[[Geert van Istendael]] ''Arm Brussel'', uitgeverij Atlas, {{ISBN|90-450-0853-X}}</ref> [[Saint Vindicianus]], the Bishop of [[Cambrai]], made the first recorded reference to the place {{lang|odt|Brosella}} in 695,<ref>{{cite book |title=Nouvelles archives historiques, philosophiques, et littéraires|volume=1 |author1=Jean Baptiste D'Hane |author2=François Huet |author3=P.A.

Annoot- Braeckman |location=Gent |isbn= |page=405 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA405|language=fr}}</ref> when it was still a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. The names of all the municipalities in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] are also of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin, except for [[Evere]], which is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].

===Pronunciation===
In [[French language|French]], {{lang|fr|Bruxelles}} is pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁysɛl|}} (the ''x'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|s}}, like in [[English language|English]], and the final ''s'' is silent) and in Dutch, {{lang|nl|Brussel}} is pronounced {{IPA-nl|ˈbrʏsəl|}}. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}} (pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁysɛlwa|}}) and in Dutch as {{lang|nl|Brusselaars}} (prounouced {{IPA-nl|ˈbrʏsəlaːrs|}}). In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels (known as ''Brussels'', and also sometimes called [[Marols]]), they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.

Originally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained.<ref>[[Jean d'Osta]], ''Dictionnaire historique des faubourgs de Bruxelles'', édition Le Livre {{ISBN|978-2-930135-10-6}}.</ref> The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛl|}} and {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛlwa|}} (for {{lang|fr|bruxellois}}) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.<ref name="Lerond, 1980 pp. 477">Alain Lerond, ''Dictionnaire de la prononciation'' (1980), Larousse, pp. 477.</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels, {{circa|979}}.]]
The history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]]. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone Age]], with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[Menhir|standing stones]] (''Plattesteen'' in the [[City of Brussels]] and ''Tomberg'' in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]], for example). During [[late antiquity]], the region was home to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of [[Tour & Taxis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_decouverte-majeure-a-bruxelles-des-vestiges-romains-retrouves-sur-le-site-de-tour-et-taxis?id=9048235|title=Bruxelles: des vestiges romains retrouvés sur le site de Tour et Taxis|date=6 August 2015|work=RTBF Info|access-date=28 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/news/les-romains-de-tour-et-taxis|title=Les Romains de Tour & Taxis — Patrimoine – Erfgoed|website=patrimoine.brussels|language=fr|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> Following the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]].

The origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Cited source does not reference scholarly literature. Possibly local legend, not fact|date=September 2020}} The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] (located in today's province of [[East Flanders]]) to Saint Gaugericus' chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

===Middle Ages===
[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[County of Leuven|Count of Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (''Treurenberg'', ''[[Coudenberg]]'' and [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon''/''Zavel'']] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the early 13th century, the first [[Fortifications of Brussels]] were built,<ref>{{cite web |language=nl |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels]}}</ref> and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Traces of these walls can still be seen, although the ''[[small ring]]'', a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows their former course.

===Early modern===
[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|View of Brussels, {{circa|1610}}|alt=]]
In the 15th century, the marriage between heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], produced a new Duke of Brabant of the [[Valois Dynasty|House of Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant was integrated into this composite state, and Brussels flourished as the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Burgundy and Brabant.

Philip died in 1506, and he was succeeded by his son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] who then also became [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] (crowned in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]) and even Holy Roman Emperor at the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519. Charles was now the ruler of a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] "on which the sun never sets" with Brussels serving as his main capital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/42112/how-brussels-became-the-capital-of-europe-500-years-ago/|title=How Brussels became the capital of Europe 500 years ago|date=21 April 2017|website=The Brussels Times|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSYkCQAAQBAJ&q=Charles+V+28+years+in+the+netherlands&pg=PA36|title=The Muslim Diaspora (Volume 2, 1500-1799): A Comprehensive Chronology of the Spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas|first=Everett Jenkins|last=Jr|date=7 May 2015|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476608891|accessdate=13 August 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V was declared of age in 1515, and it was there that he abdicated all of his possessions and passed the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] to [[Philip II of Spain]]. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.

[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]
In the 17th century, Brussels was a centre for the [[lace]] industry. In 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings—a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[Pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.

Following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and the city became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.

===Late modern===
[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Gustaf Wappers]], 1834]]
In 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] began in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]].<ref>Slatin, Sonia. "Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited", Journal of Musicological Research 3 (1979), 53–54.</ref> The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.

Following independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies launched by the ''[[Société Générale de Belgique]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the building of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834 and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Saint-Louis University]] in 1858. In 1835, the [[History of rail transport in Belgium|first passenger railway]] built outside England linked the municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] with [[Mechelen]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2010|p=20}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.molenbeek.irisnet.be/fr/je-visite/histoire/Histoire%20en%20quelques%20mots|title=Histoire en quelques mots — Français|website=molenbeek.irisnet.be|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>

[[File:Bruxelles, Place Royale, -Brussels, Belgium--LCCN2001697909.jpg|thumb|The [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]] in the late 19th century]]
During the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Zenne|Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of the [[mayor of the City of Brussels|city's then-mayor]], [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|hausmannien]]'' style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].

===20th century===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference.]]
During the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the 1958 Brussels World's Fair ([[Expo '58]]). During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944. The [[Brussels Airport]], in the suburb of [[Zaventem]], dates from the occupation.

After the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the [[North–South connection]], linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] (underground tram) was finished in 1969,<ref name="1960s">{{cite web|url=http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr|title=STIB – La STIB de 1960 à 1969|year=2013|publisher=STIB|language=French|trans-title=STIB – STIB from 1960 to 1969|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221053137/http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr|archivedate=2013-12-21|url-status=dead|accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref> and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] was opened in 1976.<ref name="1970s">{{cite web|url=http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr|title=STIB – Historique de la STIB de 1970 à 1979|year=2013|publisher=STIB|language=French|trans-title=STIB – History of STIB from 1970 to 1979|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021155415/http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr|archivedate=2013-10-21|url-status=dead|accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref> Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the [[European Union]], and many modern offices were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and numerous architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of ''[[Brusselization|Brusselisation]]''.

==Geography==

===Location and topography===
[[File:Brussels 4.35995E 50.84400N.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of the Greater Brussels area]]{{Further|Geography of Belgium}}
Brussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about {{convert|110|km|abbr=off}} from the Belgian coast and about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} from Belgium's southern tip. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Antwerp]] ([[Flanders]]), and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]). Its average [[elevation]] is {{convert|57|m|abbr=off}} above [[sea level]], varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered [[Zenne|Senne]], which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the [[Sonian Forest]], on its southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the [[Maalbeek]] and the [[Woluwe]], to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are {{convert|15|m||abbr=off}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/brussels-in-figures |title=Brussels in figures 1 |website=visit.brussels |language=en |access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref> The highest point lies at a height of about {{convert|108|m|abbr=off}}, near the {{lang|fr|Place de l'Altitude Cent|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogte Honderdplein|italic=no}}, in [[Forest, Belgium|Forest]].

===Climate===

Brussels experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') with warm summers and cool winters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=15460&cityname=Brussels,+Brussels+Capital,+Belgium&units=|title=Brussels, Belgium Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> Proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the highest totals for any European capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/fr/360361-Parametres.html#ppt_757427|title=Site de l'institut météorologique belge|date=|publisher=Meteo.be|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. The city also often experiences violent thunderstorms in summer months.

==Brussels as a capital==
Despite its name, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of [[Belgium]]. Article 194 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] establishes that the capital of Belgium is the [[City of Brussels]], the municipality in the region that is the city's core.<ref name="article 194" />

The City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], where the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]] exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside [[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]] (not to be confused with the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], the official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Palace of the Nation]] is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]]. The office of the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], colloquially called ''Law Street 16'' (French: {{lang|fr|16, rue de la Loi}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Wetstraat 16}}), is located adjacent to this building. It is also where the [[Council of Ministers (Belgium)|Council of Ministers]] holds its meetings. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], Belgium's main court, has its seat in the [[Palace of Justice (Brussels)|Palace of Justice]]. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium|Constitutional Court]], the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]], the [[Court of Audit of Belgium|Court of Audit]], the [[Royal Belgian Mint]] and the [[National Bank of Belgium]].

The City of Brussels is also the capital of both the [[French Community of Belgium]]<ref name="décret" /> and the [[Flemish Community]].<ref name="decreet" /> The [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government]] have their seats in Brussels,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brussels, the capital of Flanders |url=http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1166590837731&context=1166590833692--EN&p=1166590837731&pagename=flanders_site%2FView |publisher=Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610162638/http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1166590837731&context=1166590833692--EN&p=1166590837731&pagename=flanders_site%2FView |archivedate=10 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> and so do the [[Parliament of the French Community]] and the [[Government of the French Community]].

The 19 [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]] (French: {{lang|fr|communes}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|gemeenten}}) of the Brussels-Capital [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Regions|Region]] are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders.<ref name="list">{{cite web |title=Brussels-Capital region / Communes |website=Brussels Capital-Region / Région de Bruxelles-Capitale |url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml |accessdate=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606023552/http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml |archivedate=6 June 2004 }}</ref><ref name="OECD">{{cite web |title=Managing across levels of government |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/43/1902434.pdf |year=1997 |publisher=OECD |pages=107, 110 |accessdate=5 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213027/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/43/1902434.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 }}</ref> Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.<ref name="OECD" />

In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region.<ref name="roots">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/_places/bel_places.html|title=Municipalities (1795-now)|last=Picavet|first=Georges|date=29 April 2003|publisher=Georges Picavet|accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref> Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975.<ref name="roots" /> However, several municipalities outside the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the [[City of Brussels]] throughout its history, including [[Laeken]], [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] in 1921.<ref name="Brussels">{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/2bru/index.html|title=Brussels Capital-Region|date=4 June 2005 |publisher=Georges Picavet |accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref>

The largest municipality in area and population is the City of Brussels, covering {{convert|32.6|km2|sqmi|1}} and with 145,917 inhabitants; the least populous is [[Koekelberg]] with 18,541 inhabitants. The smallest in area is [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], which is only {{convert|1.1|km2|sqmi|1}}, but still has the highest population density in the region, with {{Convert|20822|PD/km2}}. [[Watermael-Boitsfort]] has the lowest population density in the region, with {{Convert|1928|PD/km2}}.

There is much controversy on the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanised region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the "19 baronies" and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peterdedecker.eu/blog/2009/01/23/fusie_van_de_19_brusselse_gemeenten|title=Fusie van de 19 Brusselse gemeenten|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/nieuws/4237|title=De Brusselse Baronieën|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903210953/http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/nieuws/4237|archivedate=3 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of [[Antwerp]] or to structures of other capitals like the [[London boroughs|boroughs]] in [[London]] or ''[[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]]'' in [[Paris]], to keep politics close enough to the citizen.<ref>{{cite web |title= Bruxelles vaut bien une messe?|url=https://www.vub.ac.be/home/academischeopening/archief/0506/Bruxellesvautbienunemesse.pdf |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812052919/https://www.vub.ac.be/home/academischeopening/archief/0506/Bruxellesvautbienunemesse.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 }}</ref>

==Brussels-Capital Region==
[[File:Regions of Belgium.svg|thumb|Regions of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Region]]}}{{legend|#2385d2|Brussels-Capital Region}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]}}]]

===Political status===
{{see also|Partition of Belgium#Brussels|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Brussels}}The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] and the [[Flemish Region]]. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions; the three communities being the other component. Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].

Since the split of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[provinces of Belgium]], nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].

===Institutions===
{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Parlement région Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Brussels Parliament building]]|alt=]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking—parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] (French: {{lang|fr|ordonnances}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|ordonnanties}}), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

===Agglomeration of Brussels===
Before the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=1971072630&table_name=wet|website=Belgiëlex.be|publisher=FOD Justitie|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>

The Brussels Agglomeration had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.

After the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.

==French and Flemish communities==
{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}
[[File:Communities of Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish & French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]
The [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire française}} or COCOF) and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: {{lang|nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie}} or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).<ref>Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.<ref>Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.

===Common Community Commission===
A bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire commune}}, COCOM, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie}}, GGC) also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers—not the secretaries of state—of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

==International institutions==

Brussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including [[Right of asylum|political refugees]] ([[Karl Marx]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Léon Daudet]], for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or [[expatriate]]s, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.

Brussels has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Moroccan (mainly [[Riffian people|Riffian]] and [[Berbers|Berber]]) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former [[Belgian overseas colonies|Belgian colonies]], such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

People of foreign origin make up nearly 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npdata.be/Data/Vreemdelingen/Vreemde-afkomst/1990-2008/tabellen/Portaal/index.html |title=2008: aantal en % Vreemde Afkomst per nationaliteit / gemeente |language=nl |trans-title=2008: number and % Foreign origin per nationality / municipality |website=Npdata.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> of the population of Brussels, most of whom have been [[Naturalization|naturalised]] following the great 1991 reform of the naturalisation process. About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian [[Europe]]an origin (mainly expatriates from France, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and 36% are of another background, mostly from [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]] and Sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/155-Vreemde-afkomst/Vreemde-afkomst.htm |title=2.738.486 inwoners van vreemde afkomst in België op 01/01/2012 |language=nl |trans-title=2,738,486 inhabitants of foreign origin in Belgium on 01/01/2012 |website=Npdata.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Since the founding of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] ([[Brabantian dialect]] to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically [[Belgian French]]) as the majority language and ''[[lingua franca]]''. This language shift, the [[Francization of Brussels|''Francisation'' of Brussels]], is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after [[Belgium]] became [[Belgian revolution|independent]] and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.<ref name="service">{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105023238/http://www.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archivedate=5 January 2007 |title=Wallonie – Bruxelles |publisher=Le Service de la langue française |date=19 May 1997 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name="laval">{{cite web|language=French |url=https://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |title=Villes, identités et médias francophones: regards croisés Belgique, Suisse, Canada |publisher=[[University of Laval]] |location=Quebec |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619145722/http://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref>

French-speaking immigration contributed to the ''Frenchification'' of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries—mainly France—came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the ''Frenchification'' was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was carried out by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] inhabitants themselves. The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for [[social mobility]].<ref name="nlb">{{cite book |language=Dutch |chapter-url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |chapter=9.

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that the [[City of Brussels]] plays as capital in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communitarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] ''arrondissement'' be separated from the Brussels Region (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish ''arrondissement''). BHV was divided mid-2012.

The original Dutch dialect of Brussels (known as ''Brussels'', and also sometimes called [[Marols]]) is a form of [[Brabantic]] (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient [[Duchy of Brabant]]) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called ''Brusseleers'', many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.

For their French-speaking {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}}, it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}} (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in [[Klaipėda|Memel]]), [[Walloons|Walloon]] (for people who migrated from the Walloon Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels, it is mainly either Flemish or {{lang|nl|Brusselaar}} (Dutch for an inhabitant), and often both. For the ''Brusseleers'', many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two [[Francophonie|francophone]] countries: France and [[Morocco]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/brussels?set_language=en&uri=ff80818115f323cb0115f659b6880039 |title=IS 2007 – Population (Tableaux) |publisher=Bruxelles.irisnet.be |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref> The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region.<ref name="standaard">{{cite news |title=Van autochtoon naar allochtoon |quote=Meer dan de helft van de Brusselse bevolking is van vreemde afkomst.

In recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/flemish-education-minister-engli-news-531233 |title=English should be Brussels' official language, Flemish minister says |publisher=EurActiv |date= 2013-10-23|accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref> Even though some people want English to be used as an unofficial compromise language between Dutch and French, French remains the ''lingua franca'', and laws still require Dutch and French translations in most cases. The acceptance of English as a language for communication with the city's public servants depends entirely on their knowledge of this language, though they must accept questions in French and Dutch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dutchstudies/an/SP_LINKS_UCL_POPUP/SPs_dutch/brussels/taalgebruik.html |title=Language usage in Brussels (nl)|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>

The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other member states, speak many languages like [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic languages|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and (increasingly) [[English language|English]]. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

Historically, Brussels has been predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], especially since the expulsion of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the 16th century. This is clear from the large number of historical churches in the region, particularly in the [[City of Brussels]]. The pre-eminent Catholic [[cathedral]] in Brussels is the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]], serving as the [[co-cathedral]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels]]. On the northwestern side of the region, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|National Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] is a Minor Basilica and parish church and the [[List of largest church buildings|14th largest church building]] in the world. The [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] holds the tombs of many members of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian royal family]], including all the former [[List of Belgian monarchs|Belgian monarchs]], within the [[Royal Crypt (Belgium)|Royal Crypt]].

In reflection of its multicultural makeup, Brussels hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]. Minority faiths include [[Islam]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Judaism]], and [[Buddhism]]. According to a 2016 survey, approximately 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves [[Catholics]] (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were [[Irreligion|non-religious]], 23% were [[Muslim]] (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were [[Protestant Christian|Protestants]] and 4% were of another religion.<ref name=2016religion>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/1106186/article/actualite/belgique/2016-01-28/75-des-francophones-revendiquent-une-identite-religieuse |title=75% des francophones revendiquent une identité religieuse |language=fr |author=Elodie Blogie |date=28 January 2016 |website=Le Soir.be |access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>

Recognised religions and [[Secularism in Belgium|laicism]] enjoy public funding and school courses. It was once the case that every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 had to choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion—or laicist—inspired morals. However, in 2015, the Belgian Constitutional court ruled religious studies could no longer be required in the primary and secondary education system.<ref>{{cite web |author=Andy Furniere |date=13 March 2015 |url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/education/lessons-religion-no-longer-obligatory-belgium |title=Lessons in religion no longer obligatory in Belgium |website=Flanders Today |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Brussel 052 Jubelpark.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Great Mosque of Brussels]] is the seat of the Islamic and Cultural Centre of Belgium.]]
Brussels has a large concentration of [[Islam in Belgium|Muslims]], mostly of Moroccan, Turkish, Syrian and Guinean ancestry. The [[Great Mosque of Brussels]], located in the [[Cinquantenaire|Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]], is the oldest [[mosque]] in Brussels. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown. It was estimated that, in 2005, people of Muslim background living in the Brussels Region numbered 256,220 and accounted for 25.5% of the city's population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.<ref name="BuG 100">{{cite web |url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/100/ |title=Bericht uit het Gewisse |language=Dutch |trans-title=Message from the Gewisse |quote=In België wonen 628.751 moslims(Berekend aantal), 6,0% van de bevolking.

===Architecture===
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], and [[French Baroque architecture|Louis XIV]] styles on the [[Grand Place]] to the [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] buildings of the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Brussels Architecture Sights |url=https://www.brussels.info/architecture/ |website=brussels.info |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Bruxelles Manneken Pis.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Manneken Pis]] is a well-known public sculpture in Brussels.]]
Very little [[medieval architecture]] is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from that period are mostly found in the historic centre (called {{lang|fr|Îlot Sacré}}), [[Saint-Géry Island|''Saint Géry''/''Sint-Goriks'']] and {{lang|fr|Sainte-Catherine}}/{{lang|nl|Sint Katelijne}} neighbourhoods. The [[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] remains a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the [[First walls of Brussels|first city walls]] were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the [[Second walls of Brussels|second walls]] is the [[Halle Gate]]. The [[Grand Place]] is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/857 |title=La Grand-Place, Brussels |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref> The square is dominated by the 15th century [[Flamboyant]] [[Brussels Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] ''[[Museum of the City of Brussels|Breadhouse]]'' and the Baroque [[guildhall]]s of the [[Guilds of Brussels]]. [[Manneken Pis]], a fountain containing a small bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and [[symbol]] of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/brussels-folklore/mannekenpis |title=Manneken Pis |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>

The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the ''Royal Quarter''/''Coudenberg'' area, around [[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]] and the [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Royal Square]]. Examples include the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], the [[Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg|Church of St. James on Coudenberg]], the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Palace of the Nation]] (Parliament building), the [[Academy Palace]], the [[Palace of Charles of Lorraine]], the [[Palace of the Count of Flanders]] and the [[Egmont Palace]]. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around [[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]] and Barricades' Square. Some additional landmarks in the centre are the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries]] (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe, the [[Congress Column]] (1859), the former [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] building (1873) and the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883), designed by [[Joseph Poelaert]], in [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] style, and reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5357/ |title=Le Palais de Justice de Bruxelles |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>

Located outside the centre, in a greener environment, are the [[Cinquantenaire|Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]] with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, and in [[Laeken]], the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]] and the Royal Domain with its large [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|greenhouses]], as well as the [[Museums of the Far East]].

Also particularly striking are the buildings in the [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Art Nouveau]] style, most famously by the Belgian architects [[Victor Horta]], [[Paul Hankar]] and [[Henry Van de Velde]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/10-must-visit-world-class-art-nouveau-buildings-in-brussels |title=10 must-visit world-class Art Nouveau buildings in Brussels! |website=visit.brussels |language=en |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-most-remarkable-art-nouveau-houses-in-brussels/ |title=The Most Remarkable Art Nouveau Houses In Brussels |last=Stambolic |first=Ana |work=Culture Trip |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> Some of Brussels' municipalities, such as [[Schaerbeek]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]], and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau and have many buildings in that style. The [[Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta]]—[[Hôtel Tassel]] (1893), [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1894), [[Hôtel van Eetvelde]] (1895) and the [[Horta Museum]] (1901)—have been listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005 |title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels) |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=14 February 2017}}</ref> Another example of Brussels' Art Nouveau is the [[Stoclet Palace]] (1911), by the Viennese architect [[Josef Hoffmann]], designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1298 |title=Stoclet House |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref>

[[Art Deco in Brussels|Art Deco]] structures in Brussels include the Residence Palace (1927) (now part of the [[Europa building]]), the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Centre for Fine Arts]] (1928), the [[Villa Empain]] (1934), the [[Forest Town Hall|Town Hall of Forest]] (1938), and the [[Le Flagey|Flagey Building]] (formerly known as the ''Maison de la Radio'') on [[Place Flagey|Eugène Flagey Square]] (1938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the [[Interwar period|interwar era]] were also constructed in that style, such as the [[Church of St. John the Baptist, Molenbeek|Church of St. John the Baptist]] (1932) in Molenbeek and the [[Church of St. Augustine, Forest|Church of St. Augustine]] (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with [[Byzantine Revival architecture|neo-Byzantine]] elements, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Koekelberg]] is one of the [[List of largest church buildings|largest]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] basilicas by area in the world, and its cupola provides a panoramic view of Brussels and its outskirts. Another example are the exhibition halls of the Centenary Palace, built for the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|1935 World's Fair]] on the [[Heysel Plateau|''Heysel''/''Heizel'' Plateau]] in northern Brussels, and home to the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brusselslife.be/en/article/top-10-of-art-deco-buildings-in-brussels|title=Top 10 of Art Deco buildings in Brussels|work=Brussleslife|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Atomium]] is a symbolic {{convert|103|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Modern architecture|modernist]] structure, located on the Heysel Plateau, which was originally built for the [[Expo '58|1958 World's Fair]] (Expo '58). It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a [[unit cell]]), magnified 165&nbsp;billion times. The architect [[André Waterkeyn|A.

Since the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels ([[Madou Plaza Tower|Madou Tower]], [[Rogier Tower]], [[Proximus Towers]], [[Finance Tower]], the [[World Trade Center (Brussels)|World Trade Center]], among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's [[central business district|main business district]]: the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]] (also called ''Little Manhattan''), near [[Brussels-North railway station]]. The [[South Tower (Brussels)|South Tower]], standing adjacent to [[Brussels-South railway station]], is the [[List of tallest structures in Belgium|tallest building in Belgium]], at {{cvt|148|m}}. Along the [[North–South connection]], is the State Administrative City, an administrative complex in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. The postmodern buildings of the [[Espace Leopold|Espace Léopold]] complete the picture.

The city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the [[Maison du Peuple|''Maison du Peuple''/''Volkshuis'']] by Victor Horta, a process known as ''[[Brusselization|Brusselisation]]''.

===Folklore===
[[File:GeantsMeyboom2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Meyboom]] giants in Brussels, a [[UNESCO]] [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]]]
Brussels' identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country.
* The [[Ommegang of Brussels|Ommegang]], a folkloric costumed procession, commemorating the [[Joyous Entry]] of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] in the city in 1549, takes place every year in July. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional giant puppets, such as [[Saint Michael]] and [[Saint Gudula]], and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. The parade ends in a [[Medieval pageant|pageant]] on the [[Grand Place]].
* The [[Meyboom]], an even-older folk tradition of Brussels (1308), celebrating the May tree—in fact, a bad translation of the Dutch ''tree of joy''—takes place paradoxically on 9 August. After parading a young [[beech]] in the city, it is planted in a joyful spirit with lots of music, ''Brusseleir'' songs, and giant puppets. It was recognised as an expression of [[intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], as part of the bi-national inscription "[[Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/brussels-folklore/meyboom |title=Meyboom |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/processional-giants-and-dragons-in-belgium-and-france-00153 |title=Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France – intangible heritage – Culture Sector – UNESCO |website=ich.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> The celebration is reminiscent of the town's long-standing (folkloric) feud with [[Leuven]], which dates back to the [[Middle Ages]].
* Another good introduction to the ''Brusseleir'' [[Marols|local dialect]] and way of life can be obtained at the [[Royal Theatre Toone]], a folkloric theatre of [[marionette]]s, located a stone's throw away from the Grand Place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toone.be/spip.php?page=choix_lang|title=Théâtre Royal de Toone|website=www.toone.be|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>
* The [[St V|Saint-Verhaegen]] (often shortened to ''St V''), a folkloric student procession, celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], is held on 20 November.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Brussels waffle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffles]].]]
Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffle]], its [[chocolate]], its [[French fries]] and its numerous types of [[beer]]s. The [[Brussels sprout]], which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.<ref>{{cite web | last = Oliver | first = Lynne |title = Food Timeline: Brussels sprouts | date = 11 April 2011 | url =http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq.html#brussels | accessdate =9 April 2012 }}</ref>

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 [[restaurant]]s, and a number of high quality bars. [[Belgian cuisine]] is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are many [[Coffeehouse|cafés]], [[bistro]]s and the usual range of international [[Fast food restaurant|fast food]] chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; [[Coffeehouse|coffee houses]] are called {{lang|fr|salons de thé}}. Also widespread are [[brasserie]]s, which usually offer a variety of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of [[French cuisine]] with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include [[Brussels waffle]]s (gaufres) and [[mussels]] (usually as [[moules frites|''moules-frites'']], served with fries). The city is a stronghold of [[chocolate]] and [[praline]]s manufacturers with renowned companies like [[Côte d'Or (chocolate)|Côte d'Or]], [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]] and [[Godiva Chocolatier|Godiva]]. Pralines were first introduced in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian [[chocolatier]] of Swiss origin, in the Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/travel/brussels-the-chocolate-trail.html|title=Brussels: The Chocolate Trail|last=Thomas|first=Amy M.|date=22 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Numerous [[friteries]] are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.

As well as other [[Beer in Belgium|Belgian beer]]s, the [[Spontaneous fermentation|spontaneously fermented]] [[lambic]] style, brewed in and around Brussels, is widely available there and in the nearby [[Zenne|Senne]] valley where the wild yeasts which ferment it have their origin. [[Kriek lambic|Kriek]], a cherry lambic, is available in almost every bar or restaurant in Brussels.

Brussels is known as the birthplace of the [[Chicory|Belgian Endive]]. The technique for growing [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]] in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729081033/http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 July 2005|title=Food Museum, Belgium Endive|date=29 July 2005|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref>

The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Université libre de Bruxelles]], a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, has three campuses in the city,<ref>{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Université libre de Bruxelles |publisher=[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] |url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html |accessdate=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203153418/http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html |archivedate=3 December 2007 }}</ref> and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] university, has about 10,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the University: Culture and History|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}</ref> Both universities originate from a single ancestor university, founded in 1834, namely the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]], which was split in 1970, at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/about|title=About the University: Culture and History|website=www.vub.ac.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

[[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]] (also known as UCLouvain Saint-Louis – Bruxelles) was founded in 1858 and is specialised in social and human sciences, with 4,000 students, and located on two campuses in the [[City of Brussels]] and [[Ixelles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Institution: Historique |publisher=Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis |url=http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html |accessdate=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223141339/http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}</ref>

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the French-speaking [[UCLouvain|University of Louvain]] (UCLouvain), which has 10,000 students in the city with its medical faculties at [[UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe|UCLouvain Bruxelles Woluwe]] since 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html|title=L'histoire de l'UCLouvain à Bruxelles|publisher=[[Université catholique de Louvain]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114142407/http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html|archivedate=14 November 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=9 December 2007}}</ref> in addition to its [[UCLouvain Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uclouvain.be/en/sites/st-gilles|title=UCLouvain Bruxelles Saint-Gilles|last=|first=|date=|website=UCLouvain|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107224911/https://uclouvain.be/en/sites/st-gilles|archive-date=7 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and UCLouvain's Dutch-speaking sister [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/unit/52230448/@@org|title=KU Leuven organisational chart: KU Leuven, Campus Brussels|publisher=[[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> (offering bachelor's and master's degrees in economics & business, law, arts, and architecture; 4,400 students). In addition, the University of Kent's [[Brussels School of International Studies]] is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.

Also a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking [[Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|Conservatoire Royal]] and its [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] equivalent, the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Petite histoire du Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|publisher=Conservatoire Royal|url=http://www.conservatoire.be/historique.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel |publisher=[[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] |url=http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&nr=1 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013223138/http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&nr=1 |archivedate=13 October 2006 }}</ref>

===Primary and secondary education===
Most of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the [[French-speaking Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]], with close to 80% going to French-speaking schools, and roughly 20% to Dutch-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the [[International School of Brussels]], with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2{{frac|2}} and 18,<ref>{{cite web|title=ISB Profile |publisher=[[International School of Brussels]] |url=http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017045221/http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |archivedate=17 October 2007 }}</ref> the [[British School of Brussels]], and the four [[European School]]s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]]. The combined student population of the four [[European School]]s in Brussels is around 10,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Background|publisher=[[European Schools|Schola Europaea]]|url=http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|accessdate=9 December 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231041405/http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Libraries===

===Science and technology===
{{Main|Science and technology in Brussels}}
Science and technology in Brussels is well developed with the presence of several [[List of universities in Belgium|universities]] and research institutes.

The [[Museum of Natural Sciences|Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]] houses the world's largest hall completely dedicated to [[dinosaur]]s, with its collection of 30 [[fossil]]ised ''[[Iguanodon]]'' skeletons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.naturalsciences.be/en/museum/exhibitions-view/239/394/390 |title=Permanent Exhibition " Dinosaur Gallery |website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> The [[Planetarium (Belgium)|Planetarium]] of the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]] is one of the largest in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museum/102-planetarium-of-brussels |title=Planetarium of Brussels |website=Brussels' Museums |access-date=10 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075316/http://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museum/102-planetarium-of-brussels |archive-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Healthcare===
{{Main|List of hospitals in Belgium#Brussels-Capital Region}}
Brussels is home to a thriving [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and [[health care]] industry which includes pioneering [[biotechnology]] research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large [[science park]]s: [[Da Vinci Research Park]] and [[Erasmus Research Park]]. There are five [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]], a [[military hospital]] and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitals.be/|title=Belgian Association of Hospitals|website=www.hospitals.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

==Transport==

===Air===
[[File:Brussels Airlines Airbus A319 landing at Brussels Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Airlines]] Airbus A319 landing at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]]]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:
* [[Brussels Airport|Brussels-National Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], {{convert|12|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of the capital;
* [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located in [[Gosselies]], a part of the city of [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south-west of Brussels;
* [[Melsbroek Air Base]], located in [[Steenokkerzeel]], is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.
The first two are also the main airports of Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brussels.info/airports/|title=Brussels.info – Brussels Airports|website=www.brussels.info|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

===Water===
[[File:Eugène Boudin 005.jpg|thumb|''The Saint Catherine Dock'', Eugène Boudin (1871)|left]]
Since the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the [[port of Brussels]]. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the {{lang|fr|Place Sainte-Catherine|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Katelijneplein|italic=no}}, it lies today to the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called Willebroek Canal), which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.

Moreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels–Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north–south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronquières inclined plane|Ronquières]] and the lifts of [[Strépy-Bracquegnies]].

The importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year—almost 2,000 per day—which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221507/http://www.port.brussels/en|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Train===

[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ([[Intercity Express|ICE]] train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured).]]
The Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Brussels-Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|Brussels-North]], which are also the busiest of the country.<ref name=":2"/> Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|accessdate=11 Feb 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212004929/http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (1hr 50min) and [[Frankfurt]] (2hr 57min) by the German [[Intercity Express|ICE]].

The train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North–South connection]], with Brussels Central Station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.

The [[City of Brussels]] has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]] and [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]]. In the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at [[Berchem-Sainte-Agathe railway station|Berchem-Sainte-Agathe]], [[Boitsfort railway station|Boitsfort]], [[Boondael railway station|Boondael]], [[Bordet railway station|Bordet (Evere)]], [[Etterbeek railway station|Etterbeek]], [[Evere railway station|Evere]], [[Forest-East railway station|Forest-East]], [[Forest-South railway station|Forest-South]], [[Jette railway station|Jette]], [[Meiser railway station|Meiser (Schaerbeek)]], [[Moensberg railway station|Moensberg (Uccle)]], [[Saint-Job railway station|Saint-Job (Uccle)]], [[Schaerbeek railway station|Schaarbeek]], [[Uccle-Calevoet railway station|Uccle-Calevoet]], [[Uccle-Stalle railway station|Uccle-Stalle]], Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle), [[Merode station|Merode]] and [[Watermael railway station|Watermael]].

===City public transport===
The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|STIB/MIVB]] is the local [[public transport]] operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.

====Metro====
[[File:Rame "Boa".jpg|thumb|[[Brussels metro]] carriage at [[Erasmus metro station]]|left]]
The [[Brussels metro]] dates back to 1976,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/brussels/|title=Brussels Metro and Tram Network|work=Railway Technology|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> but underground lines known as the [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] have been serviced by tramways since 1968. It is the only [[rapid transit]] system in Belgium ([[Antwerp Pre-metro|Antwerp]] and [[Charleroi Metro|Charleroi]] both having [[light rail]] systems). The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three ''premetro'' lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The network and vehicles">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?_guid=8086313c-3883-3410-f894-ec3da5b1280e&l=en|title=The network and vehicles|work=STIB-MIVB|access-date=27 February 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the metro network within the region has a total of 69 metro and ''premetro'' stations. The metro is an important [[Transport in Brussels|means of transport]], connecting with six [[railway station]]s of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]] (NMBS/SNCB), and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Lijn]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] bus stops.

====Trams and buses====
A comprehensive [[Brussels buses|bus]] and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] covers the region. {{As of|2017}}, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which – lines T3, T4 and T7 – qualify as ''premetro'' lines). The total route length is {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}},<ref name="The network and vehicles"/> making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The network and vehicles"/> Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called Noctis. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/4353 |title=Metro, tram and bus in Brussels |website=City of Brussels |language=en |access-date=27 February 2017|date=2016-10-28 }}</ref>

====Ticketing====
An interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will, in the next few years,{{when|date=September 2016}} be augmented by the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]] (RER/GEN), which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.

====Other public transport====
[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|''[[Villo!]]'' bicycles in Brussels]]Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio, in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by [[Villo!]]. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.

===Road network===
[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi|Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat]] is one of the city's main streets.|alt=]]
In medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north–south (the modern {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogstraat|italic=no}}) and east–west ({{lang|fr|Chaussée de Gand|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Gentsesteenweg|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue du Marché aux Herbes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Grasmarkt|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue de Namur|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Naamsestraat|italic=no}}). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the [[Grand Place]], in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built [[covering of the Senne|over the River Senne]], [[small ring (Brussels)|over the city walls]] and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.

Today, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform [[INRIX]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/brussels-and-antwerp-have-worst-traffic|title=Brussels and Antwerp have worst traffic|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Flanders Today}}</ref>

Brussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the [[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]] (N to [[Breda]]), [[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]] (E to [[Maastricht]]), [[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]] (E to [[Aachen]]), [[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]] (SE to [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]) [[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]] (S to [[Reims|Rheims]]), N6 (S to [[Maubeuge]]), N7 (SW to [[Lille]]), [[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]] (W to [[Koksijde]]) and N9 (NW to [[Ostend]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?/nb.html |title=Belgian N roads |publisher=Autosnelwegen.net |accessdate=29 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529013951/http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?%2Fnb.html |archive-date=29 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Usually named {{lang|fr|chaussées}}/{{lang|nl|steenwegen}}, these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The region is skirted by the [[European route E19]] (N-S) and the [[European route E40|E40]] (E-W), while the [[E411]] leads away to the SE. Brussels has an [[beltway|orbital motorway]], numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the ''Ring''. It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as the ''Pentagon'', is surrounded by an inner ring road, the [[small ring (Brussels)|''Small Ring'']] (French: {{lang|fr|Petite Ceinture}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Kleine Ring}}), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the [[second walls of Brussels|second set of city walls]] following their demolition. The [[Brussels Metro line 2|metro line 2]] runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the ''Pentagon'' have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circulatieplan.be/en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514223301/http://circulatieplan.be/en |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 May 2015 |title=Circulation plan |accessdate=26 August 2015 }}</ref>

On the eastern side of the region, the R21 or ''[[Greater ring (Brussels)|Greater Ring]]'' (French: {{lang|fr|Grande Ceinture}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Grote Ring}}) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from [[Laeken]] to [[Uccle]]. Some ''premetro'' stations (see [[Brussels metro]]) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to [[Uccle|Saint-Job]].

===Fire department===
The Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly known by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://be.brussels/about-the-region/regional-bodies/fire-brigade |title=SIAMU |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=24 March 2017}}</ref> It is a class X fire department and the largest [[Fire department|fire service]] in Belgium in terms of annual operations, equipment, and personnel. It has 9 [[fire station]]s, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional [[firefighter]]s. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French–Dutch).

==Parks and green spaces==
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Brussels}}

Brussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/parks-and-green-space |title=Parks and green spaces |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref> Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the [[peri-urbanisation]] of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central ''Pentagon'', 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.

Many parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city.
