The '''National Women's Soccer League''' ('''NWSL''') is a professional [[Women's association football|women's soccer]] league owned by the teams, and under a management contract with the [[United States Soccer Federation]]. At the top of the [[United States soccer league system|United States league system]], it represents the sport's highest level in the United States.

The NWSL was established in 2012 as the successor to [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (2007–2012), which was itself the successor to [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (2001–2003). The league began play in 2013 with eight teams, four of which were former members of Women's Professional Soccer (Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue FC, and Western New York Flash).<ref>{{cite web|title=Will NWSL be a success?

Since the league's [[2013 National Women's Soccer League season|inaugural season]] in 2013, four teams have been crowned NWSL Champions, awarded to the playoff winner, and four teams have claimed the [[NWSL Shield]], awarded to the team in first place at the end of the regular season. The current champions are the [[North Carolina Courage]] (2019). The current shield winners are also the Courage, who in 2018 became the first team to claim both the NWSL Championship and the NWSL Shield in the same season and repeated the feat in 2019.

== Competition format ==
The NWSL season runs from April to November, with each team scheduled for 24 regular-season games (12 home and 12 road games).<ref name="new_playoffs">{{cite news |title=NWSL Announces Innovative 2021 Competition Framework |url=https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/nwsl-announces-innovative-2021-competition-framework |accessdate=18 November 2020 |publisher=NWSL |date=18 November 2020}}</ref> At the end of the regular season, the team with the highest point total is awarded the [[NWSL Shield]].

== History ==

=== Founding ===
After [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (WPS) officially folded in April 2012, the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF or US Soccer) announced a roundtable for discussion of the future of women's professional soccer in the United States.  The meeting, which included representatives from USSF, WPS teams, the [[USL W-League|W-League]] (ceased operation in 2015), and the [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL), was held in June. By November, after much discussion, owners from the Chicago Red Stars, Boston Breakers and US Soccer recruited an additional six teams.  Compared to WPS, the teams would intentionally operate at a lower cost structure and manage growth in a sustainable way.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kassouf |first=Jeff |url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/06/29/new-womens-soccer-league-in-the-works-for-2013-following-meeting-in-chicago/ |title=New women's soccer league in the works for 2013 following meeting in Chicago |work=The Equalizer |date=June 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bell |first=Jack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sports/soccer/national-womens-soccer-league-to-begin-play.html |title=Another Attempt at Women's Circuit, but With a Twist |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2013 |url-access=limited|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

In November 2012, it was announced that there would be eight teams in a new women's professional soccer league that was yet to be named at the time of the announcement, with national team players subsidized by the [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]], the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA) and the [[Mexican Football Federation]] (FMF). The three federations would pay for the salaries of their national team players (24 from the US, 16 from Canada, and 12 to 16 from Mexico) to aid the teams in creating world-class rosters while staying under the salary cap. The players would be distributed evenly (as possible) among the eight teams in an [[NWSL Player Allocation|allocation process]]. USSF would be hired through a contract to manage aspects of the league.  The teams own the league and periodically revisit the Management relationship with US Soccer and/or others.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lauletta |first=Dan |url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/11/21/eight-teams-to-start-new-womens-pro-soccer-league-in-2013/ |title=Eight teams to start new women's pro soccer league in 2013 |work=The Equalizer |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref>

On November 29, 2012, it was announced that [[Cheryl Bailey]] had been named executive director in the new league. Bailey had previously served as general manager of the [[United States women's national soccer team]] from 2007 to 2011, which included leading the support staff for the U.S. team during the [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] and [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]]s, as well as the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. During her tenure with the [[United States women's national soccer team|women's national team]], she was in charge of all areas of administration including interfacing with clubs, team travel, payroll, and working with FIFA, CONCACAF, and other federations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cheryl Bailey Named Executive Director of New Women's Soccer League|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/Cheryl-Bailey-Named-Executive-Director-of-New-Womens-Soccer-League.aspx|publisher=US Soccer|accessdate=December 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203043736/http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/Cheryl-Bailey-Named-Executive-Director-of-New-Womens-Soccer-League.aspx|archivedate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>

[[Nike, Inc.]] was selected as league sponsor, providing apparel to all teams as well as the game ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/13776702/nike-extends-partnership-nwsl-2019|title=Nike extends partnership with NWSL through 2019|work=espnW|agency=Associated Press|date=September 30, 2015}}</ref>

=== Early years ===
The first NWSL game was held on April 13, 2013, as the [[Portland Thorns FC|Portland Thorns]] visited [[FC Kansas City]], playing to a 1–1 draw in front of a crowd of 6,784 fans at [[Shawnee Mission District Stadium]]. [[Renae Cuellar]] scored the first goal in league history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fckansascity.com/2013/04/14/fc-kansas-city-earns-point-in-league-opener/|title=FC Kansas City earns point in league opener|publisher=FC Kansas City|date=April 14, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timbers.com/news/2013/04/christine-sinclair-penalty-kick-leads-thorns-fc-1-1-draw-against-fc-kansas-city|title=Christine Sinclair penalty kick leads Thorns FC to 1–1 draw against FC Kansas City|publisher=Portland Thorns|date=April 13, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref> The 2013 season saw regular-season attendance average of 4,270, with a high of 17,619 on August 4 for Kansas City at Portland.<ref name=equalizer_2013attend>{{cite web|last=Jorstad |first=Keith |url=http://womens.soccerly.com/2013/08/20/nwsl-attendance-watch-week-19/ |title=NWSL Attendance Watch Week 19 |work=The Equalizer |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/News/2013Q3/744390.html |title=FC Kansas City earn playoff berth with 3–2 win over Thorns FC |publisher=National Women's Soccer League |date=August 4, 2013 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817101227/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/News/2013Q3/744390.html |archivedate=August 17, 2014 }}</ref>

The NWSL became the first U.S. professional women's soccer league to reach nine teams with the addition of [[Houston Dash]], backed by [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) team [[Houston Dynamo]], in [[2014 National Women's Soccer League season|2014]]; expansion interest, particularly from MLS and USL teams, has continued.<ref name=fortune2015>{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Gwen|title=Pro women's soccer is having a moment.

The league also became the first professional women's league in the US to play more than three seasons when the league kicked off its fourth season in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCauley|first1=Kevin|title=NWSL has survived longer than any other women's soccer league. |url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2016/4/15/11409908/nwsl-2016-season-wages-cap-salary-minimum|work=SBNation|accessdate=December 20, 2017|date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

The 2020 season was initially postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and replaced with the [[2020 NWSL Challenge Cup]], a special competition hosted in the [[Salt Lake City]] region with no spectators. The cup began in late June, making the NWSL the first major U.S. team sports league to return to play.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goff |first=Steven |date=June 26, 2020 |title=NWSL Challenge Cup opens this weekend, making women's soccer first U.S. team sport back |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/25/nwsl-challenge-cup-opens-this-weekend-making-womens-soccer-first-us-team-sport-back/ |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 6, 2020}}</ref> The league was the recipient of a federal loan through the [[Paycheck Protection Program]], which it used to compensate players before the competition was able to begin.<ref>{{cite news |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=July 2, 2020 |title=Federal Loan Saved a Soccer Season Nearly Lost to the Pandemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/soccer/nwsl-ppp-loan.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 6, 2020}}</ref>

Nine NWSL teams are spread across the United States, with a tenth joining the league in 2021 and an eleventh in 2022. Each club is allowed a minimum of 20 players on their roster, with a maximum of 22 players (26 including supplemental players) allowed at any time during the season.<ref name=2013_roster_rules>{{cite web|title=2013 Roster Rules|url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/about/732760.html|publisher=National Women's Soccer League|accessdate=September 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520105930/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/about/732760.html|archive-date=May 20, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Originally, each team's roster included up to three allocated [[United States women's national soccer team|American national team]] players, up to two allocated [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico women's national team]] players, and up to two allocated [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canadian national team]] players via the [[NWSL Player Allocation]] and subsequent trades.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWSL allocation easier said than done|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/8836654/espnw-nwsl-allocation-easier-said-done|work=espnW|accessdate=September 22, 2013|first=Graham|last=Hays|date=January 11, 2013}}</ref> In addition, each team has four spots each season available for international players; these spots may be traded to other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/about/732760.html|title=2014 Roster Rules – National Women's Soccer League|website=|publisher=National Women's Soccer League|accessdate=January 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520105930/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/about/732760.html|archive-date=May 20, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The remaining roster spots must be filled by domestic players from the United States. Teams fill their rosters via a number of [[List of NWSL drafts|drafts]] and 4–6 discovery player signings.<ref name=2013_roster_rules /> Mexico no longer allocates players to the NWSL, having established [[Liga MX Femenil|its own women's league]] in 2017, and the numbers of allocated players and international players on each team vary each year due to trades.

Of the 10 teams set to play in the [[2021 NWSL season|2021 season]], four are affiliated with men's [[Major League Soccer]] teams, two are affiliated with men's [[USL Championship]] teams, one is affiliated with a [[Football in France|French]] [[Ligue 1]] team (as well as its women's counterpart in the [[Division 1 Féminine]]),<ref name="OL Reign">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/ol-groupe-to-become-majority-owner-of-national-womens-soccer-leagues-reign-fc |title=OL Groupe to become majority owner of National Women's Soccer League's Reign FC |publisher=National Women's Soccer League |date=December 19, 2019 |accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> and three are independent.

=== Expansion ===

Soon after launch, the league reportedly planned to expand to ten teams for 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Giase, Frank|url=http://www.nj.com/soccer-news/index.ssf/2012/12/on_soccer_new_womens_pro_leagu.html|title=On Soccer: New women's pro league has backing of U.S. Soccer Federation|work=The Star-Ledger|date=December 11, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> Potential candidates included groups not accepted as part of the original eight; groups from the Los Angeles area (joint effort from the [[LA Strikers]] and [[Pali Blues]])<ref>{{cite web|last=Kassouf |first=Jeff|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/11/20/no-los-angeles-pali-in-womens-soccer-league/|title=Established LA ownership excluded for geography|work=The Equalizer|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> and from [[Hartford, Connecticut]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Kassouf |first=Jeff|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/11/21/connecticut-hopes-for-expansion-bid-again/|title=Connecticut hopes for expansion bid, again|work=The Equalizer|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> were confirmed failed bids, as was one from the [[Seattle Sounders Women]].

During the second offseason, expansion talk grew rapidly, with three established men's teams ([[Real Salt Lake]] of MLS, the [[Indy Eleven]] of NASL, and the [[Pittsburgh Riverhounds]] of USL Pro) expressing interest in joining NWSL, as well as an unattached group from Atlanta.  There was also rumored or suggested interest from three men's teams in California, though none of those groups made official statements.  Despite this interest, it was announced in late April 2015 that there would be no expansion for the 2016 season.

However, after the well-publicized success of the US Women's National soccer team, renewed interest in NWSL expansion caused reports from the owners' meeting that "a new team in 2016 has not been ruled out", with potential expansion news to be revealed within a month.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lowdown: World Cup bump engulfs NWSL|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2015/07/16/the-lowdown-world-cup-bump-nwsl-commissioner-jeff-plush/|work=The Equalizer|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref> Commissioner Jeff Plush said that over a dozen interested groups had contacted the league in the post-World-Cup weeks; MLS team [[Orlando City SC]] was one of the first newly interested groups made public.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 minutes with NWSL commissioner Jeff Plush on the Women's World Cup, role models, league expansion|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/07/08/10-minutes-nwsl-commissioner-jeff-plush-womens-world-cup-role-models-expansion|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Orlando City likely to add NWSL Women's team|url=http://otowns11.com/2015/07/20/orlando-city-likely-to-add-nwsl-womens-team/|publisher=Fansided|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Women's Soccer League set to capitalize on U.S.'s World Cup title|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/national-women-s-soccer-league-set-to-capitalize-on-u-s--s-world-cup-title-213933319.html|work=Yahoo!

On November 16, 2017, it was announced that [[Real Salt Lake]] would expand into the NWSL beginning in the 2018 season. The Salt Lake City team, shortly thereafter unveiled as [[Utah Royals FC]], is officially considered a new franchise that replaced FC Kansas City. There were hopes but no plans for [[Sporting Kansas City]] to take over operations of FCKC, but Sporting KC was focused on sustainability with its [[USL Championship|United Soccer League]] reserve team, then known as Swope Park Rangers and now as [[Sporting Kansas City II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/real-salt-lake-purchases-fc-kansas-city-nwsl-relocation-news-analysis |title=Real Salt Lake team to replace FC Kansas City: What it means for the NWSL |first=Richard |last=Farley |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=November 15, 2017 |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}</ref>

== Organization ==

=== Stadiums and attendance ===
{{Main|List of National Women's Soccer League stadiums|National Women's Soccer League attendance}}

As of the most recent 2019 season, the NWSL uses nine primary stadiums, with two teams taking select matches to larger venues in their areas. The highest attendance in the league's history occurred on August 11, 2019 at [[Providence Park]] when a sellout crowd of 25,218 watched [[Portland Thorns FC]] defeat the visiting [[North Carolina Courage]] 2–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2019/08/portland-thorns-fight-back-to-earn-massive-2-1-win-over-north-carolina-courage.html |title=Portland Thorns fight back to earn massive 2-1 win over North Carolina Courage in front of record-setting crowd |first=Jamie |last=Goldberg |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=August 11, 2019 |accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref> Of the [[National Women's Soccer League attendance#Individual game highest attendance|10 most-attended matches in league history]], only one was not at Providence Park: the first-ever home match for the [[Orlando Pride]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://fw.to/cGEeK3d |title=Orlando Pride rolls to 3–1 win before record crowd in home debut |work=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>

===Squad formation and salaries===
In each season, teams receive a [[salary cap]] that limits their total spending on players. The salaries of allocated players from the United States, Canadian, and (formerly) Mexican national teams are paid by their respective federations instead of their NWSL clubs, and do not count against their club's salary cap.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pramuk|first1=Jacob|title=For US soccer wages, women still fall far short of men|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/06/for-us-soccer-wages-women-still-fall-far-short-of-men.html|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=November 9, 2015|date=July 6, 2015}}</ref>

Non-allocated players, including international players, also have minimum and maximum salary limits. Players allocated by the US and Canadian federations are exempt from these limits. The same applied to allocated Mexican players, but the arrangement between the Mexican federation and the NWSL ended when Mexico established [[Liga MX Femenil|its own women's league]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWSL make modest increase to salary cap ahead of 2016 season|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2016/04/nwsl_make_modest_increase_to_s.html|date=April 2, 2016|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fairer wages for women to dominate CBA talks|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/06/24/fairer-wages-women-dominate-cba-talks|work=The World Game|publisher=Special Broadcasting Service|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2017 Roster Rules |url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/2017-roster-rules |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606103819/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/2017-roster-rules |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Starting in 2019, the maximum roster size was expanded to 22 and the minimum to 20, with an additional four supplemental spots for players earning minimum salary that do not count against the salary cap.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Purdy |first1=Jacqueline |title=NWSL increases roster size ahead of the 2019 season |url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/nwsl-increases-roster-size-ahead-of-the-2019-season |accessdate=January 10, 2019 |publisher=National Women's Soccer League|date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> With this change, teams must carry at least 20 players and could carry as many as 26 players at any given time.

===Players' association===
{{Main|National Women's Soccer League Players Association}}

Active non-allocated players, including unpaid amateur players, announced their formation of a players' association on May 15, 2017, as the first step toward forming a union. Membership is limited to non-allocated players because allocated players are members of their own federation-affiliated labor organizations and negotiate contracts covering NWSL play with their respective national federations instead of the league or clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/05/15/nwsl-players-association-union|title=Non-allocated NWSL players take step toward forming union|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 15, 2017|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite tweet|user=NWSL_PA|author=[[Meghann Burke]]|number=864177972223381504|title=[FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE] NWSL Non-Allocated Players Announce the Formation of a Players Association|date=May 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2017/05/15/non-allocated-players-form-nwsl-players-association/|title=Non-allocated players form NWSL Players Association|work=The Equalizer|date=May 15, 2017|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref> The association is led by civil rights attorney and former [[Women's Professional Soccer#WPS Players Union|WPS players' union]] organizer [[Meghann Burke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifpro.org/news/interview-burke-leads-us-union-for-female-players/en/|title=INTERVIEW: Burke Leads New US Union|publisher=[[FIFPro]]|first=Monica|last=Gonzalez|date=May 16, 2017|accessdate=June 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625021626/https://www.fifpro.org/news/interview-burke-leads-us-union-for-female-players/en/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The association was legally recognized by the NWSL on November 15, 2018, allowing players to bring formal requests to the league.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://equalizersoccer.com/2018/11/15/nwslpa-legally-recognized-union-nwsl-relationship/|title=NWSLPA becomes legally recognized as union, opening doors to further improvements|work=The Equalizer|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>

==League championships==
{{see also|NWSL Playoffs}}
The winner of the NWSL Championship, the final match of the [[NWSL Playoffs]], determines that season's league champion. The playoff tournament is organized by the league in a format similar to other North American professional sports leagues. At the conclusion of the regular season, the top six teams in the standings earn a berth to the tournament.<ref name="new_playoffs" /> Prior to 2021, only the top four teams qualified for the playoffs.

The first NWSL Championship was played on September 1, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/9622884/portland-thorns-win-nwsl-championship|title=Portland Thorns win NWSL championship|website=espnW|access-date=March 9, 2019}}</ref> As of 2018, the record for the most championships is shared by the Portland Thorns FC and former club FC Kansas City, with two titles each. The record for the most championships lost is held by Reign FC, who have lost the title game two times since the inaugural season in 2013.

{{As of|2020}}, four clubs have been crowned NWSL Champions: Portland Thorns FC (2), FC Kansas City (2), North Carolina Courage (2), and Western New York Flash (1). Four clubs have claimed the NWSL Shield: North Carolina Courage (3), OL Reign (2), Portland Thorns FC (1), and Western New York Flash (1). In 2018, the North Carolina Courage became the first team to win both the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship in the same season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/article218872660.html|title=NC Courage shuts out Portland Thorns for NWSL championship, avenging 2017 title game|website=charlotteobserver|access-date=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

{{main|NWSL Challenge Cup}}

In 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] prevented the regular season from starting.

===2014===
On May 28, 2014, the NWSL signed a one-year agreement with [[ESPN]] to televise nine games of the [[2014 NWSL season]]. The matches included three regular season and three playoff matches on ESPN2, as well as 3 regular season games [[live-streamed]] on [[ESPN3]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/812790.html |title=NWSL and ESPN announce national broadcast agreement |publisher=National Women's Soccer League |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530233834/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/812790.html |archive-date=May 30, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On June 30, 2015, the NWSL announced a one-year agreement with Fox Sports once more to cover ten matches. Three regular season and three playoff matches were televised on [[Fox Sports 1|FS1]], and four live-streamed on [[Fox Sports Go]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jamie|last=Goldberg|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2015/06/nwsl_and_fox_sports_announce_n.html|title=NWSL and Fox Sports announce national broadcast deal|work=The Oregonian|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref> The agreement was extended into 2016 under another one-year contract, covering three regular season matches and the three playoff matches, once again on FS1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2016/04/fox_sports_to_broadcast_six_nw.html|work=The Oregonian|title=Fox Sports to broadcast six NWSL games in 2016|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref>

===2017–2018===
On February 2, 2017, the NWSL announced a three-year agreement with [[A&E Networks]], in which [[Lifetime (TV channel)|the Lifetime network]] broadcast 22 regular-season matches as the ''NWSL Game of the Week'' at 4 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]] on Saturday afternoons, as well as three post-season matches. This marked the first time that the NWSL had a weekly broadcast window throughout the entire season. As part of the deal, A&E Networks purchased a 25% equity stake in the NWSL and were granted two seats on the league's board. The company also formed a joint venture with the league known as NWSL Media to oversee the league's marketing and broadcast rights, and Lifetime became a league-wide kit sponsor for all players. This deal marked the first time Lifetime had broadcast sports since the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name="sbn-streaming">{{cite web|title=NWSL, go90 announce exclusive streaming partnership|url=http://www.blackandredunited.com/washington-spirit-womens-soccer/2017/4/13/15282800/nwsl-streaming-go90-2017|website=Black and Red United (SBNation)|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name="deadline-nwslae">{{cite web|title=Lifetime To Air National Women's Soccer League Games As A+E Networks Kicks in For Equity Stake|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/lifetime-national-womens-soccer-league-tv-deal-ae-networks-stake-1201900415/|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name="variety-nwsllifetime">{{cite web|title=A+E Networks, National Women's Soccer League Ink Major Deal|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/womens-soccer-lifetime-1201975617/|website=Variety|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-e-networks-buys-stake-in-national-womens-soccer-league-1486048177|title=A+E Networks Buys Stake in National Women's Soccer League|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=Keach|last=Hagey|date=February 2, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/sports/soccer/nwsl-lifetime-television-sponsor.html|title=In A&E, Women's Soccer League Gets an Investor and a Bigger Platform|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew|last=Das|date=February 2, 2017|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref> Lifetime also streamed the game of the week in the United States via its website, and internationally in the NWSL website and [[iOS]] app. The remaining games were initially streamed exclusively by [[go90]] in the United States under a digital rights deal with [[Verizon Communications]], and through the NWSL website internationally.<ref name="sbn-streaming"/>

The quality of the streams through go90 faced criticism, with sportswriters, users, and players and team staff criticizing the service for its inconsistent quality and arguing that the NWSL's growth could be harmed by go90's relative lack of reach and prominence when compared to YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themaneland.com/2017/5/15/15639158/go90-deal-puts-nwsl-and-orlando-pride-in-dire-situation|title=Go90 Deal Puts NWSL and Orlando Pride in Dire Situation|work=The Maneland (SB Nation)|first=Sean|last=Rollins|date=May 15, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebluetestament.com/2017/5/1/15496402/the-nwsls-go90-deal-could-be-hurting-the-league-fc-kansas-city|title=The NWSL's go90 Deal Could Be Hurting the League|work=The Blue Testament (SB Nation)|first=Chad C|last=Smith|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> ''The Equalizer'' noted that the app was prone to crashing, did not have the same wide device support as YouTube,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2017/04/13/lee-nwsl-missed-the-mark-with-go90/|title=Lee: NWSL missed the mark with go90|work=The Equalizer|first=Allison|last=Lee|date=April 13, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> and that the telecasts themselves suffered from their own technical problems (such as poor camera angles and glitches with graphics), but that the streams were good when they worked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2017/05/17/run-of-play-technical-difficulties/|title=Run of Play: Technical Difficulties|work=The Equalizer|first=Chelsey|last=Bush|date=May 17, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> On May 19, 2017, the league announced that they would additionally stream games on the NWSL website and app in the U.S. until the technical issues with go90 were rectified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2017/05/19/nwsl-to-offer-streams-on-league-site-app/|title=NWSL to offer streams on league site, app|work=The Equalizer|access-date=October 23, 2017}}</ref>

After Houston Dash player [[Rachel Daly]] collapsed on the pitch after a match in [[Houston]], on May 27 – where the [[heat index]] was reportedly over 100 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] – she was carried off on a stretcher and hospitalized for heat illness. League operations director Amanda Duffy subsequently announced that the ''NWSL Game of the Week'' matches, many of which were slated for the hottest parts of the day in humid cities such as Houston, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Cary, North Carolina]], would be rescheduled to allow for longer hydration breaks. Some ''Game of the Week'' matches changed to other venues, and teams not scheduled for television were granted more flexibility in rescheduling kickoffs for player safety. The league also adopted new procedures for addressing heat and rescheduling matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/rachel-daly-collapses-is-taken-off-on-stretcher-at-end-1795609863|title=Rachel Daly Collapses, Is Taken Off on Stretcher at End of Match|work=[[Deadspin]]|first=Timothy|last=Burke|date=May 27, 2017|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/article/73769/nwsl-measures-adopted-to-deal-with-afternoon-heat.html|title=NWSL: Measures adopted to deal with afternoon heat|work=Soccer America|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref>

On June 6, 2018, it was announced that six ''Game of the Week'' matches through the remainder of the season would move to evening kickoffs and air on [[ESPNews]] (which is owned by a [[ESPN Inc.|sister venture]] to A&E Networks), in an effort to ensure the safety of players, as well as improve attendance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2018/06/nwsl_hopes_moving_games_to_eve.html|title=NWSL hopes moving games to evening slot on ESPNews will boost attendance, ensure player safety|work=The Oregonian|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> Go90 shut down in July 2018; the remaining games not aired on television were moved back to the NWSL website for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2018/07/nwsl_will_stream_games_on_webs.html|title=NWSL will stream games on website in August and September after go90 shuts down|work=The Oregonian|access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref>

===2019===
On February 20, 2019, the NWSL announced that A&E Networks had pulled out of its broadcasting agreement with the league one season early. A&E's stake in NWSL Media was given back to the league, but Lifetime will remain a kit sponsor. NWSL president Amanda Duffy said the changes would give the league and its teams finer control over its media and sponsorship agreements, and expected to announce a new television rights deal soon. [[Verizon Media]] remained the U.S. digital rightsholder to the league, but the streams moved from go90 to the [[Yahoo! Sports]] website and apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://equalizersoccer.com/2019/02/20/nwsl-a-e-networks-end-partnership-early-analysis-world-cup-year-tv-streaming-rights/|title=The NWSL's partnership with A+E is over.
