'''World War&nbsp;II''' ('''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved [[World War II by country|the vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all the [[great power]]s—forming two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. In a state of [[total war]], directly involving more than 100&nbsp;million [[Military personnel|personnel]] from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War&nbsp;II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, resulting in [[World War II casualties|70 to 85 million fatalities]], with more civilians than military personnel killed. Tens of millions of people died due to [[genocide]]s (including [[the Holocaust]]), premeditated death from [[starvation]], [[massacre]]s, and disease. [[Air warfare of World War II|Aircraft played a major role]] in the conflict, including in [[strategic bombing]] of population centres, and the only uses of [[nuclear weapon]]s in war.

World War&nbsp;II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours: [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]], with war in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the largest land theatre of war in history]] and trapping the Axis, crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]].

Japan, which aimed to [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|dominate Asia and the Pacific]], was [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]] including an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor]]. Following a US declaration of war against Japan, which followed one from the UK, the European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity with their ally. Japan soon captured much of the Western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|the Italian mainland]], and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union [[Stalin's ten blows|regained its territorial losses]] and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany by the Western Allies]] and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender on its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the first atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]], on 6&nbsp;August 1945, and [[Nagasaki]], on 9&nbsp;August. Faced with an imminent [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]], the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] on 9 August, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. In the wake of the war, [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] and [[Occupation of Japan|Japan were occupied]], and [[war crimes]] tribunals were conducted [[Nuremberg Trials|against German]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|Japanese leaders]]. Despite their [[Italian war crimes#World War II|well documented war crimes]], mainly perpetrated in Greece and Yugoslavia, Italian leaders and generals were often pardoned, thanks to diplomatic activities.<ref name="CROWCASS">The Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, Consolidated Wanted Lists, Part 2 - Non-Germans only (March 1947), Uckfield 2005 (Naval & University Press); pp. 56&ndash;74</ref>

World War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, and the victorious [[great power]]s—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.

Others follow the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War&nbsp;II include the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] on 3 October 1935.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Horin|1943|p=169}}; {{Harvnb|Taylor|1979|p=124}}; Yisreelit, Hevrah Mizrahit (1965).

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than with the formal [[surrender of Japan]] on 2 September 1945, which officially [[End of World War II in Asia|ended the war in Asia]].

== Background ==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

=== Europe ===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

Despite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War{{nbsp}}I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76–78]}} [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] emerged in several European states in the same period. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], and promising the creation of a "[[New Roman Empire]]".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[File:Nürnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [[military globalisation]]; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy joined the following year.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=298–99}}

=== Asia ===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in [[Chinese Civil War|a civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} and [[Central Plains War|new regional warlords]]. In 1931, an [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], staged the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invade Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: "Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies."</ref> After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present [[Second United Front|a united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benito Mussolini]] inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]], 1935]]
{{Main|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}

The [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Ethiopia#Etymology|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L.

Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, [[Appeasement|but the League did little]] when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–32}} The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=289}} Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

=== Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|The [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], sparked fears abroad in Europe that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties.]]

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis did: altogether Mussolini sent to Spain more than 70,000 ground troops and 6,000 aviation personnel, as well as about 720 aircraft.{{sfn|Neulen|2000|page=25}} The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War{{nbsp}}II but generally favoured the Axis.{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=271}} His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of [[Blue Division|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=146}}

=== Japanese invasion of China (1937) ===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=342}} and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |access-date=26 June 2015 |magazine=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629092821/http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/ |archive-date=29 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |access-date=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124070956/http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx |archive-date=24 November 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[appeasement|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[Germans|ethnic German]] population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–22}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to Hungary, and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia]] and subsequently split it into the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and a pro-German [[client state]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=pp. 143–44 (2008 ed.)}} Hitler also delivered an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]] on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the [[Klaipėda Region]], formerly the German ''Memelland''.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=461–62}}

Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the [[Free City of Danzig]], the United Kingdom and France [[Anglo-Polish military alliance#British Guarantee to Poland|guaranteed their support for Polish independence]]; when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy conquered Albania]] in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]].{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=330}} Shortly after the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|Franco]]-[[Anglo-Polish military alliance|British]] pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the [[Pact of Steel]].{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=234}} Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] and the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=471}}

The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border.

Immediately after that, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland, and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/DAP-Poland/Campaign-II.html#chapter5|title=The German Campaign In Poland (1939)|access-date=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524013551/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/DAP-Poland/Campaign-II.html#chapter5|archive-date=24 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in [[Southeast Asia]], the two powers signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=114}} By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=195}}

Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-3.html 69]}} He, therefore, decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|negotiations took place]] to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=810–12}}

Following the Japanese [[false flag]] [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American [[USS Panay incident|gunboat ''USS Panay'']] in 1937, and the 1937-38 [[Nanjing Massacre]] [[Japan–United States relations#1937–1941|Japanese-American relations deteriorated]]. In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions, the [[Export Control Act]]s, which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.{{r|ibiblio_1940}}<ref>{{cite journal|year=1983 |title=Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy, 1931-1941 |journal=U.S. Department of State Publication |issue=1983 |pages=87–97 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/paw/}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceC">Maechling, Charles.

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November, a new government under [[Hideki Tojo]] presented an interim proposal as its final offer.

In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429222741/http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 |date=29 April 2013 }}.

=== Axis advance stalls (1942–43) ===
[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]] seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]], January 1943]]

On 1 January 1942, the [[Four Policemen|Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–14}}—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=904}}

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally [[Thailand in World War II|Thailand]] had almost fully conquered [[Japanese invasion of Burma|Burma]], [[Malayan campaign|Malaya]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–67, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|resistance by Filipino and US forces]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–74}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese [[Battle of Changsha (1941–42)|victory at Changsha]].{{sfn|Ch'i|1992|p=158}} These easy victories over the unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.{{sfn|Perez|1998|p=145}}

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–12}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]] in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&pg=PA19 Chevrier & Chomiczewski & Garrigue 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818213357/https://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&pg=PA19 |date=18 August 2018 }}, p. 19.</ref> In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.</ref>

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-027-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwa0000gilb/page/259 259] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwa0000gilb/page/259 |access-date=26 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719123035/https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwa0000gilb/page/259 |archive-date=19 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna–Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and [[Operation Ke|withdrew their troops]].{{sfn|Hane|2001|p=340}} In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, [[Arakan Campaign 1942–43|an offensive into the Arakan region]] in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.{{sfn|Marston|2005|p=111}} The second was the [[Chindits#Operation Longcloth|insertion of irregular forces]] behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|p=9}}

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=31}} In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch Peninsula]] and at [[Second Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]],{{sfn|Read|2004|p=764}} and then launched their main [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|oil fields of the Caucasus]] and occupy the [[Kuban]] [[steppe]], while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split [[Army Group South]] into two groups: [[Army Group A]] advanced to the lower [[Don (river)|Don River]] and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while [[Army Group B]] headed towards the [[Volga|Volga River]]. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=p. 100 (2008 ed.)}}

By mid-November, the Germans had [[Battle of Stalingrad|nearly taken Stalingrad]] in bitter [[urban warfare|street fighting]]. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an [[Operation Uranus|encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad]],{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=239–65}} and an assault on the [[Operation Mars|Rzhev salient near Moscow]], though the latter failed disastrously.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=119}} By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=383–91}} and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another [[Third Battle of Kharkov|attack on Kharkov]], creating a [[Salient (military)|salient]] in their front line around the Soviet city of [[Kursk]].{{sfn|Erickson|2001|p=142}}

Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, [[Second Happy Time|the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast]].{{sfn|Milner|1990|p=52}} By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Crusader]], in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=224–28}} In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the [[Battle of Gazala#Gazala line|Gazala line]] by early February,{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=91}} followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=31}} Concerns the Japanese might use bases in [[French Madagascar|Vichy-held Madagascar]] caused the British to [[Battle of Madagascar|invade the island]] in early May 1942.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=380–81}} An Axis [[Battle of Gazala|offensive in Libya]] forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were [[First Battle of El Alamein|stopped at El Alamein]].{{sfn|Rich|1992|p=178}} On the Continent, raids of Allied [[commando]]s on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous [[Dieppe Raid]],{{sfn|Gordon|2004|p=129}} demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.{{sfn|Neillands|2005}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|second attack against El Alamein]]{{sfn|Keegan|1997|p=277}} and, at a high cost, managed to [[Operation Pedestal|deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta]].{{sfn|Smith|2002}} A few months later, the Allies [[Second Battle of El Alamein|commenced an attack of their own]] in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.{{sfn|Thomas|Andrew|1998|p=8}} This attack was followed up shortly after by [[Operation Torch|Anglo-American landings in French North Africa]], which resulted in the region joining the Allies.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}} Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the [[Case Anton|occupation of Vichy France]];{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}} although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to [[Scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon|scuttle their fleet]] to prevent its capture by German forces.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Bonner|Bonner|2001|p=24}} The Axis forces in Africa withdrew into [[Tunisia]], which was [[Tunisian campaign|conquered by the Allies]] in May 1943.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Collier|2003|p=11}}

In June 1943 the British and Americans began [[Combined Bomber Offensive|a strategic bombing campaign]] against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and "[[dehousing|de-house]]" the civilian population.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/ETO-Summary.html#tc "The Civilians"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105044932/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/ETO-Summary.html#tc |date=5 November 2013 }} the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Summary Report (European War)</ref> The [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|firebombing of Hamburg]] was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.{{sfn|Overy|1995|pp=119–20}}

After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and US forces were sent to [[Aleutian Islands campaign#Allied response|eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians]].{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|p=164}} Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to [[Operation Cartwheel|isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands]], and [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=610}} By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also [[Operation Hailstone|neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]]. In April, the Allies launched an operation to [[Western New Guinea campaign|retake Western New Guinea]].{{sfn|Rottman|2002|p=228}}

In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany [[Battle of Kursk|attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge]]. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences,<ref>{{Harvnb|Glantz|1986}}; {{Harvnb|Glantz|1989|pp=149–59}}.</ref> and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=592}} This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=32}}

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own [[Operation Kutuzov|counter-offensives]], thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=595}} giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=90}} The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified [[Panther–Wotan line]], but the Soviets broke through it at [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk]] and by the [[Battle of the Dnieper|Lower Dnieper Offensive]].{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=50–55}}

On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]], following [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy's armistice with the Allies]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolko|1990|p=45}}</ref> Germany with the help of fascists responded by [[Operation Achse|disarming Italian forces]] that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=362}} and creating a series of defensive lines.{{sfn|Hart|Hart|Hughes|2000|p=151}} German special forces then [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued Mussolini]], who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the [[Italian Social Republic]],{{sfn|Blinkhorn|2006|p=52}} causing an [[Italian Civil War|Italian civil war]].

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By [[Black May (1943)|May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective]], the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Padfield|1998|pp=335–36}}.</ref> In November 1943, [[Franklin D.

The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands]], and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Hideki Tojo]], and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces [[Battle of Leyte|invaded the Filipino island of Leyte]]; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], one of the largest naval battles in history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cook|Bewes|1997|p=305}}.</ref>

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch [[Battle of the Bulge|a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes]] and [[Operation Nordwind|along with the French-German border]] to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at [[Antwerp]] to prompt a political settlement.<ref name="parkerxiii">{{Harvnb|Parker|2004|pp=xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–30}}</ref> By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.<ref name="parkerxiii"/> In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line.

In February, the Soviets [[Silesian Offensives|entered Silesia]] and [[East Pomeranian Offensive|Pomerania]], while [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Western Allies entered western Germany]] and closed to the [[Rhine]] river.

In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to [[Vienna offensive|Vienna]], and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops [[Battle of Königsberg|captured Königsberg]], while the Western Allies finally [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|pushed forward in Italy]] and swept across western Germany capturing [[Battle of Hamburg (1945)|Hamburg]] and [[Battle of Nuremberg (1945)|Nuremberg]].

The Allies established occupation administrations in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]]. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. A [[denazification]] programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.<ref name="Frei 2002 41_66">{{Harvnb|Frei|2002|pp=41–66}}.</ref>

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5&nbsp;billion reichsmarks (27.8&nbsp;billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.</ref> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.<ref name="Milward 1979 138">{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.</ref>

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.<ref name="6Econ3">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p= 3}}.</ref> In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.<ref name="6Econ3"/>

The United States produced about two-thirds of all the munitions used by the Allies in WWII, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.<ref>

Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);<ref name="EncWWII_76">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.</ref> and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).<ref>{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.<ref>{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.</ref> Although [[Missile|guided missiles]] were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably [[Surface-to-air missile|target aircraft]] until some years after the war.

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with [[aircraft carrier]]s and [[submarine]]s. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.<ref name="EncWWII_163">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-84509-079-1|location=Wigston, Leics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of [[trench warfare]] of World War&nbsp;I, which had relied on improved [[artillery]] that outmatched the speed of both [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]], to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.<ref name="EncWWII_125">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=125}}.</ref> In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War{{nbsp}}I,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=978-0-7106-0123-0|year=1982|page=231}}</ref> and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] with increases in speed, armour and firepower.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.<ref name="EncWWII_108">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=108}}.</ref> This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat.
