'''''{{dfn|LGBT}}''''', or '''''{{dfn|GLBT}}''''', is an [[initialism]] that stands for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]]. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''''{{dfn|LGB}}''''', which began to replace the term ''gay'' in reference to the broader [[LGBT community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.<ref>''Acronyms, Initialisms & Abbreviations Dictionary'', Volume 1, Part 1.

As lesbians forged more public identities, the phrase "gay and lesbian" became more common.<ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/> A dispute as to whether the primary focus of their political aims should be [[feminism]] or [[gay rights]] led to the dissolution of some lesbian organizations, including the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], which disbanded in 1970 following disputes over which goal should take precedence.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Esterberg | first1 = Kristen | year = 1994 | title = From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement | journal = Gender and Society | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 424–443 |doi=10.1177/089124394008003008 }}</ref> As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]].

After the elation of change following group action in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.<ref name="Transgender Subjectivities">{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |first2=Jack | last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 978-0-7890-2576-0|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC}}</ref><ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend">{{cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 978-1-56023-287-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC}}</ref> Critics{{like whom|date=September 2018}} said that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]] and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.<ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/> Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.<ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/> LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.<ref name="Exhibition Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/out-of-the-closet |website=[[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]]|access-date=1 October 2016|title=Out of the Closet and Into the Streets}}</ref>

From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBT in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.</ref> Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people gain equal respect.<ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/>  This spurred some organizations to adopt new names, as the [[GLBT Historical Society]] did in 1999.  Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of inclusion.<ref name="The Handbook of Lesb">{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006|isbn= 978-1-56023-496-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC}}</ref><ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/>

Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four-letter initialism.<ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /><ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /> Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.<ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /><ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /> Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]] in 2009 described the LGBT community "the last great minority", noting that "We can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television".<ref name="Advocate 2009-03">{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}</ref>

In 2016, [[GLAAD]]'s Media Reference Guide states that ''LGBTQ'' is the preferred initialism, being more inclusive of younger members of the communities who embrace ''[[queer]]'' as a self-descriptor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=Expanding the Acronym: GLAAD Adds the Q to LGBT|url=http://www.advocate.com/media/2016/10/26/expanding-acronym-glaad-adds-q-lgbt|publisher=Advocate|access-date=30 October 2016|date=2016-10-26}}</ref> However, some people consider ''queer'' to be a derogatory term originating in hate speech and reject it, especially among older members of the community.<ref name="Nadal-2017">{{cite book |last=Nadal |first=Kevin |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVYoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1384 |access-date=3 January 2019 |date=15 April 2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, California |isbn=978-1-4833-8427-6 |page=1384 |oclc=994139871}}</ref>

The terms ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'', ''fluid'' and ''queer-identified'' are regarded as falling under the umbrella term ''bisexual'' (and therefore are considered a part of the [[bisexual community]]).

Bindel refers to a number of possible new initialisms for differing combinations and concludes that it may be time for the alliances to be reformed or finally go "our separate ways".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28130472|title=Viewpoint: Should gay men and lesbians be bracketed together?|author=Julie Bindel|date=2 July 2014|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|access-date=4 July 2014|author-link=Julie Bindel}}</ref> In 2015, the slogan "Drop the T" was coined to encourage [[LGBT rights organization|LGBT organizations]] to stop support of [[transgender]] people; while receiving support from [[TERF|some feminists]]<ref>{{cite news | last=Glover | first=Katie | title=Why it's time to take the T out of LGBT | website=The Independent | date=2015-09-10 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/why-its-time-to-take-the-t-out-of-lgbt-10493352.html | access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=McCloy | first=Spencer | title=Why the LGBT Alliance Could Be on the Brink of Schism | website=The Heritage Foundation | date=2018-07-27 | url=https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/why-the-lgbt-alliance-could-be-the-brink-schism | access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> as well as transgender individuals,<ref>{{cite web | title=Why it's time to remove the T from LGBT | website=Metro News | date=2015-04-06 | url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/04/06/why-its-time-to-remove-the-t-from-lgbt-5116737/ | access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> the campaign has been widely condemned by many [[List of LGBT-related organizations and conferences|LGBT groups]] as [[transphobic]].<ref name=adv>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/11/06/lgbt-groups-respond-petition-asking-drop-t|title=LGBT Groups Respond to Petition Asking to 'Drop the T'|date=6 November 2015|website=www.advocate.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/12/drop-the-t-counter-petition-surpases-original/|title=Signatures for 'Drop The T' counter-petition surpass original - PinkNews · PinkNews|website=www.pinknews.co.uk|date=2015-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/drop-the-t-petition-backlash|title=Why More Than 1,000 People Have Signed a Petition to Drop the "T" From LGBT|first=Condé|last=Nast|website=Teen Vogue}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gay-transphobia-2015-styl_b_8546278|title=Gay Transphobia, 2015 Style|first1=Dana|last1=Beyer|first2=ContributorExecutive|last2=Director|first3=Gender Rights|last3=Maryl|date=12 November 2015|website=HuffPost}}</ref>

Some people advocate the term "minority sexual and gender identities" (MSGI, coined in 2000), so as to explicitly include all people who are not [[cisgender]] and [[heterosexual]]; or ''gender, sexual, and romantic minorities'' (GSRM), which is more explicitly inclusive of [[Romantic orientation|minority romantic orientations]] and [[polyamory]]; but those have not been widely adopted either.<ref name="Bradford Uni">{{cite web | title=Welcome to the Bradford University Minority Sexual and Gender Identity Site! | publisher=Bradford Uni MSGI Society | year=2008 | url =http://lgbt.wikidot.com/ | access-date=2008-09-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/Gender,-Sexual,-and-Romantic-Minorities-%28GSRM%29.html|title=GSRM - Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities|publisher=acronymfinder.com|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-suresha/diversities-may-enrich-lgbtqiap-alphabet-soup_b_3929870.html|title='Diversities' May Enrich 'LGBTQIAP' Alphabet Soup|date=19 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LGBT?

In public health settings, ''MSM'' ("[[men who have sex with men]]") is clinically used to describe men who have sex with other men without referring to their sexual orientation, with ''WSW'' ("[[women who have sex with women]]") also used as an analogous term.<ref>Young, R M & Meyer, I H (2005) The Trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse American Journal of Public Health July 2005 Vol. 95 No. 7.</ref><ref>Glick, M Muzyka, B C Salkin, L M Lurie, D (1994) Necrotizing [[Periodontitis|ulcerative periodontitis]]: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of [[AIDS]] Journal of Periodontology 1994 65 p. 393–397.</ref>
