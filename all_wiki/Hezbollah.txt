In 1982, Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by [[Iran]] primarily to harass the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon]] .<ref name="bbc-hi-me"/> Its leaders were followers of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] that arrived from Iran with permission from the [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|Syrian government]], which [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|occupied Lebanon's eastern highlands]], permitted their transit to a base in the [[Bekaa valley]]<ref name="nybooks">{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17060 |title=In Search of Hezbollah |author=Adam Shatz |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=29 April 2004 |access-date=14 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822195222/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17060 |archive-date=22 August 2006}}</ref>  which was in [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|occupation of Lebanon]] at the time.

=== 1980s ===
{{Main|Lebanese civil war|South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)}}

Hezbollah emerged in [[South Lebanon]] during a consolidation of [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] militias as a rival to the older [[Amal Movement]]. Hezbollah played a significant role in the Lebanese civil war, opposing [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|American forces in 1982–83]] and opposing Amal and [[Syria]] during the 1985–88 [[War of the Camps]]. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon<ref name="bbc-hi-me"/> following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut.<ref>Avi Shlaim (2001) ''The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World'' W.W.

In 2006, former Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Barak]] stated, "When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south.

=== After 1990 ===
In the 1990s, Hezbollah transformed from a revolutionary group into a political one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation of Hezbollah. Unlike its uncompromising revolutionary stance in the 1980s, Hezbollah conveyed a lenient stance towards the Lebanese state.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Mediterranean Politics |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=Summer 1998 |pages=103–134 |title=The strategy and tactics of Hizballah's current Lebanonization process|doi=10.1080/13629399808414643 |last1=Ranstorp |first1=Magnus }}</ref>

In 1992 Hezbollah decided to participate in elections, and [[Ali Khamenei]], [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader of Iran]], endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, [[Subhi al-Tufayli]], contested this decision, which led to a schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.<ref>Alagha (2006), pp. 41–44</ref>

In 1997 Hezbollah formed the multi-confessional [[Lebanese Resistance Brigades|Lebanese Brigades to Fighting the Israeli Occupation]] in an attempt to revive national and secular resistance against Israel, thereby marking the "Lebanonisation" of resistance.<ref>Alagha (2006), p. 47</ref>

=== Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO) ===
Whether the [[Islamic Jihad Organization]] (IJO) was a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' used by Hezbollah or a separate organization, is disputed. According to certain sources, IJO was identified as merely a "telephone organization",<ref>Marius Deeb, Militant Islamic Movements in Lebanon: Origins, Social Basis, and Ideology, Occasional Paper Series (Washington, DC, Georgetown University, 1986) p.19</ref><ref>al-Nahar, 7 September 1985</ref> and whose name was "used by those involved to disguise their true identity."<ref>''al-Nahar al-Arabi'', 10 June</ref><ref>''Ma'aretz'', 16 December 1983</ref><ref>''Le Point'', 30 July 1987</ref><ref>''al-Shira'', 28 August 1988</ref><ref>''Nouveau Magazine'', 23 July 1988</ref> Hezbollah reportedly also used another name, "Islamic Resistance" (''al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''), for attacks against Israel.<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah'' (1997), p.67</ref>

=== 1985 manifesto ===
On 16 February 1985, Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin issued Hezbollah's manifesto. The ideology presented in it was described as radical.{{By whom|date=January 2020}} Its first objective was to [[Anti-imperialism|fight against]] what Hezbollah described as [[American imperialism|American]] and [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli imperialism]], including the [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon]] and other territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims into an "[[ummah]]", under which Lebanon would further the aims of the [[1979 Revolution]] of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities, excluding those that collaborated with Israel, and support all national movements—both Muslim and non-Muslim—throughout the world.{{which|date=January 2020|reason=Which kinds of national movements?}} The ideology has since evolved, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engeland|first1=Dr Anisseh Van|last2=Rudolph|first2=Ms Rachael M|title=From Terrorism to Politics|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9870-4|page=36}}</ref>{{doubtful|date=May 2019}}

<blockquote>The anti-Semitism of Hezbollah leaders and spokesmen combines the image of seemingly invincible Jewish power&nbsp;... and cunning with the contempt normally reserved for weak and cowardly enemies. Like the [[Hamas]] propaganda for holy war, that of Hezbollah has relied on the endless vilification of Jews as 'enemies of mankind,' 'conspiratorial, obstinate, and conceited' adversaries full of 'satanic plans' to enslave the Arabs. It fuses traditional Islamic anti-Judaism with Western conspiracy myths, Third Worldist anti-Zionism, and Iranian Shiite contempt for Jews as 'ritually impure' and corrupt infidels. [[Sheikh Fadlallah]] typically insists&nbsp;... that Jews wish to undermine or obliterate Islam and Arab cultural identity in order to advance their economic and political domination.<ref>[[Robert S.

== Organization ==
[[File:HezbollahOrgChart.svg|thumb|Organizational chart of Hezbollah, by Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh]]
[[File:Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah 06.jpg|thumb|Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah, the third and current Secretary General of Hezbollah]]

At the beginning many Hezbollah leaders have maintained that the movement was "not an organization, for its members carry no cards and bear no specific responsibilities,"<ref>''al-Nahar al-Arabi walduwali'', 10–16 June 1985; and ''La Revue du Liban'', 27 July – 3 August 1985. quoted in Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.41</ref> and that the movement does not have "a clearly defined organizational structure."<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 64</ref> Nowadays, as Hezbollah scholar [[Magnus Ranstorp]] reports, Hezbollah does indeed have a formal governing structure, and in keeping with the principle of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]] (''velayat-e faqih''), it "concentrate[s]&nbsp;... all authority and powers" in its religious leaders, whose decisions then "flow from the [[Ulema|ulama]] down the entire community."

<blockquote>The supreme decision-making bodies of the Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Assembly) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon, and the Majlis al-Shura al-Karar (the Deciding Assembly), headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters. Within the Majlis al-Shura, there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological, financial, military and political, judicial, informational and social affairs. In turn, the Majlis al-Shura and these seven committees were replicated in each of Hizballah's three main operational areas (the [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]], [[Beirut]], and the South).<ref name="Ranstorp-p45">Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 45</ref></blockquote>

Since the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] is the ultimate clerical authority, Hezbollah's leaders have appealed to him "for guidance and directives in cases when Hezbollah's collective leadership [was] too divided over issues and fail[ed] to reach a consensus."<ref name="Ranstorp-p45" /> After the death of Iran's first Supreme Leader, Khomeini, Hezbollah's governing bodies developed a more "independent role" and appealed to Iran less often.<ref name="Ranstorp-p45" /> Since the [[Second Lebanon War]], however, [[Iran]] has restructured Hezbollah to limit the power of [[Hassan Nasrallah]], and invested billions of dollars "rehabilitating" Hezbollah.<ref>Nahmias, Roee.

Structurally, Hezbollah does not distinguish between its political/social activities within Lebanon and its military/''jihad'' activities against Israel. "Hezbollah has a single leadership," according to [[Naim Qassem]], Hezbollah's second in command. "All political, social and jihad work is tied to the decisions of this leadership&nbsp;... The same leadership that directs the parliamentary and government work also leads jihad actions in the struggle against Israel."<ref>Daragahi, Borzou.

In 2010, Iran's parliamentary speaker [[Ali Larijani]] said, "Iran takes pride in Lebanon's Islamic resistance movement for its steadfast Islamic stance. Hezbollah nurtures the original ideas of Islamic Jihad." He also instead charged the West with having accused Iran with support of terrorism and said, "The real terrorists are those who provide the Zionist regime with military equipment to bomb the people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/larijani-iran-proud-backing-hezbollah |title=Larijani: Iran proud of backing Hezbollah |publisher=Siasat |date=30 July 2010 |access-date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Michel Aoun]] and [[Hassan Nasrallah]] met in Mar Mikhayel Church, [[Chiyah]], and signed a memorandum of understanding between [[Free Patriotic Movement]] and [[Hezbollah]] organizing their relation and discussing Hezbollah's disarmament with some conditions. The agreement also discussed the importance of having normal diplomatic relations with [[Syria]] and the request for information about the Lebanese political prisoners in Syria and the return of all political prisoners and diaspora in [[Israel]].
After this event, Aoun and his party became part of the [[March 8 Alliance]].<ref name=Harris2012>{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&pg=PP2|access-date=7 April 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=274}}</ref>

On 7 May 2008, [[Lebanon]]'s [[2006–2008 Lebanese political protests|17-month-long political crisis]] spiraled out of control.

According to Ahmad Hamzeh, Hezbollah's counterintelligence service is divided into ''Amn al-Muddad'', responsible for "external" or "encounter" security; and ''Amn al-Hizb'', which protects the organization's integrity and its leaders. According to Wege, ''Amn al-Muddad'' "may have received specialized intelligence training in Iran and possibly North Korea".<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|773–774}} The organization also includes a military security component, as well as an External Security Organization (''al-Amn al-Khariji'' or Unit 910) that operates covertly outside Lebanon.<ref name="Wege2" />{{rp|238}}

Successful Hezbollah counterintelligence operations include thwarting the [[CIA]]'s attempted kidnapping of foreign operations chief Hassan Ezzeddine in 1994; the 1997 manipulation of a double agent that led to the [[Shayetet 13#Ansariya Ambush|Ansariya Ambush]]; and the 2000 kidnapping of alleged Mossad agent Elhanan Tannenbaum.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|773}} Hezbollah also collaborated with the Lebanese government in 2006 to detect Adeeb al-Alam, a former colonel, as an Israeli spy.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774}} Also, the organization recruited IDF Lieutenant Colonel Omar al-Heib, who was convicted in 2006 of conducting surveillance for Hezbollah.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|776}} In 2009, Hezbollah apprehended Marwan Faqih, a garage owner who installed tracking devices in Hezbollah-owned vehicles.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774}}

Hezbollah's counterintelligence apparatus also uses electronic surveillance and intercept technologies. By 2011, Hezbollah counterintelligence began to use software to analyze cellphone data and detect espionage; suspicious callers were then subjected to conventional surveillance. In the mid-1990s, Hezbollah was able to "download unencrypted video feeds from Israeli drones,"<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|777}} and Israeli [[SIGINT]] efforts intensified after the 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon. With possible help from Iran and the [[Russia]]n [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], Hezbollah augmented its electronic counterintelligence capabilities, and succeeded by 2008 in detecting Israeli bugs near Mount Sannine and in the organization's fiber optic network.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774, 777–778}}

The '''Lebanese Resistance Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|سرايا المقاومة اللبنانية}} ''Saraya al-Moukawama al-Lubnaniyya''), also known as the '''Lebanese Brigades to Resist the Israeli Occupation''', were formed by Hezbollah in 1997 as a multifaith (Christian, Druze, Sunni and Shia) volunteer force to combat the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon. With the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, the organization was disbanded.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blanford |first=Nicholas |date=2011 |title=Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJWGvIcmODoC&q=resistance+brigades+lebanon+2008&pg=PT582 |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=582 |isbn=978-0-679-60516-4 |access-date=26 April 2014 }}</ref>

In 2009, the Resistance Brigades were reactivated, mainly comprising Sunni supporters from the southern city of [[Sidon]]. Its strength was reduced in late 2013 from 500 to 200–250 due to residents complaints about some fighters of the group exacerbating tensions with the local community.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wariness of Resistance Brigades grows in Sidon|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2013/Nov-13/237718-wariness-of-resistance-brigades-grows-in-sidon.ashx#axzz2zozaKG9W|work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]|date=13 November 2013|access-date=26 April 2014}}</ref>

=== The beginning of its military activities: the South Lebanon conflict ===
{{Main|South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)}}
Hezbollah has been involved in several cases of armed conflict with Israel:
* During the 1982–2000 South Lebanon conflict, Hezbollah waged a guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces occupying Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was based in Southern Lebanon and was firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel from Lebanon. Israel invaded Lebanon to evict the PLO, and Hezbollah became an armed organization to expel the Israelis.<ref name="In the Party of God" /> Hezbollah's strength was enhanced by the dispatching of one thousand to two thousand members of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] and the financial backing of Iran.<ref name="lebarmy6915">{{cite web|url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=6915 |author=Nizar Abdel-Kader |work=Lebanese Army Magazine |title=Iraq and the Future of Gulf Security Cooperation: A Lebanese perspective |access-date=25 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404030400/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=6915 |archive-date=4 April 2006 }}</ref><ref>Third World Quarterly, Vol 14, No 2, 1993, reprinted at Al Mashriq [http://almashriq.hiof.no/ddc/projects/pspa/hamzeh2.html Lebanon's Hizbullah: from Islamic revolution to parliamentary accommodation] Accessed 26 July 2006</ref><ref>Rex A.

Senior officials from Hezbollah warned that they would not hesitate to use weapons to defend Lebanon's natural resources.

{{Main|Assassination of Rafic Hariri}}
On 14 February 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was killed, along with 21 others, when his motorcade was struck by a roadside bomb in Beirut. He had been PM during 1992–1998 and 2000–2004. In 2009, the United Nations special tribunal investigating the murder of Hariri reportedly found evidence linking Hezbollah to the murder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,626412,00.html|title=New Evidence Points to Hezbollah in Hariri Murder|first=Erich|last=Follath|work=Der Spiegel|date=23 May 2009}}</ref>

In August 2010, in response to notification that the UN tribunal would indict some Hezbollah members, [[Hassan Nasrallah]] said Israel was looking for a way to assassinate Hariri as early as 1993 in order to create political chaos that would force Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and to perpetuate an anti-Syrian atmosphere [in Lebanon] in the wake of the assassination. He went on to say that in 1996 Hezbollah apprehended an agent working for Israel by the name of Ahmed Nasrallah – no relation to Hassan Nasrallah – who allegedly contacted Hariri's security detail and told them that he had solid proof that Hezbollah was planning to take his life. Hariri then contacted Hezbollah and advised them of the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/nasrallah-israel-used-secret-agent-to-turn-lebanon-gov-t-against-hezbollah-1.307008|title=Nasrallah: Israel used secret agent to turn Lebanon gov't against Hezbollah|date=9 August 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref> Saad Hariri responded that the UN should investigate these claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lebanon-pm-un-must-probe-claims-of-israeli-complicity-in-hariri-murder-1.307587?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Lebanon PM: UN must probe claims of Israeli complicity in Hariri murder|date=12 August 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref>

==== In the Western world ====
The United States Department of State has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization since 1995. The group remains on Foreign Terrorist Organization and
Specially Designated Terrorist lists. According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], "The U.S. government holds Hezbollah responsible for a number of attacks and hostage takings targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s, including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983, which together killed 258 Americans. Hezbollah's operations outside of Lebanon, including its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish targets in Argentina during the 1990s and more recent training and liaison activities with Shiite insurgents in Iraq, have cemented the organization's reputation among U.S. policy makers as a capable and deadly adversary with potential global reach."<ref>Casey L.

In August 2008, Lebanon's cabinet completed a policy statement which recognized "the right of Lebanon's people, army, and resistance to liberate the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms, Kafar Shuba Hills, and the Lebanese section of Ghajar village, and defend the country using all legal and possible means."<ref name="Nafez Qawas" />

[[Gebran Tueni]], a late conservative Orthodox Christian editor of [[an-Nahar]], referred to Hezbollah as an "Iranian import" and said "they have nothing to do with Arab civilization."

While Hezbollah has supported popular uprisings in [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]], Bahrain and [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]], Hezbollah publicly sided with Iran and Syria in their own [[2011 Syrian uprising|violent repressions of dissent]]. In August 2010, 800 people demonstrated in Beirut against Syrian President Bashar Assad, and police were called in to contain the smaller pro-Syrian rallies that followed.

The Hezbollah Anti-Terrorism Act surgically targets this cancer and will strengthen the position of Lebanese who oppose Hezbollah."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ca28_berman/HATA_Joint_Release.shtml |title=Reps.
