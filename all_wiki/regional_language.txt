A '''regional language''' is a [[language]] spoken in an area of a [[sovereign state]], whether it be a small area, a [[federated state]] or [[province]] or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], "''regional or minority languages''" ''means languages that are:''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population and''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''<ref name=COE-Charter>{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref>

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an [[official language]].

==Influence of number of speakers==
There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be [[official language]]s of sovereign states. For example, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (a regional language of [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], albeit the [[national language]] of [[Andorra]]) has more speakers than [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Danish language|Danish]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Catalan only has 4M L1 speakers}}  A similar situation exists in China, where [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], spoken in southern [[Jiangsu]], northern, and the general area of [[Shanghai]] [[Zhejiang]] by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than [[French language|French]]; [[Yue Chinese]], a [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese regional variety]] spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and nearby areas in [[China]] with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of [[Malaysia]]), outnumbers [[Italian language|Italian]] in number of speakers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019|reason=claim appears to be false in terms of number of Italian speakers}} Dialects of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in [[Fujian]] and in nearby [[Taiwan]], but also in the [[Southeast Asian]] countries of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or [[official language]]. For example:

*The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.
