'''Great American Country''' ('''GAC''') is an American multinational [[pay television]] network that is owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]] Based in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], the channel primarily broadcasts lifestyle programming pertaining to "country" settings, including the [[Heartland (United States)|Heartland]] and [[Southern United States|south]], some of which is sourced from the libraries of its sibling channels. The channel was previously established primarily with a focus on [[country music]]-related content.

As of February 2015, GAC is available to approximately 59.547 million television households (51.2% of pay television customers) in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Great American Country 2003.svg|100px|thumb|left|First Great American Country logo]]
The channel was launched on December 31, 1995, with the first music video to be broadcast on the channel, [[Garth Brooks]]' "[[The Thunder Rolls]]".<ref>[http://www.garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&discoID=22 The Official Garth Brooks Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125032515/http://garthbrooks.com/dialup/index.cfm?id=3&discoID=22 |date=2009-01-25 }}</ref> The channel was originally owned by the [[Centennial, Colorado]]-based [[Jones Radio Network]]. Scripps Networks, which was spun off from the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] in July 2008, acquired Great American Country from Jones Radio Network on October 12, 2004.

In late 2005, television industry trade publication ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' named GAC as one of TV's "Breakout Networks"<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6278792.html Hot & Happening: Breakout Networks - 31 October 2005 - Broadcasting & Cable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> heading into 2006, saying of the channel: "The emerging GAC is a younger, hipper version that respects Nashville's country roads but widens the boulevards."

Great American Country and [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio Networks]] (now [[Cumulus Media]]) formed a partnership to produce a nightly [[radio show]] called ''GAC Nights: Live From Nashville'' hosted by Suzanne Alexander, and co-hosted by [[Storme Warren]] and [[Nan Kelley]]. It was broadcast from its studios at [[Music Row]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The show ran from 2007 to 2009, when it was canceled.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[AT&T U-verse]] dropped Great American Country, and sister networks [[Food Network]], [[Cooking Channel]], [[HGTV]], and [[DIY Network]] on November 5, 2010, due to a [[carriage dispute]] over an increase in [[retransmission consent|retransmission]] fees.<ref>[http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2010/11/atts-u-verse-drops-food-network-hgtv-and-other-scripps-networks.html AT&T's U-verse Drops Food Network, HGTV and Other Scripps Networks], ''Chicago Tribune'', November 5, 2010</ref> Two days later, however, the dispute was resolved.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-11-07/business/ct-biz-att-uverse-1108-20101107_1_u-verse-customers-at-t-u-verse-scripps-networks Food Network, HGTV, Back on U-verse], ''Chicago Tribune'', November 7, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/459564-AT_T_U_Verse_Scripps_Reconnect_On_Carriage_Contract.php AT&T U-verse, Scripps Reconnect on Carriage Contract], ''MultiChannel News'', November 7, 2010</ref>

On October 1, 2013, the network unveiled a new logo inspired by the U.S. flag, dropping the "GAC" acronym in favor of using the Great American Country name in full. The network stated that it wanted to emphasize its expansion from a country music-oriented channel to one with a larger emphasis on "country" as referring to a "sense of place" and lifestyles (citing programming such as ''Celebrity Motor Homes'' and ''Farm Kings'' as examples).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/210484/great-american-country-broadens-expanse.html|title=Great American Country Broadens Expanse|website=MediaPost|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> With the channel's rebranding, the daily music video show ''Daily Countdown'' was renamed ''Great American Playlist''. ''Top 20 Country Countdown'' continued to air (although it was cancelled in December 2018), and the network still offered country music specials including ''Backstory'', ''Introducing'' and ''Origins''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2013/10/02/gac-announces-rebranding-programming-changes/ |title=GAC announces rebranding, programming changes|last=Watts |first=Cindy |work=[[The Tennessean]]|date=October 2, 2013}}</ref>
