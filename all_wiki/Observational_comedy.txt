'''Observational comedy''' is a form of [[humor]] based on the commonplace aspects of [[everyday life]].

==Overview==
British comedians [[Richard Herring]] and [[Jo Caulfield]] wrote in an article that observational comedy "essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home."<ref name="Herring Caulfield">{{cite news|last1=Herring|first1=Richard|last2=Caulfield|first2=Jo|authorlink1=Richard Herring|authorlink2=Jo Caulfield|title=The comedian's toolbox|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/22/comedy4|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 September 2008}}</ref> [[Eddie Izzard]] noted that a comedian's observations "need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act.<ref name="Double"/> [[Douglas Coupland]] writes, "Anybody can describe a pre-[[Wet wipe|moistened towelette]] to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them." He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a "lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units."<ref>{{cite book|last=Grassian|first=Daniel|title=Hybrid Fictions: American Literature and Generation X|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=London|isbn=978-0786416325|page=[https://archive.org/details/hybridfictionsam00gras/page/182 182]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hybridfictionsam00gras/page/182}}</ref>

Observational comedy has been compared to [[sociology]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galea|first=Patrick|title="So what’s the deal with that?" – Observational Comedy and Sociology|journal=[[Electronic Journal of Sociology]]|date=30 January 2012|url=http://www.sociology.org/so-whats-the-deal-with-that-observational-comedy-and-sociology/}}</ref>

==History==
Although observational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s,<ref name="Double"/> one author suggests that it "has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature."<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=John|authorlink=John Byrne (columnist)|title=Writing Comedy|date=2012|publisher=Methuen Drama|location=London|isbn=978-1408146453|page=10|edition=4th}}</ref> Comedians, however, have long been making observational comedy, though it may not have been called that before 1950. [[Will Rogers]], who was similar to [[Mark Twain]] in that his comedic styles observed American plainsman and made fun of him, said, "I just watch the government, and report their activities." [[Shelley Berman]] was one of the pioneers in the field.<ref name="Double"/> [[David Brenner]]'s "brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups",<ref>{{cite news|last=Elber|first=Lynn|title=Comedian David Brenner, 'Tonight' favorite, dies|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/comedian-david-brenner-tonight-favorite-dies|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=16 March 2014|quote=...whose brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups, including Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Platt|first=Larry|title=David Brenner will perform at the Sellersville Theater|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-06-15/entertainment/29660728_1_david-brenner-wash-larry-platt|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=15 June 2011|quote=Brenner gave birth to a generation of "observational" comics - funny men who examined small moments closely and poked fun at life's minutiae.

The British observational comedy tradition began with the Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]]'s performances in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Double|first1=Oliver|title=Stand-Up! on being a comedian|date=1997|contribution=Dave Allen|publisher=Methuen Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0413703200|page=[https://archive.org/details/standuponbeingco0000doub/page/140 140]|quote=This was quite an innovation, because up to this point there had been no tradition of observational comedy in British stand-up.|url=https://archive.org/details/standuponbeingco0000doub/page/140}}</ref>

==Criticism of the term==
[[Richard Zoglin]] considers the term "observational comedy" misleading because it is not "about politics or social issues or the comedian's own autobiography, but simply about everyday life."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoglin|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Zoglin|title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America|date=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1582346250}}</ref>
