{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}
The '''Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament''' ('''CND''') is an organisation that advocates unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] by the [[United Kingdom]], international nuclear disarmament and tighter international arms regulation through agreements such as the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. It opposes military action that may result in the use of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] and the building of [[nuclear power]] stations in the UK.

CND began in November 1957 when a committee was formed, including [[Canon John Collins]] as chairman, [[Bertrand Russell]] as president and [[Peggy Duff]] as organising secretary. The committee organised CND's first public meeting at [[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958. Since then, CND has periodically been at the forefront of the [[peace movement]] in the UK. It claims to be [[Europe]]'s largest [[Single-issue politics|single-issue peace campaign]]. Between 1958 and 1965 it organised the [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], which was held over the [[Easter]] weekend from the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] near [[Aldermaston]] to [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].

==Campaigns==
CND's current strategic objectives are:
* The elimination of British nuclear weapons and global abolition of nuclear weapons. It campaigns for the cancellation of the [[Trident (UK nuclear programme)|Trident programme]] by the British government and against the deployment of nuclear weapons in Britain.
* The abolition of [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular chemical and biological weapons. CND also wants a ban on the manufacture, testing and use of depleted [[uranium]] weapons.
* A nuclear-free, less militarised and more secure Europe. It supports the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It opposes US military bases and nuclear weapons in Europe and British membership of NATO.
* The closure of the [[nuclear power]] industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/about/general/about-cnd.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427223236/http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/about/general/about-cnd.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-27 |title=CND aims and policies |publisher=Cnduk.org |access-date=2011-01-09 }}</ref>

In recent years CND has extended its campaigns to include opposition to US and British policy in the [[Middle East]], rather as it broadened its anti-nuclear campaigns in the 1960s to include opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. In collaboration with the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]], CND has organised [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|anti-war marches]] under the slogan "[[Don't Attack Iraq]]", including protests on 28 September 2002 and [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|15 February 2003]]. It also  organised a vigil for the victims of the [[2005 London bombings]].

CND campaigns against the [[Trident missile]]. In March 2007 it organised a rally in Parliament Square to coincide with the Commons motion to renew the weapons system. The rally was attended by over 1,000 people. It was addressed by Labour MPs [[Jon Trickett]], [[Emily Thornberry]], [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]], [[Michael Meacher]], [[Diane Abbott]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]] who voted against the renewal of Trident, and [[Elfyn Llwyd]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Angus MacNeil]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In the House of Commons, 161 MPs (88 of them Labour) voted against the renewal of Trident and the Government motion was carried only with the support of Conservatives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03038.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319154844/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03038.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 March 2009 |title=Labour Backbench Rebellions since 1997 |date=12 June 2008 |publisher=House of Commons Library}}</ref>

In 2006 CND launched a campaign against nuclear power. Its membership, which had fallen to 32,000 from a peak of 110,000 in 1983, increased threefold after Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] made a commitment to nuclear energy.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cnd-membership-booms-after-nuclear-uturn-408265.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125105911/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cnd-membership-booms-after-nuclear-uturn-408265.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-11-25 |title=CND membership booms after nuclear U-turn |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-17 |access-date=2011-01-09 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Herbert }}</ref>

==Structure==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
CND is based in London and has national groups in Wales, Ireland and [[Scottish CND|Scotland]], regional groups in Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, the East Midlands, Kent, London, Manchester, Merseyside, Mid Somerset, Norwich, South Cheshire and North Staffordshire, Southern England, South West England, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands and Yorkshire, and local branches.

There are five "specialist sections": Trade Union CND, [[Christian CND]], [[Labour CND]], Green CND and Ex-Services CND,<ref name=constitution>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/images/stories/cnd_docs/cnd_constitution.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20121114113532/http://www.cnduk.org/images/stories/cnd_docs/cnd_constitution.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-11-14 |title=CND Constitution |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref> which have rights of representation on the governing council. There are also parliamentary, youth and student groups.

==History==

===The First Wave: 1957–1963===
[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Bertrand Russell]] (centre), alongside his wife Edith and [[Ralph Schoenman]] with [[Michael Randle]] (second left), leading an anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961]]

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was founded in 1957 in the wake of widespread fear of nuclear conflict and the effects of nuclear tests. In the early 1950s Britain had become the third atomic power, after the US and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and had recently [[Operation Grapple|tested an H-bomb]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120511081337/http://www.cnduk.org/about/item/437 CND, ''The history of CND'']</ref>

In November 1957 [[J. B. Priestley]] wrote an article for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine, "Britain and the Nuclear Bombs",<ref>J. B. Priestley, [http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/02/nuclear-world-britain-power "Britain and the Nuclear Bombs"], ''New Statesman'', 2 November 1957.</ref> advocating [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] by Britain. In it he said:

<blockquote>In plain words: now that Britain has told the world she has the H-bomb she should announce as early as possible that she has done with it, that she proposes to reject, in all circumstances, nuclear warfare.</blockquote>

The article prompted many letters of support and at the end of the month the editor of the ''New Statesman'', [[Kingsley Martin]], chaired a meeting in the rooms of [[Canon John Collins]] in [[Amen Corner, London|Amen Court]] to launch the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Collins was chosen as its chairman, [[Bertrand Russell]] as its president and [[Peggy Duff]] as its organising secretary. The other members of its executive committee were Martin, Priestley, [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Ritchie Calder]], journalist [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]], Howard Davies, [[Michael Foot]], Arthur Goss, and [[Joseph Rotblat]]. The Campaign was launched at a public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, chaired by Collins and addressed by Michael Foot, [[Stephen King-Hall]], J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell and A. J. P. Taylor.<ref>[https://kmflett.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cnd60.jpg Contemporary CND poster advertising the event.]</ref> It was attended by 5,000 people, a few hundred of whom demonstrated at [[Downing Street]] after the event.<ref name=Minnion>John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds), ''The CND Story'', Allison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |access-date=2011-01-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archive-date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>

The new organisation attracted considerable public interest and drew support from a range of interests, including scientists, religious leaders, academics, journalists, writers, actors and musicians. Its sponsors included [[John Arlott]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], the Bishop of Birmingham [[Bishop of Birmingham|Dr J. L. Wilson]], [[Benjamin Britten]], Viscount Chaplin, [[Michael de la Bédoyère]], Bob Edwards, MP, Dame [[Edith Evans]], A.S.Frere, [[Gerald Gardiner]], QC, [[Victor Gollancz]], Dr I. Grunfeld, [[E. M.

H. Pennington]], [[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]] and [[Dora Russell]]. Organisations that had previously opposed British nuclear weapons supported CND, including the [[World Peace Council|British Peace Committee]], the [[Direct Action Committee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040617103503/http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-17 |title=The history of CND |publisher=Cnduk.org |date=1945-08-06 |access-date=2011-01-09 }}</ref> the National Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons Tests<ref name=Driver/> and the [[Society of Friends|Quakers]].<ref name=Parkin/>

In the same year, a branch of CND was also set in the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [[John de Courcy Ireland]], and his wife Beatrice, aiming to campaign for the Irish government to support international efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and to keep Ireland free of nuclear power.<ref>Fagan, Kieran (9 April 2006). [http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/migration/john-de-courcy-ireland-128791.html "John de Courcy Ireland"], Obituary. ''Irish Independent''.

Harrison, ''Irish Anti-War Movements''.  Dublin : Irish Peace 1986 (pp. 59–61).</ref>

The formation of CND marked a significant change in the international peace movement, which from the late 1940s had been dominated by the [[World Peace Council]] (WPC), an anti-western organisation directed by the Soviet Communist Party. Because the WPC had a large budget and organised high-profile international conferences, the peace movement became identified with the communist cause.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.santibox.ch/Peace/Peacemaking.html#5. |title=Rainer Santi, ''100 years of peace making'', International Peace Bureau, January 1991 |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321044904/http://www.santibox.ch/Peace/Peacemaking.html#5. |archive-date=2019-03-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> CND represented the growth of the unaligned peace movement and its detachment from the WPC.

With a [[1959 United Kingdom general election|general election]] due in 1959, which Labour was widely expected to win,<ref>David E. Butler and Richard Rose, ''The British General Election of 1959'' (1960)</ref> CND's founders envisaged a campaign by eminent individuals to secure a government that would adopt its policies: the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention; halting the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; not proceeding with missile bases; and not providing nuclear weapons to any other country.<ref name=Driver/>

In Easter 1958, CND, after some initial reluctance, supported a [[Aldermaston marches|march]] from London to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]] (a distance of 52 miles), that had been organised by a small pacifist group, the Direct Action Committee. Thereafter, CND organised annual Easter marches from Aldermaston to London that became the main focus for supporters' activity. 60,000 people participated in the 1959 march and 150,000 in the 1961 and 1962 marches.<ref>Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Continuum International Publishing, 2005.  {{ISBN|0-8264-5814-9}}</ref><ref>[[April Carter]], "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament", in [[Linus Pauling]], [[Ervin László]], and Jong Youl Yoo (eds), ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace'', Oxford: Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (vol. 1, pp. 109–113).</ref> The 1958 march was the subject of a documentary by [[Lindsay Anderson]], [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/533592/ ''March to Aldermaston''].

[[File:Semaphore Delta November.svg|thumb|The [[flag semaphore]] symbols for letters "N" (green) and "D" (blue)]]
The [[Peace symbols#The peace sign|symbol adopted by CND]], designed for them in 1958 by [[Gerald Holtom]],<ref name=Driver/> became the international peace symbol. It is based on the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]] symbols for "N" (two flags held 45 degrees down on both sides, forming the triangle at the bottom) and "D" (two flags, one above the head and one at the feet, forming the vertical line) (for Nuclear Disarmament) within a circle.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/century/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html "Early Defections in March", ''Manchester Guardian'', 5 April 1958]</ref> Holtom later said that it also represented "an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of [[The Third of May 1808|Goya's peasant before the firing squad]]," (although in that painting, ''The Third of May 1808'', the peasant is actually holding his hands ''upwards'').<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724002411/http://www.cnduk.org/information/info-sheets/item/435-the-cnd-symbol Information], Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</ref>  
The CND symbol, the Aldermaston march, and the slogan "Ban the Bomb" became icons and part of the youth culture of the 1960s.

CND's supporters were generally left of centre in politics.  About three-quarters were Labour voters<ref name=Parkin>Frank Parkin, ''Middle Class Radicalism: The Social Bases of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament'', Manchester University Press, 1968, p. 39.</ref> and many of the early executive committee were Labour Party members.<ref name=Driver/> The ethos of CND at that time was described as "essentially that of middle-class radicalism".<ref name=hinton/>

In the event, Labour lost the 1959 election, but it voted at its 1960 Conference for unilateral nuclear disarmament, which represented CND's greatest influence and coincided with the highest level of public support for its programme.<ref name=carter>April Carter, ''Direct Action and Liberal Democracy'', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973, p. 64.</ref>  The resolution was passed against the wishes of the party's leaders, who refused to be bound by it and proceeded to organise to have it overturned at the next conference.<ref>Robert McKenzie, "Power in the Labour Party: The Issue of 'Intra-Party Democracy'", in Dennis Kavanagh, ''The Politics of the Labour Party'', Routledge, 2013.</ref> [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the Labour Party leader, promised to "fight, fight, and fight again" against the decision, which was duly overturned at the 1961 Conference. Labour's failure to win the election and its rejection of unilateralism upset CND's plans, and from about 1961 its prospects of success began to fade. It was said that from that time onward it lacked any clear idea of how nuclear disarmament was to be implemented and that its demonstrations had become ends in themselves.<ref name=peers/> The sociologist Frank Parkin said that, for many supporters, the question of implementation was of secondary importance anyway because, for them, involvement in the campaign was "an expressive activity in which the defence of principles was felt to have higher priority than 'getting things done'."<ref name=Parkin/> He suggested CND's survival in the face of its failure was explained by the fact that it provided "a rallying point and symbol for radicals", which was more important for them than "its manifest function of attempting to change the government's nuclear weapons policy."<ref name=Parkin/>  Despite setbacks, it retained the support of a significant minority of the population and became a mass movement, with a network of autonomous branches and specialist groups and an increased participation in demonstrations until about 1963.

In 1960 Bertrand Russell resigned from the Campaign in order to form the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which became, in effect, the [[direct action]] wing of CND. Russell argued that direct action was necessary because the press was losing interest in CND and because the danger of nuclear war was so great that it was necessary to obstruct government preparations for it.<ref>Russell, B., "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961</ref>  In 1958 CND had cautiously accepted direct action as a possible method of campaigning,<ref name=Driver/> but, largely under the influence of its chairman, Canon Collins, the CND leadership opposed any sort of unlawful protest. The Committee of 100 was created as a separate organisation partly for that reason and partly because of personal animosity between Collins and Russell. Although the committee was supported by many in CND, it has been suggested<ref name=Taylor>Taylor, R., ''Against the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 1988.</ref> that the campaign against nuclear weapons was weakened by the friction between the two organisations. The Committee organised large sit-down demonstrations in London and at military bases. It later diversified into other political campaigns, including [[Biafra]], the [[Vietnam war]] and housing in the UK. It was dissolved in 1968. When direct action came to the fore again in the 1980s, it was generally accepted by the peace movement as a normal part of protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040617103503/http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-17 |title=A brief history of CND |publisher=Cnduk.org |date=1945-08-06 |access-date=2011-01-09 }}</ref>

CND's executive committee did not give its supporters a voice in the Campaign until 1961, when a national council was formed and until 1966 it had no formal membership. The relationship between supporters and leaders was unclear, as was the relationship between the executive and the local branches. The executive committee's lack of authority made possible the inclusion within CND of a wide range of views, but it resulted in lengthy internal discussions and the adoption of contradictory resolutions at conferences.<ref name=peers>Peers, Dave, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1963/no012/peers.htm "The impasse of CND"], ''International Socialism'', No. 12, Spring 1963, pp. 6–11.</ref> There was friction between the founders, who conceived of CND as a campaign by eminent individuals focused on the Labour Party, and CND's supporters (including the more radical members of the executive committee), who saw it as an extra-parliamentary mass movement. Collins was unpopular with many supporters because of his strictly constitutional approach and found himself increasingly out of sympathy with the direction the movement was taking.<ref>"Collins, (Lewis) John", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> He resigned in 1964 and put his energies into the [[International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/the-oxford-conference-of-non-aligned-peace-organizations|title=Oxford Conference of Non-aligned Peace Organizations|access-date=2009-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716134412/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/the-oxford-conference-of-non-aligned-peace-organizations|archive-date=2011-07-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in the Autumn of 1962, in which the United States blockaded a Soviet attempt to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, created widespread public anxiety about imminent nuclear war and CND organised demonstrations on the issue. But six months after the crisis, a [[Gallup Poll]] found that public concern about nuclear weapons had fallen to its lowest point since 1957,<ref name=Driver/> and there was a view (disputed by some CND supporters)<ref>Nigel Young, "Cuba '62", in Minnion and Bolsover, p. 61</ref> that US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s success in facing down Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] turned the British public away from the idea of unilateral nuclear disarmament.

On the 1963 Aldermaston march, a clandestine group calling itself [[Spies for Peace]] distributed leaflets about a secret government establishment, [[Regional Seat of Government|RSG 6]], that the march was passing. The people behind Spies for Peace remain unknown, except for [[Nicholas Walter]], a leading member of the Committee of 100.<ref>Natasha Walter, [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/142990 "How my father spied for peace"], ''New Statesman'', 20 May 2002</ref> The leaflet said that RSG 6 was to be the local HQ for a military dictatorship after nuclear war. A large group left the march, against the wishes of the CND leadership, to demonstrate at RSG 6.  Later, when the march reached London, there were disorderly demonstrations in which [[anarchism|anarchists]] were prominent, quickly deprecated in the press and in parliament.<ref name=Driver/>  In 1964 there was only a one-day march, partly because of the events of 1963 and partly because the logistics of the march, which had grown beyond all expectation, had exhausted the organisers.<ref name=Minnion/>  The Aldermaston March was resumed in 1965.

Support for CND dwindled after the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Test Ban Treaty]], one of the things it had been campaigning for. From the mid-1960s, the anti-war movement's preoccupation with the [[Vietnam War]] tended to eclipse concern about nuclear weapons but CND continued to campaign against both.

Although CND has never formally allied itself to any political party and has never been an election campaigning body, CND members and supporters have stood for election at various times on a nuclear disarmament ticket. The nearest CND has come to having an electoral arm was the Independent Nuclear Disarmament Election Campaign (INDEC) which stood candidates in a few local elections during the 1960s. INDEC was never endorsed by CND nationally and candidates were generally put up by local branches as a means of raising the profile of the nuclear threat.

===The Second Wave: 1980–1983===
In the 1980s, CND underwent a major revival in response to the resurgence of the Cold War. Wave after wave of new members joined as the result of a growing antinuclear movement, the strong motivation of its membership, and criticism of CND objectives by the Thatcher government.<ref>Paul Byrne, "The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament: the resilience of a protest group." ''Parliamentary Affairs'' 40.4 (1987): 517-535.</ref> There was increasing tension between the superpowers following the deployment of [[RT-21M Pioner|SS20s]] in the Soviet Bloc countries, American [[Pershing II|Pershing]] [[medium-range ballistic missile|missiles]] in Western Europe, and Britain's replacement of the [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]] armed submarine fleet with [[Trident missile]]s.<ref name=hinton/> The [[NATO]] exercise [[Able Archer 83]] also added to international tension.

CND's membership soared; in the early 1980s it claimed 90,000 national members and a further 250,000 in local branches.  "This made it one of the largest political organisations in Britain and probably the largest peace movement in the world (outside the state-sponsored movements of the communist bloc)."<ref name=hinton/> Public support for unilateralism reached its highest level since the 1960s.<ref name=Caedel>Caedel, Martin, "Britain's Nuclear Disarmers", in Laqueur, W., ''European Peace Movements and the Future of the Western Alliance'', Transaction Publishers, 1985, p. 233, {{ISBN|0-88738-035-2}}</ref> In October 1981, 250,000 people joined an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. CND's demonstration on the eve of Cruise missile deployment in October 1983 was one of the largest in British history,<ref name=hinton/> with 300,000 taking part in London as three million protested across Europe.<ref name=Cortright>David Cortright, ''Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas'', Cambridge University Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-521-85402-4}}</ref>

[[Glastonbury Festival]] played a key cultural role in this period. The festival's long-term campaigning relationships have been with CND (1981–1990), Greenpeace (1992 onwards), and Oxfam (because of its campaigning against the arms trade), as well as the establishment of the Green Fields as a regular and expanding eco-feature of the festival (from 1984 on). The radical peace movement and the rise of the greens in Britain are interwoven at Glastonbury. The festival has offered these campaigns and groups space on-site to publicise and disseminate their ideas, and it has ploughed large sums of money from the festival profits into them, as well as other causes. June 1981 saw the first Glastonbury CND Festival, and over the 1980s as a decade Glastonbury raised around £1m for CND. The CND logo topped Glastonbury's pyramid stage, while publicity regularly proclaimed proudly: 'This Event is the most effective Anti-Nuclear Fund Raiser in Europe’.<ref>George McKay (2000) Glastonbury: A Very English Fair (London: Victor Gollancz), 167–168.</ref>
   
New sections were formed, including Ex-services CND, Green CND, Student CND, Tories Against Cruise and Trident (TACT), Trade Union CND, and Youth CND. More women than men supported CND.<ref name=Minnion/> The campaign attracted supporters who opposed the Government's civil defence plans as outlined in an official booklet, ''[[Protect and Survive]]''. This publication was ridiculed in a popular pamphlet, ''Protest and Survive'', by [[E. P. Thompson]], a leading anti-nuclear campaigner of the period.

The British anti-nuclear movement at this time differed from that of the 1960s. Many groups sprang up independently of CND, some affiliating later. CND's previous objection to civil disobedience was dropped and it became a normal part of anti-nuclear protest. The women's movement had a strong influence, much of it emanating from the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]],<ref name=Minnion/> followed by [[Molesworth peace camp|Molesworth People's Peace Camp]].

A network of protesters, calling itself Cruise Watch, tracked and harassed [[Cruise missile]]s whenever they were carried on public roads. After a while, the missiles traveled only at night under police escort.

At its 1982 conference, the Labour Party adopted a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament.  It lost the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] "in which, following the [[Falklands war]], foreign policy was high on the agenda. Election defeats under, first, [[Michael Foot]], then [[Neil Kinnock]], led Labour to abandon the policy in the late 1980s."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121074833/http://www.antiwarresearch.info/cases.php Anti-war Activism in the Information Age]</ref> The re-election of a Conservative government in 1983 and the defeat of left-wing parties in continental Europe "made the deployment of Cruise missiles inevitable and the movement again began to lose steam."<ref name=hinton/>

==Extent of support for CND policies==

===Membership===
Until 1967, supporters joined local branches and there was no national membership. An academic study of CND gives the following membership figures from 1967 onwards:<ref name=matt>John Mattausch, ''A Commitment to Campaign: A Sociological Study of CND'', Manchester University Press, 1989</ref>

*1967:  1,500
*1968:  3,037
*1969:  2,173
*1970:  2,120
*1971:  2,047
*1972:  2,389
*1973:  2,367
*1974:  2,350
*1975:  2,536
*1976:  3,220
*1977:  2,168
*1978:  3,220
*1979:  4,287
*1980:  9,000
*1981:  20,000
*1982:  50,000

Under Joan Ruddock's chairmanship from 1981 to 1985, CND said its membership rose from 20,000 to 460,000.<ref>[http://www.julianlewis.net/letters-in-the-press/3173:amnesia-over-cnd-membership-82 "Amnesia over CND membership"], Julian Lewis [citing ''The Daily Telegraph'', 24 June 1997]</ref> The BBC said that in 1985 CND had 110,000 members<ref name=BBC/> and in 2006, 32,000.<ref name=BBC>Finlo Rohrer, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5149520.stm "Whatever happened to CND?"], ''BBC News Magazine'', 5 July 2006</ref> The organisation reported a rapid increase in membership after [[Jeremy Corbyn]], a prominent member, became leader of the Labour Party in 2015.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/16/campaign-nuclear-disarmament-cnd-membership-surge-jeremy-corbyn "CND membership surge gathers pace after Jeremy Corbyn election"], ''The Guardian'', 16 October 2015</ref>

As of 2020, the UK Membership was around 35,000

===Opinion polls===
As it did not have a national membership until 1967, the strength of public support in its early days can be estimated only from the numbers of those attending demonstrations or expressing approval in opinion polls. Polls on a number of related issues have been taken over the past fifty years.

*Between 1955 and 1962, between 19% and 33% of people in Britain expressed disapproval of the manufacture of nuclear weapons.<ref name=Snyder>W. P. Snyder, ''The Politics of British Defense Policy, 1945-1962'', Ohio University Press, 1964.</ref>
*Public support for unilateralism in September 1982 was 31%, falling to 21% in January 1983, but it is hard to say whether this decline was a result of the contemporary propaganda campaign against CND or not.<ref name=Caedel/>
*Support for CND fell after the end of the Cold war. It had not succeeded in converting the British public to unilateralism and even after the collapse of the Soviet Union British nuclear weapons still have majority support.<ref name=Caedel/>  "Unilateral disarmament has always been opposed by a majority of the British public, with the level of support for unilateralism remaining steady at around one in four of the population."<ref name=carter/><ref name=byrom>Andy Byrom, "British attitudes on nuclear weapons", ''Journal of Public Affairs'', 7: 71-77, 2007.</ref>
*In 2005, [[MORI]] conducted an opinion poll which asked about attitudes to Trident and the use of nuclear weapons. When asked whether the UK should replace Trident, without being told  of the cost, 44% of respondents said "Yes" and 46% said "No".  When asked the same question and told of the cost, the proportion saying "Yes" fell to 33% and the proportion saying "No" increased to 54%.<ref name=MORI>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Archive/Polls/greenpeace.pdf "British Attitudes to Nuclear Weapons"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103235126/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Archive/Polls/greenpeace.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>
*In the same poll, [[MORI]] asked  "Would you approve or disapprove of the UK using nuclear weapons against a country we are at war with?".  9% approved if that country did not have nuclear weapons, and 84% disapproved. 16% approved if that country had nuclear weapons but never used them, and 72% disapproved. 53% approved if that country used nuclear weapons against the UK, and 37% disapproved.<ref name=MORI/>
*CND's policy of opposing American nuclear bases is said to be in tune with public opinion.<ref name=hinton>James Hinton "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament", in Roger S. Powers, ''Protest, Power and Change'', Taylor and Francis, 1997, p. 63, {{ISBN|0-8153-0913-9}}</ref>

On three occasions the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], when in opposition, has been significantly influenced by CND in the direction of unilateral nuclear disarmament. Between 1960 and 1961 it was official Party policy although the Labour leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] opposed the decision and succeeded in quickly reversing it. In 1980 long time CND supporter Michael Foot became Labour Party leader and in 1982 succeeded in changing official Labour policy in line with his views. After losing the 1983 and 1987 general elections Labour leader Neil Kinnock persuaded the party to abandon unilateralism in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |author=John Carvel |author2=Patrick Wintour |date=10 May 1989 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/century/1980-1989/Story/0,,110263,00.html |title=Kinnock wins accord on defence switch |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2015 another long time CND supporter,  Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, although the official Labour policy has not changed as yet in line with his views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11937746/Jeremy-Corbyn-courts-new-anti-nuclear-row-by-becoming-vice-president-of-CND.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn courts new anti-nuclear row by becoming vice-president of CND|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=17 October 2015 |newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>

==Organised opposition to CND==
CND's growing support in the 1980s provoked opposition from several sources, including Peace Through Nato, the British Atlantic Committee (which received government funding),<ref>{{hansard|1981/dec/17/british-atlantic-committee-grant |house=lords |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Women and Families for Defence (set up by Conservative journalist and later MP [[Lady Olga Maitland]] to oppose the Greenham Common Peace Camp), the Conservative Party's Campaign for Defence and Multilateral Disarmament, the [[Coalition for Peace through Security]],  the Foreign Affairs Research Institute, and The 61, a private sector intelligence agency.  The British government also took direct steps to counter the influence of CND, [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] setting up Defence Secretariat 19 "to explain to the public the facts about the Government's policy on deterrence and multilateral disarmament".<ref>{{hansard|1986/jul/21/section-ds19 |house=written |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> The activities of anti-CND organisations are said to have included research, publication, mobilising public opinion, counter-demonstrations, working within the Churches, smears against CND leaders and spying.

In an article on anti-CND groups, [[Stephen Dorril]] reported that in 1982 [[Eugene V. Rostow]], Director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, became concerned about the growing unilateralist movement.  According to Dorril, Rostow helped to initiate a propaganda exercise in Britain, "aimed at neutralising the efforts of CND. It would take three forms: mobilising public opinion, working within the Churches, and a 'dirty tricks' operation against the peace groups."<ref name=lobster/>

One of the groups set up to carry out this work was the Coalition for Peace through Security (CPS), modelled on the US Coalition for Peace through Strength.  The CPS was founded in 1981. Its main activists were [[Julian Lewis (MP)|Julian Lewis]], [[Edward Leigh]] and Francis Holihan.<ref name=lobster/>  Amongst the activities of the CPS were commissioning Gallup polls<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040726013923/http://www.julianlewis.net/press_detail.php?id=36]</ref> which showed the levels of support for British possession of nuclear weapons, providing speakers at public meetings, highlighting the [[left-wing]] affiliations of leading CND figures and mounting counter-[[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] against CND.  These including haranguing CND marchers from the roof of the CPS's Whitehall office and flying a plane over a CND festival with a banner reading, "Help the Soviets, Support CND!"<ref name=wittner>Wittner, L., ''The Struggle Against the Bomb'', Volume 3, Stanford University Press, 2003.</ref>  The CPS attracted criticism for refusing to say where its funding came from while alleging that the anti-nuclear movement was funded by the Soviet Union.<ref name="Kent179-181">Bruce Kent, ''Undiscovered Ends'', pp. 179–181.</ref> Although the CPS called itself a grass-roots movement, it had no members and was financed by The 61,<ref name=wittner/> "a private sector operational intelligence agency"<ref>Joseph C.  Goulden, "Crozier, covert acts, CIA and Cold War", ''The Washington Times'', 15 May 1994</ref> said by its founder, [[Brian Crozier]], to be funded by "rich individuals and a few private companies".<ref>Brian Crozier, Letters: Churchill, the CIA and Clinton, ''The Guardian'', 3 August 1998.</ref>  It is said to have also received funding from the [[Heritage Foundation]].<ref name=spinwatch/>

The CPS claimed that [[Bruce Kent]], the general secretary of CND and a Catholic priest, was a supporter of IRA terrorism.<ref name=wittner/> Kent alleged in his autobiography that Francis Holihan spied on CND. Dorril claimed<ref name=lobster>[http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/lobster/lobster03.pdf ''The Lobster'', No. 3, 1984]</ref>

<blockquote>that Holihan had organised aerial propaganda, had entered CND offices under false pretences, and that CPS workers had joined CND in order to gain access to the Campaign's 1982 Annual Conference. When Bruce Kent went on a speaking tour of America, Holihan followed him around. Offensive material on Kent was sent to newspapers and radio stations, and demonstrations were organised against him with support from the College Republican Committee.</blockquote>

[[Gerard Vaughan (British politician)|Gerald Vaughan]], a government minister, tried to halve government funding for the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], apparently because [[Joan Ruddock]], CND's chair, was employed part-time at his local bureau. Bruce Kent was warned by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] not to become too involved in politics.

==Allegations of communist influence and intelligence surveillance==
Some of CND's opponents claimed that CND was a communist or [[Soviet-run peace movements in the West|Soviet-dominated organisation]], a charge its supporters denied.

In 1981, the Foreign Affairs Research Institute, which shared an office with the CPS, was said by ''Sanity'', the CND newspaper, to have published a booklet claiming that Russian money was being used by CND.<ref name=lobster/> [[Lord Chalfont]] claimed that the Soviet Union was giving the European peace movement £100 million a year, to which Bruce Kent responded, "If they were, it was certainly not getting to our grotty little office in [[Finsbury Park]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/media/item/812-soviet-funding?-rubbish |title=Soviet funding?

CND sued for defamation and the FCS settled on the second day of the trial, apologised and paid damages and costs.<ref>Bruce Kent, ''Undiscovered Ends'', Fount, 1992, pp. 185–6 {{ISBN|0002159961}}</ref>

The British journalist [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] reported a conversation he had with the Soviet double agent [[Oleg Gordievsky]] after the death of leading Labour politician [[Michael Foot]]. As editor of the newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', says Moore, Foot was regularly visited by KGB agents who identified themselves as diplomats and gave him money. "A leading supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Foot ... passed on what he knew about debates over nuclear weapons. In return, the KGB gave him drafts of articles encouraging British disarmament which he could then edit and publish, unattributed to their real source, in ''Tribune''." <ref>Charles Moore, Charles Moore, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/7377111/Was-Foot-a-national-treasure-or-the-KGBs-useful-idiot.html "Was Foot a national treasure or the KGB's useful idiot?"] ''The Telegraph'', 5 March 2010</ref> Foot had received libel damages from the ''Sunday Times'' for a similar claim made during his lifetime.<ref>Rhys Williams, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sunday-times-pays-foot-damages-over-kgb-claim-1590325.html] "'Sunday Times' pays Foot damages over KGB claim", ''Independent'', Sunday 23 October 2011</ref>

The security service ([[MI5]]) carried out surveillance of CND members it considered to be subversive and from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s it designated CND as subversive by virtue of its being "communist-controlled".<ref name=bateman/> Communists have played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]];{{cn|date=June 2020}} but from the late 1970s, MI5 downgraded CND from "communist-controlled" to "communist-penetrated".<ref name="Myths and Misunderstandings">{{cite web|url=http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html#8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217081716/http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-12-17 |title=Myths and Misunderstandings |publisher=Mi5.gov.uk |access-date=2011-01-09 }}</ref>

In 1985, Cathy Massiter, an MI5 officer who had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to  a [[Channel 4]] ''20/20 Vision'' programme, "MI5's Official Secrets".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/true_spies/2336987.stm |title=Secret State: Timeline |work=BBC News |date=2002-10-17 |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref><ref name=hansard>{{hansard|1986/jul/24/business-of-the-house-1 |title=Dale Campbell-Savours, MP, in Business of the House |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it.  In 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. According to Massiter, Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist, but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion.<ref name=bateman>Bateman, D., [http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/issue28.php "The Trouble With Harry: A memoir of Harry Newton, MI5 agent"], ''Lobster'', Issue 28, December 1994. Accessed 3 November 2011.</ref> On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Dale Campbell-Savours]], MP, said:

<blockquote>it was felt within the service that officers were likely to be questioned about the true political affiliation of Mrs. Joan Ruddock, who became chair of CND in 1983. It was fully recognised by the service that she had no subversive affiliations and therefore should not be recorded under any of the usual subversive categories. In fact, she was recorded as a contact of a hostile intelligence service after giving an interview to a Soviet journalist based in London who was suspected of being a KGB intelligence officer.  In Joan Ruddock's file, MI5 recorded special branch references to her movements—usually public meetings—and kept press cuttings and the products of mail and telephone intercepts obtained through active investigation of other targets, such as the Communist party and John Cox. There were police reports recording her appearances at demonstrations or public meetings. There were references to her also in reports from agents working, for example, in the Communist party. These would also appear in her file.<ref name=hansard/></blockquote>

According to Stephen Dorril, at about the same time, [[Special Branch]] officers recruited an informant within CND, Stanley Bonnett, on the instructions of MI5.<ref name=spinwatch/> MI5 is also said to have suspected CND's treasurer, [[Cathy Ashton]], of being a communist sympathiser because she shared a house with a communist.<ref name=spinwatch>Tom Mills, Tom Griffin and David Miller, [http://www.islamagainstextremism.com/dld.cfm?a=isjeyf "The Cold War on British Muslims"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613084843/http://www.islamagainstextremism.com/dld.cfm?a=isjeyf |date=2015-06-13 }}, Spinwatch, 2011.</ref>  When Michael Heseltine became Secretary of State for Defence in 1983, Massiter was asked to provide information for Defence Secretariat 19 (DS19) about leading CND personnel but was instructed to include only information from published sources. Ruddock claims that DS19 released distorted information regarding her political party affiliations to the media and Conservative Party candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030127mi5.pdf |publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology| title=Domestic Intelligence Agencies: The Mixed Record of the UK's MI5 |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref>

MI5 says that it does not now investigate this area.<ref name="Myths and Misunderstandings"/>

Brian Crozier claimed in his book ''Free Agent: The Unseen War 1941–1991'' (Harper Collins, 1993) that The 61 infiltrated a mole into CND in 1979.<ref name=spinwatch/>

In 1990, it was discovered in the archive of the [[Stasi]] (the state security service of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]) that a member of CND's governing council, [[Vic Allen]], had passed information to them about CND. This discovery was made public in a BBC TV programme in 1999, reviving debate about Soviet links to CND. Allen stood against [[Joan Ruddock]] for the leadership of CND in 1985, but was defeated. Ruddock responded to the Stasi revelations by saying that Allen "certainly had no influence on national CND, and as a pro-Soviet could never have succeeded to the chair," and that "CND was as opposed to Soviet nuclear weapons as Western ones."<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991221/halltext/91221h04.htm#91221h04_head0 |title=Commons Hansard |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/451366.stm |title=I regret nothing, says Stasi spy  |work=BBC News |date=1999-09-20 |access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref>
