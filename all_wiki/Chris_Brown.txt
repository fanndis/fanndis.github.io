==Career==

===2002–2004: Career beginnings===
At age 13, Brown was discovered by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent.<ref name="us">{{cite web|title=Celebrity Bios – Chris Brown|work=[[Us Weekly]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/chris_brown_profile|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401030734/http://www.usmagazine.com/chris_brown_profile|archive-date=April 1, 2008|access-date=October 11, 2008}}</ref> Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package and approached contacts in New York to seek a record deal.<ref>{{citation|work=VA Vibe|title=Another One of Our Own Has Made it|date=September 2005|last=Johnson|first=Brian|pages=5–8}}</ref>  Tina Davis, senior [[A&R]] executive at [[Def Jam Recordings]], was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam Music Group]], [[Antonio "L.A." Reid]], who offered to sign him that day. "I knew that Chris had real talent," says Davis. "I just knew I wanted to be part of it."<ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Brown runs with it|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/01/PKG5ULA4C41.DTL&type=music|date=October 1, 2006|access-date=May 28, 2009 | first=Lee| last=Hildebrand}}</ref>

The negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and Davis then lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to labels such as [[Jive Records]], [[J-Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. According to Mark Pitts in an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: "I saw the potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MarkPitts.html |title=Interview with Mark Pitts |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=April 24, 2006 |access-date=December 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AVWYiI8E?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_MarkPitts.html |archive-date=September 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Justin Timberlake]].

===Musical style and influences===
[[File:Michael Jackson1 1988.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Michael Jackson]] in 1988. He is cited as the main inspiration for Brown to make music.]]
Brown has cited a number of artists as his inspiration, predominantly [[Michael Jackson]]. Brown emphasizes "Michael Jackson is the reason why I do music and why I am an entertainer."<ref>{{cite web|title=LIL WAYNE, CHRIS BROWN MOURN MICHAEL JACKSON'S DEATH|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1614762/lil-wayne-chris-brown-mourn-michael-jacksons-death/|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> In "[[Fine China (Chris Brown song)|Fine China]]", he exemplifies Jackson's influence both musically and visually as [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'' magazine]]’s Britini Danielle asserted that the song was "reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s ''[[Off the Wall]]''".<ref>{{Cite web|title  =  [EXCLUSIVE] Introducing the 'New' Chris Brown?|url = http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/exclusive-introducing-the-new-chris-brown-234#ixzz4AY2XBhvV |website = [[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref> Choreographically, [[MTV]] noticed that it "takes distinct visual cues from classic clips like '[[Smooth Criminal]]' and '[[Beat It]]'",<ref>{{Cite web|title  = CHRIS BROWN'S 'FINE CHINA' VIDEO: GOOD GUY GONE 'BAD'|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/1704655/chris-brown-fine-china-music-video/|website = [[MTV]]|access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref> while ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' complimented his appearance by calling it "a modern way to channel the King of Pop".<ref>{{Cite web|title  = Chris Brown's 'Fine China' Vintage Makeover: The Singer Cleans Up Well in New Video|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-hook/1555256/chris-browns-fine-china-vintage-makeover-the-singer-cleans-up-well |website = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date= June 3, 2016}}</ref> [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] is also another influence who comes across as a more contemporary figure for Brown.

Music critics have commended Brown's introduction to [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], recognizing his modern day adaptations as well as versatility. [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'s Iyana Robertson says "As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre". She saw his debut single "[[Run It!]]" as a "prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of [[rhythm and blues]]." By his sophomore album ''[[Exclusive (album)|Exclusive]]'', she says he was "tapping more [[Electronic music|electric up-tempos]], swimming deep in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] waters and annihilating the [[Pop music|pop]] arena". Describing the [[Grammy Award]] winning ''[[F.A.M.E. (Chris Brown album)|F.A.M.E.]]'' as "his most diverse offering to date", she remarked "There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't."<ref>{{cite news|title=In 10 Years, Chris Brown Single-Handedly Transformed R&B |url= http://www.vibe.com/featured/chis-brown-10th-anniversary/| work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]| access-date= May 31, 2016}}</ref>

My mom was like, 'You can sing?'

===Rehab===
On October 30, 2013, Brown voluntarily decided to enter rehab. After Brown completed his 90 days, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go directly to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown was kicked out of the rehab facility and sent to [[Northern Neck Regional Jail]]<ref name="nort_Sing">{{Cite web

During Brown's rehab, a probation officer noted in a letter that Brown's brushes with the law may have been caused by untreated [[bipolar disorder]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], specifically that "Mr. Brown became aggressive and acted out physically due to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD". According to the court documents, which were received by [[E! News]] and later [[The Hollywood Reporter]], Brown was formally diagnosed with both [[Bipolar II]] and PTSD at the unnamed rehab facility.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=2014-03-02 |title=Chris Brown Diagnosed With PTSD And Bipolar Disorder |url=https://time.com/11775/chris-brown-ptsd-bipolar-violence-rihanna/ |access-date=2020-06-28 |website=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Coleman |first=Miriam |date=2014-03-01 |title=Chris Brown Suffers From Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, Says Court Report |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chris-brown-suffers-from-bipolar-disorder-ptsd-says-court-report-89703/ |access-date=2020-06-28 |website=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>
