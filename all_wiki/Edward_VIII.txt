'''Edward VIII''' (Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David; 23 June 1894 – 28 May 1972), was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 20 January 1936 until [[Abdication of Edward VIII|his abdication]] that December.{{efn|The instrument of abdication was signed on 10 December, and given legislative form by [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]] the following day. The parliament of the [[Union of South Africa]] retroactively approved the abdication with effect from 10 December, and the [[Irish Free State]] recognised the abdication on 12 December.<ref name=heard />}}

Edward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, seven weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the [[British prime minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]].

Edward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Abdication of Edward VIII|constitutional crisis]] by proposing to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral [[constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he [[abdicated]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|shortest-reigning monarchs in British history]].

After his abdication, Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's 1937 tour of Germany|toured Germany]]. During the [[Second World War]], Edward was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he was a [[Nazi sympathiser]], he was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later.

Edward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). His father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the eldest daughter of [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]] and [[Francis, Duke of Teck]]. At the time of his birth, he was third in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind his grandfather and father.

He was baptised ''Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David'' in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894 by [[Edward White Benson]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{efn|His twelve godparents were:
[[Queen Victoria]] (his paternal great-grandmother); the [[Christian IX of Denmark|King]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (his paternal great-grandparents, for whom his maternal uncle [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] and his paternal aunt the [[Louise, Princess Royal|Duchess of Fife]] stood proxy); the [[William II of Württemberg|King of Württemberg]] (his mother's distant cousin, for whom his granduncle the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] stood proxy); the [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Queen of Greece]] (his grandaunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (his granduncle, for whom [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] stood proxy); the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] (his paternal grandparents); the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsarevich]] (his father's cousin); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (his maternal granduncle and Queen Victoria's cousin); and the [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]] (his maternal grandparents).<ref name=demoskoff/>}}<ref name=demoskoff>{{citation |url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm |title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings |author=Demoskoff, Yvonne |date=27 December 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Fn0l7vK?url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm |archive-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The names were chosen in honour of [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Edward's late uncle]], who was known to his family as "Eddy" or Edward, and his great-grandfather King [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria for her late husband [[Albert, Prince Consort]], and the last four names – [[Saint George|George]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] and [[Saint David|David]] – came from the [[patron saint]]s of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.<ref>Ziegler, p. 5</ref> He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.<ref>Ziegler, p. 6</ref>

As was common practice with upper-class children of the time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away.<ref>Windsor, p. 7; Ziegler, p. 9</ref> The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered, and she was replaced by [[Charlotte Bill]].<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 16–17</ref>

Edward's father, though a harsh disciplinarian,<ref>Windsor, pp. 25–28</ref> was demonstratively affectionate,<ref>Ziegler, pp. 30–31</ref> and his mother displayed a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image. She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French [[schoolmaster|master]] as a prank,<ref>Windsor, pp. 38–39</ref> and encouraged them to confide in her.<ref>Ziegler, p. 79</ref>

== Education ==

Initially, Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka. When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.<ref>Parker, pp. 12–13</ref>

Edward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost thirteen years old. Private tutors taught him German and French.<ref name="matthew" /> Edward took the examination to enter the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed.<ref>Parker, pp. 13–14</ref> Following two years at Osborne College, which he did not enjoy, Edward moved on to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. A course of two years, followed by entry into the [[Royal Navy]], was planned.<ref name=P14/>

Edward automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] on 6 May 1910 when his father ascended the throne as George V on the death of Edward VII. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28387|page=4473|date=23 June 1910}}</ref> Preparations for his future as king began in earnest. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as [[midshipman]] for three months aboard the battleship ''[[HMS Hindustan (1903)|Hindustan]]'', then immediately entered [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], for which, in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually.<ref name=P14/> A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the [[Oxford University Polo Club|university club]].<ref>{{citation |title=The Prince of Wales Starts Play |work=Polo Monthly |date=June 1914 |page=300 |url=http://www.hpa-polo.co.uk/download/1914-Mar-1914-Aug.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730235904/http://www.hpa-polo.co.uk/download/1914-Mar-1914-Aug.pdf |archive-date=30 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He left Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications.<ref name=P14>Parker, pp. 14–16</ref>

Edward was officially [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|invested as Prince of Wales]] in a special ceremony at [[Caernarfon Castle]] on 13 July 1911.<ref>{{citation |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir (historian) |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy Revised edition |year=1996 |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |page=327 |isbn=978-0-7126-7448-5}}</ref> The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician [[David Lloyd George]], Constable of the Castle and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government.<ref name="duke">Windsor, p. 78</ref> Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 26–27</ref>
[[File:The Prince of Wales at the Front (Photo 24-283).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Edward during the First World War]]
When the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.<ref>Windsor, pp. 106–107 and Ziegler, pp. 48–50</ref> He had joined the [[Grenadier Guards]] in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir apparent to the throne were captured by the enemy.<ref>Roberts, p. 41 and Windsor, p. 109</ref> Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare first-hand and visited the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.<ref>Ziegler, p. 111 and Windsor, p. 140</ref> He undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.royal.uk/edward-viii-jan-dec-1936 |title=Edward VIII (Jan–Dec 1936) |publisher=Official website of the British monarchy |accessdate=18 April 2016 |date=12 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507221901/https://www.royal.uk/edward-viii-jan-dec-1936 |archive-date=7 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Edward's youngest brother, [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]], died at the age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after a severe [[epileptic]] seizure.<ref>"Death of Youngest Son of King and Queen". ''Daily Mirror''. 20 January 1919. p. 2.</ref> Edward, who was 11 years older than John and had hardly known him, saw his death as "little more than a regrettable nuisance".<ref name="Ziegler, p. 80">Ziegler, p. 80</ref> He wrote to his mistress of the time that "[he had] told [her] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. [John]'s been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." He also wrote an insensitive letter to his mother which has since been lost.<ref>Tizley, Paul (director) (2008), ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7Nesw6r0I Prince John: The Windsors' Tragic Secret] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108191748/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7Nesw6r0I |date=8 November 2013 }}'' (Documentary), London: [[Channel 4]], retrieved 26 April 2017</ref> She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did&nbsp;...

Throughout the 1920s, Edward, as the Prince of Wales, represented his father at home and abroad on many occasions. His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention. At the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time and he set men's fashion.<ref>{{citation |last=Broad |first=Lewis |year=1961 |title=The Abdication: Twenty-five Years After.

Edward visited poverty-stricken areas of Britain,<ref>Windsor, p. 215</ref> and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] between 1919 and 1935.

In 1919, Edward agreed to be president of the organising committee for the proposed [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Park]], [[Middlesex]].

By 1917, Edward liked to spend time partying in Paris while he was on leave from his regiment on the Western Front. He was introduced to Parisian courtesan [[Marguerite Alibert]], with whom he became infatuated. He wrote her candid letters, which she kept. After about a year, Edward broke off the affair. In 1923, Alibert was acquitted in a spectacular murder trial after she shot her husband in the [[Savoy Hotel]]. Desperate efforts were made by the Royal Household to ensure that Edward's name was not mentioned in connection with the trial or Alibert.<ref>{{citation|first=Andrew |last=Rose|title=The Prince, the Princess and the Perfect Murder|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=2013}} reviewed in {{citation|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/389389/A-new-book-brings-to-light-the-scandalous-story-of-Edward-VIII-s-first-great-love|title=A new book brings to light the scandalous story of Edward VIII's first great love|first=Cheryl|last=Stonehouse|date=5 April 2013|website=Express Newspapers|access-date=1 July 2020}}<br/>See also: Godfrey, pp. 138, 143, 299; Ziegler, pp. 89–90</ref>

Edward's womanising and reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], King George V, and those close to the prince. George V was disappointed by his son's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. "After I am dead," George said, "the boy will ruin himself in twelve months."<ref>{{citation |last1=Middlemas |first1=Keith |authorlink=Keith Middlemas |last2=Barnes |first2=John |title=Baldwin: A Biography |year=1969 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-297-17859-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/baldwinbiography0000midd/page/976 976] |url=https://archive.org/details/baldwinbiography0000midd/page/976 }}</ref>

George V favoured his second son Albert ("Bertie") and Albert's daughter Elizabeth ("Lilibet"), later [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] respectively. He told a courtier, "I pray to God that my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>{{citation |last=Airlie |first=Mabell |authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie |title=Thatched with Gold |year=1962 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |page=197}}</ref> In 1929, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that Edward teased Albert's wife, also named [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] (later the [[Queen Mother]]), by calling her "Queen Elizabeth".

In 1930, George V gave Edward the lease of [[Fort Belvedere, Surrey|Fort Belvedere]] in [[Windsor Great Park]].<ref>Windsor, p. 235</ref> There, he continued his relationships with a series of married women, including [[Freda Dudley Ward]] and [[Lady Furness]], the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American [[Wallis Simpson]]. Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer [[Win Spencer]], in 1927. Her second husband, [[Ernest Simpson]], was a British-American businessman. Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers, while Lady Furness travelled abroad, although the prince adamantly insisted to his father that he was not having an affair with her and that it was not appropriate to describe her as his mistress.<ref>Ziegler, p. 233</ref> Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father. Although his parents met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935,<ref>Windsor, p. 255</ref> they later refused to receive her.<ref>Bradford, p. 142</ref>

Edward's affair with an American [[wikt:divorcée|divorcée]] led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police [[Special Branch]], who examined in secret the nature of their relationship.

King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII.

Edward caused unease in government circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during a tour of depressed villages in [[South Wales]] that "something must be done"<ref name="matthew" /> for the unemployed coal miners was seen as an attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently revealing government secrets.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 273–274</ref>

Edward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that of his or her predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done),<ref>Windsor, pp. 293–294</ref> to show the parting in his hair.<ref>A.

On 16 July 1936, Jerome Bannigan, alias [[George McMahon (failed assassin)|George Andrew McMahon]], produced a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]], near [[Buckingham Palace]]. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that "a foreign power" had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed [[MI5]] of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for "intent to alarm".<ref>{{Citation |url=https://nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january2/attempt.htm |title=George Andrew McMahon: attempt on the life of H.M.

In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht ''[[Nahlin (yacht)|Nahlin]]''. By October it was becoming clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at [[Ipswich]] [[Assizes]].<ref>Broad, pp. 56–57</ref> Although gossip about his affair was widespread in the United States, the British media kept voluntarily silent, and the general public knew nothing until early December.<ref>Broad, pp. 44–47; Windsor, pp. 314–315, 351–353; Ziegler, pp. 294–296, 307–308</ref>

== Abdication ==

[[File:King Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson on holiday in Yugoslavia, 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson on their Mediterranean holiday, 1936]]
On 16 November 1936, Edward invited Prime Minister Baldwin to [[Buckingham Palace]] and expressed his desire to marry Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the [[Church of England]], and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen.<ref>Windsor, pp. 330–331</ref> As king, Edward was the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head of the Church]], and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings. The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], was vocal in insisting that Edward must go.<ref name="Pearce and Goodlad">{{citation|first1=Robert|last1=Pearce|last2=Graham|first2=Goodlad|year=2013|title=British Prime Ministers From Balfour to Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5yLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|page=80|isbn=978-0-415-66983-2|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=3 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104021555/https://books.google.ca/books?id=e5yLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|archive-date=4 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Edward proposed an alternative solution of a [[morganatic marriage]], in which he would remain king but Simpson would not become [[queen consort]]. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This was supported by senior politician [[Winston Churchill]] in principle, and some historians suggest that he conceived the plan.<ref name="Pearce and Goodlad"/> In any event, it was ultimately rejected by the [[British Cabinet]]<ref>Windsor, p. 346</ref> as well as other [[Dominion]] governments.<ref>Windsor, p. 354</ref> Their views were sought pursuant to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which provided in part that "any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]."<ref>{{citation |title=Statute of Westminster 1931 c.4 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/contents |publisher=UK Statute Law Database |accessdate=1 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013012440/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/contents |archive-date=13 October 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Prime Ministers of Australia ([[Joseph Lyons]]), Canada ([[Mackenzie King]]) and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] ([[J.

Edward informed Baldwin that he would abdicate if he could not marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three options: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.<ref>Windsor, pp. 354–355</ref> It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis.<ref>{{citation |last=Beaverbrook |first=Lord |authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook |title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=A.

On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, explained his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He said, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love." He added that the "decision was mine and mine alone&nbsp;...

== Duke of Windsor ==
On 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]], George VI announced he was to make his brother the "Duke of Windsor" with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34349|page=8111|date=12 December 1936}}</ref> He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI's decision to create Edward a [[royal duke]] ensured that he could neither stand for election to the [[British House of Commons]] nor speak on political subjects in the [[House of Lords]].<ref>[[Clive Wigram]]'s conversation with Sir [[Claud Schuster]], Clerk to the Crown and Permanent Secretary to the [[Lord Chancellor]] quoted in Bradford, p. 201</ref>

[[Letters Patent]] dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the "title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness" upon the Duke, but specifically stated that "his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute". Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style ''Her Royal Highness''; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as "Mr Edward Windsor". On 14 April 1937, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Donald Somervell]] submitted to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] a memorandum summarising the views of [[Lord Advocate]] [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|T. M. Cooper]], Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:
{{quote|
# We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.
# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.<ref>Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, François (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937].

[[File:ChateauCandé-B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Candé]], the Windsors' wedding venue]]
The Duke married Simpson, who had changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at [[Château de Candé]], near [[Tours]], France. When the [[Church of England]] refused to sanction the union, a [[County Durham]] clergyman, the Reverend [[Robert Anderson Jardine]] (Vicar of St Paul's, [[Darlington]]), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. George VI forbade members of the royal family to attend,<ref>{{citation |last=Williams |first=Susan |title=The historical significance of the Abdication files |work=Public Records Office – New Document Releases – Abdication Papers, London |publisher=Public Records Office of the United Kingdom |year=2003 |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/significance.htm |accessdate=1 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220409/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/significance.htm |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] to attend the ceremony.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 354–355</ref>

The denial of the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the [[Civil List]], and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] paid to him as [[Prince of Wales]] and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for [[Sandringham House]] and [[Balmoral Castle]], which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.<ref name="settlement">Ziegler, pp. 376–378</ref> Edward received approximately £300,000 for both residences which was paid to him in yearly installments. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.<ref>Ziegler, p. 349</ref>

Relations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the royal family were strained for decades. The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.<ref name="settlement" /> Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: "[your last letter]{{efn|She had asked [[Alec Hardinge]] to write to the Duke explaining that he could not be invited to his father's memorial.<ref name=z384/>}} destroy[ed] the last vestige of feeling I had left for you&nbsp;... [and has] made further normal correspondence between us impossible."<ref name=z384>Ziegler, p. 384</ref>

The former Austrian ambassador, [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]], who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German [[fascism]] as a bulwark against [[communism]], and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.<ref>Papers of [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]] (1861–1945) in the State Archives, Vienna, quoted in {{citation |authorlink=Kenneth Rose |last=Rose |first=Kenneth |year=1983 |title=King George V |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |page=391 |isbn=978-0-297-78245-2}}</ref> According to the Duke of Windsor, the experience of "the unending scenes of horror"<ref>Windsor, p. 122</ref> during the First World War led him to support [[appeasement]]. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Germany and thought that [[Anglo-German relations]] could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. [[Albert Speer]] quoted Hitler directly: "I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us."<ref>{{citation |last=Speer |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Speer |title=Inside the Third Reich |year=1970 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |page=118}}</ref> The Duke and Duchess settled in France.

== Second World War ==
In May 1939, the Duke was commissioned by [[NBC]] to give a radio broadcast<ref name=commission /> (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the World War I battlefields of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In it he appealed for peace, saying "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war."

On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Duke and Duchess were brought back to Britain by Louis Mountbatten on board [[HMS Kelly|HMS ''Kelly'']], and Edward, although an honorary [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]], was made a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] attached to the British Military Mission in France.<ref name="matthew" /> In February 1940, the German ambassador in [[The Hague]], [[Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda]], claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied [[Dyle Plan|war plans]] for the defence of Belgium,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/documentsongerma014726mbp#page/n871/mode/2up No. 621]: Minister Zech to State Secretary [[Ernst von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], 19 February 1940, in ''Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918–1945'' (1954), Series D, Volume VIII, p. 785, quoted in Bradford, p. 434</ref> which the Duke later denied.<ref>{{citation |author=McCormick, Donald |year=1963 |title=The Mask of Merlin: A Critical Biography of David Lloyd George |page=290 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |lccn=64-20102 |url=https://archive.org/stream/maskofmerlinacri000286mbp#page/n307/mode/2up}}</ref> When Germany [[Battle of France|invaded]] the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to [[Biarritz]], then in June to [[Francoist Spain]].

In July 1940, Edward was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the [[American Export Lines]] steamship ''[[USS Joseph Hewes (AP-50)|Excalibur]]'', which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to [[New York City]] so that they could be dropped off at [[Bermuda]] on the 9th.<ref>Bloch, pp. 93–94, 98–103, 119</ref> They left Bermuda for [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the Canadian steamship [[Canadian National Railway#East Coast|''Lady Somers'']] on 15 August, arriving two days later.<ref>Bloch, p. 119; Ziegler, pp. 441–442</ref> The Duke did not enjoy being governor and privately referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".<ref>Bloch, p. 364</ref> The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]].<ref>Bloch, pp. 154–159, 230–233; {{citation |last=Luciak |first=Ilja |chapter=The Life of Axel Wenner-Gren–An Introduction |title=Reality and Myth: A Symposium on Axel Wenner-Gren |editor1-first=Ilja |editor1-last=Luciak |editor2-first=Bertil |editor2-last=Daneholt |location=Stockholm |publisher=Wenner-Gren Stiftelsirna |year=2012 |chapter-url=http://blog.wennergren.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AW-G-Conference-Book-2012.pdf |pages=12–30 |access-date=6 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708154249/http://blog.wennergren.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AW-G-Conference-Book-2012.pdf |archive-date=8 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of [[Étienne Dupuch]], the editor of the ''Nassau Daily Tribune'': "It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium."<ref>Ziegler, p. 448</ref> He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – communists" and "men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|draft]]".<ref>Ziegler, pp. 471–472</ref> He resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.<ref name="matthew" />

Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.<ref>Ziegler, p. 392</ref> It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: "In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society&nbsp;...

Roosevelt]] to mediate a peace settlement. The Duke protested that he had been misquoted and misinterpreted.<ref>Bloch, p. 178</ref>

The Allies became sufficiently disturbed by German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited [[Palm Beach, Florida]], in April 1941. [[Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg]] (then a monk in an American monastery) had told the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.<ref>{{citation |last1=Evans |first1=Rob |last2=Hencke |first2=David |title=Wallis Simpson, the Nazi minister, the telltale monk and an FBI plot |periodical=The Guardian |date=29 June 2002 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/29/research.monarchy |accessdate=2 May 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826041707/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/29/research.monarchy |archive-date=26 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] claimed that [[Anthony Blunt]], an [[MI5]] agent and [[Soviet]] spy, acting on orders from the [[British royal family]], made a successful secret trip to [[Schloss Friedrichshof]] in Germany towards the end of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.<ref>[[Charles Higham (biographer)|Higham, Charles]] (1988), ''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life'', New York: McGraw-Hill Publishers, pp. 388–389</ref> What is certain is that George VI sent the [[Royal Librarian]], [[Owen Morshead]], accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|German Empress Victoria]], the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the [[Royal Archives]].<ref>Bradford, p. 426</ref> In the late 1950s, documents recovered by U.S. troops in [[Marburg]], Germany, in May 1945, since titled [[The Marburg Files]], were published following more than a decade of suppression, enhancing theories of the Duke's sympathies for Nazi ideologies.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fane Saunders|first=Tristram|title=The Duke, the Nazis, and a very British cover-up: the true story behind The Crown's Marburg Files|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/duke-nazis-british-cover-up-true-story-behind-crowns-marburg/|date=14 December 2017|newspaper=The Telegraph|url-access=subscription|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814200947/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/duke-nazis-british-cover-up-true-story-behind-crowns-marburg/|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Miller|first=Julie|date=9 December 2017|title=The Crown: Edward's Alleged Nazi Sympathies Exposed|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/the-crown-edward-hitler-nazi|accessdate=14 August 2018|publisher=Vanity Fair|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206111901/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/the-crown-edward-hitler-nazi|archive-date=6 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: "[the] ''[[Führer]]'' struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions."<ref>Windsor, p. 277</ref> In the 1950s, journalist [[Frank Giles]] heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] for helping to "precipitate the war through his treatment of [[Mussolini]]&nbsp;... that's what [Eden] did, he helped to bring on the war&nbsp;... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews".<ref>{{citation |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/wallis-simpson-that-woman-after-the-abdication/ |title=Wallis Simpson, 'That Woman' After the Abdication |date=1 November 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Sebba |first=Anne |accessdate=7 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105172447/http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/wallis-simpson-that-woman-after-the-abdication/ |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, [[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross]], "I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap."<ref>[[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Lord Kinross]], ''Love conquers all'' in ''Books and Bookmen'', vol. 20 (1974), p. 50: "He indeed remarked to me, some twenty-five years later, 'I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap'."</ref>

[[File:The Duke of Windsor (1945).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duke in 1945]]

At the end of the war, the couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never held another official role. Correspondence between the Duke and [[Kenneth de Courcy]], dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where the Duke would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible [[Regent|regency]]. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned about the influence of the [[Mountbatten family]] over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested the Duke buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and make himself available should the King become incapacitated. The Duke, however, hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6624594/Revealed-the-Duke-and-Duchess-of-Windsors-secret-plot-to-deny-the-Queen-the-throne.html |title=Revealed: the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's secret plot to deny the Queen the throne |last=Wilson |first=Christopher |date=22 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=6 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808042427/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6624594/Revealed-the-Duke-and-Duchess-of-Windsors-secret-plot-to-deny-the-Queen-the-throne.html |archive-date=8 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Duke and Duchess effectively took on the role of celebrities and were regarded as part of [[café society]] in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; [[Gore Vidal]], who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation.<ref>{{citation |last=Vidal |first=Gore |authorlink=Gore Vidal |title=Palimpsest: a memoir |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-679-44038-3 |page=206}}</ref> The couple doted on the [[pug]] dogs they kept.<ref>{{citation |last= Farquhar |first= Michael |title= A Treasury of Royal Scandals |publisher= Penguin Books |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-7394-2025-6 |page= [https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/48 48] |url= https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/48 }}</ref>

In June 1953, instead of attending the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], his niece, in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris. The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another. He was paid to write articles on the ceremony for the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' and ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', as well as a short book, ''The Crown and the People, 1902–1953''.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 539–540</ref>
[[File:Nixon and the Windsors.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1970]]

In 1955 they visited President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the White House. The couple appeared on [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s television-interview show ''[[Person to Person]]'' in 1956,<ref>{{citation |periodical= Time |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824447,00.html |date= 8 October 1956 |title= Peep Show |accessdate= 2 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140226204358/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824447,00.html |archive-date= 26 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and in a 50-minute BBC television interview in 1970. That year President [[Richard Nixon]] invited them as guests of honour to a dinner at the White House.<ref>[[United Press International|UPI]]. "Duke, Duchess Have Dinner With Nixons" ''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]'' (Hendersonville, North Carolina) 6 April 1970; p. 13</ref>

The royal family never fully accepted the Duchess. Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, Edward sometimes met his mother and his brother, George VI; he attended George's funeral in 1952. Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: "To give up all this for that", she said.<ref>Bradford, p. 198</ref> In 1965 the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by Elizabeth II, his sister-in-law [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], and his sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood]]. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967 they joined the royal family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 554–556</ref> He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the [[investiture of the Prince of Wales]] in 1969, replying that [[Prince Charles]] would not want his "aged great-uncle" there.<ref>Ziegler, p. 555</ref>

In the 1960s the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964 [[Michael E. DeBakey]] operated on him in [[Houston]] for an [[aneurysm]] of the [[abdominal aorta]], and in February 1965 Sir [[Stewart Duke-Elder]] treated a [[detached retina]] in his left eye. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]] and underwent [[cobalt therapy]]. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Duke and Duchess of Windsor while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes, but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.<ref>{{citation |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/18/newsid_2512000/2512067.stm |date= 18 May 1972 |title= Duke too ill for tea with the Queen |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 24 October 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830154714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/18/newsid_2512000/2512067.stm |archive-date= 30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Death and legacy ===
On 28 May 1972, ten days after the Queen's visit, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th&nbsp;birthday. His body was returned to Britain, [[lying in state]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. The funeral service took place in the chapel on 5 June in the presence of the Queen, the royal family, and the Duchess of Windsor, who stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit. He was buried in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at [[Frogmore]].<ref>Ziegler, pp. 556–557</ref> Until a 1965 agreement with the Queen, the Duke and Duchess had planned for a burial in a cemetery plot they had purchased at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the Duchess's father was interred.<ref>{{citation |title= Windsors had a plot at Green Mount |last= Rasmussen |first= Frederick |journal= The Baltimore Sun |date= 29 April 1986}}</ref> Frail, and suffering increasingly from [[dementia]], the Duchess died in 1986, and was buried alongside her husband.<ref>{{citation |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm |publisher= BBC |title= Simple funeral rites for Duchess |date= 29 April 1986 |accessdate= 2 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071230041309/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm |archive-date= 30 December 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the view of historians, such as [[Philip Williamson (historian)|Philip Williamson]] writing in 2007, the popular perception in the 21st century that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable. To modern sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson "seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation" for his abdication.<ref>
