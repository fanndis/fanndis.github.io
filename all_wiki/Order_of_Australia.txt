The '''Order of Australia''' is an [[Order (honour)|order of chivalry]] established on 14 February 1975 by [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], to recognise Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service. Before the establishment of the order, Australian citizens received [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours]].

The Queen of Australia is sovereign head of the order,<ref name="DPMCHonoursOrder">{{cite web |url = http://www.dpmc.gov.au/government/its-honour/awards/order-australia |title = Order of Australia |website = dpmc.gov.au |date = 22 June 2016 }}</ref> while the [[Governor-General of Australia]] is the principal companion/dame/knight (as relevant at the time) and chancellor of the order. The [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia|governor-general's official secretary]], currently [[Paul Singer (secretary)|Paul Singer]], is secretary of the order.

{{toclimit|3}}

== Levels of membership ==
The order is divided into a general and a military division. The five levels of appointment to the order in descending order of seniority have been:
# '''Knight''' and '''Dame of the Order of Australia''' ([[List of Knights and Dames of the Order of Australia|AK]] and [[List of Knights and Dames of the Order of Australia|AD]] – ''inactive'');{{NoteTag|The level of Dame/Knight was established in 1976, disestablished in 1986, re-established in 2014 and again disestablished in 2015; neither disestablishment affected existing awards.|name=AKAD}}<ref name=SMH2014 /><ref name=SMH2015 /><ref name="GGHonoursOrder">{{Cite web |url = http://www.gg.gov.au/australian-honours-and-awards/order-australia |title=The Order of Australia |website = gg.gov.au |access-date = 28 January 2019 }}</ref>
# '''Companion of the Order of Australia''' ([[List of Companions of the Order of Australia|AC]] – quota of 35 per annum);<ref name=GGHonoursOrder />
# '''Officer of the Order of Australia''' (AO – quota of 140 per annum);<ref name=GGHonoursOrder />
# '''Member of the Order of Australia''' (AM – quota of 365 per annum);<ref name=GGHonoursOrder /> and
# '''Medal of the Order of Australia''' (OAM – no quota).{{NoteTag|The Medal of the Order of Australia was established 1976.|name=Est76}}
Honorary awards at all levels may be made to deserving non-citizens – these awards are made additional to the quotas.

==Insignia==
The ''badge'' of the Order of Australia is a [[wikt:convex|convex]] disc (gold for AKs, ADs and ACs, [[Gilding|gilt]] for AOs, AMs and OAMs) representing the [[Acacia pycnantha|Golden Wattle]] flower. At the centre is a ring, representing the sea, with the word 'Australia' below two branches of golden wattle. The whole disc is topped by the [[St Edward's Crown|Crown of St Edward]]. The AC badge is decorated with [[citrine quartz|citrines]], blue enamelled ring, and enamelled crown. The AO badge is similar, without the citrines. For the AM badge, only the crown is enamelled, and the OAM badge is plain. The AK/AD badge is similar to that of the AC badge, but with the difference that it contains at the centre an enamelled disc bearing an image of the [[coat of arms of Australia]].{{NoteTag|name=AKAD}}

The ''star'' for knights and dames is a convex golden disc decorated with citrines, with a blue royally crowned inner disc bearing an image of the coat of arms of Australia.{{NoteTag|name=AKAD}}

The ''ribbon'' of the order is blue with a central stripe of golden wattle flower designs; that of the military division has additional golden edge stripes. AKs,{{NoteTag|name=AKAD}} male ACs and AOs wear their badges on a [[necklet]]; male AMs and OAMs wear them on a ribbon on the left chest. Women usually wear their badges on a bow on the left shoulder, although they may wear the same insignia as males if so desired.

A gold lapel pin for daily wear is issued with each badge of the order at the time of investiture; AK/AD{{NoteTag|name=AKAD}} and AC lapel pins feature a citrine central jewel, AO and AM lapel pins have a blue enamelled centre and OAM lapel pins are plain.

The order's insignia was designed by [[Stuart Devlin]].

== Membership ==
The order currently consists of four levels (one discontinued) and the medal, in both ''general'' and ''military'' divisions. Since 2015, the knight/dame level has been discontinued on the advice of then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Awards of knight and dame of the order have been made in the general division only.{{NoteTag|The constitution of the order has been amended via Letters Patent to allow the appointment of Prince Charles and Prince Philip as substantive members of the order.)}}

While [[Governors of the Australian states|state governors]] can present the officer and member level and the Medal of the Order of Australia to their respective state's residents, only the [[Queen of Australia]] or the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] can present the companion level (and previously also the knight/dame level).<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2007/Summer_2007_CMN.pdf Honours of the Crown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625225416/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2007/Summer_2007_CMN.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}, www.monarchist.ca, p.&nbsp;11.</ref>

== Nomination process ==
Since 1976 any person may nominate any Australian citizen for an award. The nominations are reviewed by the [[Council for the Order of Australia]],<ref name="GGHonoursOrder" /> and then approved by the governor-general. The order is awarded on [[Australia Day]] and on the [[Queen's Birthday]] public holiday in June, when public announcements are made about new awards, on the occasion of a special announcement by the governor-general (usually honorary awards), and on the appointment of a new Governor-General.

People who are not Australian citizens may be awarded honorary membership of the order at all levels.

Appointments to the order are not made posthumously; however, if a nominee dies after accepting an appointment but before the relevant announcement date, the appointment stands and it is announced as having effect from no later than the date of the nominee's death.

Awardees may subsequently resign from the order, and also may have their award cancelled by the governor-general.{{NoteTag|Resignation and cancellation have occurred up to the companion level – see [[List of Companions of the Order of Australia#Former Companions]].}}

==History==
===Establishment===
The Order of Australia was established on 14 February 1975 by [[letters patent]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II of Australia]], the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian monarch]], and countersigned by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Gough Whitlam]]. The original order had three levels: Companion (AC), Officer (AO) and Member (AM) as well as two divisions: Civil Division and Military Division. At the time it was also announced that Australian prime ministers would no longer nominate persons for British Imperial honours, but this new practice did not extend to nominations by state premiers.

On 24 May 1976, the level of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia#Classes|Knight]] (AK) and [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia#Classes|Dame]] (AD) and the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), were created by the Queen on the advice of Whitlam's successor, [[Malcolm Fraser]], and the Civil Division was renamed the General Division. The level of Knight/Dame was awarded only in the General Division.

The original three-level structure of the Order of Australia was modelled closely upon the [[Order of Canada]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barwick|first=Garfield|title=[[A Radical Tory: Garfield Barwick's Reflections and Recollections]]|date=1995|publisher=Federation Press|isbn=978-1-86287-236-3|page=266 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Duke|first=Suzanne|title=Debrett's Handbook of Australia and New Zealand|date=1984|publisher=Debrett's Peerage|isbn=0-313-26126-1|page=47 }}</ref> though the Order of Australia has been awarded rather more liberally, especially in regard to honorary awards to foreigners. To date, only [[Honorary appointments to the Order of Canada|24 non-Canadians]] have been appointed to the Order of Canada, while more than 420 non-Australians have been appointed to the Order of Australia, with [[List of Companions of the Order of Australia#Honorary Companions|40]] to the "Companion" level.

===Knights and dames===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Ninian Martin Stephen.svg|thumb|The neck badge of a Knight of the Order of Australia appeared at the base of the coat of arms of [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]].]]

{{Main|List of Knights and Dames of the Order of Australia}}

Following [[1983 Australian federal election|the 1983 federal election]], Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] advised the abolition of the knight/dame level.  On 3 March 1986, the Queen co-signed letters patent revoking the level, with existing knights and dames not being affected by the change.  In the period 1976&ndash;1983, twelve knights and two dames were created, all but one of whom—Prince Charles—are now deceased.

On 19 March 2014, Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] advised the Queen to reinstate the level of knight/dame and the Queen co-signed letters patent to bring this into effect. The change was publicly announced on 25 March, and gazetted on 17 April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014G00635/ |title=Letters Patent amending the Constitution of the Order of Australia |website=Government Notices Gazette C2014G00635 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> Up to four knights and/or dames could be appointed each year, by the Queen of Australia on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia after consultation with the Chairman of the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=SMH2014>{{cite web |title=Knights, dames return under Abbott |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325113330/http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/knights-dames-return-under-abbott-20140325-35fy0.html|archivedate=25 March 2014|date= 25 March 2014 |accessdate= 25 March 2014 |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald  |url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/knights-and-dames-back-in-australia-20140325-35fy0.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= A new honour for pre-eminent Australians |work= Media release |publisher= Office of the Prime Minister of Australia |date= 25 March 2014 |url= http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians |accessdate= 25 March 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140325130621/http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians |archivedate= 25 March 2014 }}</ref>

Five awards of knight and dame were then made, to the outgoing [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Quentin Bryce]]; her successor, [[Peter Cosgrove]]; a recent [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], [[Angus Houston]]; a recent [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Marie Bashir]]; and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]].

The [[Australian Labor Party]] continued to oppose knighthoods and damehoods. Leader of the opposition [[Bill Shorten]] stated in March 2014 that the party would again discontinue the level if it were to win the next Australian federal election.<ref>{{cite news|last=Knott|first=Matthew|title=Bill Shorten would reverse reinstatement of knights and dames if elected prime minister|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-would-reverse-reinstatement-of-knights-and-dames-if-elected-prime-minister-20140328-35mtn.html|accessdate=3 August 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605115335/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-would-reverse-reinstatement-of-knights-and-dames-if-elected-prime-minister-20140328-35mtn.html|archivedate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

Abbott's tenure as prime minister ended in September 2015. Two months after coming into office, on 2 November 2015, pro-republican Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] announced that the Queen had approved his request to amend the Order's [[letters patent]] and cease awards at this level.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/knights-and-dames-to-be-scrapped/6904474 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418043230/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/knights-and-dames-to-be-scrapped/6904474|archivedate=18 April 2016|title=Knights and dames scrapped from Order of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull says |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |last1=Norman|first1= Jane |last2=Iggulden|first2= Tom |date=2 November 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/02/knights-and-dames-removed-from-order-of-australia-by-malcolm-turnbull|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044211/http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/02/knights-and-dames-removed-from-order-of-australia-by-malcolm-turnbull|archivedate=5 March 2016 |title=Knights and dames removed from Order of Australia by Malcolm Turnbull |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=Australia |last=Medhora|first=Shalailah  |date=2 November 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 }}</ref> Existing titles would not be affected.<ref name=SMH2015>{{cite news|title=Malcolm Turnbull scraps Tony Abbott's Knights and Dames|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-scraps-tony-abbotts-knights-and-dames-20151101-gkodek.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107004242/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-scraps-tony-abbotts-knights-and-dames-20151101-gkodek.html|archivedate=7 January 2016|first=Latika|last=Bourke|author-link=Latika Bourke|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref> The move was attacked by monarchists<ref>{{cite news|title=Malcolm Turnbull's 1999 referendum loss behind dumping knights and dames: David Flint|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbulls-1999-referendum-loss-behind-dumping-knights-and-dames-david-flint-20151102-gkofvb.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref> and praised by republicans.<ref>{{cite news|last=FitzSimons|first=Peter|title=By scrapping knights and dames, the Age of Turnbull has returned us to 2015|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/by-scrapping-knights-and-dames-the-age-of-turnbull-has-returned-us-to-2015-20151102-gkok7j.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105020024/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/by-scrapping-knights-and-dames-the-age-of-turnbull-has-returned-us-to-2015-20151102-gkok7j.html#ixzz3qIi2uO8G|archivedate=5 November 2015|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Malcolm Turnbull clears the royal barnacle and starts a debate Tony Abbott never could have|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/malcolm-turnbull-clears-the-royal-barnacle-and-starts-a-debate-tony-abbott-never-could-have-20151102-gkohlb.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Mark|last=Kenny|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105013050/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/malcolm-turnbull-clears-the-royal-barnacle-and-starts-a-debate-tony-abbott-never-could-have-20151102-gkohlb.html#ixzz3qIg68SQ8|archivedate=5 November 2015|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref> The amendments to the constitution of the Order were gazetted on 22 December 2015.<ref name=kdgazette>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2015G02163 Amendments to the Constitution of the Order of Australia], ''Gazette'' C2015G02163, 22 December 2015.</ref>

==Current membership==
===Officials of the order===
*Sovereign Head of the Order: [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]] ([[Elizabeth II]])
*[[Principal of the Order of Australia|Chancellor and Principal Companion]]: [[Governor-General of Australia]] ([[David Hurley]])
*Secretary: [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]] (Paul Singer)

===Royal members===
*[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]]: Knight (AK)
*[[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]: Knight (AK)

[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK) on 14 March 1981.  As he is not an Australian citizen, even though he is the heir to the Australian throne, this would have required the award to be honorary.  To overcome this issue, his appointment was created by amendment to the constitution of the Order of Australia by special letters patent signed by the Queen, on the recommendation of Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010Q00036 |title=Order of Australia – Constitution – Letters Patent – Amendment – 14/03/1981 |publisher=legislation.gov.au |accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref>

In March 2014 the knight and dame levels, which had been abolished in 1986 by Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]], were reintroduced to the Order of Australia by [[Tony Abbott]]. At the same time, Abbott announced that future appointments at this level would be recommended by the prime minister alone, rather than by the Council of the Order of Australia, as is the case with all lower levels of the order. In accordance with the statutes of 2014, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] was created a Knight of the Order by letters patent signed by the Queen on 7 January 2015, on Abbott's advice.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2015G00155 |title=Amendments to the Constitution of the Order of Australia |publisher=Government Notices Gazette C2015G00155}}</ref> Prince Philip's knighthood was announced as part of the [[Australia Day]] Honours on 26 January 2015 and his appointment attracted criticism of what Abbott described as his "captain's call".  Abbott responded by announcing that future recommendations for appointments as Knights and Dames of the Order would be determined by the Council of the Order of Australia.

===Honorary awards===
Awards of the Order of Australia are sometimes made to people who are not citizens of Australia to honour extraordinary achievements.  These achievements, or the people themselves, are not necessarily associated with Australia, although they often are.  On 26 January 2019, the Australian Honours website listed appointments for 40 Honorary Companions, 100 Honorary Officers, 127 Honorary Members of the Order of Australia and the award of 124 Honorary Medals of the Order of Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search Australian Honours – Advanced Search|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/search|work=It's an Honour|publisher=Awards and Culture Branch, Australian Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=26 January 2019|date=26 January 2019}} Separate searches conducted for Knights, Companions, Officers, Members and Medals of the Order.</ref> Notable honorary awards include:

===Sociology of recipients of highest levels===
In December 2010, ''[[The Age]]'' reported a study of the educational backgrounds of all people who had received Knight/Dame and Companion level awards at that time. It reported: "An analysis of the 435 people who have received the nation's top Order of Australia honours since they were first awarded in 1975, shows they disproportionately attended a handful of elite Victorian secondary schools. [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] alumni received the highest number of awards, with 19 former students receiving Australia's ''[then]'' highest honour".<ref name="Age2010">{{cite news |first = Jewel |last = Topsfield |title = Ties that bind prove a private education has its awards |url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/ties-that-bind-prove-a-private-education-has-its-awards-20101203-18jx0.html?from=age_sb |work = The Age |page = 11 |date = 4 December 2010 }}</ref><ref group="note" name="AgeAnalysis">The hard-copy article also published a table of the schools which were ranked in the top ten places:

===Order of Australia Association===
On 26 January 1980 the order's award recipients formed the Order of Australia Association. This organisation seeks to aid the members of the order in their pursuits related to the development and maintenance of Australia's culture and traditions. The organisation also attempts to increase awareness of those honoured by the order, since many of their number are not household names, despite their contributions. Branches of the association can be found in all the [[states and territories of Australia]].

==Precedence==
"Imperial" honours ''awarded after 5 October 1992'' have been classed as "Foreign awards", and hence have lower precedence than <u>all</u> Australian awards.<br />(Note, however, that the {{small|(original/imperial/British)}} [[Victoria Cross]], and awards of the monarch, have retained their position in the [[order of precedence]], even if awarded after 5 October 1992.)

==References in popular culture==
The award is parodied in the play ''[[Amigos (play)|Amigos]]'', where the central character is determined to be awarded the AC, and uses persuasion, bribery and blackmail in his (ultimately successful) attempts to get himself nominated for the award.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/28/1088392587638.html Amigos] Reviewer Helen Thomson, 29 June 2004, ArtsReviews – ''The Age''</ref>

During the 1996 season of the popular television programme ''[[Home and Away]]'', the character [[Pippa Ross]] was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for her years of service as a foster carer.
