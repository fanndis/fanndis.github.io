}} is an [[archipelagic state|archipelagic country]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. Situated in the western [[Pacific Ocean]], it consists of about 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], [[Mindanao]]. The capital city of the Philippines is [[Manila]] and the most populous city is [[Quezon City]], both within the single urban area of [[Metro Manila]]. Bounded by the [[South China Sea]] to the west, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, and the [[Celebes Sea]] to the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with [[Taiwan]] to the north, [[Japan]] to the northeast, [[Palau]] to the east, [[Indonesia]] to the south, [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]] to the southwest, [[Vietnam]] to the west, and [[China]] to the northwest.

The Philippines' position as an [[List of island countries|island country]] on the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]] and close to the equator makes the country prone to [[Earthquakes in the Philippines|earthquakes]] and [[Typhoons in the Philippines|typhoons]]. The country has a variety of [[natural resource]]s and a globally significant [[megadiverse countries|level of biodiversity]]. The Philippines has an area of around {{convert|300,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of around 109&nbsp;million people. {{As of|2020}}, it is the [[List of Asian countries by population|8th-most populated country in Asia]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|13th-most populated country]] in the world. Multiple [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnicities]] and cultures are found throughout the islands.

[[Negrito]]s, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by [[Models of migration to the Philippines|successive waves]] of [[Austronesian peoples]]. The arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] named the archipelago ''{{lang|es|[[:es:Filipinas|Las Islas Filipinas]]}}'' in honor of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Spanish settlement, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the [[Spanish Empire]] for more than 300 years. During this time, [[Catholicism]] became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of [[Spanish treasure fleet|trans-Pacific trade]]. In 1896 the [[Philippine Revolution]] began, which then became entwined with the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]]. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while [[Katipunan|Filipino rebels]] declared the [[First Philippine Republic]]. The ensuing [[Philippine–American War]] ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|Japanese invasion]] of the islands during [[World War II]]. Following [[Philippines campaign (1944–1945)|liberation]], the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the [[unitary state|unitary]] [[sovereign state]] has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a [[dictatorship]] by the [[People Power Revolution]].

The Philippines is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum, and the [[East Asia Summit]]. The Philippines is considered to be an [[emerging market]] and a [[newly industrialized country]], which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing.

Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] "''{{lang|es|Felipinas}}''" after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&nbsp;II of Spain]], then the [[Prince of Asturias]]. Eventually the name "''{{lang|es|Las Islas Filipinas}}''" would be used to cover the archipelago's Spanish possessions.{{sfn|Scott |1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC&pg=PA6 6]}} Before Spanish rule was established, other names such as ''{{lang|es|Islas del Poniente}}'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands, ''{{lang|es|San Lázaro}}'', were also used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region.<ref name="Spate">{{cite book |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ |chapter-url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ch04s05.html |title=The Spanish Lake – The Pacific since Magellan, Volume I |chapter=Chapter 4.

 |quote                = Given the significance of the size and distribution of the population to the spread of diseases and their ability to become endemic, it is worth commenting briefly on the physical and human geography of the Philippines. The hot and humid tropical climate would have generally favored the propagation of many diseases, especially water-borne infections, though there might be regional or seasonal variations in climate that might affect the incidence of some diseases. In general, however, the fact that the Philippines comprise some seven thousand islands, some of which are uninhabited even today, would have discouraged the spread of infections, as would the low population density.

 | quote = The early modern revival of the Reconquista in the Philippines had a profound effect on the islands, one that is still being felt today. As described above, the Spanish Reconquista served to unify Christians against a common Moro enemy, helping to bring together Castilian, Catalan, Galician, and Basque peoples into a single political unit: Spain. In precolonial times, the Philippine islands were a divided and unspecified part of the Malay archipelago, one inhabited by dozens of ethnolinguistic groups, residing in countless independent villages, strewn across thousands of islands. By the end of the seventeenth century, however, a dramatic change had happened in the archipelago. A multiethnic community had come together to form the colonial beginnings of a someday nation: the Philippines. The powerful influence of Christian-Moro antagonisms on the formation of the early Philippines remains evident more than four hundred years later, as the Philippine national government continues to grapple with Moro separatists groups, even in 2013.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of the Philippines}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map PHL present.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification]] of the Philippines]]
The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate that is usually hot and humid. There are three seasons: ''tag-init'' or ''tag-araw'', the hot dry season or summer from March to May; ''tag-ulan'', the rainy season from June to November; and ''tag-lamig'', the cool dry season from December to February. The southwest [[monsoon]] (from May to October) is known as the Habagat, and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (from November to April), the Amihan. Temperatures usually range from {{convert|21|C|F}} to {{convert|32|C|F}} although it can get cooler or hotter depending on the season. The coolest month is January; the warmest is May.<ref name="PAGASA-Climate">{{cite web |title=Climate of the Philippines |url=http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/information/climate-philippines |website=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration |access-date=July 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418140425/http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/information/climate-philippines |archive-date=April 18, 2018 |quote=Based on the average of all weather stations in the Philippines, excluding Baguio, the mean annual temperature is 26.6o C. The coolest months fall in January with a mean temperature of 25.5oC while the warmest month occurs in May with a mean temperature of 28.3oC. Latitude is an insignificant factor in the variation of temperature while altitude shows greater contrast in temperature. Thus, the mean annual temperature of Baguio with an elevation of 1,500 meters is 18.3oC.}}</ref>

The average yearly temperature is around {{convert|26.6|C|F}}. In considering temperature, location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor. Whether in the extreme north, south, east, or west of the country, temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range. Altitude usually has more of an impact. The average annual temperature of [[Baguio]] at an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|sp=us}} above sea level is {{convert|18.3|C|F}}, making it a popular destination during hot summers.<ref name="PAGASA-Climate" /> Annual rainfall measures as much as {{convert|5000|mm|sp=us}} in the mountainous east coast section but less than {{convert|1000|mm|sp=us}} in some of the sheltered valleys.<ref name=cp />

The [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] affected the economy, resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the [[fiscal conservatism]] of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth.<ref name="lastlaugh" /> There have been signs of progress since.
