}}'''Kappa Kappa Gamma''' ('''ΚΚΓ'''), also known simply as '''Kappa''' or '''KKG''', is a collegiate [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]], founded at [[Monmouth College]] in [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].

Kappa has a total membership of more than 260,000 women, with 140 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada and 307 alumnae associations worldwide.<ref name="Kappa">{{cite web|url=http://www.kappakappagamma.org/Template.cfm?Section=Founders_Day&Template=/flash/foundersday/foundersday2010.cfm|title=Kappa Kappa Gamma Founders Day 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712014022/http://www.kappakappagamma.org/Template.cfm?Section=Founders_Day&Template=%2Fflash%2Ffoundersday%2Ffoundersday2010.cfm|archive-date=2011-07-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kappa Kappa Gamma is considered a women's fraternity because it was founded before the term "sorority" was created, but is commonly referred to as a sorority because it only admits women.<ref name="KKG History">{{cite web

==History==
{{More citations needed|date=January 2019}}
[[File:530 East Town Street.jpg|thumb|530 E. Town St. headquarters, 1952-2018]]
In 1869, two [[Monmouth College]] students, Mary Louise Bennett and Hannah Jeannette Boyd, were dissatisfied with the fact that, while men enjoyed membership in fraternities, women had few equivalent organizations for companionship, support, and advancement, and were instead limited to [[College literary societies|literary societies]]. Bennett and Boyd decided to create a women's fraternity and sought members "not only for literary work, but also for social development", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.<ref name="ReferenceA">Tessier, Denise, "History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years". 2000</ref> Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members, to plan their new society.<ref>William Urban et al., ''Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century''. Monmouth College, 1979</ref> They recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.[[File:Minnie Stewart House.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Minnie Stewart House]] in Monmouth, where the sorority was founded|alt=|left]]

The six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on establishing the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. They chose a golden key as their badge and had badges crafted by Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter for the fraternity was drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth Chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted to recognize October 13, 1870 as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined.

In 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby [[St. Mary's Seminary]]. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at [[Indiana University]]. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was temporarily closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years.

In 1882, Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly [[Magazine|journal]],''The Key''. Today, it is published triennially through Watkins Printing Company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bairdsmanualame00bairgoog|quote=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities.|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|last1=Baird|first1=William Raimond|last2=Brown|first2=James Taylor|publisher=G.

In 1890, the Beta Alpha chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma became the first sorority at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], led by president [[Martha Bunting]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/women/chron3.html|title=1880-1900: Timeline of Women at Penn, University of Pennsylvania University Archives|website=www.archives.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306012216/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/women/chron3.html|archive-date=2009-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Moves Toward Panhellenic ===
In 1891, Kappa Kappa Gamma invited the other women's fraternities to Boston for a discussion on the challenges they collectively faced – thus the precursor to the [[National Panhellenic Conference]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://npcwomen.dynamic.omegafi.com/about/our-story/|title=Our Story|work=National Panhellenic Conference|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}</ref> However, no major movements occurred from this meeting, and none would occur for another decade when [[Alpha Phi]] invited [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], Kappa Kappa Gamma, [[Delta Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], and [[Chi Omega]] to a conference in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on May 24, 1902, to set standards for collegiate sororities. This meeting resulted in the organization of the first inter-fraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses.

In the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of "the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige."<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|edition=Seventh|page=57|oclc=912380768|author-link=G. William Domhoff|title-link=Who Rules America?}}</ref>

From 1929 to 1952, the organization was headquartered in the [[Law and Finance Building]] in [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio]]. In 1952, Kappa Kappa Gamma purchased its first headquarters at 530 East Town Street, now part of the [[East Town Street Historic District]]. On January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved from the building to 6640 Riverside Drive in [[Dublin, Ohio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kappa.historyit.com/exhibit-view.php?id=2#5|title=KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA|website=KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA}}</ref>

==Symbols==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Kappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the [[owl]] as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the [[fleur-de-lis]], combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the [[Iris (plant)|iris]] is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue [[sapphire]]. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity [[Coat of Arms]] combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva.

Kappa Kappa Gamma used "Tradition of Leadership" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to "Aspire to Be".

In June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line "Dream Boldly, Live Fully".

===Badges===
The badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with [[sapphires]], [[pearls]] or [[diamonds]]. On the front of the key are the Greek letters ΚΚΓ (on the stem) and ΑΩΟ (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as [[opals]]. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership by initiated members. The fraternity encourages badges to be returned to the headquarters upon a member's death. 

New, uninitiated members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge, which is a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the initiating chapter.

== Programs ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

===Philanthropy===
Kappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as "Philanthropy 1-2-3".

* The first branch of philanthropy supports the "Kappa family" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma  Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need.
* The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions.
* The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004.

Local KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually.

===Leadership===
Collegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers.

The national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio.

In 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an [[outdoor education]] facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at [http://www.heartlandretreat.com Heartland Conference Retreat Center] in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters.

===The Monmouth Duo===
The women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] was founded as I.C. Sorosis at [[Monmouth College]] in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called "The Monmouth Duo". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events.

===Hazing===

The thirteen members who had either been involved with the incident or had known about it were given one-semester suspensions and social probation for their participation, and were voted by their chapter to retain membership within the chapter.<ref name="nuwer">{{cite book | last = Nuwer | first = Hank | title = Wrongs of Passage: Fraternities, Sororities, Hazing, and Binge Drinking | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253335968 | url-access = registration | publisher = Indiana University Press | year= 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253335968/page/159 159–165] | isbn = 0-253-21498-X}}</ref>
