The '''''Stanford Law Review''''' ('''SLR''') is a [[law review|legal journal]] produced independently by [[Stanford Law School]] students. The journal was established in 1948 with future [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]] as its first president. The review produces six issues yearly between January and June and regularly publishes short-form content on the ''Stanford Law Review Online''.<ref name=online>{{cite web|title=Stanford Law Review Online|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online|publisher=[[Stanford Law School]]|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>

==Admissions==
The ''Stanford Law Review'' selects members based on a competitive exercise that tests candidates on their editing skills and legal writing ability. There is not a firm number of accepted candidates each year; recent classes of new editors have ranged from about 40 to 45. The candidate exercise is distributed to candidates late in their first year at the law school.  Transfer students are also eligible for admission through the same process.

==Notable alumni==
The review's [[editorial board]] has a president, who is effectively the [[editor-in-chief]] of the publication. The current president is Samuel Ward-Packard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contact|url=https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/contact/|publisher=Stanford Law Review|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref> Notable past presidents include [[Warren Christopher]] (1949),<ref>{{cite news|title=Stanford mourns the loss of diplomat Warren Christopher, alumnus of Stanford Law School and former chair of the Board of Trustees|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/march/warren-christopher-obit-032211.html|accessdate=3 February 2012|newspaper=Stanford Report|date=22 March 2011}}</ref>  [[Brooksley Born]] (1964), [[Raymond C.
