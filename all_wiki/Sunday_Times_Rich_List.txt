The '''''Sunday Times Rich List''''' is a list of the 1,000 wealthiest people or families [[tax residence|resident]] in the [[United Kingdom]] ranked by [[net wealth]]. The list is updated annually in April and published as a magazine supplement by [[United Kingdom|British]] national Sunday [[newspaper]] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' since 1989. The editorial decisions governing the compilation of the ''Rich List'' are published in the newspaper and online as its "Rules of engagement."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article6185993.ece |title=''The Sunday Times'' |access-date=2009-05-01 |archive-date=2011-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612194426/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article6185993.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

The ''Rich List'' is not limited to British citizens and it includes individuals and families born overseas but who predominantly work and/or live in Britain. This excludes some individuals with prominent financial assets in Britain.

The editors estimate subjects' wealth from a range of public information, based on values in January each year. They typically explain their actions by stating: "We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts—to which we have no access... We try to give due consideration to liabilities."

The 2015 list marked the first year [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was not among the list's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989.<ref name="rich">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-queen-drops-off-the-top-end-of-the-sunday-times-rich-list-for-the-first-time-since-its-inception-10204588.html|title=The Queen drops off the top end of the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since its inception|date=26 April 2015|author=Helen Nianias|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=17 December 2015|archive-date=10 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410163156/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-queen-drops-off-the-top-end-of-the-sunday-times-rich-list-for-the-first-time-since-its-inception-10204588.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She was number one on the inaugural ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 1989]],'' when it first began.<ref name="rich"/>

== Giving List ==
Since 2005, as part of the ''Rich List'', The Sunday Times has produced an annual ''Giving List'', which tracks the most generous philanthropists in the UK as a proportion of their wealth. In 2018, it was reported that, of the 300 philanthropists listed in the ''Giving List'', a total of £3.207 billion was given away.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/uk-s-richest-gave-away-over-3-2bn-in-2018-according-to-sunday-times.html|title=UK’s richest gave away over £3.2bn last year, according to Sunday Times|website=www.civilsociety.co.uk|access-date=3 March 2019|archive-date=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043319/https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/uk-s-richest-gave-away-over-3-2bn-in-2018-according-to-sunday-times.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jamie Cooper, the former wife of hedge fund manager [[Chris Hohn|Sir Christopher Anthony Hohn]], was ranked in first place with a giving index of 88.89%, which amounted to donations in 2018 of £299.6 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/article/1464614|title=Giving by the richest steady at £3.2bn|last=Cooney|first=Rebecca|website=www.thirdsector.co.uk|access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref>

==Book version==
A fuller version of the ''Rich List'' is also published in a reference book edition, edited by [[Philip Beresford]]. This list covers the top 5,000 richest people, rather than the top 1,000, and includes their business addresses:
*''Sunday Times Rich List 2006–2007'' was published by A & C Black in December 2006 ({{ISBN|978-0713679410}}).
*''Sunday Times Rich List 2007–2008'' was due to be published by A & C Black in November 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0713685152}}) but no book appeared due to a deadlock between the publishers and ''The Sunday Times''. The publisher was keen to carry on but only if a CD version was attached to the book. ''The Sunday Times'' would not allow this as it would give competitors a chance to develop their own database and launch rival rich lists.<ref>[http://www.thinkresource.org/node/1427 Thinkresource.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110728104428/http://www.thinkresource.org/node/1427 |date=28 July 2011 }} Resource talks to Philip Beresford</ref>
