'''''Pravda''''' ({{lang-rus|Правда|p=ˈpravdə|a=Ru-правда.ogg}}, "Truth") is a [[Russia]]n [[broadsheet]] newspaper, formerly the [[official newspaper]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], when it was one of the most influential papers in the country with a [[newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 11 million.<ref name="Specter">{{Cite news|title = Russia's Purveyor of 'Truth', Pravda, Dies After 84 Years|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/world/russia-s-purveyor-of-truth-pravda-dies-after-84-years.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 31 July 1996|access-date = 19 October 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Michael|last = Specter}}</ref> The newspaper began publication on 5 May 1912 in the [[Russian Empire]], but was already extant abroad in January 1911.<ref>V.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]  ''Pravda'' was sold off by [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to a Greek business family in 1996, and the paper came under the control of their private company Pravda International.<ref name="Specter"/><ref name="Pravda {{!}} Soviet newspaper">{{Cite web|title = Pravda {{!}} Soviet newspaper|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Pravda|website = Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate = 19 October 2015}}</ref>

In 1996, there was an internal dispute between the owners of Pravda International and some of the ''Pravda'' journalists which led to Pravda splitting into different entities. The [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] acquired the ''Pravda'' paper, while some of the original Pravda journalists separated to form Russia's first online paper (and the first online English paper) ''[[Pravda.ru]]'', which is not connected to the Communist Party.<ref name="Pravda {{!}} Soviet newspaper"/><ref>{{Cite news|title = Which Pravda did John McCain write about Syria for?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/sep/19/john-mccain-pravda-syria|newspaper = the Guardian|accessdate = 19 October 2015|date = 19 September 2013}}</ref> After a legal dispute between the rival parties, the Russian court of arbitration stipulated that both entities would be allowed to continue using the Pravda name.<ref>{{Cite web|title = There is no Pravda.

The ''Pravda'' paper is today run by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, whereas the online Pravda.ru is privately owned and has international editions published in Russian, English, French and Portuguese.

== Origins ==

=== Pre-revolutionary ''Pravda'' ===
Though ''Pravda'' officially began publication on 5 May 1912 (22 April 1912 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]), the anniversary of [[Karl Marx]]'s birth, its origins trace back to 1903 when it was founded in [[Moscow]] by a wealthy [[railway engineer]], [[V.A. Kozhevnikov]]. ''Pravda'' had started publishing in the light of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]].<ref name=James>White, James D. (April 1974). "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/150476 The first Pravda and the Russian Marxist Tradition]". ''Soviet Studies'', Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 181–204. Accessed 6 October 2012.</ref> At the time when the paper was founded, the name "Pravda" already had a clear historical connotation, since the law code of the Medieval [[Kievan Rus']] was known as ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]'';<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=12|date=2003|isbn=9780852299616|page=823|edition=15th|chapter=Yaroslav I|chapterurl=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652106/Yaroslav-I |quote=Under Yaroslav the codification of legal customs and princely enactments was begun, and this work served as the basis for a law code called the Russkaya Pravda (“Russian Justice”).}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Yaroslav Padokh|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\R\U\RuskaiaPravdaIT.htm|title=Ruskaia Pravda|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Ukraine|volume=4|year=1993|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> in this context, "Pravda" meant "Justice" rather than "Truth", "Russkaya Pravda" being "Russian Justice". This early law code had been rediscovered and published by 18th Century Russian scholars, and in 1903 educated  Russians with some knowledge of their country's history could have been expected to know the name.

During its earliest days, ''Pravda'' had no political orientation. Kozhevnikov started it as a journal of arts, literature and social life. Kozhevnikov was soon able to form up a team of young writers including [[Alexander Bogdanov|A.A. Bogdanov]], [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Rozhkov|N.A Rozhkov]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky|M.N Pokrovsky]], [[Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov|I.I Skvortsov-Stepanov]], P.P Rumyantsev and M.G. Lunts, who were active contributors on 'social life' section of ''Pravda''. Later they became the editorial board of the journal and in the near future also became the active members of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP).<ref name=James/> Because of certain quarrels between Kozhevnikov and the editorial board, he had asked them to leave and the [[Menshevik]] faction of the RSDLP took over as Editorial Board. But the relationship between them and Kozhevnikov was also a bitter one.<ref name=James/>

The Ukrainian political party [[Spilka]], which was also a splinter group of the RSDLP, took over the journal as its organ. [[Leon Trotsky]] was invited to edit the paper in 1908 and the paper was finally moved to [[Vienna]] in 1909. By then, the editorial board of ''Pravda'' consisted of hard-line Bolsheviks who sidelined the Spilka leadership soon after it shifted to Vienna.<ref>Corney, Frederick. (September 1985). "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40868466 Trotskii and the Vienna ''Pravda'', 1908–1912]". ''Canadian Slavonic Papers''. Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 248–268. Accessed 6 October 2012.</ref> Trotsky had introduced a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] to the newspaper and distanced itself from the intra-party struggles inside the RSDLP. During those days, ''Pravda'' gained a large audience among Russian workers. By 1910 the Central Committee of the RSDLP suggested making ''Pravda'' its official organ.

Finally, at the sixth conference of the RSDLP held in [[Prague]] in January 1912, the [[Menshevik]] faction was expelled from the party. The party under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] decided to make ''Pravda'' its official mouthpiece. The paper was shifted from Vienna to [[St. Petersburg]] and the first issue under Lenin's leadership was published on 5 May 1912 (22 April 1912 OS).<ref>Bassow, Whitman. (February 1954) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2492164 The Pre Revolutionary Pravda and Tsarist Censorship]". ''American Slavic and East European Review''. Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 47–65. Accessed 6 October 2012.</ref> It was the first time that ''Pravda'' was published as a legal political newspaper. The Central Committee of the RSDLP, workers and individuals such as [[Maxim Gorky]] provided financial help to the newspaper. The first issue published on 5 May cost two [[Ruble|kopeks]] and had four pages. It had articles on economic issues, workers movement, and [[Strike action|strikes]], and also had two [[Proletariat|proletarian]] [[poem]]s. M.E. Egorov was the first editor of St. Petersburg ''Pravda'' and Member of [[Duma]] N.G. Poletaev served as its publisher.<ref name=Ralph>Elwood, Carter Ralph. (June 1972) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2494339 Lenin and ''Pravda'', 1912–1914]". ''Slavic Review''. Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 355–380. Accessed 6 October 2012.</ref>

Egorov was not a real editor of ''Pravda'' but this position was pseudo in nature. As many as 42 editors had followed Egorov within a span of two years, till 1914. The main task of these editors was to go to jail whenever needed and to save the party from a huge fine.<ref name=Ralph /> On the publishing side, the party had chosen only those individuals as publishers who were sitting members of Duma because they had parliamentary immunity. Initially,{{when|date=October 2012}} it had sold between 40,000 and 60,000 copies.<ref name=Ralph /> The paper was closed down by tsarist censorship in July 1914. Over the next two years, it changed its name eight times because of police harassment:<ref>See Tony Cliff's ''Lenin'' (1975), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/lenin1/chap19.htm Chapter 19] {{full citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>

=== During the 1917 Revolution ===
[[File:Prawda.16.3.1917.png|thumb|16 March 1917: ''Pravda'' reports the declaration of Polish independence.]]

The overthrow of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] by the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 allowed ''Pravda'' to reopen. The original editors of the newly reincarnated ''Pravda'', [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]], were opposed to the liberal [[Russian Provisional Government]]. However, when [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and former Duma deputy [[Matvei Muranov]] returned from Siberian exile on 12 March, they took over the editorial board – starting from 15 March.<ref>Leon Trotsky, ''History of the Russian Revolution'', translated by Max Eastman, Chicago, Haymarket Books, 2008, p. 209</ref>
Under Kamenev's and Stalin's influence, ''Pravda'' took a conciliatory tone towards the Provisional Government—"insofar as it struggles against reaction or counter-revolution"—and called for a unification conference with the internationalist wing of the Mensheviks. On 14 March, Kamenev wrote in his first editorial:

{{quote|What purpose would it serve to speed things up, when things were already taking place at such a rapid pace?<ref>See Marcel Liebman, ''Leninism under Lenin'', London, J. Cape, 1975, {{ISBN|978-0-224-01072-6}} p.123</ref>}}

On 15 March, he supported the war effort:

{{quote|When army faces army, it would be the most insane policy to suggest to one of those armies to lay down its arms and go home. This would not be a policy of peace, but a policy of slavery, which would be rejected with disgust by a free people.<ref>See E. H. Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution'', London, [[Macmillan Publishers]], 1950, vol. 1, p. 75.</ref>}}

== Soviet period ==

The offices of the newspaper were transferred to [[Moscow]] on 3 March 1918 when the Soviet capital was moved there. ''Pravda'' became an official publication, or "organ", of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. ''Pravda'' became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy changes and would remain so until 1991. Subscription to ''Pravda'' was mandatory for state run companies, the [[Soviet Army|armed services]] and other organizations until 1989.<ref>See Mark Hooker. ''The Military Uses of Literature: Fiction and the Armed Forces in the Soviet Union'', Westport, CT, [[Praeger Publishers]], 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-275-95563-2}} p.34</ref>

Other newspapers existed as organs of other state bodies. For example, ''[[Izvestia]]'', which covered [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]], was the organ of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' was the organ of the [[trade union]] movement, ''[[Bednota]]'' was distributed to the [[Red Army]] and rural peasants. Various derivatives of the name ''Pravda'' were used both for a number of national newspapers (''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' was the organ of the [[Komsomol]] organization, and ''[[Pionerskaya Pravda]]'' was the organ of the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]]), and for the regional Communist Party newspapers in many republics and provinces of the USSR, e.g. ''[[Kazakhstanskaya Pravda]]'' in [[Kazakhstan]], ''[[Polyarnaya Pravda]]'' in [[Murmansk Oblast]], ''[[Pravda Severa]]'' in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], or ''[[Moskovskaya Pravda]]'' in the city of Moscow.

Shortly after the October 1917 Revolution, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] became the Editor of ''Pravda''.<ref>Stephen F. Cohen, ''Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, 1888–1938'' (Oxford University Press: London, 1980) p. 43.</ref> Bukharin's apprenticeship for this position had occurred during the last months of his emigration/exile prior to Bukharin's return to Russia in April 1917.<ref>Stephen F. Cohen, ''Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, 1888–1938'', p. 44.</ref> These months from November 1916 until April 1917 were spent by Bukharin in New York City in the United States. In New York, Bukharin divided his time between the local libraries and his work for ''[[Novy Mir|Novyj Mir]]'' (The New World) a Russian language newspaper serving the Russian speaking community of New York.<ref name="Stephen F. Cohen p. 43">Stephen F. Cohen, ''Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, 1888–1938'', p. 43.</ref> Bukharin's involvement with ''Novyj Mir'' became deeper as time went by. Indeed, from January 1917 until April when he returned to Russia, Bukharin served as ''de facto'' Editor of ''Novyj Mir''.Z<ref name="Stephen F. Cohen p. 43"/> In the period after the death of Lenin in 1924, ''Pravda'' was to form a power base for [[Nikolai Bukharin]], one of the rival party leaders, who edited the newspaper, which helped him reinforce his reputation as a [[Marxist]] theoretician. Bukharin would continue to serve as Editor of ''Pravda'' until he and [[Mikhail Tomsky]] were removed from their responsibilities at ''Pravda'' in February 1929 as part of their downfall as a result of their dispute with [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>Stephen F. Cohen, ''Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, 1888–1938'', p. 311.</ref>

A number of places and things in the Soviet Union were named after ''Pravda''. Among them was the city of [[Pravdinsk, Balakhna|Pravdinsk]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorky Oblast]] (the home of a [[paper mill]] producing much [[newsprint]] for ''Pravda'' and other national newspapers), and a number of streets and [[kolkhoz|collective farms]].

As the names of the main Communist newspaper and the main Soviet newspaper, ''Pravda'' and ''Izvestia'', meant "the truth" and "the news" respectively, a popular saying was "there's no truth in Pravda and no news in Izvestia".<ref name="1987_nytimes">Overholser, Geneva. (12 May 1987). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-dear-pravda.html?pagewanted=1 The Editorial Notebook; Dear Pravda]" ''[[New York Times]]''. Accessed 6 October 2012.</ref> However, though not highly appreciated as an objective and unbiased news source, ''Pravda'' was regarded - both by Soviet citizens and by the outside world - as a government mouthpiece and therefore a reliable reflection of the Soviet government's positions on various issues. The publication of an article in ''Pravda'' could be taken as indication of a change in Soviet policy or the result of a power struggle in the Soviet leadership, and Western [[Sovietologist]]s were regularly reading ''Pravda'' and paying attention to the most minute details and nuances.

== Post-Soviet period ==

''Pravda'' was closed down for a brief period on 30 July 1996. Some of ''Pravda''{{'}}s journalists established their own English language online newspaper known as ''[[Pravda.ru|Pravda Online]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/world/russia-s-purveyor-of-truth-pravda-dies-after-84-years.html|title=Russia's Purveyor of 'Truth', Pravda, Dies After 84 Years|date=31 July 1996|work=The New York Times}}</ref> ''Pravda'' is witnessing hard times and the number of its staff members and print run has been significantly reduced. During the Soviet era it was a daily newspaper but today it is  published three times a week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kprf.ru/xiii_congress/61738.html|title=The Communist Party of the Russian Federation today}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2012}}

''Pravda'' still operates from the same headquarters at Pravda Street from where journalists used to prepare ''Pravda'' every day during the Soviet era.  It operates under the leadership of journalist Boris Komotsky. A function was organised by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CPRF]] on 5 July 2012 to celebrate 100 years since the publication of the first official issue of ''Pravda''.<ref>Sharma, Rajendra.
