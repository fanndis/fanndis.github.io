==Early life==
[[File:Photograph of Rosalynn Carter at about Age 17.gif|thumb|upright|left|Rosalynn Smith around age 17]]

Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on August 18, 1927, in [[Plains, Georgia]]. She was the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar Smith, an [[auto mechanic]], [[bus driver]] and [[farmer]], and Frances Allethea "Allie" Murray Smith, a [[teacher]], [[dressmaker]] and [[post office|postal worker]]. Her brothers were William Jerrold "Jerry" Smith (1929–2003), an engineer, and Murray Lee Smith (1932–2003), a teacher and minister. Her sister, Lillian Allethea (Smith) Wall (born 1936), named for [[Lillian Gordy Carter]] (Smith and Carter families being friends<ref name=O'Brien/>), is a real estate broker. Rosalynn was named after Rosa Wise Murray, her maternal grandmother.<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 3.</ref>

Smith's great uncle W.S. Wise was one of the [[American Brazilians]] known as [[Confederados]] who emigrated from the United States to [[Brazil]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-04-30-9504300190-story.html IN BRAZIL, A TOUCH OF JOHNNY REB] Retrieved May 17, 2019</ref>

Smith's family lived in poverty, although she later claimed that she and her siblings were unaware, since even though their family "didn't have money," neither did "anyone else, so as far as we knew, we were well off."<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 12.</ref> Churches and schools were at the center of her family's community, and the people of Plains were familiar with each other.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/former-first-lady-rosalynn-carter/solving-the-mental-health_b_561747.html|title=Rosalynn Carter: Solving the Mental Crisis for Our Children|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Rosalynn|last=Carter|date=May 6, 2010}}</ref> Smith played with the boys during her early childhood since no girls on her street were her age.

Rosalynn's father died of [[leukemia]] when she was 13. She called the loss of her father the conclusion of her childhood.<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 17.</ref> Thereafter, she helped her mother raise her younger siblings, as well as assisting in the dressmaking business in order to meet the family's financial obligations.<ref name=Godbold /> Rosalynn would credit her mother with inspiring her own independence and said that she learned from her mother that "you can do what you have to do".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-06/features/0211060029_1_president-jimmy-carter-mrs-carter-rosalynn-carter-institute|title=Rosalynn Carter at peace with her work and herself A...|first=Michele|last=Weldon|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=November 6, 2002}}</ref> At Plains High School, Rosalynn worked hard to achieve her father's dream of seeing her go to college.<ref name=Godbold>Godbold, p. 44.</ref> Rosalynn graduated as [[salutatorian]] of Plains High School.

==Politics==
===First Lady of Georgia===
After helping her husband win the governorship of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in [[Georgia gubernatorial election, 1970|1970]], Rosalynn decided to focus her attention in the field of [[mental health]] when she was that state's First Lady. It was her main focus.<ref name=Lindsay229>Lindsay, p. 229.</ref> She was appointed to the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. Many of the Commission's recommendations were approved and became law. In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental health facilities across Georgia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&dat=19710813&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=First Lady lauds Battey progress on mental aid|first=Nan|last=Curry|date=August 13, 1971|publisher=Rome News-Tribune}}</ref> She has described her efforts for mentally disabled children her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|author=PsychiatryLectures|date=September 25, 2011|title=Rosalynn Carter on mental health policy 1982|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9zirBDk1zo|publisher=Youtube.com}}</ref>

Carter also served as a volunteer at the Georgia Regional Hospital in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and for four years was honorary chairperson for the Georgia [[Special Olympics]].<ref>Rosalynn Carter, ''First Lady from Plains'', [[Houghton Mifflin]] Co., [[Boston]], 1984: pp. 74–111</ref>

Among wives of Georgia legislators, she was considered a model and was revered for her traits and appearance. Her activities included entertaining as many as 75 people a week at the [[Georgia Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]].<ref>Godbold, p. 217.</ref> Governor Carter once claimed that he had supported the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] while his wife was opposed to the measure, the First Lady confronting him upon hearing the news story with two feminist allies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter|pages=[https://archive.org/details/redeemerlifeofji0000balm/page/94 94–95]|year=2014|first=Randall|last=Balmer|isbn=978-0465029587|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://archive.org/details/redeemerlifeofji0000balm/page/94}}</ref>

===1976 presidential campaign===
When her husband's gubernatorial term ended in January 1975, Rosalynn, Jimmy and Amy Carter returned to Plains. Jimmy had already announced his plans to run for President of the United States. Rosalynn returned to the campaign trail, this time on a national quest to gather support for her husband. She campaigned alone on his behalf in 41 states. Because of her husband's obscurity at the time, she often had to answer the question, "Jimmy who?"<ref name=Lindsay229 /> She promoted the establishment of additional daycare facilities and adjustments to "Social Security and so many other things to help the elderly."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/26/archives/mrs-carter-carries-campaign-to-harlem.html|title=Mrs. Carter Carries Campaign to Harlem|date=March 26, 1976|work=New York Times}}</ref>

During the months when she was campaigning across the country, she was elected to the board of directors of the [[National Association of Mental Health]], honored by the [[National Organization for Women]] with an Award of Merit for her vigorous support for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], and received the Volunteer of the Year Award from the Southwestern Association of Volunteer Services. Also in 1975, she was photographed shaking hands with serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]], who was active in his local Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://findery.com/ministerofculture/notes/rosalynn-carter-and-john-wayne-gacy|title=Rosalynn Carter and John Wayne Gacy|website=Findery}}</ref>

Rosalynn sat in the balcony at [[Madison Square Garden]] with friends and family the night of the nomination while her husband was with his mother and daughter. She had "butterflies in her stomach," until the Ohio delegation announced its votes were for her husband. Rosalynn wished she could have been with him at that time.<ref>Gherman, p. 63.</ref> The Carters met with all the potential running mates, and instantly gained affinity for [[Walter Mondale]] after meeting with him and his wife [[Joan Mondale|Joan]].<ref>Carter, Jimmy (2010), p. 89.</ref> Following the election, the Carters traveled to the White House and met with President Ford and First Lady [[Betty Ford]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-the-transition-with-president-elect-carter|title=Remarks Following a Meeting on the Transition With President-elect Carter. &#124; The American Presidency Project|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu}}</ref> the latter becoming a role model for Rosalynn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/04/former_first_lady_rosalynn_car_2.html|title=Former first lady Rosalynn Carter calls Betty Ford 'a role model,' touts their support for equal rights|first=Andrew|last=Krietz|date=April 8, 2014|publisher=mlive.com}}</ref>

When her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] during his presidential inauguration parade. The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the [[Atlanta]] balls  when Jimmy became governor.<ref>Rosalynn Carter, ''First Lady from Plains'', [[Houghton Mifflin]] Co., [[Boston]], 1984: p. 6, 148</ref>

Rosalynn declared that she had no intention of being a traditional First Lady of the United States.<ref name=Kaufman119 /> During her husband's administration, Rosalynn supported her husband's public policies as well as his social and personal life. In order to remain fully informed, she sat in on Cabinet meetings at the invitation of the President. The first meeting she attended was on February 28, 1977, where she felt comfortable since she was among other officials that were not members of the unit. The idea for her to be in attendance came from her husband's suggestion after she started to question him about a news story.<ref name=Carter185>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 185.</ref>

She wrote notes, but never spoke. As she put it, "I was there to be informed so that when I traveled across the country, which I did a great deal, and was questioned by the press and other individuals about all areas of government, I'd know what was going on."<ref name=Carter185 /> When the cultural exchange program [[Friendship Force International]] launched at the White House on March 1, 1977, she became honorary chairperson, a position she held until 2002. She joined [[Lady Bird Johnson]] and [[Betty Ford]] in supporting the unsuccessful campaign for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) at the Houston conference celebrating the [[International Women's Year]] in 1977.<ref name=Gould389 /><ref>Rosalynn Carter, ''First Lady from Plains'', [[Houghton Mifflin]] Co., [[Boston]], 1984: pp. 143–300</ref>

For Christmas 1977, she decorated the White House's Christmas tree with ornaments from pine cones, peanuts and egg shells.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/12/history-of-white-house-christmas-trees-98005.html|title=History of White House Christmas trees|publisher=ABC 7|date=December 25, 2013|first=Scott|last=Meeks}}</ref> On July 27, 1978, Carter was the host of "First Lady's Employment Seminar". 200-300 delegates came and shared information to learn how other communities responded to unemployment.<ref name=Gould389>Gould, p. 389.</ref> Rosalynn remembered 1979 and 1980 as years of never-ending crises, the years having "Big ones and small ones, potential disasters and mere annoyances."<ref>Marton, p. 239.</ref>

During 1978, Carter became involved with an effort to reform D.C. General Hospital after criticizing the appearance of it,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/02/19/rosalynn-carter-pledges-help-for-district-hospital/d0d7e4eb-f3c9-46a5-a55f-812541957fe1/|title=Rosalynn Carter Pledges Help for District Hospital|first=B.D.|last=Cohen|work=Washington Post}}</ref> traveling to the hospital for reviews of changing conditions as more work was done in remodeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/10/26/rosalynn-carter-returns/3504c62d-b679-4273-9232-2b823dbd6657/|title=Rosalynn Carter Returns|first=B.D.|last=Colen|date=October 26, 1978}}</ref>

Despite finding time to entertain, the Carters never were able to match their immediate predecessors and Rosalynn never considered it a major part of her job as First Lady.<ref name=Lindsay230>Lindsay, p. 230.</ref>
Criticism came towards her role as First Lady by a U.S. diplomat in Brazil, who insisted that women were meant to be kept "at home and that's all." The cultural factor had also caused many to oppose her trip.<ref name=Gould387>Gould, p. 387.</ref> Critics called her too programmed and disciplined while others said she lacked admirable qualities of Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford.<ref>Caroli, p. 275.</ref> Despite this, Rosalynn was pleased by her viewed role as a demanding First Lady and remembered the times of presidents' wives being "confined" to "official hostess" and other demeaning roles.<ref>Caroli, p. 277.</ref> In efforts to advance the appearance of the White House, she accumulated American paintings.<ref>Watson, p. 57.</ref>

After the Carter administration began losing popularity, Rosalynn advised [[Gerald Rafshoon]] be brought on as [[White House Director of Communications]] and have key media figures at the White House during "informal, off‐the‐record, deep discussions about issues."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/the-importance-of-being-rosalynn-first-lady-on-the-move.html|title=THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ROSALYNN|first=B.

====Mental health campaign====
In March 1977, Carter gave her first interview since becoming First Lady. She outlined her goals in focusing on mental health: "For every person who needs mental health care to be able to receive it close to his home, and to remove the stigma from mental health care so people will be free to talk about it and seek help. It's been taboo for so long to admit you had a mental health problem."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/10/archives/mrs-carter-says-she-tells-the-president-what-i-think.html|title=Mrs. Carter Says She Tells The President 'What I Think'|work=New York Times|date=March 10, 1977}}</ref>

Rosalynn Carter served as an active honorary chair of the [[President's Commission on Mental Health]]. On behalf of the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980|Mental Health System Bill]], enacted in 1980, she testified before a Senate committee, the second [[First Lady]] to appear before the [[United States Congress|Congress]] (the first being [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]). Of her priorities, mental health was the highest. Working to change the nature of government assistance to the mentally ill, Carter wanted to allow people to be comfortable admitting their disabilities without fear of being called crazy.<ref name=Gould387 />

====Influence====
After she had been in the office of First Lady for two years, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called her the "second most powerful person in the United States." Many times, Carter was cited by her husband as an equal partner; he even called her a "perfect extension of myself."<ref>Wertheimer, p. 145.</ref> During a 1977 interview, Carter admitted that she quarrelled with her husband over his policies but his own decision was what he acted on, and she denied influencing his major decisions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19771012&id=VHlUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6039,714907|title=Rosalynn says husband is doing a 'great job'|date=October 12, 1977|publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record}}</ref> In an interview the following year, Carter stated that she did not publicly disagree with her husband's policies out of a belief that she "would lose all my effectiveness with him" as well as her opinion that the gesture would not assist in changing his perspective to her own.<ref name=1978interview>{{Cite web|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-the-president-and-mrs-carter-question-and-answer-session-with-barbara|title=Interview With the President and Mrs. Carter Question-and-Answer Session With Barbara Walters of the American Broadcasting Company. &#124; The American Presidency Project|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu}}</ref> She outlined that a First Lady could influence officials or the public by discussing an issue or giving attention to it.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Presidents' Wives: Reassessing the Office of First Lady|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentswivesr00wats|url-access=registration|first=Robert P.|last=Watson|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidentswivesr00wats/page/29 29]|year=2000|isbn=978-1555879488|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers}}</ref>

Biographer MaryAnne Borrelli wrote that Carter considered her attempts to portray herself as a traditional wife and influencing factor in her husband's administration would be "viewed by some as dependent upon her husband, by others as lacking accountability, and by still others as doing too little–or too much."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Politics of the President's Wife|year=2011|page=125|first=MaryAnne|last=Borrelli|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1603442855}}</ref> Years after leaving the White House, Carter would remain bothered by claims that she exuded too much influence on her husband, insisting they had an equal partnership.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19830623&id=hsJAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3237,4904922|title=Criticism that still hurts Rosalynn Carter|publisher=The Glasgow Herald|first=Charlotte|last=Curtis|date=June 23, 1983}}</ref> Jimmy Carter would later write that the two engaged in discussions on a variety of issues and she was aware of everything within the administration apart from "a few highly secret and sensitive security matters".<ref>{{cite book|title=Sharing Good Times|first=Jimmy|last=Carter|year=2004|author-link=Jimmy Carter|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sharinggoodtimes00cart_0/page/33 33–34]|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0743270335|url=https://archive.org/details/sharinggoodtimes00cart_0/page/33}}</ref>

====Life in the White House====
She was the first First Lady to keep her own office in the [[East Wing]].<ref name="firstladies1">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/facinatingfacts.aspx |title=Little-known facts about our First Ladies |publisher=Firstladies.org |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref> She also oversaw her family at the [[White House]]. Her daughter, Amy, attracted much public attention. The two youngest sons, Chip and Jeff, and their families also lived in the White House. Other members of the family, including son Jack and his wife and children, were frequent visitors. Rosalynn Carter's Secret Service codename was "Dancer".<ref>Walsh, Kenneth T. (2003). "Appendix". Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes. Hyperion. pp. 227. {{ISBN|1-4013-0004-9}}.</ref> In 1977, Carter reported that her family was divided in their reaction to public perception of them, saying her sons were worried about how they would be perceived living there while she personally thought nothing of it as the public was not financing their residence and she favored the family being together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1977/03/13/rosalynn-carter-awesome-home/59605bc6-c5da-486c-90e1-6d6e56a3bf34/|title=Rosalynn Carter: 'Awesome' Home|first=Helen|last=Thomas|work=Washington Post|date=March 13, 1977}}</ref>

On August 16, 1979, Carter released a statement announcing Edith J.

After leaving the White House, Carter reflected of Washington, "I love this city. I loved living here and being so close to the seat of power, being a part of the political system. When you watched television you knew the people involved, you were familiar with both sides of the issues."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/us/a-former-first-lady-returns-to-city-she-loves.html|title=A FORMER FIRST LADY RETURNS TO CITY SHE LOVES|first=Barbara|last=Gamarekian|date=April 13, 1984|work=New York Times}}</ref>

====Equal Rights Amendment====
During the 1976 campaign, Carter spoke to feminists about her equal partnership with her husband.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/mrs-carter-cool-and-intense-on-day-of-triumph-for-her-too.html|title=Mrs. Carter Cool and Intense On Day of Triumph for Her, Too|work=New York Times|date=January 21, 1977}}</ref> In January 1977, prior to the inauguration of her husband, Carter substituted for him in speaking with Senator [[Birch Bayh]] over the phone as the latter wanted President-elect Carter to lobby for support of the Equal Rights Amendment being ratified in [[Indiana]].

In reference to Carter's role in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, associate professor of religion Elizabeth Flowers said, "[Rosalynn Carter] wanted to temper down some of the more radical elements of feminism, as she saw it, and challenge what she felt were caricatures of the movement. She wanted to be sure that the struggle for ERA really appealed to mainstream America."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://magazine.tcu.edu/spring-2016/rosalynn-carter-southern-feminism/|title=Rosalynn Carter's Southern Feminism|publisher=TCU Magazine}}</ref>

In the last few months of her husband's presidency, Rosalynn was confident that she and her husband would be able to defeat Reagan in the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]].

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
Their families were already acquainted when Rosalynn first dated Jimmy Carter in 1945 while he was attending the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]]. She developed a crush on him after seeing a picture of him in his Annapolis uniform.<ref name=O'Brien>O'Brien, p. 253.</ref>
The two were riding in the back seat of the car of Ruth Carter's boyfriend when Jimmy surprised Rosalynn by kissing her. This was the first time that Rosalynn had ever allowed a boy to do this on the first date.<ref>Ryan, p. 21.</ref> Rosalynn agreed to marry Jimmy in February 1946 when she went to Annapolis with his parents. The two scheduled their marriage to take place in July and kept the arrangement secret. Rosalynn resented telling her mother she had chosen to marry instead of continuing her education.<ref>Godbold, pp. 58-59.</ref> On July 7, 1946, they married in Plains. The marriage canceled Rosalynn's plans to attend [[Georgia State College for Women]], where she had planned to study interior design.<ref name=Kaufman119>Kaufman, p. 119.</ref>

The couple had four children: [[Jack Carter (politician)|John William "Jack"]] (b. 1947), James Earl "Chip" III (b. 1950), Donnel Jeffrey "Jeff" (b. 1952), and [[Amy Carter|Amy Lynn]] (b. 1967).  Due to Jimmy's military duties, the first three were born in different parts of the country and away from Georgia. During those duties, Rosalynn watched over and enjoyed the independence she had gained from raising the children on her own. However, their relationship faced its first major crisis when she opposed Jimmy's resigning to return to Plains in 1953 after he learned his father was dying.<ref name=Kaufman119 /> 
Jimmy reflected that she "avoided talking to me as much as possible" as a result of his decision and would interact with him through their children.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety|year=2015|pages=67–68|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1501115646}}</ref> They were fans of the [[New York Yankees]] until the [[Braves]] moved to Atlanta.<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 27.</ref> They said they never went to bed arguing with each other.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/jimmy-carter-now-88-on-aging-and-health/2013/05/03/84f67db8-9ae8-11e2-9bda-edd1a7fb557d_story.html|title=Jimmy Carter, now 88, on aging and health|date=May 6, 2013|first=Laura|last=Hambleton}}</ref>

In 1953, after her husband left the Navy, Rosalynn helped run the family peanut farm and warehouse business, handling accounting responsibilities. Around this time and yearning for another child, the Carters discovered Rosaylnn had physical ailments preventing her from having another child, which would only be rectified twelve years later when she underwent surgery for the removal of a large tumor from her uterus, her obstetrician confirming the couple could have another child and their daughter Amy being born thereafter.<ref>{{cite book| author = Carter, Jimmy| title = Why Not the Best?

Rosalynn had different relationships with each member of Jimmy's family. Becoming friends with his sister [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]], who was two years younger than she, she gave her dresses she had outgrown.<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 4.</ref> However, she and Jimmy's mother, [[Lillian Gordy Carter]], had difficulty living together.<ref>Godbold, p. 84.</ref>

In later years, the couple rode two and a half miles a day on three-wheel electric scooters, and they read the [[Bible]] aloud to each other in Spanish before they retired to bed each night.<ref name=People/>

On November 22, 1963, Rosalynn was at a beauty parlor when she was contacted by her husband and informed of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. She would later write that though the pair were both saddened at the event, a teacher and classmates of their son Chip exclaimed happiness.<ref>Carter, Rosalynn (1984), p. 49.</ref> Carter backed Kennedy's successor [[Lyndon B.

Jimmy thoroughly consulted with Rosalynn before he mounted a bid for [[Governor of Georgia]] in 1966. She traveled to multiple towns throughout the state with promotional materials, visited multiple establishments such as radio stations and newspaper offices, and attending civic organizations meetings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sharing Good Times|first=Jimmy|last=Carter|year=2004|author-link=Jimmy Carter|page=[https://archive.org/details/sharinggoodtimes00cart_0/page/44 44]|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0743270335|url=https://archive.org/details/sharinggoodtimes00cart_0/page/44}}</ref> In one encounter, she tried endorsing her husband to a man in [[Washington, Georgia]], the latter declaring his support for Republican candidate [[Bo Callaway]] before spitting on her. Rosalynn would later describe the encounter as the "worst political experience of my life."

==Activism==
===The Carter Center===
After the Carters left the [[White House]] in 1981, Rosalynn and Jimmy continued to lead a very active life. In 1982, she co-founded [[The Carter Center]], a private, [[not-for-profit]] institution based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The Carters returned to the home they had built in 1961 in Plains, Georgia. She is a member of the Center's Board of Trustees and participates in many of the Center's programs, but gives special attention to the Mental Health Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/experts/rosalynn_carter.html|title=Rosalynn Carter Biography|website=The Carter Center}}</ref> Carter and her husband fell into serious debt immediately after leaving the White House, but were able to alleviate this by writing projects and were able to open the Carter Center from their revenue. She, like Betty Ford before her, would say the American people made a mistake in not reelecting her husband and was bitter over the election.<ref>O'Brien, p. 256.</ref> At this time she expressed resentment of [[Ronald Reagan]], and even told interviewer [[Mike Wallace]] that he was ruining the country. Rumors at this time spread that she was running for [[Governor of Georgia]], which she denied and outright stated she had no political ambition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Conversation with Carter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-DXDZDo9xUC&q=rosalynn+carter&pg=PA262|date=October 1998|isbn=9781555878016|last1=Carter|first1=Jimmy}}</ref> When asked nearly two decades later why she had not run for Georgia Senate after [[Hillary Clinton]] was pondering to run, she responded "What would I have done in Washington, with Jimmy in Georgia?"<ref>Marton, p. 243.</ref>

Rosalynn and her husband's first major project with the Carter Center was to help in peace between [[Israel]] and its neighbors. The two visited the Middle East in March 1983 and worked with [[Kenneth W.

This included the [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinian]] community, [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].<ref>Carter, Jimmy (2008), p. 15.</ref>

===Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving===
Rosalynn Carter is president of the board of directors for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving (RCI) at [[Georgia Southwestern State University]], her alma mater in [[Americus, Georgia]]. The RCI, which was established in 1987, aims to address issues related to [[caregiving]] in America and internationally. The institute focuses its work on both family and professional [[caregivers]] for individuals living with [[chronic illness]] and [[disabilities]], limitations related to [[aging]], and other health concerns across the lifespan. It plays a major role in moving science into practice for caregivers by supporting the implementation of evidence-based programs and interventions for caregivers in community settings.<ref>[http://rci.gsw.edu/ Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving].

===Advocacy for women and children===
In 1988, Rosalynn Carter convened with three other former [[first ladies]]—[[Betty Ford]], [[Lady Bird Johnson]], and [[Pat Nixon]]—at the "Women and the Constitution" conference at [[The Carter Center]] to assess that document's impact on women. The conference featured over 150 speakers and 1,500 attendees from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries. The conference was meant to promote [[awareness]] on [[gender inequality|sexual inequality]] in other countries, and fight against it in America.<ref>Carter, Jimmy (2008), p. 233.</ref>

She served on the Policy Advisory Board of The Atlanta Project (TAP) of The Carter Center, addressing social ills associated with [[poverty]] and [[quality of life]] citywide.

In 1991, she launched [[Every Child By Two]], a nationwide campaign that sought to increase early childhood [[immunizations]] along with [[Betty Bumpers]], wife of former U.S. Senator [[Dale Bumpers]] of [[Arkansas]].
