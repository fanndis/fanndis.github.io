'''Professional services''' are occupations in the [[service sector]] requiring special training in [[the arts]] or sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/financial-and-professional/professional-services/|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/financial-and-professional/professional-services/ |archivedate=2 April 2014 |title=Professional services |publisher=The Office of Fair Trading |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Some professional services require holding professional degrees and licenses and they also require specific skills such as  [[architect]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Doctor (title)|doctor]]s, [[lawyer]]s and [[teachers]]. Other professional services involve providing specialist business support to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors; this can include [[tax advice]], supporting a company with accounting, [[IT services]] or [[management consulting|providing management advice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/issues/higher-apprenticeships-what-are-professional-services.jhtml |title=What are professional services? |publisher=PwC |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> 

== Definition ==
Many industry groupings have been used for academic research when looking at professional services firms, making a clear definition hard to attain. Some work has been directed at better defining professional service firms (PSF). In particular, Von Nordenflycht generated a taxonomy of professional service firms, defining four types:<ref>Von Nordenflycht, A, "What is a professional service firm? Toward a theory and taxonomy of knowledge-intensive firms", ''Academy of Management Review'', Vol. 35, No. 1. (2010), pp. 155–174</ref>

# Classic PSFs (e.g. law and accounting firms): characterised by a high knowledge intensity, a professionalised workforce, and low [[capital intensity]]
# Professional campuses (e.g. hospitals): characterised by a high knowledge intensity, a professionalised workforce, and high capital intensity
# Neo-PSFs (e.g. management consultants): characterised by a high knowledge intensity and a low capital intensity
# Technology developers (e.g. [[R&D]] firms, [[biotech]]s): characterised by a high knowledge intensity and a high capital intensity

Frameworks such as this aid the ability of managers and academics to better understand how such firms manage themselves and how to judge benchmark practices.

== Provision ==
Professional services can be provided by [[sole proprietors]], [[partnerships]] or [[corporations]]. A person providing the service can often be described as a [[consultant]]. In law, [[barristers]] normally organise themselves into [[Barristers#Differences between barristers and solicitors|chambers]]. Businesses in other industries, such as banks and retailers, can employ individuals or teams to offer professional services for their customers. Major cities such as [[Economy of London|London]] and [[Economy of New York City|New York]] are leading global centres for professional services firms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Facts about the UK as an International Financial Centre 2014|url=https://www.thecityuk.com/assets/2014/Reports-PDF/Key-Facts-about-international-financial-and-related-professional-services-2014.pdf|publisher=TheCityUK|accessdate=9 October 2016|page=5|date=3 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510104208/https://www.thecityuk.com/assets/2014/Reports-PDF/Key-Facts-about-international-financial-and-related-professional-services-2014.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=GFCI>{{cite web|url=http://www.longfinance.net/images/GFCI17_23March2015.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 17|date=March 2015|publisher=Long Finance|accessdate=5 June 2015|page=32|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414052808/http://www.longfinance.net/images/GFCI17_23March2015.pdf|archive-date=14 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Marketing ==
The [[marketing]] and selection of professional-service providers may depend on factors such as skill, knowledge, experience, reputation, capacity, ethics, and creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbdc.duq.edu/Files/Admin/Webnotes/8ChoosinganAccountant.pdf |title=Choosing an Accountant |publisher=Duquesne University Small Business Development Center |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://amcf.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307&Itemid=91 |title=Selection Criteria |publisher=Association of Management Consulting Firms |accessdate=26 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701022542/http://amcf.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307&Itemid=91 |archive-date=1 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Large corporations may have a formal [[procurement]] process for engaging professional services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmi.org/business-solutions/~/media/pdf/business-solutions/pmi_rcp_guide_for_organizations.ashx |title=A Guide on How to Select a Project Management Consultancy |publisher=Project Management Institute |accessdate=26 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221095711/http://www.pmi.org/Business-Solutions/~/media/PDF/Business-Solutions/PMI_RCP_Guide_for_organizations.ashx |archivedate=21 December 2010 }}</ref> Prices for services, even within the same field, may vary greatly. Professional-service providers may offer fixed rates for specific work, charge in relation to the number or seniority of people engaged, or charge in relation to the success or profit generated by the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=How management consultants are cashing in on austerity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/management-consultants-cashing-in-austerity-public-sector-cuts|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=The Guardian|date=17 October 2016}}</ref>
