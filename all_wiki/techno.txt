'''Techno''' is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[electronic dance music]]<ref>According to Butler (2006:33) use of the term EDM "has become increasingly common among fans in recent years. During the 1980s, the most common catchall term for EDM was ''house music'', while ''techno'' became more prevalent during the first half of the 1990s. As EDM has become more diverse, however, these terms have come to refer to specific genres. Another word, ''electronica'', has been widely used in mainstream journalism since 1996, but most fans view this term with suspicion as a marketing label devised by the music industry".</ref> (EDM) that is characterized by a repetitive [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] beat<ref>Butler, M. (2006). Unlocking the groove : rhythm, meter, and musical design in electronic dance music. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, page 78. ''"...Drawing on two of the most  commonly used terms employed in this discourse, I will describe these categories as ‘breakbeat-driven” and ‘four-on-the-floor.’… The constant stream of steady bass-drum quarter notes that results is the distinguishing feature of four-on-the-floor genres, and the term continues to be used within EDM  … The primary genres within this category are techno, house, and trance."''
*Brewster, B. & Broughton, F. (2014). Last night a DJ saved my life : the history of the disc jockey. New York: Grove Press, Chapter 7, paragraph 48 (EPUB.''"‘No UFOs’ was a dark challenge to the dancefloor built from growing layers of robotic bass, dissonant melody lines and barks of disembodied voices. it was music he’d originally intended for Cybotron, and in its theme of government control it continued Cybotron’s doomy social commentary, but was noticeably faster-paced, with the electro breakbeat replaced by an industrial four-to-the-floor rhythm. This was the sound of Detroit’s future.''
*Julien, O. & Levaux, C. (2018). Over and over:exploring repetition in popular music. New York, NY: Bloomsbury Academic, page 76.''"Most techno dance music is characterized by a post-disco, house-music-inflected, rhythm that is known as “four-on-the-floor:’ in reference to the pulse that is explicitly emphasized by a kick drum on each beat (regular like the piston of a mechanical machine), while the snare is heard on the second and fourth beats, and an open hi-hat sound provides a sense of pull and push in between the beats. Music styles that fall within the rhythmic realm of the disco-continuum include not only Chicago house music and Detroit techno, but also hi-NRG and trance."''
*Webber, S. (2008). DJ skills : the essential guide to mixing and scratching. Oxford: Focal, page 253.''"A lot of dance music features what's called four on the floor, which means that the bass drum (also called the kick drum) Is playing quarter notes In 4/4 time. While four on the floor is common in most genres derived from house and techno, it is far from new."''
*Demers, J. (2010). Listening through the noise : the aesthetics of experimental electronic music. Oxford New York: Oxford University Press, page 97.''"These newest subgenres drew listeners in part because they provided a respite from relent less dancing but also because they fleshed out the sparseness of straight-ahead techno and house. In particular, dub techno replaced EDM’s mechanization with a way of muffling the sense of time’s passage, despite the persistence of the four-on-the-floor beat."''</ref> which is generally [[music production|produced]] for use in a continuous [[DJ set]]. The central [[Drum beat|rhythm]] is often in [[common time]] (4/4), while the [[tempo]] typically varies between 120 and 150 [[beats per minute]] (bpm). Artists may use [[electronic instrument]]s such as [[drum machines]], [[sequencer (musical instrument)|sequencers]], and [[synthesizer]]s, as well as [[digital audio workstations]]. Drum machines from the 1980s such as [[Roland Corporation|Roland's]] [[TR-808]] and [[TR-909]] are highly prized, and [[softsynth|software emulations]] of such [[retro]] instruments are popular.

Use of the term "techno" to refer to a type of [[electronic music]] originated in Germany in the early 1980s. In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation ''[[Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit]],'' the term came to be associated with a form of electronic dance music produced in Detroit.<ref name=BREW354>Brewster 2006:354</ref><ref name=REYNOLDS71>Reynolds 1999:71. ''Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the [[Belleville Three]] decided to fasten on the word techno – a term that had been bandied about but never stressed – in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre.''</ref> [[Detroit techno]] resulted from the melding of [[synthpop]] by artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] with [[African American music|African American styles]] such as [[house music|house]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[funk]].<ref name="bogdanov_2001">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All music guide to electronica: the definitive guide to electronic music|year=2001|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Backbeat Books]]|isbn=0-87930-628-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJNXLSBlL7IC&pg=PT582|edition=4|access-date=May 26, 2011|page=582|quote=Typically, that birth is traced to the early '80s and the emaciated inner-city of Detroit, where figures such as [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]], among others, fused the quirky machine music of Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra with the space-race electric funk of George Clinton, the optimistic futurism of Alvin Toffler's ''The Third Wave'' (from which the music derived its name), and the emerging electro sound elsewhere being explored by Soul Sonic Force, the Jonzun Crew, Man Parrish, "Pretty" Tony Butler, and LA's Wrecking Cru.}}</ref> Added to this is the influence of [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] and [[science-fiction]] themes<ref>Rietveld 1998:125</ref> relevant to life in American [[Late capitalism|late capitalist]] society, with [[Alvin Toffler|Alvin Toffler's]] book ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' a notable point of reference.<ref>Sicko 1999:28</ref><ref>''Having grown up with the latter-day effects of Fordism, the Detroit techno musicians read futurologist Alvin Toffler's soundbite predictions for change – 'blip culture', 'the intelligent environment', 'the infosphere', 'de-massification of the media de-massifies our minds', 'the techno rebels', 'appropriated technologies' – accorded with some, though not all, of their own intuitions,'' Toop, D.

After the success of [[house music]] in a number of European countries, techno grew in popularity in the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.<ref>{{youtube|id=gu78EKCS54g|title=Short excerpt from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec. 8, 1988}}The show is called "Tanzhouse" hosted by a young Fred Kogel.

Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as [[tech house]] and [[Trance music|trance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicfaze.com/p/electronica-genre-guide.html#te|title=Music Faze - The Electro House, Dubstep, EDM Music Blog: Electronica Genre Guide|date=December 20, 2014|access-date=November 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220000949/http://www.musicfaze.com/p/electronica-genre-guide.html#te|archive-date=2014-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Critzon | title=Eat Static is bad stuff |date=September 17, 2001 | url =http://www.cm-life.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=18da0484-aa27-4c21-9e8e-a2abdbb39b94 | archive-url =http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160524013848/http://www.cm-life.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=18da0484-aa27-4c21-9e8e-a2abdbb39b94 | url-status =dead | archive-date =May 24, 2016 | work =Central Michigan Life | access-date = August 12, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Electronic Energy|journal=The Miami Herald|date=March 23, 2001|first=Michael|last=Hamersly|pages=6G }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|periodical=Newsweek|date=February 10, 1997|title=Electronic Eden|last=Schoemer|first=Karen|page=60}} ''Every Monday night, Natania goes to Koncrete Jungle, a dance party on new York's lower East Side that plays a hip, relatively new offshoot of dance music known as drum & bass—or, in a more general way, ''techno'', a blanket term that describes music made on computers and electronic gadgets instead of conventional instruments, and performed by deejays instead of old-fashioned bands.''</ref>

==Detroit techno==
The initial blueprint for [[Detroit techno]] developed during the mid-1980s in [[Belleville, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]] by Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May (the so-called The Belleville Three), all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]],<ref>Brewster 2006:340–359</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a.</ref><ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN>Sicko 1999</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:12–40</ref> with the addition of Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter and James Pennington. By the close of the 1980s, the pioneers had recorded and released material under various guises: Atkins as [[Juan Atkins|Model 500]], Flintstones, and Magic Juan; Fowlkes simply as [[Eddie "Flashin" Fowlkes]]; Saunderson as Reeses, Keynotes, and Kaos; with May as Mayday, R-Tyme, and [[Rhythim Is Rhythim]]. There were also a number of joint ventures, <!--the most commercially successful of which{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} was-->including Kevin Saunderson's group [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]], which saw collaborations with Atkins, May, vocalist [[Paris Grey]], and fellow DJs [[James Pennington]] and [[Arthur Forest (DJ)|Arthur Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/39861|title=Release info & credits for Inner City's "Big Fun" original 12" single|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> [[The Electrifying Mojo]] was the first radio DJ to play music by Atkins, May, and Saunderson. Mojo refused to follow pre-established radio formats or playlists, and he promoted social and cultural awareness of the African American community.

In exploring Detroit techno's origins writer [[Kodwo Eshun]] maintains that "[[Kraftwerk]] are to techno what [[Muddy Waters]] is to the [[Rolling Stones]]: the authentic, the origin, the real."<ref name=KODWO100>Kodwo 1998:100</ref> Juan Atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]], particularly Moroder's work with [[Donna Summer]] and the producer's own album ''E=MC<sup>2</sup>.'' Atkins also mentions that "around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, [[Telex (band)|Telex]], [[Devo]], Giorgio Moroder and [[Gary Numan]], and I'd ride around in my car playing it."<ref name=MTM/> Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with [[Richard Davis (techno artist)|Richard "3070" Davis]] as [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]], which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments.<ref>Sicko 1999:79</ref> Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were "clean and precise" relative to the "weird UFO sounds" featured in his seemingly "psychedelic" music.<ref>Sicko 1999:71</ref>

Derrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that "it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!".<ref>Silcott, M.  (1999). ''Rave America: New school dancescapes''. Toronto, ON:  ECW Press.</ref> May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition.<ref name=BREW349>Brewster 2006:349</ref> He also identified Japanese synthpop act [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], particularly member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], and British band [[Ultravox]], as influences, along with Kraftwerk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Derrick May on the roots of techno at RBMA Bass Camp Japan 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t3r3makyc4|work=[[Red Bull Music Academy]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=July 23, 2012|date=September 20, 2010}}</ref> YMO's song "[[Solid State Survivor|Technopolis]]" (1979), a tribute to [[Tokyo]] as an electronic mecca, is considered an "interesting contribution" to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.<ref>Sicko 1999:49</ref>

Kevin Saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of Europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: "I was more infatuated with the idea that I can do this all myself."<ref name=BREW349/>

These early Detroit techno artists additionally employed [[science fiction]] imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schaub|first=Christoph|title=Beyond the Hood?

Prior to achieving notoriety, Atkins, Saunderson, May, and Fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians, [[DJ mix|"mix"]] tape traders, and aspiring DJs.<ref>{{cite news| title=Techno music pulses in Detroit |date=February 13, 2003 | publisher=CNN | url =http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/02/10/techno.exhibit.ap|access-date = August 11, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184221/http://cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/02/10/techno.exhibit.ap <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = October 12, 2007}}</ref> They also found musical inspiration via the ''[[Midnight Funk Association]],'' an eclectic five-hour late-night radio program hosted on various Detroit radio stations, including [[WMKM|WCHB]], [[WGPR]], and WJLB-FM from 1977 through the mid-1980s by DJ Charles "[[The Electrifying Mojo]]" Johnson.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gridface.com/features/a_brief_history_of_techno.html|title=A Brief History of Techno|last=Arnold|first=Jacob|journal=Gridface|date=October 17, 1999}}</ref> Mojo's show featured [[electronic music]] by artists such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and [[Tangerine Dream]], alongside the funk sounds of acts such as [[Parliament Funkadelic]] and dance oriented [[new wave music]] by bands like [[Devo]] and [[the B-52's]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Shapiro | first = Peter | title = Modulations: A History of Electronic Music, Throbbing Words on Sound | publisher = Caipirinha Productions, Inc. | year = 2000 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap/page/108 108]–121 | isbn = 189102406X | url = https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap | url-access = registration }}</ref> Atkins has noted:

Despite the short-lived disco boom in Detroit, it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing, Juan Atkins among them. Subsequently, Atkins taught May how to mix records, and in 1981, "Magic Juan", Derrick "Mayday", in conjunction with three other DJ's, one of whom was Eddie "Flashin" Fowlkes, launched themselves as a party crew called Deep Space Soundworks<ref>Brewster 2006:350</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:16–17.</ref> (also referred to as Deep Space).<ref>Sicko 1999:56–58</ref> In 1980 or 1981 they met with Mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show, which they did end up doing the following year.<ref name=MTM/>

During the late 1970s-early 1980s high school clubs such as Brats, Charivari, Ciabattino, Comrades, Gables, Hardwear, Rafael, Rumours, Snobs, and Weekends<ref>Snobs, Brats, Ciabattino, Rafael, and Charivari are mentioned in ''Generation Ecstasy'' (Reynolds 1999:15); Gables and Charivari are mentioned in ''Techno Rebels'' (Sicko 1999:35,51–52). Citations still needed for Comrades, Hardwear, Rumours, and Weekends.</ref> allowed the young promoters to develop and nurture a local dance music scene. As the local scene grew in popularity, DJs began to band together to market their mixing skills and [[Sound system (DJ)|sound systems]] to clubs that were hoping to attract larger audiences. Local church activity centers, vacant warehouses, offices, and [[YMCA]] auditoriums were the early locations where the musical form was nurtured.<ref>Sicko 1999:33–42,54–59</ref>

===Juan Atkins===
{{main|Juan Atkins|Cybotron (American band)}}

Of the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right, Juan Atkins is widely cited as "The Originator".<ref>Dr. Rebekah Farrugia paraphrasing Derrick May in a review of ''High Tech Soul: The Creation of Techno Music'' (Directed by Gary Bredow. Plexifilm DVD PLX-029, 2006). Published in ''Journal of the Society for American Music'' (2008) Volume 2, Number 2, pp. 291–293.</ref> Atkins' role was likewise acknowledged in 1995 by the American music technology publication ''[[Keyboard Magazine]]'', which honored him as one of ''12 Who Count'' in the history of keyboard music.<ref>''Keyboard Magazine'' Vol. 21, No.7 (issue #231, July 1995).</ref>

In the early 1980s, Atkins began recording with musical partner Richard Davis (and later with a third member, Jon-5) as Cybotron. This trio released a number of rock and electro-inspired tunes,<ref>Sicko 1999:74</ref> the most successful of which were ''[[Clear (Cybotron song)|Clear]]'' (1983) and its moodier followup, "Techno City" (1984).<ref>Cosgrove 1988b. ''Juan's first group Cybotron released several records at the height of the electro-funk boom in the early '80s, the most successful being a progressive homage to the city of Detroit, simply entitled 'Techno City'.''</ref><ref>Sicko 1999:75. ''Adding to the impact of ''Enter'', the single "Clear" made a huge splash and became Cybotron's biggest hit, especially after it was remixed by Jose "Animal" Diaz. "Clear" climbed the charts in Dallas, Houston, and Miami, and spent nine weeks on the Billboard Top Black Singles chart (as it was called then) in fall 1983, peaking at No. 52. "Clear" was a success.''</ref>

Atkins used the term ''techno'' to describe Cybotron's music, taking inspiration from [[Futurist]] author Alvin Toffler, the original source for words such as ''cybotron'' and ''metroplex''. Atkins has described earlier synthesizer based acts like Kraftwerk as techno, although many would consider both Kraftwerk's and Juan's Cybotron outputs as electro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4080.html|title=First academic conference on techno music and its African American origins|access-date=October 8, 2019|author=Unknown author}}</ref> Atkins viewed Cybotron's ''Cosmic Cars'' (1982) as unique, Germanic, synthesized funk, but he later heard [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" (1982) and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned. Inspired, he resolved to continue experimenting, and he encouraged Saunderson and May to do likewise.<ref>Cosgrove 1988b. "At the time, [Atkins] believed ["Techno City"] was a unique and adventurous piece of synthesizer funk, more in tune with Germany than the rest of black America, but on a dispiriting visit to New York, Juan heard Afrika Bambaataa's 'Planet Rock' and realized that his vision of a spartan electronic dance sound had been upstaged. He returned to Detroit and renewed his friendship with two younger students from Belleville High, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May, and quietly over the next few years the three of them became the creative backbone of Detroit Techno.'' "Techno City" was released in 1984. Sicko 1999:73 clarifies Atkins was in New York in 1982, trying to get Cybotron's "Cosmic Cars" into the hands of radio DJs, when he first heard "Planet Rock"; so "Cosmic Cars", not "Techno City", is the ''unique and adventurous piece of synthesizer funk''.</ref>

Eventually, Atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym [[Juan Atkins|Model 500]], and in 1985 he established the record label [[Metroplex (record label)|Metroplex]].<ref>Sicko 1999:76</ref> The same year saw an important turning point for the Detroit scene with the release of Model 500's "[[No UFO's]]," a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production.<ref>Sicko 2010:48-49</ref><ref>Butler 2006:43</ref><ref>Nelson 2001:154</ref><ref>''"In 1985 Juan Atkins released the first record on his fledgling label Metroplex, 'No UFO's', now widely regarded as Year Zero of the techno movement."'' Cox, T. (2008), [http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature-read.aspx?id=907 Model 500:Remake/remodel], interview with Atkins and Mike Banks hosted on www.residentadvisor.net</ref><ref>Interview with Detroit producer Alan Oldham hosted at [http://www.spannered.org/music/722/ Spannered.org]. Oldham answers ''"The release of Model 500 No UFO's"'' when asked ''"what do you consider to be the most important turning points in the history of Detroit techno?"''</ref> Of this time, Atkins has said:

{{quote|When I started Metroplex around February or March of '85 and released "No UFO's," I thought I was just going to make my money back on it, but I wound up selling between 10,000 and 15,000 copies. I had no idea that my record would happen in Chicago. Derrick's parents had moved there, and he was making regular trips between Detroit and Chicago. So when I came out with 'No UFO's,' he took copies out to Chicago and gave them to some DJs, and it just happened.<ref name=MTM/>}}

The early producers, enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers, merged a European [[synthpop]] aesthetic with aspects of [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[disco music|disco]], and [[electro music|electro]], pushing electronic dance music into uncharted terrain. They deliberately rejected the [[Motown Records|Motown]] legacy and traditional formulas of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]], and instead embraced technological experimentation.<ref name=COSGROVE_ATKINS>Cosgrove 1988a. ''[Says Juan Atkins, ] "Within the last 5 years or so, the Detroit underground has been experimenting with technology, stretching it rather than simply using it. As the price of sequencers and synthesizers has dropped, so the experimentation has become more intense. Basically, we're tired of hearing about being in love or falling out, tired of the R&B system, so a new progressive sound has emerged. We call it techno!"''</ref><ref name=COSGROVE_POSTSOUL>Cosgrove 1988a. ''Although the Detroit dance music has been casually lumped in with the jack virus of Chicago house, the young techno producers of the Seventh City claim to have their own sound, music that goes 'beyond the beat', creating a hybrid of post-punk, funkadelia and electro-disco...a mesmerizing underground of new dance which blends European industrial pop with black American garage funk...If the techno scene worships any gods, they are a pretty deranged deity, according to Derrick May. "The music is just like like Detroit, a complete mistake.

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's "[[Derrick May (musician)#Career|Strings of Life]]" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, "Nude Photo" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 [[house music]] boom (see [[Second Summer of Love]]).<ref>Unterberger R., Hicks S., Dempsey J, (1999).

The Detroit sound exerted an influence on widely differing styles of electronic music, yet it also maintained an identity as a genre in its own right, one now commonly referred to as "[[Detroit techno]]".

===Chicago===

The music's producers, especially May and Saunderson, admit to having been fascinated by the Chicago club scene and influenced by house in particular.<ref>Sicko 1999:77–78</ref><ref name=DFP>{{Cite book|publisher=Detroit Free Press|title=Detroit Electronic Music Festival salutes Chicago connection|date=May 22, 2002|first=Brian|last=McCollum|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8849128_ITM|access-date=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218195332/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8849128_ITM|archive-date=December 18, 2008}}</ref> May's 1987/1989 hit "Strings of Life" (released under the alias Rhythim Is Rhythim) is considered a classic in both the house and techno genres.<ref name=DFP/><ref>{{Cite news | last =Harrison | first =Andrew | date =July 1992 | title =Derrick May | periodical =Select | location =London | pages =80–83}} "RIR singles like 'Strings of Life'...are among the few classics in the debased world of techno"</ref><ref>"Strings of Life" appears on compilations titled ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/788003 The Real Classics of Chicago House 2]'' (2003), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/6413 Techno Muzik Classics]''  (1999), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/483465 House Classics Vol. One]'' (1997), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/48064 100% House Classics Vol. 1]'' (1995), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/64669 Classic House 2]'' (1994), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/13123 Best of House Music Vol. 3]'' (1990), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/30645 Best of Techno Vol. 4]'' (1994), ''[http://www.discogs.com/release/146494 House Nation – Classic House Anthems Vol. 1]'' (1994), and [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rhythim+Is+Rhythim numerous other compilations] with the words "techno" or "house" in their titles.</ref>

Juan Atkins also believes that the first [[acid house]] producers, seeking to distance house music from [[disco]], emulated the techno sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timlawrence.info/linernotes/2005/acidhousesj.php |title=Acid?

{{quote|Derrick sold Chicago DJ Frankie Knuckles a TR909 drum machine. This was back when the Powerplant was open in Chicago, but before any of the Chicago DJs were making records. They were all into playing Italian imports; 'No UFOs' was the only U.S.-based independent record that they played. So Frankie Knuckles started using the 909 at his shows at the Powerplant. Boss had just brought out their little sampling footpedal, and somebody took one along there. Somebody was on the mic, and they sampled that and played it over the drumtrack pattern. Having got the drum machine and the sampler, they could make their own tunes to play at parties. One thing just led to another, and Chip E used the 909 to make his own record, and from then on, all these DJs in Chicago borrowed that 909 to come out with their own records.<ref name=MTM/>}}

In the UK, a club following for house music grew steadily from 1985, with interest sustained by scenes in London, Manchester, Nottingham, and later Sheffield and Leeds. The DJs thought to be responsible for house's early UK success include [[Mike Pickering]], [[Mark Moore]], [[Colin Faver]], and [[Graeme Park]].<ref name="Rietveld 1998:40–50">Rietveld 1998:40–50</ref>

====Acid house====
{{see also|Acid house|Rave|Second Summer of Love}}
[[File:TB-303.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Roland TB-303]]: The [[bass synthesizer|bass line synthesizer]] that was used prominently in [[acid house]].]]

By 1988, house music had exploded in the UK, and [[acid house]] was increasingly popular.<ref name="Rietveld 1998:40–50"/> There was also a long-established warehouse party [[subculture]] based around the [[sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] scene. In 1988, the music played at warehouse parties was predominantly house. That same year, the [[Balearic beat|Balearic]] party vibe associated with Ibiza-based DJ [[Alfredo Fiorito]] was transported to London, when [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Paul Oakenfold]] opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both night spots quickly became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that the use of [[MDMA]], as a party drug, started to gain prominence. Other important UK clubs at this time included Back to Basics in [[Leeds]], Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and in Manchester [[The Haçienda]], where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's Friday night spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American [[Underground music|underground]] <ref>Fikentscher (2000:5), in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to post-disco music in America, states that: ''"The prefix 'underground' does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music - and its cultural context - are familiar only to a small number of informed persons. Underground also points to the sociological function of the music, framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away, to large degree, from mainstream society, mass media, and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values."'' Fikentscher, K. (2000), ''You Better Work!: Underground Dance Music in New York'', Wesleyan University Press, Hanover, NH.</ref> dance music. Acid house party fever escalated in London and Manchester, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. MDMA-fueled club goers, faced with 2&nbsp;A.M. closing hours, sought refuge in the warehouse party scene that ran all night. To escape the attention of the press and the authorities, this after-hours activity quickly went underground. Within a year, however, up to 10,000 people at a time were attending the first commercially organized mass parties, called ''raves'', and a media storm ensued.<ref>Rietveld 1998:54–59</ref>

The success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the Detroit sound, and vice versa: techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with London clubs catching up later;<ref>Brewster 2006:398–443</ref> but in 1987, it was "Strings of Life" which eased London club-goers into acceptance of house, according to DJ Mark Moore.<ref>Brewster 2006:419. ''I was on a mission because most people hated house music and it was all rare groove and hip hop...I'd play Strings of Life at the Mud Club and clear the floor. Three weeks later you could see pockets of people come onto the floor, dancing to it and going crazy – and this was without ecstasy'' – Mark Moore commenting on the initially slow response to House music in 1987.</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a. ''Although it can now be heard in Detroit's leading clubs, the local area has shown a marked reluctance to get behind the music. It has been in clubs like the Powerplant (Chicago), The World (New York), The Hacienda (Manchester), Rock City (Nottingham) and Downbeat (Leeds) where the techno sound has found most support. Ironically, the only Detroit club which really championed the sound was a peripatetic party night called Visage, which unromantically shared its name with one of Britain's oldest new romantic groups.''</ref>

We got backing from Virgin Records and flew to Detroit. We met Derrick, Kevin, and Juan and went out to dinner, trying to think of a name. At the time, everything was house, house house. We thought of Motor City House Music, that kind of thing, but Derrick, Kevin, and Juan kept on using the word ''techno''. They had it in their heads without articulating it; it was already part of their language."''</ref>

===Music Institute===
In mid-1988, developments in the Detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the Music Institute (MI), located at 1315 Broadway in downtown Detroit. The venue was secured by George Baker and Alton Miller with Darryl Wynn and Derrick May participating as Friday night DJs, and Baker and Chez Damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on Saturday nights.

The club closed on November 24, 1989, with Derrick May playing "Strings of Life" along with a recording of clock tower bells.<ref name=SICKO92>Sicko 1999:92–94</ref> May explains:

{{quote|It all happened at the right time by mistake, and it didn't last because it wasn't supposed to last. Our careers took off right around the time we [the MI] had to close, and maybe it was the best thing. I think we were peaking – we were so full of energy and we didn't know who we were or [how to] realize our potential. We had no inhibitions, no standards, we just did it. That's why it came off so fresh and innovative, and that's why...we got the best of the best.<ref name=SICKO92/>}}

Though short-lived, MI was known internationally for its all-night sets, its sparse white rooms, and its juice bar stocked with "[[smart drinks]]" (the Institute never served liquor). The MI, notes Dan Sicko, along with Detroit's early techno pioneers, "helped give life to one of the city's important musical subcultures&nbsp;– one that was slowly growing into an international scene."<ref name=SICKO92/>

===Technoclub===
In 1982, [[:de:Talla 2XLC|Talla 2XLC]] had begun to use the term ''techno'' as a genre name for instrumental electronic dance music at Frankfurt's City Music record store, when he started to categorize certain tracks by artists such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], Kraftwerk, [[Heaven 17]] and Front 242 under the heading ''techno'', to sum up all technologically created dance music. His collection quickly became the basis for other DJs like [[Sven Väth]].<ref name="techno_term">{{cite book |last=Horst |first=Dirk |date=1974 |title=Synthiepop –Die gefühlvolle Kälte: Geschichten des Synthiepop |language=de |trans-title=Synthiepop – The soulful cold: Stories of Synthiepop}}</ref><ref name="techno_term_talla2xlc">{{cite web |last=Schäfer |first=Sven |url=https://www.fazemag.de/talla-2xlc-am-anfang-war-der-technoclub/ |title=Talla 2XLC – Am Anfang war der Technoclub | trans-title=Talla 2XLC – In the beginning, there was the Technoclub |publisher=Faze Magazin |date=2019-10-21 |access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> Talla 2XLC popularized the term even more in Germany when he founded the renowned and longstanding [[:de:Technoclub|Technoclub]] dance event at Frankfurt's No Name Club in 1984, which later moved to the [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]] club in 1987.<ref name="techno_term"/><ref name="techno_term_talla2xlc"/> Talla's club spot served as the hub for the regional EBM and electronic music scene, and according to [[:de:Jürgen Laarmann|Jürgen Laarmann]], of [[:de:Frontpage (Zeitschrift)|Frontpage]] magazine, it had historical merit in being the first club in Germany to play almost exclusively electronic dance music.<ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"/>

===Influence of Chicago and Detroit===
Germany's engagement with American underground dance music during the 1980s paralleled that in the UK. By 1987 a German party scene based around the Chicago sound was well established. The following year (1988) saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany as it had in England.<ref>{{youtube|id=gu78EKCS54g|title=Short excerpt from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec. 8, 1988}}.

===Growth of German scene===
In 1991 a number of party venues closed, including ''[[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]]'', and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: ''Planet'', ''[[E-Werk (Berlin)|E-Werk]]'',<ref name=BREW361>Brewster 2006:361</ref> ''[[Bunker (Berlin)|Bunker]]'', and the long-lived ''[[Tresor (club)|Tresor]]''.<ref>Henkel, O.; Wolff, K. (1996) Berlin Underground: Techno und Hiphop; Zwischen Mythos und Ausverkauf, Berlin: FAB Verlag, (pp. 81–83).</ref> It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by DJ [[Tanith (DJ)|Tanith]];<ref>Reynolds 1999:112</ref> possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by [[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]]'s paramilitary posturing.<ref>Sicko 1999:145</ref> In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into [[hardcore techno|hardcore]].<ref>Schuler, M.(1995),''Gabber + Hardcore'', (p. 123), in Anz, P.; Walder, P. (Eds) (1999 rev. edn, 1st publ. 1995, Zurich: Verlag Ricco Bilger)''Techno''. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag.</ref> DJ Tanith commented at the time that "Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore [[hippie]], hardcore punk, and now we have a very hardcore house sound."<ref name=BREW361/> This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch [[gabber]] and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to [[Underground Resistance (band)|Underground Resistance]] and Richie Hawtin's [[Plus 8 Records]]. Other influences on the development of this style were European [[Electronic Body Music]] (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Front 242]], and [[Nitzer Ebb]].<ref>Reynolds 1999:110</ref>

Changes were also taking place in Frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the Berlin party scene. It was instead very much centred around discothèques and existing arrangements with various club owners. In 1988, after the [[:de:Omen (Frankfurt)|Omen]] opened, the Frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the club's management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start. By the early 1990s [[Sven Väth]] had become perhaps the first DJ in Germany to be worshipped like a rock star. He performed centre stage with his fans facing him, and as co-owner of Omen, he is believed to have been the first techno DJ to run his own club. One of the few real alternatives then was The Bruckenkopf in [[Mainz]], underneath a Rhine bridge, a venue that offered a non-commercial alternative to Frankfurt's [[discothèque]]-based clubs. Other notable underground parties were those run by [[:de:Force Inc. Music Works|Force Inc.

By 1992 [[:de:DJ Dag|DJ Dag]] & [[:de:Torsten Fenslau|Torsten Fenslau]] were running a Sunday morning session at [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]], a plush discothèque near the [[Frankfurt airport]]. They initially played a mix of different styles including Belgian [[new beat]], [[Deep House]], Chicago House, and synthpop such as Kraftwerk and Yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the Frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged.<ref name="Sextro, M. 2008">Sextro, M. & Wick H.

In 1993-94 rave became a mainstream music phenomenon in Germany, seeing with it a return to "melody, New Age elements, insistently kitsch harmonies and timbres". This undermining of the German underground sound lead to the consolidation of a German "rave establishment," spearheaded by the party organisation Mayday, with its record label [[Low Spirit]], DJ Westbam, [[Marusha]], and a music channel called [[VIVA (TV station)|VIVA]]. At this time the German popular music charts were riddled with Low Spirit "pop-Tekno" German folk music reinterpretations of tunes such as "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" and "Tears Don't Lie", many of which became hits. At the same time, in Frankfurt, a supposed alternative was a music characterised by Simon Reynolds as "moribund, middlebrow Electro-Trance music, as represented by Frankfurt's own Sven Väth and his [[Harthouse]] label." <ref>Simon Reynolds, in an interview with former [[Mille Plateaux]] label boss Achim Szepanski, for [[Wire Magazine]].

===Tekkno versus techno===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tekknozid3.jpg|thumb|left|Flyer for a Tekknozid Tekkno rave held in December 1990.]] -->
In Germany, fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early 1990s as ''[[:de:Tekkno|Tekkno]]'' (or ''Brett'').<ref name=ROBB/> This alternative spelling, with varying numbers of ''k''s, began as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to emphasize the music's hardness, but by the mid-1990s it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from Detroit's ''techno'', deriving instead from a 1980s EBM-oriented club scene cultivated in part by DJ/musician Talla 2XLC in Frankfurt.<ref name=Sicko2010_118120>Sicko 2010:118–120</ref>

At some point tension over "who defines techno" arose between scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin. DJ Tanith has expressed that Techno as a term already existed in Germany but was to a large extent undefined. [[:de:Dimitri Hegemann|Dimitri Hegemann]] has stated that the Frankfurt definition of techno associated with Talla's Technoclub differed from that used in Berlin.<ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"/> Frankfurt's Armin Johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such DAF, [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older EBM and [[Industrial (music)|Industrial]] as handed down and outdated. The Berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as ''Techno-House.'' The move away from EBM had started in Berlin when acid house became popular, thanks to Monika Dietl's radio show on [[:de:Sender Freies Berlin|SFB 4]]. Tanith distinguished acid-based dance music from the earlier approaches, whether it be DAF or Nitzer Ebb, because the latter was aggressive, he felt that it epitomised "being against something," but of acid house he said, "it's electronic, it's fun it's nice."<ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"/> By Spring 1990, Tanith, along with [[:de:Wolfram Neugebauer|Wolle XDP]], an East-Berlin party organizer responsible for the X-tasy Dance Project, were organizing the first large scale rave events in Germany. This development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with Techno-House and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define Tanith and Wolle's [[:de:Tekknozid|Tekknozid]] parties. According to Wolle it was an "out and out rejection of disco values," instead they created a "sound storm" and encouraged a form of "dance floor socialism," where the DJ was not placed in the middle and you "lose yourself in light and sound."<ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"/>

==Developments==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:URcoverWire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]] Featured on the cover of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', November 2007]] -->
As the techno sound evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it also diverged to such an extent that a wide spectrum of stylistically distinct music was being referred to as techno. This ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as [[Moby]]<ref>Reynolds 1999:131. ''Moby's track "Go!", a work featuring a sample from the [[Twin Peaks]] opening theme, entered the top 20 of [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] in late 1991.''</ref> to the distinctly anti-commercial sentiments<ref>Reynolds 1999:219–222. ''Presenting themselves as a sort of techno [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], Underground Resistance were dedicated to 'fighting the power' not just through rhetoric but through fostering their own autonomy.''</ref> of [[Underground Resistance (band)|Underground Resistance]]. Derrick May's experimentation on works such as ''Beyond the Dance'' (1989) and ''The Beginning'' (1990) were credited with taking techno "in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact John Coltrane had on Jazz".<ref name="Sicko 1999:80">Sicko 1999:80</ref> The [[Birmingham]]-based label [[Network Records]] label was instrumental in introducing Detroit techno to British audiences.<ref>{{Citation|year=2010|contribution=Techno|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVxgs_E57_EC&pg=PA942|editor-last=Price|editor-first=Emmett George|title=Encyclopedia of African American Music|volume=3|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=942|isbn=978-0313341991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVxgs_E57_EC|access-date=July 6, 2013}}</ref> By the early 1990s, the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The growth of techno's popularity in Europe between 1988 and 1992 was largely due to the emergence of the [[rave]] scene and a thriving club culture.<ref name=SICKO95_120/>

===Exodus===
In America, apart from regional scenes in Detroit, [[New York City]], Chicago and Orlando, interest was limited. Producers from Detroit, frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood.<ref>Reynolds 1999:219</ref> This first wave of Detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of up-and-coming artists, the so-called "second wave", including Carl Craig, [[Octave One]], Jay Denham, [[Kenny Larkin]], and [[Stacey Pullen]], with [[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]]'s [[Jeff Mills]], [[Mike Banks (musician)|Mike Banks]], and [[Robert Hood]] pushing their own unique sound. A number of New York producers were also making an impression at this time, notably [[Frankie Bones]], Lenny Dee, and [[Joey Beltram]]. In the same period, close to Detroit ([[Windsor, Ontario]]), [[Richie Hawtin]], with business partner [[John Acquaviva]], launched the influential imprint [[Plus 8]] Records.<ref>Sicko 1999:121–160</ref>

Developments in American-produced techno between 1990 and 1992 fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in Europe, particularly in Germany.<ref name="Sicko 1999:161–184">Sicko 1999:161–184</ref><ref name=REYN228>Reynolds 2006:228–229</ref> In [[Berlin]], following the closure of a free party venue called [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], the club [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]] opened in 1991. The venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading Detroit producers, some of whom relocated to Berlin.<ref>Reynolds 1999:215</ref> By 1993, as interest in techno in the UK club scene started to wane, Berlin was considered the unofficial ''techno capital'' of Europe.<ref>Sicko 1999:181</ref>

Although eclipsed by Germany, [[Belgium]] was another focus of second-wave techno in this time period. The [[Ghent]]-based label [[R&S Records]] embraced harder-edged techno by "teenage prodigies" like Beltram and [[C.J. Bolland]], releasing "tough, metallic tracks...with harsh, discordant synth lines that sounded like distressed Hoovers," according to one music journalist.<ref name=SHALLCROSS>{{Cite news|periodical=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=161|date=July 1997|title=From Detroit To Deep Space|last=Shallcross|first=Mike|page=21}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, [[Sub Club]] opening in [[Glasgow]] in 1987 and [[Trade (nightclub)|Trade]] which opened its doors to [[London]]ers in 1990 were pioneering venues which helped bring techno into the country. Both clubs were praised for their late opening hours and party-focused clientele. Trade has often been referred to as the 'original all night bender'.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136783166|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWf4J6yn9zAC&q=Ian+Levine+pioneer+English+DJ+and+Producer|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Advisor.net|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=1918|title=Resident Advisor: Sub Club |publisher=tntmagazine.com|date=2018-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=dmcworld.net|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/laurence-malice-1/amp/|title=DMC World - Laurence Malice |publisher=tntmagazine.com|date=2018-03-02}}</ref>

====''A Techno Alliance''====
In 1993, the German techno label [[Tresor Records]] released the compilation album ''Tresor II: Berlin & Detroit – A Techno Alliance'',<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/release/48297 Tresor II: Berlin & Detroit – A Techno Alliance] album details at Discogs</ref> a testament to the influence of the Detroit sound upon the German techno scene and a celebration of a "mutual admiration pact" between the two cities.<ref name=REYN228/> As the mid-1990s approached, Berlin was becoming a haven for Detroit producers; [[Jeff Mills]] and [[Blake Baxter]] even resided there for a time. In the same period, with the assistance of Tresor, Underground Resistance released their X-101/X-102/X103 album series, Juan Atkins collaborated with 3MB's [[Thomas Fehlmann]] and [[Moritz Von Oswald]]<ref name=REYN228/> and Tresor-affiliated label [[Basic Channel]] had its releases [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by Detroit's National Sound Corporation, the main mastering house for the entire Detroit dance music scene. In a sense, popular electronic music had come full circle, returning to Germany, home of a primary influence on the electronic dance music of the 1980s: [[Düsseldorf]]'s Kraftwerk. Even the dance sounds of Chicago also had a German connection, as it was in [[Munich]] that [[Giorgio Moroder]] and Pete Bellotte first produced the 1970s Eurodisco synthpop sound.<ref name=ROBB/>

===Minimal techno===
{{main|Minimal techno}}
As techno continued to transmute a number of Detroit producers began to question the trajectory the music was taking. One response came in the form of so-called [[minimal techno]] (a term producer [[Daniel Bell]] found difficult to accept, finding the term ''minimalism'', in the artistic sense of the word, too "arty").<ref>Sicko 1999:199–200</ref> It is thought that [[Robert Hood]], a Detroit-based producer and one time member of UR, is largely responsible for ushering in the minimal strain of techno.<ref>Mike Banks [http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/271/ interview], The Wire, Issue #285 (November '07)</ref> Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too [[rave|"ravey"]], with increasing tempos, the emergence of [[gabber]], and related trends straying far from the social commentary and [[soul music|soul]]-infused sound of original Detroit techno. In response, Hood and others sought to emphasize a single element of the Detroit aesthetic, interpreting techno with "a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spannered.org/music/802/|title=Robert Hood interview|publisher=Overload Media/Spannered|date=February 1, 2001|access-date=December 2, 2011|last=Osselaer|first=John}}</ref> Hood explains:

{{quote|I think Dan [Bell] and I both realized that something was missing – an element...in what we both know as techno. It sounded great from a production point of standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.<ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN/>}}

===Jazz influences===
{{see also|Jazz|Jazz fusion|Musical improvisation}}
Some techno has also been influenced by or directly infused with elements of jazz.<ref>{{cite news |title=Techno Dances With Jazz |first=Mike |last=Rubin  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/arts/music-techno-dances-with-jazz.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 30, 2001 |access-date=December 2, 2011}} "Electronic producers of all stripes are now inspired by a broader jazz palette, whether as fodder for samples, as part of the search for rhythmic diversity, or as a reference point for their own artistic aspirations toward a cerebral sophistication removed from the sweat of the dance floor." The article provides, as examples, the music of [[Kirk Degiorgio]], Matthew Herbert, Spring Heel Jack, Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher), Jason Swinscoe (Cinematic Orchestra) and Innerzone Orchestra (Carl Craig with ex-Sun Ra/James Carter group members, et al.).</ref> This led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions.<ref>Sicko 1999:198</ref> [[Manchester]] (UK)-based techno act [[808 State]] helped fuel this development with tracks such as "[[Pacific State (song)|Pacific State]]"<ref>Gerald Simpson ([[A Guy Called Gerald]]) maintains that "Pacific State" was intended for a [[John Peel]] session exclusively, but 808 State's [[Graham Massey]] and Martin Price added additional elements by drawing upon Massey's collection of ''exotic jazz'' records for inspiration. This led to the inclusion of a distinctive saxophone solo. Massey recalls that: ''We were trying to do something in the vein of [[Marshall Jefferson]]'s 'Open Your Eyes'...That track was happening everywhere.'' The production was released as a white label in May 1989 and later issued on the mini-album ''[[Quadrastate]]'' at the end of July that year, just as the [[second Summer of Love]] was flowering. Massey remembers taking the white label to Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and Jon Da Silva, and notes that ''it rose through the ranks to become the last tune of the night.

Early experiments with synthesizers and jazz by artists like Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder, Weather Report, Return to Forever, Larry Heard and Lenny White's Astral Pirates also pointed them in this direction.

===Intelligent techno===
{{see also|Intelligent dance music|ambient techno}}
In 1991 UK music journalist Matthew Collin wrote that "Europe may have the scene and the energy, but it's America which supplies the ideological direction...if Belgian techno gives us riffs, German techno the noise, British techno the breakbeats, then Detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth."<ref>Brewster 2006:364</ref> By 1992 a number of European producers and labels began to associate rave culture with the corruption and commercialization of the original techno ideal.<ref>Reynolds 1999:183</ref> Following this the notion of an ''intelligent'' or Detroit inspired ''pure techno'' aesthetic began to take hold. Detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of so-called ''intelligent techno'' producers forward. Simon Reynolds suggests that this progression "involved a full-scale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity, namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology."<ref>Reynolds 1999:182</ref>

The term ''[[intelligent techno]]'' was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno <ref>Anker M., Herrington T., Young R. (1995), [http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/220/ ''New Complexity Techno''], ''The Wire'', Issue #131 (January '95)</ref> from rave-oriented styles such as [[breakbeat hardcore]], Schranz, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Gabber]]. [[Warp Records]] was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album ''[[Artificial Intelligence (compilation album)|Artificial Intelligence]]''<ref>Track listing for the Warp Records 1992 compilation [http://www.discogs.com/release/29372 ''Artificial Intelligence'']</ref> Of this time, Warp founder and managing director Steve Beckett said

{{quote|the dance scene was changing and we were hearing B-sides that weren't dance but were interesting and fitted into experimental, progressive rock, so we decided to make the compilation ''Artificial Intelligence'', which became a milestone... it felt like we were leading the market rather than it leading us, the music was aimed at home listening rather than clubs and dance floors: people coming home, off their nuts and having the most interesting part of the night listening to totally tripped out music. The sound fed the scene.<ref>Birke S. (2007), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/label-profile/label-profile-warp-records-768021.html "Label Profile: Warp Records"], The Independent (UK), Music Magazine (supplement), newspaper article published February 11, 2007</ref>}}

Warp had originally marketed ''Artificial Intelligence'' using the description ''electronic listening music'' but this was quickly replaced by ''intelligent techno''. In the same period (1992–93) other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno, [[ambient techno]], and [[electronica]],<ref>"Of all the terms devised for contemporary non-academic electronic music (the sense intended here), 'electronica' is one of the most loaded and controversial. While on the one hand it does seem the most convenient catch-all phrase, under any sort of scrutiny it begins to implode. In its original 1992–93 sense it was largely coterminous with the more explicitly elitist 'intelligent techno', a term used to establish distance from and imply distaste for, all other more dancefloor-oriented types of techno, ignoring the fact that many of its practitioners such as Richard James ([[Aphex Twin]]) were as adept at brutal dancefloor tracks as what its detractors present as self-indulgent ambient 'noodling'". Blake, Andrew, ''Living Through Pop'', Routledge, 1999. p 155.</ref> but all referred to an emerging form of ''post-rave'' dance music for the "sedentary and stay at home".<ref>Reynolds 1999:181</ref> Following the commercial success of the compilation in the United States, ''[[Intelligent Dance Music]]'' eventually became the name most commonly used for much of the experimental dance music emerging during the mid-to-late 1990s.

Although it is primarily Warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of IDM and electronica, in the early 1990s there were many notable labels associated with the initial ''intelligence'' trend that received little, if any, wider attention. Amongst others they include: [[Black Dog Productions]] (1989), Carl Craig's Planet E (1991), Kirk Degiorgio's Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1991), In 1993, a number of new "intelligent techno"/"electronica" record labels emerged, including New Electronica, [[Mille Plateaux (record label)|Mille Plateaux]], 100% Pure (1993) and Ferox Records (1993).

[[File:Algorythm duracell enzo pk zinix zbomb sound6tems.jpg|thumb|right|A sound system at Czechtek 2004]]
In the early 1990s a post-rave, [[DIY ethic|DIY]], [[free party]] scene had established itself in the UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban [[Squatting|squat]] scenes and politically inspired [[new age travellers]]. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike.<ref>Reynolds 1999:163. ''The traveling lifestyle began in the early seventies, as convoys of hippies spent the summer wandering from site to site on the free festival circuit. Gradually, these proto-[[crusty]] remnants of the original [[counterculture]] built up a neomedieval [[economy]] based on crafts, alternative medicine, and entertainment...In the mid-eighties, as [[squatting]] became a less viable option and the government mounted a clampdown on welfare claimants, many urban crusties tired of the squalor of settled life and took to the roving lifestyle.''</ref> Prominent among the [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in [[Brighton]], Smokescreen in [[Sheffield]], [[The DiY Sound System|DiY]] in [[Nottingham]], Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's [[Spiral Tribe]]. The high point of this free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] for 5 days of partying.<ref name=STJOHN>St. John 2001:100–101</ref>

This one event was largely responsible for the introduction in 1994 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940033_en_6.htm#mdiv63 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land – Powers in relation to raves |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |access-date=January 17, 2006| year=1994}}</ref> effectively leaving the British [[free party]] scene for dead. Following this many of the traveller artists moved away from Britain to Europe, the US, [[Goa]] in [[India]], [[Koh Phangan]] in [[Thailand]] and [[Australia|Australia's]] East Coast.<ref name=STJOHN/> In the rest of Europe, due in some part to the inspiration of traveling sound systems from the UK,<ref name=STJOHN/> rave enjoyed a prolonged existence as it continued to expand across the [[continental Europe|continent]].<ref name="Sicko 1999:161–184"/>

Spiral Tribe, Bedlam and other English sound systems took their cooperative techno ideas to Europe, particularly [[Eastern Europe]] where it was cheaper to live, and audiences were quick to appropriate the free party ideology. It was European [[Teknival]] free parties, such as the annual [[Czechtek]] event in the Czech Republic that gave rise to several French, German and Dutch sound systems. Many of these groups found audiences easily and were often centered around squats in cities such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Berlin]].<ref name=STJOHN/>

===Divergence===
{{see also|List of electronic music genres}}
By 1994 there were a number of techno producers in the UK and Europe building on the Detroit sound, but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention. Some drew upon the Detroit techno aesthetic, while others fused components of preceding dance music forms. This led to the appearance (in the UK initially) of inventive new music that sounded far-removed from techno. For instance [[oldschool jungle|jungle]] ([[drum and bass]]) demonstrated influences ranging from [[hip-hop]], soul, and [[reggae]] to techno and house.

With an increasing diversification (and commercialization) of dance music, the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early [[rave]] scene diminished, each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music (or in certain cases, non-dance music) should evolve. Some examples not already mentioned are [[trance music|trance]], [[industrial techno]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[acid techno]], and [[happy hardcore]]. Less well-known styles related to techno or its subgenres include the primarily Sheffield (UK)-based bleep techno, a regional variant that had some success between 1989 and 1991. <!-- and a scene that was responsible for putting [[Warp (record label)|Warp Records]] on the map (largely as a result of its fifth release, [[LFO (British band)|LFO]]'s self-titled 12″).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} -->

According to ''[[Muzik]]'' magazine, by 1995 the UK techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling. The music had become "too hard, too fast, too male, too drug-oriented, too anally retentive." Despite this, weekly night at clubs such as Final Frontier (London), House of God ([[Birmingham sound|Birmingham]]), Pure (Edinburgh, whose resident DJ Twitch later founded the more eclectic [[Optimo]]), and Bugged Out (Manchester) were still popular. With techno reaching a state of "creative palsy," and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle, in 1995 the future of the UK techno scene looked uncertain as the market for "pure techno" waned. ''Muzik'' described the sound of UK techno at this time as "dutiful grovelling at the altar of American techno with a total unwillingness to compromise." <ref>Bush, Calvin, Techno - The Final Frontier?, ''Muzik'', Issue No.4, September 1995, p.48-50</ref>

By the end of the 1990s, a number of post-techno <ref>Cox 2004:414. ''Any form of electronica genealogically related to Techno but departing from it in one way or another.''</ref> underground styles had emerged, including [[ghettotech]] (a style that combines some of the aesthetics of techno with [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[house music]]), [[nortec]], [[glitch (music)|glitch]], [[digital hardcore]], the so-called ''no-beat techno'',<ref>Loubet E.& Couroux M., Laptop Performers, Compact Disc Designers, and No-Beat Techno Artists in Japan: Music from Nowhere,  ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 4. (Winter, 2000), pp. 19–32.</ref> and [[electroclash]].<ref name="spectator_clash"/>

In attempting to sum up the changes since the heyday of Detroit techno, Derrick May has since revised his famous quote in stating that "Kraftwerk got off on the third floor and now George Clinton's got [[Napalm Death]] in there with him. The elevator's stalled between the pharmacy and the athletic wear store."<ref name=FantaziaMay />

While techno and its derivatives only occasionally produce commercially successful mainstream acts—[[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] and [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] being two better-known examples—the genre has significantly affected many other areas of music. In an effort to appear relevant, many established artists, for example [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[U2]], have dabbled with dance music, yet such endeavors have rarely evidenced a genuine understanding or appreciation of techno's origins with the former proclaiming in January 1996 that "Techno=Death".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music and Technoculture|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musictechnocultu00lysl/page/185 185–186]|first1=Andrew|last1=Ross|first2=René|last2=Lysloff|first3=Leslie|last3=Gay|isbn=0-8195-6514-8|year=2003|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/musictechnocultu00lysl/page/185}}</ref><ref>Chaplin, Julia & Michel, Sia.

The R&B artist, [[Missy Elliott]], exposed the popular music audience to the Detroit techno sound when she featured material from Cybotron's ''Clear'' on her 2006 release "Lose Control"; this resulted in [[Juan Atkins]]' receiving a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for his writing credit. Elliott's 2001 album ''[[Miss E... So Addictive]]'' also clearly demonstrated the influence of techno inspired club culture.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Sal |last=Cinquemani |title=Miss E...So Addictive |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=64 |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |access-date=December 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102040143/http://slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=64 |archive-date=January 2, 2010 }}</ref>

In recent years, the publication of relatively accurate histories by authors Simon Reynolds (''Generation Ecstasy'', also known as ''Energy Flash'') and Dan Sicko (''Techno Rebels''), plus mainstream press coverage of the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], have helped to diffuse the genre's more dubious mythology.<ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Gorell | title=Permanent record: Jeff Mills talks Detroit techno and the exhibit that hopes to explain it. | url =http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4496 | work =Metro Times | access-date = August 11, 2007}}</ref> Even the Detroit-based company [[Ford Motors]] eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that "this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno." With a marketing campaign targeting under-35s, Ford used "Detroit Techno" as a print ad slogan and chose Model 500's "No UFO's" to underpin its November 2000 [[MTV]] television advertisement for the [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Ford Unveils New Limited Street Edition Focus |publisher=Ford Motors |date=October 6, 2000 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6225 |access-date=January 10, 2009 |quote="Detroit Techno is a music style that is recognized by young people around the world.

==Antecedents==
===Early use of the term 'Techno'===
In 1977, [[Steve Fairnie]] and [[Bev Sage]] formed an electronica band called the [[Techno Twins]] in London, England. When Kraftwerk first toured Japan, their music was described as "technopop" by the Japanese press.<ref>79年8月の「ロックマガジン」の増刊号の「MODERN MUSIC」</ref> The Japanese band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] used the word 'techno' in a number of their works such as the song "Technopolis" (1979), the album ''Technodelic'' (1981), and a rare [[flexi disc]] EP, "The Spirit of Techno" (1983). When [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] toured the United States in 1980, they described their own music as technopop, and were written up in [[Rolling Stone Magazine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/yellow-magic-orchestra-188812/|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra|first1=James|last1=Henke|first2=James|last2=Henke|date=June 12, 1980|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Around 1980, the members of YMO added synthesizer backing tracks to idol songs such as [[Ikue Sakakibara]]'s "Robot", and these songs were classified as 'techno kayou' or 'bubblegum techno.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%83%86%E3%82%AF%E3%83%8E%E6%AD%8C%E8%AC%A1&oldid=73318803|title=テクノ歌謡|date=July 2, 2019|access-date=November 22, 2019|via=Wikipedia}}</ref> In 1985, [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] reviewed the Canadian band [[Skinny Puppy]]'s album, and described the genre as ''techno dance''.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1985/BB-1985-10-05-OCR-Page-0070.pdf</ref> Juan Atkins himself said "In fact, there were a lot of electronic musicians around when Cybotron started, and I think maybe half of them referred to their music as 'techno.' However, the public really wasn't ready for it until about '85 or '86. It just so happened that Detroit was there when people really got into it." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/1994/07/techno/|title=The Roots of Techno|first=Dan|last=Sicko|date=July 1, 1994|access-date=November 22, 2019|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>

===Proto-techno===
The popularity of [[Euro disco]] and [[Italo disco]]—referred to as ''progressive'' in Detroit—and [[new romantic]] [[synthpop]] in the Detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged<ref>Sicko 1999:45–49</ref> has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the Detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genre's development.<ref name=KODWO100/><ref>Brewster 2006:343–346</ref><ref name="Reynolds 1999:190">Reynolds 1999:190</ref> The search for a mythical "first techno record" leads such commentators to consider music from long before the 1988 naming of the genre. Aside from the artists whose music was popular in the Detroit high school scene ("progressive" disco acts such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Alexander Robotnick]], and [[Claudio Simonetti]] and synthpop artists such as [[Visage (band)|Visage]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Human League]], and [[Heaven 17]]), they point to examples such as "Sharevari" (1981) by A Number of Names,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillen|first=Brendan|date=November 21, 2001|access-date=January 10, 2009|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2691|title=Name that number: The history of Detroit's first techno record|journal=Metro Times Detroit}}</ref> danceable selections from Kraftwerk (1977–83), the earliest compositions by Cybotron (1981), Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder's "[[I Feel Love]]" (1977), Moroder's "From Here to Eternity" (1977), and [[Manuel Göttsching]]'s "proto-techno masterpiece"<ref name="Reynolds 1999:190"/> ''[[E2-E4]]'' (1981). Another example is a record entitled ''Love in C minor'', released in 1976 by Parisian Euro disco producer [[Jean-Marc Cerrone]]; cited as the first so called "conceptual disco" production and the record from which house, techno, and other underground dance music styles flowed.<ref>Sicko 1999:48</ref> Yet another example is Yellow Magic Orchestra's work which has been described as "proto-techno"<ref name="keyboard_28">{{cite book|title=Keyboard, Volume 19, Issues 7-12|publisher=GPI Publications|year=1993|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ4JAQAAMAAJ|access-date=June 4, 2011}}</ref><ref name="kpcc_takahashi">{{cite web|title=Peter Stenshoel's Album of the Week: What, Me Worry? by Yukihiro Takahashi|publisher=[[KPCC]]|date=May 18, 2011|author=Peter Stenshoel|url=https://www.scpr.org/blogs/offramp/2011/05/18/2970/peter-stenshoels-album-week-what-me-worry-yukihiro/|access-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref>

Around 1983, Sheffield band [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] began including funk and electronic dance music elements into their sound, and in later years, would come to be described as techno. [[Nitzer Ebb]] was an Essex band formed in 1982, which also showed funk and electronic dance music influence on their sound around this time. The Danish band [[Laid Back]] released "[[White Horse (Laid Back song)|White Horse]]" in 1983 with a similar funky electronica sound.

===Prehistory===
Certain electro-[[disco]] and European synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machine-generated dance rhythms, but such comparisons are not without contention. Efforts to regress further into the past, in search of earlier antecedents, entails a further regression, to the sequenced electronic music of [[Raymond Scott]], whose "The Rhythm Modulator," "The Bass-Line Generator," and "IBM Probe" are considered early examples of techno-like music. In a review of Scott's [[Manhattan Research Inc. (Raymond Scott album)|Manhattan Research Inc.]] compilation album the [[England|English]] newspaper [[The Independent]] suggested that "Scott's importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of [[electronic music]], which laid the foundation for all electro-pop from disco to techno."<ref>{{cite news|title=Raymond Scott's Manhattan Research |date=February 21, 2006 |url=http://raymondscott.com/mripr.html |access-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813132527/http://raymondscott.com/mripr.html |archive-date=August 13, 2007 }} Extensive collection of review excerpts hosted on the Raymond Scott website.</ref> In 2008, a tape from the mid-to-late 1960s by the original composer of the [[Doctor Who]] theme [[Delia Derbyshire]], was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary electronic dance music. Commenting on the tape, [[Paul Hartnoll]], of the dance group [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], described the example as "quite amazing," noting that it sounded not unlike something that "could be coming out next week on [[Warp Records]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7512072.stm|title=Lost tapes of the Dr Who composer|work=BBC News|last=Wrench|first=Nigel|access-date=January 10, 2009 | date=July 18, 2008}}</ref>

==Music production practice==
===Stylistic considerations===
In general, techno is very [[disc jockey|DJ]]-friendly, being mainly [[instrumental]] (commercial varieties being an exception) and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous [[DJ mix|DJ set]], wherein the DJ progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized [[segue]] or "mix."<ref>Butler 2006:12–13,94</ref> Much of the [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] in techno emphasizes the role of [[rhythm]] over other musical parameters, but the design of [[synthesizer|synthetic]] [[timbre]]s, and the creative use of [[music technology|music production technology]] in general, are important aspects of the overall [[aesthetics of music|aesthetic]] practice.

Unlike other forms of electronic dance music that tend to be produced with [[Keyboard instrument|synthesizer keyboards]], techno does not always strictly adhere to the [[harmony|harmonic practice]] of [[Classical music|Western music]] and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone.<ref>Fikentscher, K. (1991), ''The Decline of Functional Harmony in Contemporary Dance Music'', Paper presented at the 6th International Conference On Popular Music Studies, Berlin, Germany, July 15–20, 1991.</ref> Thus techno inherits from the modernist tradition of the so-called [[Klangfarbenmelodie]], or timbral serialism.{{Dubious|date=January 2019}} The use of [[motif (music)|motivic development]] (though relatively limited) and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles, for example [[Eurodance|euro-trance]], where the template is often an [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA song structure]].<ref>Pope, R. (2011), Hooked on an Affect: Detroit Techno and Dystopian Digital Culture, ''Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture'' 2 (1): p. 38</ref>

The main drum part is almost universally in [[common time]] (4/4); meaning 4 [[quarter note]] [[pulse (music)|pulses]] per bar.<ref>Butler 2006:8</ref> In its simplest form, [[time]] is marked with kicks ([[bass drum]] beats) on each quarter-note pulse, a [[snare drum|snare]] or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar, with an open [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] sound every second eighth note. This is essentially a [[disco]] (or even [[polka]]) drum pattern and is common throughout [[house music|house]] and [[trance music]] as well. The [[tempo]] tends to vary between approximately 120 [[beats per minute|bpm]] (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.

Some of the [[drum machine|drum programming]] employed in the original Detroit-based techno made use of [[syncopation]] and [[polyrhythm]], yet in many cases the basic disco-type pattern was used as a foundation, with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other [[drum machine]] voices. This syncopated-feel ([[funk]]iness) distinguishes the Detroit strain of techno from other variants. It is a feature that many DJs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno, the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation. Derrick May has summed up the sound as 'Hi-tech Tribalism': something "very spiritual, very bass oriented, and very drum oriented, very percussive. The original techno music was very hi-tech with a very percussive feel... it was extremely, extremely Tribal. It feels like you're in some sort of hi-tech village."<ref name=LUNAR/>

===Compositional techniques===
[[File:producerschair.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a professional production environment]]
There are many ways to create techno, but the majority will depend upon the use of loop-based [[Music sequencer|step sequencing]] as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or ''[[record producer|producers]]'', rather than employing traditional [[Musical composition|compositional techniques]], may work in an [[Musical improvisation|improvisatory]] fashion,<ref>Butler 2006:208–209,214</ref> often treating the electronic [[music studio]] as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally [[Synchronization|synchronized]] using a hardware- or computer-based [[MIDI sequencer]], enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to [[overdubbing|overdub]] successive layers of material while continuously looping a single [[bar (music)|measure]] or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] arrangement has been produced.<ref>Butler 2006:94</ref>

Once a single loop-based arrangement has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, and what the final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a [[mixing console|mixer]], sequencer, effects, [[dynamic range compression|dynamic processing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], and [[audio filter|filtering]] while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based [[digital audio workstation]]s. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] of one variety or another, frequency [[audio filter|filtering]] being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as Twerk and [[Autechre]], where aspects of [[algorithmic composition]] are employed in the generation of material.

===Retro technology===
[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Roland TR-808]] was, according to [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], the preferred drum machine during the early years of techno.<ref name="MUZIK01">[[System 7 (band)|System 7]] interview with Mark Roland in: ''Muzik'', Issue No.4, September 1995, p.97</ref>]]
Instruments used by the original techno producers based in Detroit, many of which are now highly sought after on the retro music technology market, include classic drum machines like the Roland [[TR-808]] and [[TR-909]], devices such as the Roland [[TB-303]] bass line generator, and synthesizers such as the [[Roland SH-101]], Kawai KC10, [[Yamaha DX7]], and Yamaha DX100 (as heard on Derrick May's seminal 1987 techno release ''Nude Photo'').<ref name="Sicko 1999:80"/> Much of the early music sequencing was executed via [[MIDI]] (but neither the TR-808 nor the TB-303 had MIDI, only [[DIN sync]]) using hardware sequencers such as the Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the limited amount of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an [[Akai S900]].<ref>Keyboard Magazine Vol. 21, No.7 (issue #231), July 1995, ''12 Who Count: Juan Atkins''.</ref>

The TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines have since achieved legendary status, a fact that is now reflected in the prices sought for used devices. During the 1980s, the 808 became the staple beat machine in [[Hip hop]] production while the 909 found its home in [[House music]] and techno. It was "the pioneers of Detroit techno [who] were making the 909 the rhythmic basis of their sound, and setting the stage for the rise of Roland's vintage Rhythm Composer." In November 1995 the UK music technology magazine ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' noted:<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/nov95/rolandtr909.html 909 LIVES!]: Overview of the Roland TR-909 drum machine published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in November 1995.</ref>

{{quote|There can be few hi-tech instruments which still command a second-hand price only slightly lower than their original selling price 10 years after their launch. Roland's now near-legendary TR-909 is such an example—released in 1984 with a retail price of £999, they now fetch up to £900 on the second-hand market! The irony of the situation is that barely a year after its launch, the 909 was being 'chopped out' by hi-tech dealers for around £375, to make way for the then-new TR-707 and TR-727. Prices hit a new low around 1988, when you could often pick up a second-user 909 for under £200—and occasionally even under £100. Musicians all over the country are now garrotting themselves with MIDI leads as they remember that 909 they sneered at for £100—or worse, the one they sold for £50 (did you ever hear the one about the guy who gave away his TB-303 Bassline—now worth anything up to £900 from true loony collectors—because he couldn't sell it?)}}

<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Reason4 screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reason (software)|Reason]]: a popular software-based music production environment]] -->

By May 1996, ''Sound on Sound'' was reporting that the popularity of the 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as "the dance floor drum machine to use." This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. ''Sound on Sound'' reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800.<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/rolandtr808.html 808 Statement]: Overview of the Roland TR-808 drum machine published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in May 1997.</ref> Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on [[eBay]]. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, or whatever you want to call it. There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever."<ref name="MUZIK01" />

====Emulation====
In the latter half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the ''[[ReBirth RB-338]]'', produced by the Swedish company [[Propellerhead]] and originally released in May 1997.<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/aug97/rebirthaug97.html BORN WIBBLY] Steinberg/Propellerheads Rebirth RB-338 v2.0 Techno Microcomposer Software For Mac & PC. Overview of the original ReBirth RB-338 published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in August 1997</ref> Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A ''Sound on Sound'' review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called "the ultimate techno software package" and mentions that it was "a considerable software success story of 1997".<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov98/articles/rebirth.htm THE COOL OF REBIRTH]

Overview of the ReBirth RB-338 V2 published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in November 1998</ref> In America ''Keyboard Magazine'' asserted that ReBirth had "opened up a whole new [[paradigm]]: modeled analog synthesizer tones, percussion synthesis, pattern-based sequencing, all integrated in one piece of software".<ref>Jim Aikin, Keyboard Magazine, reprinted in Software Synthesizers: The Definitive Guide to Virtual Musical Instruments. Backbeat Books, 2003.</ref> Despite the success of ReBirth RB-338, it was officially taken out of production in September 2005. Propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the "ReBirth Museum". The site also features extensive information about the software's history and development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/|title=ReBirth: virtual synthesizer and drum machine iPad app - Propellerhead|website=Rebirthmuseum.com}}</ref>

In March 2001, with the release of [[Reason (software)|Reason]] V1, Propellerhead upped the ante in providing a £300 software-based electronic music studio, comprising a 14-input automated digital mixer, 99-note polyphonic 'analogue' synth, classic Roland-style drum machine, sample-playback unit, analogue-style step sequencer, loop player, multitrack sequencer, eight effects processors, and over 500&nbsp;MB of synthesizer patches and samples. With this release Propellerhead were credited with "creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the [[zeitgeist]], and may just be the one that many [were] waiting for."<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar01/articles/propellorhead.asp REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL] Propellerhead Software Reason Virtual Music Studio.

===Technological advances===
As computer technology became more accessible and [[music software]] advanced, interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional [[performance|musical performance]] practices:<ref>Emmerson, S. (2007), ''Living Electronic Music'', Ashgate, Adlershot, pp. 111–113.</ref> for instance, [[laptop computer|laptop]] performance (''laptronica'')<ref>Emmerson, S.

London: Routledge: 67–79.</ref>
By the mid 2000s a number of software-based virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's [[Reason (software)|Reason]] and [[Ableton Live]] finding popular appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/idmas/winners2008.php |title=23rd Annual International Dance Music Awards Nominees & Winners |access-date=January 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501041708/http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/idmas/winners2008.php |archive-date=May 1, 2008 }} Best Audio Editing Software of the Year – 1st Ableton Live, 4th Reason. Best Audio DJ Software of the Year – Ableton Live.</ref> These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in [[microprocessor]] technology, can create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation,<ref>Chadabe, J., Electronic music and life, ''Organised Sound'', 9(1): 3–6, 2004 Cambridge University Press, United Kingdom.</ref> and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts.
