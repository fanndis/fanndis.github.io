In September 2007, Jung sparked a debate by his controversial assertion to shoot down jetliners in the case of a terrorist attack on Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/20/germany.kateconnolly|title=German defence minister ready to shoot down hijacked planes|date=September 20, 2007|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Several politicians of the opposition parties as well as politicians from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], especially  [[Reinhard Bütikofer]] and [[Kurt Beck]], described his move as "unconstitutional" and called for his resignation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/terrorabwehr-spd-und-gruene-empoert-ueber-jungs-abschuss-plaene-a-506081.html|title=Terrorabwehr: SPD und Grüne empört über Jungs Abschuss-Pläne - DER SPIEGEL - Politik|first=DER|last=SPIEGEL|website=www.spiegel.de}}</ref>

In early 2008, Jung rejected a sharply worded letter from his United States counterpart, [[Robert M.
