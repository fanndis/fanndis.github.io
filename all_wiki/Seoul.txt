Seoul was the capital of various Korean states, including [[Baekje]], [[Joseon]], the [[Korean Empire]], [[Goryeo]] (as a secondary capital), and presently South Korea. Strategically located along the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], Seoul's history stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BC by the people of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. The city was later designated the capital of [[Korea]] under the [[Joseon]] [[dynasty]]. Seoul is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape, with [[Bukhansan|Bukhan Mountain]] located on the northern edge of the city. As with its long history, the [[Seoul Capital Area]] contains five [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]: [[Changdeokgung|Changdeok Palace]], [[Hwaseong Fortress]], [[Jongmyo|Jongmyo Shrine]], [[Namhansanseong]] and the [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/kr|title=Lists: Republic of Korea|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-date=25 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225050657/http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/kr|url-status=live}}</ref> Seoul received over 10&nbsp;million international visitors in 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stat.seoul.go.kr/jsp2/Octagon/jsp/WWS7/WWSDS7100.jsp?stc_cd=409&lang=eng|script-title=ko:서울 통계정보 시스템|website=stat.seoul.go.kr|access-date=30 January 2013|archive-date=27 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927051259/http://stat.seoul.go.kr/jsp2/Octagon/jsp/WWS7/WWSDS7100.jsp?stc_cd=409&lang=eng|url-status=dead}}</ref> making it the world's [[Tourism#MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index|9th most visited city]] and [[Tourism#MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index|4th largest earner in tourism]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mastercard_GDCI_2014_Letter_Final_70814.pdf |title=MasterCard-Global Destination Cities index |access-date=22 October 2014 |archive-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916112828/https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mastercard_GDCI_2014_Letter_Final_70814.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city has been known in the past by the names [[Wiryeseong]] ({{Korean|위례성|慰禮城}}, during the [[Baekje]] era), [[History of Seoul|Hanyang]] ({{Korean|labels=no |한양|漢陽}}, during the [[Goryeo]] era), Hanseong ({{Korean|labels=no |한성|漢城}}, during the [[Joseon]] era), and [[Keijō]] ({{lang|ja|京城}}) or Gyeongseong ({{Korean|labels=no|경성}}) during the period of annexation to Japan.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Yu|first1=Woo-ik|last2=Lee|first2=Chan|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul|title=Seoul|date=6 November 2019|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=4 July 2020|quote=The city was popularly called Seoul in Korean during both the [[Chosŏn]] (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910) and the period of Japanese rule (1910–45), although the official names in those periods were Hansŏng (Hanseong) and [[Kyŏngsŏng]] (Gyeongseong), respectively.|archive-date=9 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609191034/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul|url-status=live}}</ref>

During [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan's annexation of Korea]], ''Hanseong'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|漢城}}) was renamed {{Nihongo||京城|Keijō}} by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the [[hanja]] '{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|漢}}}}' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word ''Han'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|{{linktext|한}}}}) meaning "great"), which also refers to Han people or the [[Han dynasty]] in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for "China".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDZYDwAAQBAJ&q=Hanseong+was+renamed+to+Keij%C5%8D&pg=PT136|title=Eclipsed Cinema: The Film Culture of Colonial Korea|date=22 March 2017|isbn=9781474421829|last1=Kim|first1=Dong Hoon}}</ref>

After [[World War II]] and [[Liberation of Korea|Korea's liberation]], the city took its present name, which originated from the [[Korean language|Korean]] word meaning "capital city", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, ''Seorabeol'' ({{Korean|서라벌|徐羅伐}}), which originally referred to [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Silla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.holidaysguide.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-221948-seoul_history-i|title=Yahoo holiday travel guide|publisher=Uk.holidaysguide.yahoo.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107185557/http://uk.holidaysguide.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-221948-seoul_history-i|archive-date=January 7, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name ''Geumseong'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|金城}}, literally "Gold Castle or City" or "Metal Castle or City"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name ''Seorabeol'' had the same meaning as ''Geumseong''.

Unlike most place names in Korea, "Seoul" has no corresponding [[hanja]] ([[Chinese characters]] used in the [[Korean language]]). On January 18, 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic ''Hancheng'' ({{zh|t=漢城|s=汉城|p=Hànchéng}}) to ''Shou'er'' ({{zh|links=no |s=首尔|t=首爾|p=Shǒu'ěr}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=022&aid=0000126138 |script-title=ko:서울특별시표기 ''首爾''로...중국, 곧 정식 사용키로 :: 네이버 뉴스 |language=ko |publisher=News.naver.com |date=2005-10-23 |access-date=2012-02-10 |archive-date=25 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042516/http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=022&aid=0000126138 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/20/content_410881.htm |title='Seoul' morphs into Chinese 'Shouer' |work=China Daily |date=2005-01-20 |access-date=2012-02-10 |archive-date=13 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613003500/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/20/content_410881.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://goodcharacters.com/newsletters/summer2006-seoul-korea.html|title=Chinese Naming Crisis Danger Opportunity Summer 2006 – Good Characters|last=Characters|first=Good|website=goodcharacters.com|access-date=2018-11-18|archive-date=30 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930195048/http://goodcharacters.com/newsletters/summer2006-seoul-korea.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Seoul|Timeline of Seoul}}

Settlement of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul/24023/Cultural-life#toc24024|title=Seoul|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100436/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul/24023/Cultural-life#toc24024|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of [[Baekje]] (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.<ref name="Britannica"/> There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. [[Pungnaptoseong]], an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.<ref name="toseong">{{cite web|url=http://m.visitseoul.net/en/m/article/article.do?_method=view&m&p=02&menu=0004003002017&art_id=535&searchLoca&searchTheme=0002000001003&flag&searchType|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140222005911/http://m.visitseoul.net/en/m/article/article.do?_method=view&m&p=02&menu=0004003002017&art_id=535&searchLoca&searchTheme=0002000001003&flag&searchType|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-02-22|title=Pungnap-toseong (Earthen Ramparts)|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|access-date=2014-02-07}}</ref> As the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to [[Goguryeo]] in the 5th century, and from Goguryeo to [[Silla]] in the 6th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjgsBgAAQBAJ&q=three+kingdoms+korea|title=History Of Korea|date=12 November 2012|isbn=9781136166983|author1=Tennant|archive-date=10 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010214851/https://books.google.com/books?id=LjgsBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=three+kingdoms+korea#v=onepage|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 11th century [[Goryeo]], which succeeded [[Unified Silla]], built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the "Southern Capital". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.<ref name="Britannica"/> When [[Joseon]] replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The [[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbok Palace]], built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, [[Changdeokgung]], constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.<ref name="Britannica"/> After [[Joseon]] changed her name to the [[Korean Empire]] in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.

Originally, the city was entirely surrounded by [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|a massive circular stone wall]] to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain ({{Korean|북악산|北岳山}}), north of the downtown area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1061818|title=Bugaksan Mountain|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062015/http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1061818|url-status=live}}</ref>), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as [[Namdaemun]]) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as [[Dongdaemun]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5781/|title=Seoul City Wall|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-date=31 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231012607/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5781|url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]], the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the [[Bosingak]] [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264135|title=Bosingak Belfry|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062012/http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264135|url-status=live}}</ref> In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize.

Much of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like [[France]] and the [[United States]]. For example, the [[Seoul Electric Company]], Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/koreaundersiege10000chun|url-access=registration|title=Korea under Siege, 1876–1945 : Capital Formation and Economic Transformation|author=Young-Iob Chung|page=[https://archive.org/details/koreaundersiege10000chun/page/70 70]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780198039662}}</ref> In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, "The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained.

After the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty|annexation treaty]] in 1910, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] annexed Korea and renamed the city [[Gyeongseong]] ("Kyongsong" in Korean and "Keijo" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of [[World War II]].<ref name="Britannica"/>

In 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a [[Special cities of South Korea|special city]] in 1949.<ref name="Britannica"/>

During the [[Korean War]], Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces several times, leaving the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to [[Busan]].<ref name="Britannica"/> One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5&nbsp;million by 1955.<ref name="hamnett">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GSpAgAAQBAJ|title=Planning Asian Cities: Risks and Resilience|page=159|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|editor=Stephen Hamnett, Dean Forbes|isbn=9781136639272|access-date=9 November 2015|archive-date=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042515/https://books.google.com/books?id=8GSpAgAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As [[Miracle on the Han River|South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly]] from the 1960s, [[urbanization]] also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.<ref name="hamnett"/> From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spp.seoul.go.kr/cms/board/Download.jsp?fileId=IUAjJDMyMTY1LS0kJA==|title=Urban Planning of Seoul|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|format=PDF|year=2009|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-date=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042517/http://spp.seoul.go.kr/cms/board/Download.jsp?fileId=IUAjJDMyMTY1LS0kJA==|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seoul is in the northwest of [[South Korea]]. Seoul proper comprises {{convert|605.25|km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},<ref name="seoul1">{{cite web|url=http://stat.seoul.go.kr/Seoul_System5.jsp?stc_cd=412|title=Seoul Statistics (Land Area)|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|access-date=24 March 2010|archive-date=19 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019175850/http://stat.seoul.go.kr/Seoul_System5.jsp?stc_cd=412|url-status=live}}</ref> with a radius of approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. The Han River and its surrounding area played an important role in Korean history. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] strove to take control of this land, where the river was used as a trade route to China (via the [[Yellow Sea]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.visitseoul.net/tours/Brief-History-of-Hangang-River_/4624|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031211814/http://english.visitseoul.net/tours/Brief-History-of-Hangang-River_/4624|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-10-31|title=Brief History of Hangang (River)|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|access-date=2014-02-07}}</ref> The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its [[estuary]] is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. Historically, the city was during the [[Joseon]] dynasty bounded by the [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Seoul Fortress Wall]], which stretched between the four main mountains in central Seoul: [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]], [[Naksan]], [[Bukhansan]] and [[Inwangsan]]. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas. Due to its geography and to economic development policies, Seoul is a very polycentric city. The area that was the old capital in the Joseon dynasty, and mostly comprises [[Jongno District]] and [[Jung District, Seoul|Jung District]], constitutes the historical and political center of the city. However, for example, the city's financial capital is widely considered to be in [[Yeouido]], while its economic capital is [[Gangnam District]].

The traditional heart of Seoul is the old [[Joseon]] dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. [[Cheonggyecheon]], a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=85750|title=Seoul's Cheonggyecheon Stream symbolizes Korea's past, present and tomorrow|publisher=Korea.net|access-date=2014-02-12|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142757/http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=85750|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Jongno]] street, meaning "Bell Street", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8Xj7pHu1jEC|title=The Emerging Asian City: Concomitant Urbanities and Urbanisms|editor=Vinayak Bharne|page=59|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415525978|access-date=9 November 2015|archive-date=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042515/https://books.google.com/books?id=M8Xj7pHu1jEC|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/06/137_68203.html|title=Jongno walk|date=2010-06-24|newspaper=The Korea Times|author=Andrei Lankov|access-date=2014-02-12|archive-date=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001120702/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/06/137_68203.html|url-status=live}}</ref> on which one can find [[Bosingak]], a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is [[Bukhan Mountain]], and to the south is the smaller [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]]. Further south are the old suburbs, [[Yongsan District]] and [[Mapo District]]. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of [[Gangnam District]], [[Seocho District]] and surrounding neighborhoods.

===Historical architecture===
Seoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In [[Amsa-dong|Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site]], [[Gangdong District]], neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264111 |title=Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]] |access-date=2014-02-12 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222135311/http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264111 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Urban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The [[Joseon]] dynasty built the "Five Grand Palaces" in Seoul – [[Changdeokgung]], [[Changgyeonggung]], [[Deoksugung]], [[Gyeongbokgung]] and [[Gyeonghuigung]] – all of which are located in [[Jongno District|Jongno]] and [[Jung District, Seoul|Jung Districts]]. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO [[World Heritage]] List in 1997 as an "outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design". The main palace, [[Gyeongbokgung]], underwent a large-scale restoration project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/data/data_01.jsp?dep1=2&dep2=1|title=About the Palace|publisher=Gyeongbokgung Palace|access-date=2014-02-12|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614221413/http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/data/data_01.jsp?dep1=2&dep2=1|archive-date=2008-06-14}}</ref> The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, [[Unhyeongung]] is known for being the royal residence of Regent [[Daewongun]], the father of [[Emperor Gojong]] at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.

Seoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. [[Pungnap Toseong]] is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of [[Wiryeseong]]. [[Mongchontoseong|Mongchon Toseong]] ({{Korean|몽촌토성|蒙村土城}}) is another earthen wall built during the [[Baekje]] period that is now located inside the [[Olympic Park, Seoul|Olympic Park]].<ref name="toseong"/> The [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Fortress Wall]] of Seoul was built early in the [[Joseon]] dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about ⅔ of the wall remains, as well as six of the original [[The Eight Gates of Seoul|eight gates]]. These gates include [[Sungnyemun]] and [[Heunginjimun]], commonly known as Namdaemun (South Great Gate) and Dongdaemun (East Great Gate). Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sungnyemun to open to great fanfare after more than five years of renovation|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130430000738|access-date=1 May 2013|publisher=The Korea Herald|date=30 April 2013|archive-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430200528/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130430000738|url-status=live}}</ref> Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, [[Namdaemun Market]] and [[Dongdaemun Market]].

There are also many buildings constructed with international styles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The [[Independence Gate]] was built in 1897 to inspire an independent spirit. [[Seoul Station]] was opened in 1900 as Gyeongseong Station.

Various high-rise [[office building]]s and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the [[Tower Palace]], Namsan Seoul Tower, and the [[Lotte World Tower]], dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 4th highest building in the world.

The [[World Trade Center Seoul]], located in [[Gangnam District]], hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the [[COEX Mall]], a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex. Downstream from Gangnam District is [[Yeouido]], an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]. The [[Olympic Stadium (Seoul)|Olympic Stadium]], [[Olympic Park, Seoul|Olympic Park]], and [[Lotte World]] are located in [[Songpa District]], on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], the new wave-shaped [[Seoul City Hall]], by [[Yoo Kerl]] of [[iArc]], and the [[Lotte World Tower]], the 5th tallest building in the world designed by [[Kohn Pederson Fox]].

In 2010 Seoul was designated the [[World Design Capital]] for the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-02-27/the-seoul-of-world-designbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=The Seoul of World Design|date=2008-02-27|access-date=2014-02-12|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|archive-date=18 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418211436/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-02-27/the-seoul-of-world-designbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|url-status=live}}</ref>
