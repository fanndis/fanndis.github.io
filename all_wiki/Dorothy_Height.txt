==Early life==
Dorothy Height was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on March 24, 1912. When she was five years old, she moved with her family to [[Rankin, Pennsylvania]], a steel town in the suburbs of [[Pittsburgh]], where she attended racially integrated schools. Height's mother was active in the [[Pennsylvania Federation of Colored Women's Clubs]] and regularly took Dorothy along to meetings where she established her "place in the sisterhood."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Collection: Dorothy Irene Height papers {{!}} Smith College Finding Aids|url=https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/814|access-date=2020-06-29|website=findingaids.smith.edu}} {{Cc-notice|cc=by3}}</ref> Height's long association with the [[YWCA]] began in a Girl Reserve Club in Rankin organized under the auspices of the Pittsburgh YWCA. An enthusiastic participant, who was soon elected President of the Club, Height was appalled to learn that her race barred her from swimming in the pool at the central YWCA branch. Though her arguments could not bring about a change in policy in 1920s Pittsburgh, Height later dedicated much of her professional energy to bringing profound change to the YWCA.<ref name=":0" />

While in high school Height became socially and politically active in anti-lynching campaigns.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Skutch|first1=Jan|title=Civil rights leader, beacon for black women Dorothy Height dies|url=https://www.savannahnow.com/article/20100421/NEWS/304219711|accessdate=25 May 2019|publisher=Savannah Morning News}}</ref> A talented orator, she won first place and a $1,000 scholarship at a national oratory contest held by the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]].<ref>Hine, Darlene Clark., William C.

==Career==
[[File:Dorothy Height presents Eleanor Roosevelt the Mary McLeod Bethune Human Rights Award, 12 Nov 1960.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Height with Eleanor Roosevelt, 1960]]
From 1934-37, Height worked in the New York City Department of Welfare, an experience she credited with teaching her the skills to deal with conflict without intensifying it. From there she moved to a job as a counselor at the YWCA of New York City, Harlem Branch, in the fall of 1937. Soon after joining the staff there, Height met [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] at a meeting of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) held at the YWCA. In her 2003 memoir, Height described the meeting: "On that fall day the redoubtable Mary McLeod Bethune put her hand on me. She drew me into her dazzling orbit of people in power and people in poverty…. 'The freedom gates are half ajar,' she said. 'We must pry them fully open.' I have been committed to the calling ever since."<ref name="memoir">{{cite book|author=Height, Dorothy|url=https://archive.org/details/openwidefreedomg00heig|title=Open Wide the Freedom Gates: A Memoir|publisher=PublicAffairs Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58648-286-2|location=New York|url-access=registration}}</ref> The following year Height served as Acting Director of the YWCA of New York City's Emma Ransom House residence. In addition to her YWCA and NCNW work, Height was also very active in the United Christian Youth Movement, a group intensely interested in relating faith to real world problems.<ref name=":0" />

In 1939 Height went to Washington, DC to be Executive of the [[Phyllis Wheatley YWCA|Phyllis Wheatley Branch]] of the DC YWCA. She returned to New York City to join the YWCA national staff in the fall of 1944, joining the program staff with "special responsibility" in the field of Interracial Relations. This work included training activities, writing, and working with the Public Affairs committee on race issues where her "insight into the attitude and feeling of both white and negro people [was] heavily counted on." It was during this period that the YWCA adopted its Interracial Charter (1946), which not only pledged to work towards an interracial experience within the YWCA, but also to fight against injustice on the basis of race, "whether in the community, the nation or the world." Convinced that segregation causes prejudice through estrangement, Height facilitated meetings, ran workshops, and wrote articles and pamphlets aimed at helping white YWCA members transcend their fears and bring their daily activities in line with the Association's principles.<ref name=":0" />

Height was an active member of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority, throughout her life, developing leadership training programs and ecumenical education programs.<ref name="memoir" /> She was initiated at the Rho Chapter at [[Columbia University]], and served as national president of the sorority from 1947 to 1956.<ref name="memoir" /> In 1950 Height moved to the Training Services department where she focused primarily on professional training for YWCA staff. She spent the fall of 1952 in [[India]] as a [[Visiting scholar|visiting professor]] at the [[Delhi School of Social Work]], then returned to her training work in New York City.<ref name=":0" /> Height participated in the Liberia Watch Program and worked within the ranks of leadership in 1955.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Edelman|first1=Marian|date=30 March 2006|title=Dorothy Height broadens our horizon|journal=New York Beacon}}</ref>

The increasing momentum of the civil rights movement prompted the YWCA's National Board to allocate funds to launch a country-wide Action Program for Integration and Desegregation of Community YWCAs in 1963. Height took leave from her position as Associate Director for Training to head this two-year Action Program. At the end of that period, the National Board adopted a proposal to accelerate the work "in going beyond token integration and making a bold assault on all aspects of racial segregation." It established an Office of Racial Integration (re-named Office of Racial Justice in 1969) as part of the Executive Office. In her role as its first Director, Height helped to monitor the Association's progress toward full integration, kept abreast of the civil rights movement, facilitated "honest dialogue," aided the Association in making best use of its African-American leadership (both volunteer and staff), and helped in their recruitment and retention. Shortly before she retired from the YWCA in 1977, Height was elected as an honorary national board member, a lifetime appointment.<ref name=":0" />

Height became President of the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW) in 1958 and remained in that position until 1990. While working with both the YWCA and NCNW, Height participated in the Civil Rights Movement and she was considered a member of the "[[Civil Rights Six]]" (a group with up to nine members, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr]]., [[James Farmer]], [[John Lewis]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Roy Wilkins]], and [[Whitney Young]]). In his autobiography, civil rights leader [[James Farmer]] noted that Height's role in the "Big Six" was frequently ignored by the press due to sexism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it2RdgDxFMMC&q=Big+Six|title=Lay Bare the Heart|publisher=[[Texas Christian University Press]]|year=1998|isbn=9780875651880|location=Fort Worth|page=215|author-link=James Farmer|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref> During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], she organized [[Wednesdays in Mississippi]] with [[Polly Spiegel Cowan]], which brought together black and white women from the North and South to work against segregation.<ref name="AP">{{cite web|author=Evans, Ben|date=April 20, 2010|title=Dorothy Height, civil rights activist, dies at 98|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g1wclP0PXt3NaBWLcwbFUjRs9bawD9F73F081|accessdate=April 20, 2010|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Height's background as a prize-winning orator allowed her to serve as an effective middleman through creating a dialogue of understanding between unfamiliar parties. Though Height was not called upon to speak at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], she served as one of the chief organizers for the gathering becoming a key part in the demonstration's success. Height also acted as an ambassador for the lone women's organization during the event.<ref name="auto1" /> Additionally, Height developed many international volunteer programs with the NCNW in Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America.<ref name=":0" />

In the mid-1960s, she wrote a column called "A Woman's Word" for the weekly African-American newspaper the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]''.<ref>Height, Dorothy. (March 20, 1965). "A Woman's World," column. ''[[New York Amsterdam News]],'' p. 8 ff.</ref> In 1974, she was named to the [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]], which published the ''[[Belmont Report]]'' a response to the infamous "[[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee Syphilis Study]]" and an international ethical touchstone for researchers to this day.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html "The Belmont Report"], U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.</ref> Height was the driving force in the campaign to erect a statue in honor of Mary McLeod Bethune in [[Lincoln Park (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Park, Washington, D.C.]] The monument was the first statue dedicated to either a woman or an African American person to be erected on federal land. At the July 1974 unveiling of the [[Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial]], which had an attendance of more than eighteen thousand people, Height stated that the statue represented the awakening appreciation for the contributions of racial minorities and women within the United States, which was best represented by a [[Black women|Black woman]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodley|first=Jenny|date=17 May 2017|title="Ma Is in the Park": Memory, Identity, and the Bethune Memorial|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-american-studies/article/ma-is-in-the-park-memory-identity-and-the-bethune-memorial/6BDE2A6A9D4686E59B14E81DE1754A2F|journal=Journal of American Studies|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=474–502|doi=10.1017/S0021875817000536|issn=0021-8758}}</ref> [[File:Dr. Dorothy I.

In 1990, Height, along with 15 other African Americans, formed the [[African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom]].<ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000">{{cite book|author=Kathryn Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of Women's History in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC|accessdate=February 4, 2012|date=August 1, 2000|publisher=Info base Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8|page=6}}</ref> Height received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1994. Height's 90th birthday celebration in 2002 raised five million dollars towards funding the NCNW's mortgage on their Washington, D.C. headquarters, the [[Central National Bank (Washington, D.C.)|Dorothy I.

Two notable donors were Don King and Oprah Winfrey.<ref name="auto"/> Height was recognized by Barnard for her achievements as an honorary alumna during the college's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ''[[Brown v.

The musical stage play ''If This Hat Could Talk'', based on her memoirs ''Open Wide The Freedom Gates'', debuted in 2005. The work showcases her unique perspective on the civil rights movement and details many of the behind-the-scenes figures and mentors who shaped her life, including [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].[[Image:Dorothy I.
