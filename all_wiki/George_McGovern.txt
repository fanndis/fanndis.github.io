'''George Stanley McGovern''' (July 19, 1922&nbsp;– October 21, 2012) was an American politician, historian, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]], and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential nominee in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]].

McGovern grew up in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], where he was a renowned debater. He volunteered for the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S.&nbsp;Army Air Forces]] upon the country's entry into [[World War&nbsp;II]] and as a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] pilot flew 35&nbsp;missions over [[German-occupied Europe]] from a base in Italy.  Among the medals bestowed upon him was a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for making a hazardous emergency landing of his badly damaged plane and saving his crew.  After the war he earned degrees from [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] and [[Northwestern University]], culminating in a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], and was a history professor. He was elected to the U.S.&nbsp;House of Representatives in 1956 and re-elected in 1958. After a failed bid for the U.S.&nbsp;Senate in 1960, he was a successful candidate in 1962.

As a senator, McGovern was an example of [[modern American liberalism]]. He became most known for his outspoken opposition to the growing U.S.&nbsp;involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He staged a brief nomination run in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]] as a stand-in for the assassinated [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. The subsequent [[McGovern–Fraser Commission]] fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly increasing the number of [[caucus]]es and [[primary election|primaries]] and reducing the influence of party insiders. The [[McGovern–Hatfield Amendment]] sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|1972 presidential campaign]] found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of [[Thomas Eagleton]] undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent [[Richard Nixon]] in one of the biggest [[Landslide victory|landslides]] in U.S. electoral history. Though re-elected to the Senate in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in his bid for a fourth term in 1980.

Beginning with his experiences in war-torn Italy and continuing throughout his career, McGovern was involved in issues related to agriculture, food, nutrition, and hunger. As the first director of the [[Food for Peace]] program in 1961, McGovern oversaw the distribution of U.S. surpluses to the needy abroad and was instrumental in the creation of the [[United Nations]]-run [[World Food Programme]]. As sole chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs|Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] from 1968 to 1977, McGovern publicized the problem of hunger within the United States and issued the "McGovern Report", which led to a new set of nutritional guidelines for Americans. McGovern later served as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture|U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]] from 1998 to 2001 and was appointed the first UN global ambassador on world hunger by the World Food Programme in 2001. The [[McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program|McGovern–Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program]] has provided school meals for millions of children in dozens of countries since 2000 and resulted in McGovern's being named [[World Food Prize]] co‑laureate in 2008.

==Military service==

===Groundschool and trainers===

Soon thereafter McGovern was sworn in as a [[Private (rank)|private]] at [[Fort Snelling]] in [[Minnesota]].<ref name="ambrose-49">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 49.</ref>  He spent a month at [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post]] in [[Missouri]] and then five months at [[Southern Illinois Normal University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], for ground school training.  McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced.<ref name="ambrose-56">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 54, 56–57.</ref> He spent two months at a base in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and then went to [[Hatbox Field]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], for basic flying school, training in a single-engined [[PT-19|PT‑19]].<ref name="ambrose-56"/>  McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943, during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer).<ref name="ambrose-65">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 65–66.</ref>  His father presided over the ceremony at the Methodist church in Woonsocket.<ref>Knock, ''The Rise of a Prairie Statesman'', pp. 51–52.</ref>
 
After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to [[Coffeyville Army Airfield]] in [[Kansas]] for a further three months of training on the [[BT-13|BT‑13]].<ref name="ambrose-68">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 68–70, 73–74.</ref>  Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at [[Pampa Army Airfield]] in [[Texas]] for twin-engine training on the [[Cessna AT-17|AT‑17]] and [[Curtiss AT-9|AT‑9]].<ref name="ambrose-68"/> Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good [[depth perception]] aiding him.<ref name="ambrose-56"/>  Eleanor McGovern followed him to these duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]].<ref name="ambrose-68"/>

===Training in the B-24===

[[Image:Liberal Army Airfield KS 7 Oct 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas during World War II, where McGovern learned to fly the B-24]]

McGovern was assigned to [[Liberal Army Airfield]] in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with.<ref name="ambrose-68"/> McGovern recalled later: "Learning how to fly the B‑24 was the toughest part of the training.  It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because in the early part of the war they didn't have hydraulic controls.  If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls.  It was the biggest bomber we had at the time."<ref name="airjourn"/>  Eleanor was constantly afraid.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 68, 72, 100.</ref>  Accidents while training claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war.<ref>Knock, ''The Rise of a Prairie Statesman'', p. 57.</ref>

This schooling was followed by a stint at [[Lincoln Army Airfield]] in [[Nebraska]], where McGovern met his B-24 crew.<ref name="ambrose-96">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 94, 96, 99.</ref>  Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation.<ref name="ambrose-96"/>  The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others, owing to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 115.</ref>  Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 87–88.</ref>

In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at [[Mountain Home Army Air Field]] in [[Idaho]].<ref name="ambrose-96"/>  They then shipped out via [[Camp Patrick Henry]] in [[Virginia]], where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 102–104.</ref>

===Italy===

In September 1944 McGovern joined the 741st Squadron of the [[455th Bombardment Group]] of the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], stationed at [[San Giovanni Airfield]] near [[Cerignola]] in the [[Apulia]] region of Italy.<ref name="ambrose-124">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 124, 128–130.</ref> There he and his crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression.<ref name="ambrose-124"/><ref name="nyt-prof-1968"/> Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger.<ref name="staug"/> Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35&nbsp;missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the ''Dakota Queen'' after his wife Eleanor.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 153.</ref> His targets were in [[Austria]]; [[Czechoslovakia]]; [[Nazi Germany]]; [[Hungary]]; [[Poland]]; and [[German invasion of Italy|northern, German-controlled Italy]], and were often either [[oil refinery]] complexes or rail [[marshalling yard|marshaling yards]], all as part of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|U.S.&nbsp;strategic bombing campaign in Europe]]. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared with earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy [[anti-aircraft artillery]] fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 125.</ref>

On McGovern's December 15 mission over [[Linz]], his second as pilot, a piece of shrapnel from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 179–180.</ref> The following day on a mission to [[Brüx]], he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 181.</ref> The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 187–189.</ref> On a December 20 mission against the [[Škoda Works]] at [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on [[Vis (island)|Vis]], a small island in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisan (military)|Partisans]]. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished.  But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref name="ambrose-192">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 192–196.</ref><ref name="1000-176">Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 176.</ref>

===Opposition to Vietnam War===
[[File:George McGovern Vietnam trip Nov 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Senator McGovern on his first trip to South Vietnam, November 1965]]
In a speech on the Senate floor in September 1963, McGovern became the first member to challenge the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Under the Kennedy Administration|growing U.S.&nbsp;military involvement in Vietnam]].<ref name="anson-150"/><ref name="weil-16">Weil, ''The Long Shot'', pp. 16–17.</ref> Bothered by the [[Buddhist crisis]] and other recent developments, and with concerns influenced by Vietnam historian [[Bernard Fall]], McGovern said:
{{cquote|The current dilemma in Vietnam is a clear demonstration of the limitations of military power&nbsp;... [Current U.S. involvement] is a policy of moral debacle and political defeat&nbsp;... The trap we have fallen into there will haunt us in every corner of this revolutionary world if we do not properly appraise its lessons.<ref name="nyt-record"/><ref name="anson-150">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 149–151.</ref>}}

However, the speech was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying anything publicly for over a year afterward, partly because of the November 1963 [[assassination of President Kennedy]] and partly to not appear strident.<ref name="anson-152">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 152–154.</ref> Though more skeptical about it than most senators,<ref name="mann-366">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', pp. 357, 366–368.</ref> McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which turned out to be an essentially unbounded authorization for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to escalate U.S. involvement in the war.<ref name="nyt-record"/> McGovern thought the commander in chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack;<ref name="weil-16"/> subsequently, he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes because of Senator [[J. William Fulbright]]'s urging to stand behind Johnson politically.<ref name="anson-152"/><ref name="mann-366"/> Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war;<ref name="nyt-record"/> [[Wayne Morse]], one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of "very interesting, but very belated."<ref name="anson-152"/> This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.<ref name="weil-16"/><ref name="mann-366"/>

In January 1965 McGovern made his first major address on Vietnam, saying that "We are not winning in South Vietnam&nbsp;... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of extending the war to the north."<ref name="cby-267"/><ref name="anson-155">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 154–157.</ref> McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UN&nbsp;presence to guarantee security and fair treatment.<ref name="anson-155"/> The speech gave McGovern national visibility as one of the "doves" in the debate over Vietnam.<ref name="anson-155"/><ref name="knock-cha-105">Knock, "Come Home America", pp. 104–105.</ref> However, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S.&nbsp;forces and criticizing [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|antiwar]] [[draft-card burning]]s as "immature, impractical, and illegal."<ref name="anson-160"/> He eschewed personal criticism of Johnson.<ref name="knock-cha-105"/> In November 1965 McGovern traveled to South Vietnam for three weeks.<ref name="mann-486">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 486.</ref> The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply upset him, and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced than ever that Vietnam was a political, not military, problem.<ref name="nyt-record"/><ref name="cby-267"/><ref name="anson-160">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 160–164.</ref> Now he was ready, as he later said, "not merely to dissent, but to crusade" against the war.<ref name="mann-486"/>

McGovern voted in favor of Vietnam military appropriations in 1966 through 1968, not wanting to deprive U.S. forces of necessary equipment.<ref name="anson-160"/> Nevertheless, his antiwar rhetoric increased throughout 1967.<ref name="anson-165">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 165–166.</ref> Over the years, Johnson had invited McGovern and other Senate doves to the [[White House]] for attempts to explain the rationale for his actions in Vietnam; McGovern came away from the final such visit, in August 1967, shaken by the sight of a president "tortured and confused&nbsp;... by the mess he has gotten into in Vietnam."<ref name="anson-165"/>

===1968 presidential and Senate campaigns===
In August 1967 activist [[Allard K. Lowenstein]] founded the [[Dump Johnson movement]], and soon it was seeking a Democratic Party figure to make a primaries campaign challenge against Johnson in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]].<ref name="white-1968-72">White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', pp. 72–74.</ref> The group's first choice was Senator Robert Kennedy, who declined, as did another, and by late September 1967 they approached McGovern.<ref name="nyt-prof-1968"/><ref name="white-1968-72"/> After much deliberation McGovern declined, largely because he feared such a run would significantly damage his own chances for reelection to his Senate seat in 1968.<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/><ref name="anson-4"/> A month later the anti-Johnson forces were able to persuade Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] to run;<ref name="white-1968-72"/> he was one of the few "dove" senators not up for reelection that year.<ref name="anson-4">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 2–8.</ref>

In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy staged a strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] joined the field. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were both from the neighboring state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral.<ref name="anson-188">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 188–192.</ref> McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, which resulted in a strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night.<ref name="anson-188"/> McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy was assassinated]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="anson-188"/> The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.<ref name="anson-188"/>

Within days, some of Kennedy's aides were urging McGovern to run in his place; their antipathy toward McCarthy and ideological opposition to Humphrey made them unwilling to support either candidate.<ref name="anson-193"/> McGovern delayed making a decision, making sure that Bobby's brother [[Ted Kennedy]] did not want to enter, and with his staff still concerned about the senator's own reelection prospects.<ref name="anson-193">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 192–199.</ref> Indeed, McGovern's voting had changed during 1968, with his ADA rating falling to 43 as he sought more middle-of-the-road stances.<ref name="nyt-record"/> In late July, McGovern's decision became more complicated when his daughter Teresa was arrested in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] on [[drug possession|marijuana possession]] charges.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10C10F93E5E1A7B93CAAB178CD85F4C8685F9 |title= McGovern's Daughter Held |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 28, 1968 |page=52}}</ref> She had led a troubled life since her teenage years, developing problems with alcohol and depression and suffering the consequences of a relationship with an unstable neighborhood boy.<ref>McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 64–66.</ref> On the basis of a recently enacted strict state drugs law, Terry now faced a minimum five-year prison sentence if found guilty.<ref name="terry-71">McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 71–74.</ref> McGovern was also convinced that the socially conservative voters of South Dakota would reject him owing to his daughter's arrest.<ref name="terry-71"/> Charges against her were subsequently dropped because of an invalid search warrant.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 195.</ref>

McGovern formally announced his candidacy on August 10, 1968, in Washington, two weeks in advance of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], committing himself to "the goals for which Robert Kennedy gave his life."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D13F8345E157A8EDDA80994D0405B888AF1D3 |title= M'Govern Opens Presidential Bid With Peace Plea |author=Hunter, Majorie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 11, 1968 |page=1}}</ref> Asked why he was a better choice than McCarthy, he said, "Well – Gene really doesn't want to be president, and I do."<ref name="white-1968-265"/> At the convention in Chicago, Humphrey was the near-certain choice, while McGovern became the initial rallying point for around 300 leaderless Kennedy delegates.<ref name="white-1968-265">White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', pp. 265–266.</ref> The chaotic circumstances of the convention found McGovern denouncing the Chicago police tactics against demonstrators as "police brutality."<ref name="anson-207">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 207–211.</ref> Given the internal politics of the party, it was difficult for McGovern to gain in delegate strength, and black protest candidate [[Channing E. Phillips]] drew off some of his support.<ref name="anson-207"/> In the actual roll call, McGovern came in third with 146½ delegates, far behind Humphrey's 1760¼ and McCarthy's 601.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', Appendix C.</ref>

McGovern endorsed Humphrey at the convention, to the dismay of some antiwar figures who considered it a betrayal.<ref name="anson-207"/> Humphrey went on to lose the general election to [[Richard Nixon]]. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former governor [[Archie M. Gubbrud]]. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest,<ref name="terry-76">McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 76, 79.</ref> he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago.<ref name="anson-213">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 213–216.</ref> However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort.<ref name="anson-213"/> In November, McGovern won 57&nbsp;percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.<ref name="terry-76"/>

===Middle Senate years and continued opposition to the Vietnam War===
During the 1968 Democratic Convention, a motion had been passed to establish a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 17–20.</ref> In 1969 McGovern was named chairman of the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission|Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection]], also known as the McGovern–Fraser Commission; owing to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and [[primary election|primaries]], and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 24–33.</ref><ref name="reichley-285"/> A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive increase in the number of presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well.<ref name="kauf"/> The U.S.&nbsp;presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.<ref name="reichley-285">Reichley, ''The Life of the Parties'', pp. 283, 285–287.</ref><ref name="kauf">{{cite journal | last1=Kaufmann | first1=Karen M. | first2=James G. | last2=Gimpel | first3=Adam H. | last3=Hoffman | title=A Promise Fulfilled?

In the wake of several high-profile reports about hunger and [[malnutrition]] in the United States, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs|Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chairman.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 220–224.</ref> Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to [[Immokalee, Florida]], the base for 20,000 [[migrant farm worker]]s.<ref name="anson-225">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 225–229.</ref> They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials.<ref name="anson-225"/><ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70C10FD3B5D137A93C3A81788D85F4D8685F9 |title=Senators on Hunger Tour See Squalor in Florida |author=Hunter, Majorie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 11, 1969 |page=31}}</ref> McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress during much of the next year over an expanded [[Food Stamp Program]]; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 229–234.</ref>

McGovern generally lacked both interest and expertise in [[economics]], but was outspoken in reaction to Nixon's imposition of [[wage and price controls]] in 1971.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 137.</ref> McGovern declared: "This administration, which pledged to slow inflation and reduce unemployment, has instead given us the highest rate of inflation and the highest rate of unemployment in a decade."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title=Economic Crisis: 1971 Year in Review |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=October 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212064553/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |archive-date=February 12, 2009  }}</ref> ''[[60 Minutes]]'' included him in a 1971 report about liberal politicians and journalists who advocated integrated schooling while avoiding it for their children.{{refn|The report, by [[Mike Wallace]], detailed the senator's support of [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]] even while the Washington, D.C., resident was paying non-resident tuition for his own daughter to attend [[Bethesda, Maryland]], public schools, which were only 3&nbsp;percent black.

{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
But most of all, McGovern was known for his continued opposition to the Vietnam War. In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president's policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves.<ref name="anson-168">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 167–169.</ref> The diversion during these years of much of Food for Peace's aid to South Vietnam, instead of other badly stricken countries around the world, greatly upset him.<ref>Knock, "Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists", pp. 112–113.</ref> By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year.<ref name="anson-168"/> In October 1969 McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000&nbsp;demonstrators in Boston at the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]], and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Mobilization]]'s antiwar march to the [[Washington Monument]].<ref name="anson-172">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 169–174.</ref> Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized antiwar figures such as [[Rennie Davis]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Huey Newton]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], and [[Jerry Rubin]] as "reckless" and "irresponsible."<ref name="anson-172"/>

Instead, McGovern focused on legislative means to bring the war to an end.<ref name="anson-177"/> The [[McGovern–Hatfield Amendment]] to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican [[Mark Hatfield]] of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina by the end of 1970.<ref name="nyt090270">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0B1FF73D551B7493C0A91782D85F448785F9 | title=Senate Defeats 'End War' Move By Vote Of 55–39 | author=Smith, Robert M. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 2, 1970 | page=1}}</ref> It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971.<ref name="mann-669"/> In May 1970 McGovern obtained a [[second mortgage]] on his Washington home in order to fund a half-hour televised panel discussion on the amendment on [[NBC]].<ref name="mann-669"/> The broadcast brought in over $500,000 in donations that furthered work on passage,<ref name="anson-177"/> and eventually the amendment gained the support of the majority of the public in polls.<ref name="mann-669"/> The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by White House aide [[Charles Colson]], which called McGovern and Hatfield "apostles of retreat and defeat" and "salesmen of surrender" and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy.<ref name="mann-669"/> The amendment was defeated in September 1970 by a 55–39 vote, just short of what McGovern had hoped would constitute at least a [[moral victory]].<ref name="anson-177">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 174–178.</ref> During the floor debate McGovern criticized his colleagues opposing the measure:

There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed.

Knock wrote in 2003 that "[McGovern's] career was extraordinary and historic ... primarily because of his impress as searching and prophetic critic" and that "few political careers offer an alternative understanding of the American Century as compelling and instructive as McGovern's."<ref name="knock-cha-84"/>

As chairman of the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that continue to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional changes taking place in both.<ref name="reichley-285"/> Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states.<ref name="cook-44">Cook, ''The Presidential Nominating Process'', pp. 43–44.</ref> His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged.<ref name="miroff-2">Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 2–3.</ref> Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the [[New Deal coalition]] to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s "New Politics" found its culmination in McGovern's nomination.<ref name="miroff-2"/> In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions.<ref name="miroff-2"/> McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, "We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon as we did, half the Democrats walked out."<ref name="nytm-mcginniss"/> [[SUNY Albany]] political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire&nbsp;... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record."<ref name="miroff-1"/> Half a century after McGovern's 1972 winning nomination effort, writers were making extensive comparisons between it and the [[Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/bernie-sanders-george-mcgovern/606883/ | title=Bernie Sanders Is George McGovern | author-first=Derek | author-last=Thompson | author-link=Derek Thompson (journalist) | magazine=[[The Atlantic]] | date=February 21, 2020}}</ref>

Staffers who worked on McGovern's 1972 campaign later became influential within the Democratic Party.<ref name="miroff-290">Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 290–293.</ref> Campaign manager Gary Hart staged his own presidential runs in 1984 and 1988. Future president Bill Clinton, with assistance from his future wife and politician, [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham]], had managed the McGovern campaign's operations in Texas.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern,<ref>Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 286–288.</ref><ref>Witcover, ''Party of the People'', p. 635.</ref> while Clinton, and the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] movement of which he was a part, explicitly rejected McGovern's ideology.<ref>Witcover, ''Party of the People'', p. 632.</ref> But there was still a legacy in terms of staffing, as the Clinton White House would be full of former "McGovernites".<ref name="miroff-290"/><ref>Knock, "Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists", pp. 114, 120.</ref>

McGovern's post-political career generally enhanced his reputation; [[Tom Brokaw]], who referred to McGovern as part of the "[[The Greatest Generation (book)|Greatest Generation]]", wrote in 1998 that "he remains one of the country's most decent and thoughtful public servants."<ref name="brokaw-121"/>
McGovern's legacy also includes his commitment to combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. He said, "After I'm gone, I want people to say about me: He did the best he could to end hunger in this country and the world."<ref name="staug"/> In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history.<ref name="knock-ftw-114"/> Responding to the [[Serenity Prayer]]'s desire to "grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change", McGovern said simply that he rejected that notion: "I keep trying to change them."<ref name="ap102906"/>
