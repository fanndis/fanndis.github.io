The '''Grammy Award for Song of the Year''' is an honor presented at the [[Grammy Awards]], a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> The Song of the Year award is one of the four most prestigious categories at the awards (alongside [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]), presented annually since the [[1st Grammy Awards]] in 1959. According to the [[54th Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is presented: {{quote|to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>
}}

If a winning song contains samples or interpolations of existing material, the publisher and songwriter(s) of the original song(s) can apply for a Winners Certificate.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf Grammy Blue Book]</ref>


Song of the Year is related to but is conceptually different from Record of the Year or Album of the Year:

* Song of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. "Song" in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.
* Record of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, "record" means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, "album" means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.

==History and description==
The Song of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-1st-annual-grammy-awards|title=GRAMMY REWIND: 1ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|the Record of the Year award]] and Song of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes only to the composer(s) of the song whereas the Record of the Year award goes to the performer and production team of the song. According to the [[54th Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is given to the songwriter(s) of a song that "must contain melody and lyrics and must be either a new song or a song first achieving prominence during the eligibility year. Songs containing prominent samples or interpolations are not eligible".<ref name=Categorymapper>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper|title=Category Mapper|accessdate=November 25, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

Since the late 1960s other songwriter's awards have been presented for genre-specific categories including [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] (since 1965), [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]] (since 1969), [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]] (since 1988), [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] (since 1992), and most recently [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song]] (since 2004), [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song]] (from 2006 to 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Song]] (from 2012 to 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song]] (since 2014), [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance/Song]] (since 2015), and [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]] (since 2015).

The category was expanded to include eight nominees in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-61st-grammy-awards-update Recording Academy Announces 61st GRAMMY Awards Update]</ref>

The first and only tie in this category in Grammy history took place in 1978, when both [[Barbra Streisand]]'s & [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]' "[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen (Love Theme from ''A Star Is Born'')]]" and [[Joseph Brooks (songwriter)|Joe Brooks]]' "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]" win the award.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://parade.com/125515/parade/has-there-been-a-tie-grammys/ |title=Has There Ever been a Tie for a Grammy? |publisher=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |access-date=26 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920225612/https://parade.com/125515/parade/has-there-been-a-tie-grammys/ |archive-date=20 September 2019}}</ref>
