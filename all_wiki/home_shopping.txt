'''Home shopping''' is the electronic retailing and home [[shopping channel]]s industry, which includes such billion dollar television-based and e-commerce companies as [[Shop LC]], [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], [[Gemporia]], [[The Jewellery Channel|TJC]], [[QVC]], [[eBay]], [[ShopHQ]], [[Buy.com]] and [[Amazon.com]], as well as traditional [[mail order]] and [[brick and mortar]] retailers as [[Hammacher Schlemmer]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] Home shopping allows [[consumer]]s to shop for goods from the privacy of their own home, as opposed to traditional shopping, which requires one to visit brick and mortar [[Retailing|stores]] and [[shopping malls]].

There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from [[mail order|catalogs]]; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as [[periodical]]s, TV and radio); and [[online shopping]].

==History==
The possibility for merchants to show their goods through the world was the first usage of the "electroscope" (some kind of television apparatus) imagined by the author of the hoax published in the ''[[New York Sun]]'', 30 March 1877.<ref>[https://www.histv.net/electroscope-1878] "The Electroscope", ''The New York Sun'', 30 March 1877.</ref> The first such attempt at broadcasting shopping news occurred on February 1, 1927 with the establishment of WASN radio in [[Boston]]; owned by [[John Shepard III]], WASN boasted reports from fifteen different department stores in [[Greater Boston]] every two hours, mixed with pre-recorded and live orchestra music.<ref>"New Station Will Take Air Tomorrow."

The home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when [[small market]] [[talk radio show]] host [[Bob Circosta]] was asked to sell [[avocado]]-[[green]]-colored [[can opener]]s live on the air by station owner [[Bud Paxson]], when an [[advertiser]] traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill.  Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first [[shopping channel]] on [[cable television]], later launching nationwide with the [[Home Shopping Network]] (rebranded as [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]]).  [[Bob Circosta]] was America's first-ever TV [[home shopping host]], becoming one of the most instantly recognizable salesmen in the United States. Over the next three decades, Circosta sold over 75,000 different products on [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], netted over 20,000 hours of live, on-air TV selling, and achieved personal product sales in excess of one billion dollars.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (The story is disputed; there is some record of Paxson having unsuccessfully tried a similar format in 1969 on one of his earlier TV stations, [[WNYB|WNYP]] in [[Jamestown, New York]].)<ref>Fybush, Scott (January 12, 2015).

The classic television-based home shopping industry quickly became a major player in the retail industry. The two most successful shopping channels – [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]] and [[QVC]] – generate a combined total of over 10 billion dollars in sales every year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} And [[Jewelry Television]] is the largest gemstone retailer in the world.

In addition to books, Amazon eventually added [[video games]], [[computer software]], [[electronics]], [[apparel]], and more to its sales repertoire.  The company now generate over 200 billion dollars annually.<ref>http://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NASDAQ_AMZN_2018.pdf </ref>

==Direct response==

The [[Electronic Retailing Association]], when totaling the combined revenues from all the home shopping companies, estimates that in 2005, the industry generated over 320 billion dollars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Direct marketing is a marketing where buyers will give direct response to the sellers and seller will immediately take an order.
