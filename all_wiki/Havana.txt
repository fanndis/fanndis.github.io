Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: [[Old Havana]], [[Vedado]] and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the [[Havana Harbor|bay]], which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: [[Havana Harbour#Facilities|Mari melena, Guanabacoa and Antares]]. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the [[Straits of Florida]] a few miles west of the bay.<ref name="Anuario Estadistico">{{cite web|title=Anuario Estadistico de Ciudad de La Habana|url=http://www.one.cu/aed2010/03Ciudad%20Habana/esp/20080618_tabla_cuadro.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804121625/http://www.one.cu/aed2010/03Ciudad%20Habana/esp/20080618_tabla_cuadro.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2011|publisher=ONE – Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas (National Statistics Office)|accessdate=28 November 2011|language=es}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Havana|Timeline of Havana}}

=== Colonial period ===

====16th century====
[[File:Jacquesdesores.jpg|thumb|left|French pirate [[Jacques de Sores]] looting and burning Havana in 1555]]
[[Conquistador]] [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] founded Havana on August 25, 1515, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de [[Batabanó, Cuba|Batabanó]], or more likely on the banks of the [[Mayabeque River]] close to [[Playa Mayabeque]]. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundación de La Habana a orillas del Río Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristobal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>

Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, "[[Careening]] Bay"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.

[[Pánfilo de Narváez]] gave Havana – the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba – its name: ''San Cristóbal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Cristóbal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.

Havana began as a [[port|trading port]], and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, [[piracy|pirates]], and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities – not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a [[monopoly]] on New World trade).

Ships from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.

On December 20, 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as "Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.

====17th century====
[[File:Panorama of La Habana (Amsterdam, 17th century).jpg|thumb|17th-century depiction of Havana from the [[Beudeker Collection]]]]
Havana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly [[wood]], combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary Islands|Canarian]] characteristics.

In 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal [[Yellow fever]] brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.<ref>C Cumo.

====18th century====
[[File:Havana Cathedral crop.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Havana Cathedral]], 1748-1777]]
By the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the [[Americas]], ranking behind [[Lima]] and [[Mexico City]] but ahead of [[Boston]] and [[New York city|New York]].<ref>{{cite book|last =Thomas|first = Hugh|title = Cuba, or The pursuit of freedom|edition = 2nd |page = 1|date = 1998|isbn = 9780306808272|publisher = Da Capo Press}}</ref> During the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only [[drydock]] in the New World.<ref>Harbron, John D..''Trafalgar and the Spanish navy'', Lestrange Maritime Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-87021-695-3}}, pp. 15–17. Havana built nearly 50% more Ships of the Line than any other Spanish dockyard during the 18th century.</ref>

The city was captured by the [[Great Britain|British]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name="Seven Years War">{{cite book|last = Pocock |first = Tom|title = Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756–63|chapter = Chapter Six|publisher =Michael O'Mara Books |date = 1998 |isbn = 9781854793904}}</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name="Siege">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>

After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Cabaña|San Carlos de la Cabaña]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Castillo San Cristóbal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.

====19th century====
[[File:Mapa de La Habana Vieja.JPG|thumb|right|19th-century depiction of Havana]]
As trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].

In 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting [[sugar]] from the valley of [[Güines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacon Teatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200&nbsp;mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.

In 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.

===Republican period and post-revolution===
The 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last =Cantón Navarro |first = José|title = History of Cuba: The Challenge of the Yoke and the Star : Biography of a People|page = 81|publisher =Editoral SI-MAR|date = 2001 |isbn = 9789597054757}}</ref> The US occupation officially ended when [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], [[List of Presidents of Cuba|first president of Cuba]], took office on 20 May 1902.

During the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.

[[File:Museo de La Revolucion, Cuba.jpg|[[Kavanagh building]]|thumb|The former presidential palace now houses a museum]]
Numerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were aware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]] took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, [[Meyer Lansky]] directed the [[Hotel Habana Riviera]], with [[Lucky Luciano]] at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of [[sex tourists]].<ref>{{cite book

Havana achieved the title of being the [[Latin American]] city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.

After the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new régime under [[Fidel Castro]] promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966–68, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to "certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce" (law No. 1076<ref>{{cite web|author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}</ref>).

A severe economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba – Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.

After many years of [[prohibition]], the communist government increasingly turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html |archive-date = 12 October 2007 |title = Elogian capital humano en restauración de La Habana|work = Digital Granma Internacional|date = 7 December 2006|url = http://www.granma.cu/granmad/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html|language = es}}</ref>  But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.

==Geography==
[[File:Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph of Havana]]

Havana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the [[Straits of Florida]], south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the [[Gulf of Mexico]] joins the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.

There are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Cabaña]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.

===Climate===
Havana, like much of Cuba, has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] that closely borders on a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.

Tornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195.<ref>{{cite web |title=Havana tornado: Cuba's capital hit by rare twister |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47025852 |website=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |title=The Latest: Havana hit by Category F3 tornado |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181446/http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=dead |work = StarTribune.com|date = 28 January 2019|agency = Associated Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/americas/cuba-tornado-dead-scli-intl/index.html|first = Jack |last=Guy|title = Huge tornado in Cuba kills 4 and injures 195 |date = 28 January 2019|work = CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cappucci |first1=Matthew |title=A deadly tornado plowed through Havana on Sunday night.

Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: [[Old Havana]], [[Vedado]], and the newer suburban districts.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.

To the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as [[Vedado]], has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The [[National Capitol Building (Havana)|''Capitolio Nacional'']] building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana.<ref>[http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=32 Centro Habana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519110017/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=32 |date=May 19, 2007 }} – Centro Habana guia turistica, Cuba</ref> Barrio Chino and the [[Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás]], one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|author=CubaJunky.com |url=http://www.cuba-junky.com/havana/havana-casas-particular-viejaycentro.html |title=Centro Habana |publisher=Cuba-junky.com |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref>

A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is [[Marianao]], one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]], located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cactuslanguage.com/en/book/course.php?course_id=1045 |title=Havana Miramar School |publisher=Cactuslanguage.com |accessdate=2010-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194543/http://www.cactuslanguage.com/en/book/course.php?course_id=1045 |archive-date=2010-02-08 }}</ref> The [[International School of Havana]] is located in the Miramar neighborhood.

In the 1980s many parts of [[Old Havana]], including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.

Due to Havana's almost [[History of Havana|five hundred-year existence]], the city boasts some of the most diverse styles of architecture in the world, from castles built in the late 16th century to modernist present-day high-rises.

The present condition of many buildings in Havana has deteriorated since the 1959 Revolution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-17935769|title=Cuba's crumbling buildings mean Havana housing shortage|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|date=2012-05-17|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> Numerous collapses have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance and crumbling structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=112640|title=Old Havana Building Collapse Kills Four - Havana Times.org|website=www.havanatimes.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}</ref>

;Neoclassical
[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.

In 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style

;Colonial and Baroque
[[File:Edificio en la Habana.jpg|thumb|left|Neo-baroque apartment building]]
Riches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Cabaña|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558–1577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589–1630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.

Old Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of [[Moorish architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748–1777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720–1746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751–1775).

;Art Deco and Eclectic
The first echoes of the [[Art Deco]] movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]].<ref name="Havana Deco">{{cite book|last=Alonso|first=Alejandro|title=Havana Deco|year=2003|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-73232-0|pages=3–7}}</ref> The Edificio [[Bacardi]], (1930) is thought to be the best example of Art-deco architecture in the city and the first tall Art Deco building as well,<ref name="Havana Deco"/> followed by the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba]] (1930) and the [[López Serrano Building]] in 1932. The [[FOCSA Building]] was finished in 1956. The year 1928 marked the beginning of the reaction against the Spanish Renaissance style architecture. Art Deco started in the lush and wealthy suburbs of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]], [[Marianao]], and [[Vedado]].<ref name="Havana Deco"/>

The city's eclectic architectural sights begins in [[Centro Habana]].<ref name="havana eclectic">{{cite book|last=Sainsbury|first=Brendan|title=Havana|year=2007|publisher=Lonely planet|isbn=978-1-74104-069-2|pages=101–02}}</ref> The [[Havana Central railway station|Central Railway Terminal]] (1912), and the [[Museum of the Revolution (Cuba)|Museum of the Revolution]] (1920) are example of [[Eclecticism|Eclectic architecture]].

;Modernism
[[File:Ave 23 (La Rampa) in Vedado, Havana.jpg|thumb|right|Modernism started in [[Vedado]] neighborhood]]
Many high-rise office buildings, and apartment complexes, along with some hotels built in the 1950s dramatically altered the skyline. Modernism, therefore, transformed much of the city and is known its individual buildings of high quality rather than its larger key buildings. Examples of the latter are [[Habana Libre]] (1958), which before the revolution was the Havana [[Hilton Hotel]] and La Rampa movie theater (1955).

Famous architects such as [[Walter Gropius]], [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] all passed through the city,<ref>{{cite book|last=Juliet|first=Barclay|title=Havana, Portrait of a City|year=1993|publisher=Casell|location=London|isbn=978-1-84403-127-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/havanaportraitof0000barc/page/92 92]|url=https://archive.org/details/havanaportraitof0000barc/page/92}}</ref> while strong influences can be seen in Havana at this time from [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=Eduardo-Luis|title=The Havana guide: modern architecture|year=1999|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-56898-210-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/havanaguidemoder00rodr/page/n93 1]–8|chapter=Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/havanaguidemoder00rodr|url-access=registration}}</ref> The [[FOCSA Building|Edificio Focsa]] (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The [[Hotel Habana Riviera|Havana Riviera]] Hotel (1957) designed by [[Igor B.

==Culture==

Havana, by far the leading cultural centre of the country, offers a wide variety of features that range from museums, palaces, public squares, avenues, churches, fortresses (including the largest fortified complex in the Americas dating from the 16th through 18th centuries), ballet and from art and musical festivals to exhibitions of technology. The restoration of [[Old Havana]] offered a number of new attractions, including a museum to house relics of the Cuban revolution. The government placed special emphasis on cultural activities, many of which are free or involve only a minimal charge.

===Old Havana===
{{Main|Old Havana}}
[[File:Street in Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Old Havana]] from street level]]
Old Havana, (''La Habana Vieja'' in Spanish), contains the core of the original city of Havana, with more than 2,000&nbsp;hectares it exhibits almost all the Western architectural styles seen in the New World. La Habana Vieja was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish [[Galleons]] on the crossing between the [[New World]] and the [[Old World]]. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in [[baroque]] and [[neoclassic style]].

Many buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana.<ref>[http://www.galenfrysinger.com/old_havana.htm Travel Photos of Galen R Frysinger, Sheboygan, Wisconsin] 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana</ref>

Old Havana is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. [[Alejo Carpentier]] called Old Havana the place "de las columnas" (of the columns). The Cuban government is taking many steps to preserve and to restore Old Havana, through the Office of the city historian, directed by [[Eusebio Leal]].<ref>[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43b/196.html Hartford Web Publishing] Cuban Restoration Project Pins New Hopes on Old Havana</ref> Old Havana and its fortifications were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] in 1982.

The [[Museum of the Revolution (Cuba)|Museum of the Revolution]] ''(Museo de la Revolución)'', designed in Havana by Cuban architect Carlos Maruri, and the [[Belgium|Belgian]] Paul Belau, who came up with an [[eclecticism in art|eclectic]] design, harmoniously combines Spanish, French and German architectural elements. The museum was the [[Presidential Palace]] in the capital; today, its displays and documents outline Cuba's history from the beginning of the ''neo-colonial period''. The building was the site of the [[Havana Presidential Palace Attack (1957)]] by the [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil]].

The neo-classical mansion of the ''Countess of Revilla de Camargo'', today it is the [[Havana Museum of Decorative Arts|Museum of Decorative Arts]] ''(Museo de Artes Decorativas)'', known as the ''"small French Palace of Havana"'' built between 1924 and 1927, it was designed in Paris inspired in [[French Renaissance]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080112140502/http://www.mytravel.com/AniteNextPage.asp?p=SPECIFICGUIDE_42938%2F Museo de Artes Decorativos]- José Gómez Mena, one of Cuba's wealthiest aristocrats, built this house in 1927 to hold his staggering collection of antique furniture, rugs, paintings and vases.</ref> The museum has been exhibiting more than 33,000 works dating from the reigns of [[Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI]], and [[Napoleon III]]; as well as 16th to 20th century [[Oriental]] pieces, among many other treasures.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/articles.asp?cID=51&sID=380&aID=1281 Paseos por La Habana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007001624/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/articles.asp?cID=51&sID=380&aID=1281 |date=October 7, 2007 }}-El museo guarda en su interior mobiliario antiguo, porcelana y ceramica, cristalerias, espejos, bronces y objetos ornamentales.</ref> The Museum has ten permanent exhibit halls.

==Tourism==
[[File:Havana sightseeing bus.jpg|thumb|right|Sight-seeing busses at the [[Parque Central, Havana|Parque Central]]]]
Havana attracts over a million tourists annually,<ref name="Havana Tourism"/> the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists,<ref name="Havana Tourism"/> a 20% increase from 2005.

The city has long been a popular attraction for [[tourism|tourists]]. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean.<ref name="Miguel">[http://world-tourism.org/quality_/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy Miguel Alejandro Figueras]  {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.

With the deterioration of [[Cuba – United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.

Through the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).

Havana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=January 28, 2010 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm |title = Cuba sells its medical expertise|work = BBC News|first = Tom |last = Fawthrop|date = 21 November 2003}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Industry===
[[File:Leyden freighter, Havana Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|M V Leyden freighter in the harbor]]
[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]
Havana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.

The city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.

The traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.

In 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archive-date = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.<ref>{{cite web|last=AP|title=Lack of Customers Dooms Many Cuban Businesses|url=http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228034327/http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 December 2013|publisher=Weekly Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=27 December 2013}}</ref>

===Commerce and finance===
After the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.

In Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the [[National Bank of Cuba]], headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.

In the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, [[casino]]s, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.<ref>{{cite web|title=De una casa colonial a una mansión del Vedado |url=http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013131209/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=es }}</ref>

[[Vedado]] is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165946/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2007 |work=britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The University of Havana is located in Vedado.

Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1&nbsp;million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy,<ref name="CIA Factbook" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656&crid=192|title= Millennium Indicators |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.<ref name=Official_census />

The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure.

===Religion===
[[Roman Catholic]]s form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río. Its patron saint is San Cristobal ([[Saint Christopher]]), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a [[minor basilica]], [[Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre]] and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: [[Pope John Paul II]] (January 1998), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (March 2012) and [[Pope Francis]] (September 2015).

The [[Jewish]] community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170701152154/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Cuba.htm Present-Day Jewish Life in Cuba]</ref> many of whom had fled [[Nazi]] persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or moved to [[Israel]] after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five [[synagogue]]s, but only three remain (one [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and two [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]: one Conservative [[Ashkenazi]] and one Conservative [[Sephardic]]), [[Beth Shalom Temple (Havana, Cuba)|Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue]] is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the [[New York Times]] estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.<ref>[http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/travel/04journeys.html?em&ex=1170824400&en=254a263b2686376e&ei=5087%0A 1,500 Jews who live in Cuba; 1,100 reside in Havana, and the remaining 400 are spread among the provinces.] In Cuba, Finding a Tiny Corner of Jewish Life.</ref>

The years after the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including [[Special Period]] of 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cuba - Overview|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/cuba/index.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=1 December 2011|first=Victoria|last=Burnett}}</ref> The national government does not have an official definition of [[poverty]].<ref name=Cub_eco>Angela, Ferriol Maruaga; et al: ''Cuba crisis, ajuste y situación social (1990–1996)'', La Habana, Cuba : Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 1998, Champter 1</ref> The government researchers argue that "poverty" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as "at risk" or "vulnerable" using internationally accepted measures.<ref name=Cub_eco />

The generic term "[[slum]]" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in ''solares'' (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families)<ref name=cuarteria_def /> and [[shanty towns]] to be the "precarious housing stock" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of [[Old Havana]] and [[Centro Habana]], as well as such neighbourhoods as ''Atarés'' in [[Regla]].<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales>González Rego, R. 1999. "Una Primera Aproximación al Análisis Espacial de los Problemas Socioambientales en los Barrios y Focos Insalubres de Ciudad de La Habana". Facultad de Filosofía e Historia. Departamento de Sociología, Universidad de La Habana. 250 p.</ref> People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighbourhoods. [[Shanty towns]] are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales />

Over 9% of Havana's population live in ''cuartería'' (''solares, ciudadela''), 3.3% in [[shanty towns]], and 0.3% in refugee shelters.<ref name=Censo_vivienda /><ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /> This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in "fair" or "poor" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to ''Instituto Nacional de Vivienda'' (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in "good" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in "fair" condition and 16% in "poor" condition.<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /> Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, specially the highly-populated districts, are in [[urban decay]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2007-03-24|title=Havana's former grandeur decays and crumbles|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-havana-idUSN2034616720070324|access-date=2020-07-17}}</ref>

===Urban buses===
The city's public buses is carried out by the ''Empresa Provincial de Transporte de La Habana'' (EPTH).

;Metrobus
{{main|Havana MetroBus}}
The ''Red Principal'', previously known as MetroBus, serves the inner-city urban area, with a maximum distance of {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Censo_transporte /> The ''Red Principal'' consists of 17 main lines, identified with the letter "P" with long-distance routes. The stops are usually {{convert|800|-|1000|m|ft}}, with frequent buses in peak hours, about every 10&nbsp;minutes. It uses large modern articulated buses, such as the Chinese-made Yutong brand, Russian-made Liaz, or MAZ of [[Belarus]].

;Red Alimentadora
The ''Red Alimentadora'', known as the feeder line, connects the adjacent towns and cities in the metropolitan area with the city center, with a maximum distance of {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Censo_transporte /> This division has one of the most used and largest [[Public transport|urban bus]] fleets in the country, its fleet is made up of mostly new Chinese [[Yutong Group|Yutong buses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granma.cu/INGLES/2004/septiembre/juev30/40fit-i.html |title=International transportation fair in Havana Business in excess of $100&nbsp;million, Granma national newspaper note |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226200426/http://www.granma.cu/INGLES/2004/septiembre/juev30/40fit-i.html |archive-date=February 26, 2008 }}</ref> In 2008 the Cuban government invested millions of dollars for the acquisition of 1,500 new [[Yutong]] urban buses.

===Airports===
Havana is served by [[José Martí International Airport]]. The Airport lies about {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} south of the city center, in the municipality of [[Boyeros]], and is the main hub for the country's [[flag carrier]] [[Cubana de Aviación]]. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]] and one destination in [[Africa]].

The city is also served by [[Playa Baracoa Airport]] which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily [[Aerogaviota]].

===Rail===
{{see also|Havana Suburban Railway}}
Havana has a network of [[Havana Suburban Railway|suburban]], interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalised and run by the FFCC ([[Ferrocarriles de Cuba]] – Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba. The main railway stations are: [[Central Railway Station, Havana|Central Rail Station]], La Coubre Rail Station, [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca Station]], and Estación de Tulipán.

In 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11&nbsp;million,<ref name=Censo_transporte>{{cite web|url=http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822200546/http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |archive-date=August 22, 2011 }} National Statistics Census of Cuba – Transportation p. 6</ref> but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and [[Santiago de Cuba]], some {{convert|836|km|mi}} apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches.

In the 1980s there were plans for a [[Rapid Transit|Metro system]] in Havana similar to [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]]'s, as a result of the [[Soviet Union]] influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s.<ref name=Hav_metro>[http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html Havana Metro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119181627/http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html |date=January 19, 2012 }} Hace unos años parecía que la capital cubana tendría metro, cuando en la década de 1980 los estudios de geología y finanzas realizados por especialistas cubanos y soviéticos iban muy adelantados.</ref> The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital.<ref name=Hav_metro/> In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the project was later dropped.<ref name=Hav_metro/>

===Interurban (tram)===
An interurban line, known as the [[Hershey Electric Railway]], built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to [[Matanzas]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Conner Gorry|author2=David Stanley|title=Cuba|url=https://archive.org/details/cuba00gorr|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-120-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/cuba00gorr/page/142 142]}}</ref>

===Tramway===

Havana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a [[horsecar]] system, '''Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana''' in 1858,<ref>http://www.tramz.com/cu/hb/hb.html</ref> merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as '''Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana''' and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as '''Havana Electric Railway Company'''.<ref>http://www.tramz.com/cu/hb/hbb.html</ref> Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner '''Autobus Modernos SA''' abandoning systems in favor of buses and sold the remaining cars were sold to [[Matanzas]] in 1952.

===Ferry===
Ferries connect [[Old Havana]] with [[Regla]] and [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca]], leaving every 10–15 minutes from Muelle Luz (at the foot of Santa Clara Street). The fare is [[Cuban peso|CUP]] 0.20¢.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/cuba/havana/transport/getting-there-around#ixzz1r0WoNtBb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228130924/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/cuba/havana/transport/getting-there-around |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-28 |title="Havana", Lonely Planet |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |accessdate=2013-01-08 }}</ref>

===Roads===
The city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] and [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]]. The road network has been under construction and growth since the colonial era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transporte publico en La Habana|url=http://transporte-publico-en-la-habana.mundoviajero.net/|publisher=Mundo Viajero|accessdate=9 December 2011|language=es}}</ref>

'''Motorways''' ([[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]) include:
* '''A1''' – Autopista Nacional, from Havana to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] and [[Sancti Spiritus, Cuba|Sancti Spiritus]], with additional short sections near [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Guantanamo]]
* '''A4''' – Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to [[Pinar del Río]]
* '''[[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]]''', to [[Matanzas]] and [[Varadero]]
* '''Havana ring road''' ({{lang-es|Primer anillo|links=no}}), which starts at a [[:es:Túnel de La Habana|tunnel]] under the entrance to [[Havana Harbor]]
* '''Autopista del Mediodia''', from Havana to [[San Antonio de los Baños]]
* an autopista from Havana to [[Melena del Sur]]
* an autopista from Havana to [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]

==Administration==
The governor is [[Reinaldo García Zapata]],<ref name="eleccionesencuba.cu"/> he was elected on January, 2020.<ref name="tribuna.cu"/>

The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer,<ref>[https://apnews.com/2fad9d6d53fa47b1a584e71fc5874506] Cuba elige gobernadores ajustándose a nueva Constitución</ref> thus Havana functions as both a city and a [[province]]. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.

[[File:Comité Central PCC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba|Comite Central del Partido Comunista de Cuba]] (Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party).]]
The national government is headquartered in Havana and plays an extremely visible role in the city's life. Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.

Voters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from "mass organisations" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.

Havana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.

{{Further|Education in Cuba}}
The national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.

The [[University of Havana]], located in the [[Vedado]] section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the [[Polytechnic José Antonio Echeverría|Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría]] where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.

The [[Cuban National Ballet School]] with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious [[ballet]] school in Cuba.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} – La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia única en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.</ref>

Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.

===Services===
Utility services are under the control of several nationalized state enterprises that have developed since the [[Cuban revolution]]. Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.

==Sports==
Many Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the [[Cuban National Series]] is [[Industriales]]. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the [[Estadio Latinoamericano]]. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.
