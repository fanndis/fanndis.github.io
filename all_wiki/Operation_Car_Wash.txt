'''Operation Car Wash''' ({{lang-pt|'''Operação Lava Jato'''}}) is an ongoing criminal investigation by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]], Curitiba Branch. It began in March 2014 and was initially headed by [[investigative judge]]{{efn|'''Investigative judge:''' like the {{lang-fr|juge d'instruction|label=none}} in France, but unlike judges in the [[common law]] systems in most Anglo-Saxon countries, an ''[[investigative judge]]'' is both part of the judicial system and carries out pre-trial investigations before prosecution.}} [[Sérgio Moro]], and in 2019 by Judge {{ILL|Luiz Antônio Bonat|pt}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/luiz-antonio-bonat-e-confirmado-na-antiga-vaga-de-moro/|language=pt |title=Luiz Antonio Bonat é confirmado na antiga vaga de Moro |trans-title=Luiz Antonio Bonat is Confirmed in Moro's Old Position }}</ref> It has resulted in more than a thousand warrants of various types.<!--the previous sentence is from the portuguese wiki article as translated by Google ~~~~ -->  According to the Operation Car Wash task force, investigations implicate administrative members of the state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]], politicians from [[Brazilian political parties|Brazil's largest parties]] (including [[History of Brazil since 1985|presidents of the Republic]]), presidents of the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]], state governors, and businessmen from large Brazilian companies. The Federal Police consider it the largest corruption investigation in the country's history.

Originally a [[money laundering]] investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted [[bribe]]s in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. This criminal scheme was initially known as {{lang|pt|Petrolão}} (Portuguese for "big oil") because of the Petrobras scandal.<ref name="connors">{{cite news|last1=Connors|first1=Will|title=How Brazil's 'Nine Horsemen' Cracked a Bribery Scandal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-brazils-nine-horsemen-cracked-petrobras-bribery-scandal-1428334221 |accessdate=12 May 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 April 2015}}</ref> The investigation is called "Operation Car Wash" because it was first uncovered at a car wash in [[Brasília]].

Investigators indicted and jailed some well-known politicians, including former presidents [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], [[Michel Temer]] and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. The scandal seemed to challenge the impunity of politicians and business leaders and the structural corruption in the political and economic system that had prevailed until then. This was initially thought possible because of the [[independence of the judiciary]].<ref name="Fausto 2017" />

== Investigation ==
The initial accusation came from businessman Hermes Magnus in 2008, who reported an attempt to launder money through his company, Dunel Indústria e Comércio, a manufacturer of electronic components. Ensuing investigations culminated in the identification of four large criminal rings, headed by: {{ill|Carlos Habib Chater|pt}}, [[Alberto Youssef]], {{ill|Nelma Kodama|pt|3=Nelma Kodama}}, and [[Raul Henrique Srour]].

Investigation at first focused on the four black-market currency dealers and improper payments to Alberto Youssef by companies who had won contracts at Petrobras' [[Abreu e Lima, Pernambuco|Abreu and Lima]] refinery. After they discovered that "[[wikt:doleiro|doleiro]]" (black-market dealer) Alberto Youssef had acquired a Range Rover Evoque for {{ILL|Paulo Roberto Costa|pt}}, a former director of Petrobras, the investigation expanded nationwide. Costa agreed after he was charged to provide evidence to the investigation.<ref>Kamm, T. (2015). Making sense of Brazil’s Lava Jato scandal. Brunswick Group, April.</ref> A newly adopted law introduced 'rewarded collaboration' ({{lang|pt|Colaboração premiada}}){{efn|name="Col-prem"}}{{efn |name="Del-prem"}} a type of plea bargaining involving sentence reductions for defendants who cooperate in investigations.

It also led to a wave of arrests. Fernando Soares, also known as "Fernando Baiano," a businessman and lobbyist, was allegedly the connection between major Brazilian construction firms and the government formed by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers’ Party]] (PT) and [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/executivo-revela-atuacao-de-operador-do-pmdb-na-andrade-gutierrez/ |title=Executivo revela atuação de operador do PMDB na Andrade Gutierrez |trans-title=Executive reveals PMDB operator performance at Andrade Gutierrez |work=Fausto Macedo|access-date=9 November 2018|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref name=ab1>{{cite news|title=In Brazil, lobbyist confirms payment of bribes to lower house speaker |date=26 April 2016 |access-date=24 November 2019 |url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/politica/noticia/2016-04/brazil-lobbyist-confirms-payment-bribes-lower-house-speaker |agency=Agência Brasil| author=Luciano Nacimento |publisher=EBC }}</ref> After Costa and Soares, many others agreed to collaborate with the prosecution and between 2014 and February 2016, the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)|Federal Public Prosecutor's Office]] ({{Lang-pt|Ministério Público da União|links=no}}) filed 37 criminal charges against 179 people, mostly politicians and businessmen.<ref name="Fausto 2017">Fausto, S.

Costa and Youssef entered into a plea bargain with prosecutors and the scope of the investigation widened to nine major Brazilian construction firms: [[Camargo Correa]], {{ill|Construtora OAS|pt}}, {{ill|UTC Engenharia|pt}}, [[Odebrecht]], {{ill|Mendes Júnior|pt}}, {{ill|Engevix|pt}}, {{ill|Queiroz Galvão|pt}}, {{ill|IESA Óleo e Gás|pt}}, and {{ill|Galvão Engenharia|pt}},
as well as politicians involved with Petrobras.

== Effect on Petrobras ==

Petrobras delayed reporting its annual financial results for 2014, and in April 2015 released "audited financial statements" showing $2.1 billion in bribes and a total of almost $17 billion in write-downs due to [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and overvalued [[asset]]s,<ref name="wsjbribeamt" /> which the company characterized as a "conservative" estimate. Had the report been delayed by another week, Petrobras [[bondholders]] would have had the right to demand early repayment. Petrobras also suspended [[dividend]] payments for 2015. Due in part to the impact of the scandal, as well as to its high debt burden and the low price of oil, Petrobras was also forced to cut [[Capital expenditure|capital expenditures]] and announced it would sell $13.7 billion in assets over the following two years.<ref name="wsjbribeamt">{{cite news|last1=Kiernan|first1=Paul|title=Brazil's Petrobras Reports Nearly $17 Billion in Asset and Corruption Charges|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-petrobras-reports-nearly-17-billion-impairment-on-assets-corruption-1429744336|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 April 2015}}</ref>

However, illegal communications between Car Wash prosecutors and its lead judge came to light in mid-2019, in which the parties suggested that their prosecutorial motive was to prevent Lula's re-election. There were calls to release the former president (see [[Operation Car Wash#Leaked conversations|Leaked conversations]] below).

=== Political parties ===
==== Lula and the Worker's Party ====

[[Emílio Odebrecht]] said in a written report to the [[Attorney General of Brazil]]'s Office (PGR) that he discussed donations to Worker's Party's (PT) campaigns with former PT president Lula.

He said that in the middle of 2010, at the end of the Lula administration, he knew that [[Dilma Rousseff]] was going to take over and that the balance of the account would be "managed by her at her request". Thus, he set apart a sum that would be destined exclusively for the former president. He said that Lula never asked directly for donations and that everything was done through Palocci, but it became clear that the donations were ultimately for the former president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/audio-marcelo-odebrecht-diz-moro-que-conta-amigo-referente-lula-comecou-com-40-milhoes-21197659|date=13 April 2017 | access-date = 13 April 2017|title=Audio: Marcelo Odebrecht tells Moro that he tells 'Amigo', referring to Lula, started with $ 40 million}}</ref><ref name="Veja">{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/politica/lula-pediu-a-debrecht-40-milhoes-de-dolares-em-propina/|work=Veja|access-date=14 April 2017|title=Lula asked Odebrecht for $40 million in tips|date=12 April 2017|author=Rodrigo Rangel and Daniel Pereira}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== Temer and Brazilian Democratic Movement ====

The plea bargain testimony by Odebrecht Engenharia Industrial's former president Márcio Faria da Silva said that on 15 July 2010, President Michel Temer led a meeting about an agreement to pay approximately US$40 million in bribes to the Brazilian Democratic Movement in exchange for contracts with the international Board of Directors of Petrobras. According to Faria, Temer, who at the time was a candidate for vice-president on Dilma Rousseff's ticket, delegated to [[Eduardo Cunha]] and [[Henrique Eduardo Alves]], then deputies and present at the meeting, the task of making the payments which represented 5% of the contract's value. The meeting took place in Temer's political office in [[São Paulo]]. He did not discuss any details about the financial agreement, limiting himself to trivial conversations about politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/temer-comandou-reuniao-de-acerto-de-propina-de-us-40-milhoes-afirma-delator/|publisher=Estadão|access-date=13 April 2017|title=Temer comandou reunião de acerto de propina de US$ 40 milhões, afirma delator |trans-title=Temer Ordered USD $40 Million Kickback Meeting, Says Whistleblower |author=Fábio Fabrini, Breno Pires e Carla Araújo, de Brasília|date=12 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.r7.com/brasil/temer-comandou-reuniao-que-acertou-propina-de-us-40-milhoes-da-odebrecht-diz-delator-13042017|publisher=R7|access-date=14 April 2017|title=Temer comandou reunião que acertou propina de US$ 40 milhões da Odebrecht, diz delator |trans-title=Temer Called Meeting That Paid USD $40 million Kickback from Odebrecht, Whistleblower Says |date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

==== Aécio and Brazilian Social Democracy Party ====

Marcelo Odebrecht said in his plea bargain testimony that the Social Democratid (PSDB) party, led by Senator [[Aécio Neves]] (PSDB-MG), received at least 50 million reals in exchange for favoring the business contractor in energy deals. He said that improper payments were made due to business deals with two state companies: [[Eletrobras Furnas|Furnas]] and [[CEMIG|Cemig]]. The first federal investigation was under the leadership of Dimas Toledo, an ally of Neves, in the early years of the Lula administration (2003–2005). The second state-run investigation was influenced by Aécio during the period when the PSDB was in power in [[Minas Gerais]] (2003–2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epocanegocios.globo.com/Brazil/noticias/2017/04/odebrecht-grupo-de-aecio-teria-recebido-r-50-milhoes-por-influencia-no-setor-eletrico.html|publisher=Globo.com|work=[[Época Negócios]]|access-date=13 April 2017|title=Odebrecht: Grupo de Aécio would have received R$ 50 million for influence in the electric sector }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/brazil/odebrecht-group-of-aecio-received-50-million-by-influence-in-sector-eletrico-1-21201378|publisher=Globo.com|work=O Globo | access-date = 13 April 2017|title=Odebrecht: Aécio group received R$ 50 million for influence in the electric sector|author=Thiago Herdy}}</ref>

=== Political families ===
Odebrecht also discussed family involvement. In eleven cases under the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Federal Court]] (STF), investigations implicate father and son, husband and wife, or siblings. The president of the Chamber, [[Rodrigo Maia]] (DEM-RJ), has the most family members implicated. Maia was charged in the same investigation as his father, councilor and former mayor [[Cesar Maia]]. According to the Odebrecht testimony, Rodrigo obtained cash resources both for his father's campaign and also for himself. The Brazilian Democratic Movement leader of the Senate, [[Renan Calheiros]] (AL), was charged along with his son, the governor of Alagoas [[Renan Filho]] (PMDB), in two inquiries. They allegedly participated in an agreement to divert resources from work on the Canal do Sertão and also received resources in the form of a [[slush fund]] they refer to as a ''[[caixa 2]]''. In the case of the father, two other inquiries are ongoing.{{Update inline|date=November 2019|reason=Update on the ongoing investigations}}

The governor of [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Robinson Faria]] (PSD), was charged along with his son, federal deputy [[Fábio Faria (politician)|Fábio Faria]] (PSD-RN). The two allegedly received contributions through a slush fund in return for defending Odebrecht Ambiental's interests in the area of basic sanitation in the state. The president of the PMDB, Senator [[Romero Jucá]] (RR), and his son Rodrigo Jucá both figured in one of the inquiries. The father helped Odebrecht negotiate a [[Provisional measure|provisional measure]] and obtained an electoral donation of 150,000 reals for his son. Romero Jucá was also charged in four other inquiries. A father asking for a contribution for a son was also why former minister [[José Dirceu]] was investigated along with {{ill|Zeca Dirceu|pt}}, federal deputy. The father was able to raise the money for Zeca in exchange for the acting for Odebrecht interests in the government.{{fact|date=September 2020}}

Senator [[Vanessa Grazziotin]] (PCdoB-AM) is accompanied by her husband, {{ILL|Eron Bezerra|pt}}, said to have asked for slush fund cash donations for her. Federal Deputy {{ill|Décio Nery de Lima|pt}} (PT-SC) also requested slush funds for the [[Blumenau]] municipal campaign in 2012 of his wife, state deputy Ana Paula Lima (PT-SC).

Marcelo Odebrecht detailed the payment of 100 million reals for the 2014 presidential campaign of Rousseff, requested by then-minister [[Guido Mantega]].<ref>Márcio Falcão and Livia Scocuglia (12 April 2017). «Negotiation of MP made Odebrecht donate$100 mi to Dilma» .

The informant detailed meetings with the politicians in his office and cash deliveries, always made in kind by messengers to hotel rooms or flats. Marcelo Odebrecht said he met with Silva a few times to handle the money for the parties that would join the coalition in 2014. The former Dilma minister allegedly instructed Alencar to directly seek party leaders to pass on the values.

On 9 June 2019, Greenwald and other journalists from [[investigative journalism]] magazine ''[[The Intercept Brasil]]'' started publishing several leaked chat messages exchanged via the [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] app between members of the Brazilian [[judiciary system]]. Some, including then Car Wash judge and former [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security (Brazil)|Minister of Justice]] [[Sérgio Moro]] and lead prosecutor [[Deltan Dallagnol]] are accused of violating legal procedure during the investigation, trial and arrest of former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] allegedly for the sake of preventing him to run for a third term in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]], among other crimes. Other news agencies, such as ''[[Folha de São Paulo]]'' and ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' confirmed the authenticity of the messages and worked in partnership with ''The Intercept Brasil'' to sort the rest of the material in their possession before releasing it.<ref>{{Cite web|language=fr|title=Brésil: des magistrats auraient conspiré pour empêcher le retour de Lula |trans-title=Brazil: Magistrates Alleged to have Conspired to Prevent Lula's Return |url=https://www.liberation.fr/depeches/2019/06/10/bresil-des-magistrats-auraient-conspire-pour-empecher-le-retour-de-lula_1732745|publisher=AFP / Libération|date=10 June 2019|access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|language=fr|title=Brésil: Les enquêteurs anticorruption auraient conspiré pour empêcher le retour au pouvoir de Lula |trans-title=Brazil: Anti-Corruption Investigators Conspired to Prevent Lula's Return to Power |url=https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/2536843-20190610-bresil-enqueteurs-anticorruption-conspire-empecher-retour-pouvoir-lula|publisher=20 Minutes|date=10 June 2019|access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/brazil-lula-convicted-2018-election-report-190610055731589.html | title=Brazil News: Brazil's Lula convicted to keep him from 2018 election: Report | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=10 June 2019 | accessdate=11 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/series/secret-brazil-archive/ |title=Secret Brazil Archive — An Investigative Series by The Intercept |website=The Intercept |language=en |access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/ | title=HIDDEN PLOT Exclusive: Brazil’s Top Prosecutors Who Indicted Lula Schemed in Secret Messages to Prevent His Party From Winning 2018 Election| publisher=The Intercept | date=9 June 2019 | accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/dallagnol-duvidas-triplex-lula-telegram-petrobras/ |title=‘ATÉ AGORA TENHO RECEIO’ Exclusivo: Deltan Dallagnol duvidava das provas contra Lula e de propina da Petrobras horas antes da denúncia do triplex |trans-title='Up Till Now, I've Been Afraid' Exclusive: Deltan Dallagnol doubted Petrobas Kickback Evidence Against Lula Horas Hours Before the Apartment Accusation |language=pt| publisher=The Intercept | date=9 June 2019 | accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/ | title=BREACH OF ETHICS Exclusive: Leaked Chats Between Brazilian Judge and Prosecutor Who Imprisoned Lula Reveal Prohibited Collaboration and Doubts Over Evidence| publisher=The Intercep | date=9 June 2019 | accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://revistaforum.com.br/politica/vaza-jato/veja-faz-parceria-com-the-intercept-e-folha-para-divulgar-conteudo-da-vaza-jato/| date=27 June 2019 |title=Veja faz parceria com The Intercept e Folha para divulgar conteúdo da Vaza Jato |trans-title=Veja partners with The Intercept and Folha to Disseminate Content of Car Wash Leaks |publisher=Revista Fórum }}</ref>

On 23 July, [[Brazilian Federal Police]] made public that they had arrested and were investigating a [[hacker]] from [[Araraquara]], Walter Delgatti Neto, for breaking into the authorities' Telegram accounts. Neto confessed to the hack and to having given the [[chat log]]s to Greenwald. Police said the attack had been perpetrated by abusing Telegram's phone number verification and exploiting vulnerabilities in [[voicemail]] technology in use in Brazil using a [[spoofing attack|spoofed]] phone number. The Intercept neither confirmed nor denied that Neto was their source and cited provisions for [[freedom of the press]] in the 1988 [[Brazilian Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Entenda o vazamento de diálogos da Lava-Jato  |trans-title=Understand the Operation Car Wash Leaked Document Dialogs |url=https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/entenda-o-vazamento-de-dialogos-da-lava-jato |website=www.nsctotal.com.br |publisher=NSCTotal |accessdate=13 August 2019 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

''The Guardian,'' reporting on retaliation against Greenwald from the Bolsonaro government and its supporters, said the articles published by Greenwald and ''The Intercept'' "have had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks," adding that the exposés "appeared to show prosecutors in the sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption inquiry colluding with Sérgio Moro, the judge who became a hero in Brazil for jailing powerful businessmen, middlemen and politicians."<ref>{{cite news |title=Outcry after reports Brazil plans to investigate Glenn Greenwald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-glenn-greenwald-investigation-outcry-bar-association-journalists |work=The Guardian |date=3 July 2019}}</ref>

In response to the leaks, several top jurisprudence authorities and experts in Europe and the Americas, such as [[Susan Rose-Ackerman]] (praised by Car Wash prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol as the world's top corruption expert), [[Bruce Ackerman]], and Luigi Ferrajoli, voiced their shock at the conduct of the Brazilian authorities and described former President Lula as a political prisoner, calling for his release.<ref name=carta>{{cite website|url=https://www.cartacapital.com.br/justica/jurista-americana-admirada-por-dallagnol-defende-libertacao-de-lula/|title=Jurista americana admirada por Dallagnol defende libertação de Lula |trans-title=American lawyer Admired by Dallagnol Advocates for Lula's Release |website=Carta Capital|date=12 August 2019 |quote=Jurist Susan Rose-Ackerman, Professor of Jurisprudence at Yale University, expressed support for the release of former President Lula, who has been imprisoned since April 2018 for his role in Operation Car Wash. The American, who is considered one of the world's leading anti-corruption experts, has signed a letter along with 16 other jurists calling for the Supreme Court to release the former president and set aside the verdict.<br/>One oddity: Susan Rose-Ackerman was previously praised by prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, the coordinator of Car Wash investigations. The head of the task force in Curitiba had already recommended that the jurist be interviewed, introducing the professor in social networks as 'the world's biggest expert in political corruption'.<br/>Susan and the other lawyers, all from international universities, say the revelations in the messages exchanged between Dallagnol and Sérgio Moro, who was responsible for the charges against Lula, 'were appalling to all legal professionals.'{{thin space}}}}</ref><ref name=choc />

== Legal aspects in 2019 ==
The decision against [[Aldemir Bendine]] was annulled by the Supreme Federal Court<ref name=SUSP1>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/supremo-anula-decisao-de-moro-em-condenacao-da-lava-jato.shtml|title=Supremo anula pela primeira vez condenação imposta por Moro na Lava Jato  |trans-title=Supreme Court for First Time Annuls a Conviction Imposed by Moro in Operation Car Wash |publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]| date=27 August 2019 |language=pt|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref> due to objections to the trial procedure.

== Winding down ==
As of September 2020, there were fears that political forces were about to bring an end to Operation Car Wash, according to prosecutors in Brazil.  Chief prosectuor Deltan Dallagnol said, "Today there is a very strong alignment of political forces against the Lava Jato operation. Much more than [just] an operation, the Brazilian effort against corruption itself is at risk."  One of the reasons Jair Bolsonaro was elected president in 2018, was because of his promises to attack corruption, but since he and his family members became embroiled, he has cooled on it. Bolsonaro's attorney general [[Augusto Aras]] complained that the investigations went too far, and were biased politically, and campaigned against it, gaining support from Bolsonaro family members such as son Flavio who was caught up in it. Dallagnol claimed that the slow down and efforts to stop the investigations were because the investigations were getting close to revealing corruption at the highest levels. Other branches of government also oppose the investigations, including Congress and the Supreme Court, which have been targets, as well as political parties.  Analysts see a concerted effort to back down from aggressive anti-corruption efforts in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web |lang=en |last1=Harris |first1=Bryan |title=Investigators fear the end is near for Brazil’s Lava Jato probe |location=Sao Paulo|url=https://app.ft.com/content/8f79871f-9dc4-4a97-9b26-79a7a9c2bf32?sectionid=world |date=16 August 2020 |website=Financial Times |url-access=subscription |accessdate=14 September 2020}}</ref>

== Dramatizations ==
There are two dramatizations of Operation Car Wash. One is the 2017 film ''[[Polícia Federal: A Lei É para Todos]]'' (''Federal Police: The Law Is for Everyone''), directed by Marcelo Antunez (2017), and the other is the Netflix series ''[[The Mechanism (TV series)|The Mechanism]]''. The Netfllix documentary and [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominee [[The Edge of Democracy]], by [[Petra Costa]] (2019), about the political crisis between 2016 and the election of [[Jair Bolsonaro]], in 2018, has Operation Car Wash as an important element as well.
