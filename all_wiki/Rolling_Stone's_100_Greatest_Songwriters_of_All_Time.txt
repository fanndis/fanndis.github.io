==Reception==
The list received mixed response from fellow publications. Writing for ''[[Flavorwire]]'', Judy Berman criticized the selection of the songwriters, saying "Predictably, it's over 70% white and features only nine solo female songwriters (five other women are included as part of mixed-gender writing teams). Classic rock is overrepresented; every other genre and subgenre of popular music is underrepresented."<ref name="flavorwire">{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/532955/does-rolling-stone-know-it-declared-songwriting-dead|work=[[Flavorwire]]|title=Does ‘Rolling Stone’ Know It Declared Songwriting Dead?|first=Judy |last=Berman|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}</ref> Geeta Dayal from ''[[The Guardian]]'' accused "corporate sponsorship" in determining the list's content.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/24/rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-list-corporate-sponsorship-apple-music|title=The real peril in Rolling Stone's greatest songwriters wasn't the lack of diversity – it was the corporate sponsorship|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Geeta|last=Dayal|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}</ref> Tom Moon from [[NPR]] wrote that "This list represents another trip through the hagiographic, hermetically sealed [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|rock hall of fame]], with the same stars you've been reading about in Rolling Stone since the dinosaur age."<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/08/24/433206610/the-one-real-problem-with-rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-of-all-time|first=Tom|last=Moon|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=The One Real Problem With Rolling Stone's 'Greatest Songwriters Of All Time'|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' editor Martin Chilton responded with a list of 100 best songwriters neglected by ''Rolling Stone'', including [[Cole Porter]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Kate Bush]], and [[Ray Charles]].<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/100-great-songwriters/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=100 great songwriters not in the Rolling Stone list|date=May 17, 2016|first=Martin|last=Chilton|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}</ref>
