== Concept and themes ==
{{quote box
| quote = We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families — as well as the news, the [[Super Bowl]], the [[Olympics]], the [[White House]] and the [[Grammys]] — and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race. And I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes.

[[Melina Matsoukas]], the director of the "[[Formation (song)|Formation]]" music video, said that Beyoncé explained to her the concept behind ''Lemonade'', stating: "She wanted to show the historical impact of [[slavery]] on black love, and what it has done to the black family, and black men and women—how we're almost socialized not to be together."<ref name=":272">{{cite web|last=Okeowo|first=Alexis|date=February 27, 2017|title=The Provocateur Behind Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Issa Rae|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/the-provocateur-behind-beyonce-rihanna-and-issa-rae|access-date=February 18, 2017|website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Beyoncé wrote on this in a 2018 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' article about the "generational curses" in her family, explaining that she comes "from a lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust", including a slave owner who married a slave.

Miriam Bale for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called ''Lemonade'' "a revolutionary work of [[Black feminism]]" as "a movie made by a black woman, starring Black women, and for Black women", in which Beyoncé is seen gathering, uniting and leading Black women throughout the film.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-25|title=Beyonce's 'Lemonade' Is a Revolutionary Work of Black Feminism: Critic's Notebook|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7341839/beyonce-lemonade-black-feminism|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Billboard}}</ref> As well as relating the story of Beyoncé's relationship with her husband, ''Lemonade'' also chronicles the relationship between Black women and American society.

"Don't Hurt Yourself" contains a quote from [[Malcolm X]] in which he said "The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman.

To create ''Lemonade'', Beyoncé drew from the work of a wide variety of Black women who are often overlooked or forgotten. The music draws inspiration from Black female [[blues]] musicians such as Shug Avery, [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], who also used their personal trauma to empower Black women, as well as samples songs originally recorded by Black women, namely [[Memphis Minnie]] and [[Dionne Warwick]], but whose most famous recordings are by male or white artists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Close To Home: A Conversation About Beyoncé's 'Lemonade'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/04/26/475629479/close-to-home-a-conversation-about-beyonc-s-lemonade|access-date=2020-06-09|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Steven J.|title=Breaking Down Beyoncé's Lemonade Samples|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1116-breaking-down-beyonces-lemonade-samples/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> The visuals drew inspiration from works by Black feminists such as [[Julie Dash]]'s ''[[Daughters of the Dust|Daughters Of The Dust]]'', [[Alice Walker]]'s ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|In Search Of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'', and [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[The Bluest Eye]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaines|first=Zeffie|date=2017|title=A Black Girl's Song Misogynoir, Love, and Beyoncé's Lemonade|url=https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&context=taboo|journal=Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education}}</ref> Other influences for ''Lemonade'' include literary work by Black women focusing on themes including [[African American folklore|African-American folklore]] (such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]])'' and [[Afrofuturism]] (such as [[Octavia E.

=== African-American history and culture ===
Beyoncé also uses ''Lemonade'' as a form of recognition, commemoration and celebration of the culture and history of Black people in the [[Deep South]] and in the United States as a whole. The film contains allusions to slavery, such as the [[House of Slaves]]' Door of No Return in Senegal and the dungeons of [[Elmina Castle]] in Ghana, where slaves were taken before being shipped to the Americas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ch. 5 – Emptiness (6 Inch) – Dissect|url=https://dissectpodcast.com/2020/05/11/chapter-5-emptiness-6-inch/|access-date=2020-06-02|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-29|title=What Beyoncé teaches us about the African diaspora in 'Lemonade'|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/what-beyonce-teaches-us-about-the-african-diaspora-in-lemonade|access-date=2020-04-18|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-us}}</ref> In "[[Love Drought]]", Beyoncé walks with her dancers into the sea, alluding to the [[Igbo Landing]] of 1803, where [[Igbo people|Igbo]] slaves took control of their slave ship, and rather than submit to slavery, marched into the sea while singing in [[Igbo language|Igbo]], drowning themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beyoncé's "Love Drought" Video, Slavery and the Story of Igbo Landing|url=https://www.q-zine.org/non-fiction/beyonces-love-drought-video-slavery-and-the-story-of-igbo-landing/|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref> Beyoncé appears wearing a [[tignon]], in reference to Louisiana's tignon laws implemented in 1786 that limited African-American women's dress in order to maintain the state's racist social hierarchies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Okwodu|first=Janelle|title=Beyoncé Just Released the Most Stylish 600-Page Coffee Table Book|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-how-to-make-lemonade-vogue-exclusive|access-date=2020-04-18|website=Vogue|language=en}}</ref> The film also contains references to [[Traditional African religions|African religion and spirituality]], such as [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] [[Ori (Yoruba)|ori]] body paint in "Sorry", allusions to the [[loa]] [[Erzulie]] Red-Eyes in "Don't Hurt Yourself", and Beyoncé's initiation into the [[Santería]] religion and embodiment of the Yoruba [[orisha]] [[Oshun]] in "Hold Up".<ref name=":26">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1102593084|title=The Lemonade reader : Beyoncé, black feminism and spirituality|others=Brooks, Kinitra Dechaun., Martin, Kameelah L., 1978-|isbn=978-0-429-48745-3|location=London|oclc=1102593084}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Beyoncé's Lemonade Is Black Woman Magic|url=https://time.com/4306316/beyonce-lemonade-black-woman-magic/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Time|language=en}}</ref> Allusions to [[Culture of New Orleans|New Orleans culture]] include "Queen of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole cuisine]]" [[Leah Chase]], the [[Edna Karr High School|Edna Karr]] Marching Band, [[jazz funeral]]s, [[Mardi Gras Indians]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]].<ref name=":262">{{Cite web|date=2016-04-27|title=Lemonade: The hidden meanings buried in Beyoncé's visual album|url=https://www.factmag.com/2016/04/27/lemonade-beyonce-meaning-visual-album/|access-date=2020-04-18|website=FACT Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>

Beyoncé is seen with other Black women on [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantations]] in ''Lemonade''. In the "[[Formation (song)|Formation]]" video, the walls of the plantation houses are covered with [[French Renaissance|French Renaissance-]]<nowiki/>style portraits of Black subjects; director [[Melina Matsoukas]] states that "films about slavery traditionally feature white people in these roles of power and position. I wanted to turn those images on their head."<ref name=":272" /> Towards the end of ''Lemonade'', Beyoncé and several Black women are on a plantation, with Chris Kelly for ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' writing "Instead of an antebellum memory, these scenes portray a dream: the fantasy of an all-Black, matriarchal utopia when women dress up, prepare meals, take photographs and perform shows, not for a master but for themselves."<ref name=":262" /> Throughout the film, Beyoncé can be seen in [[Fort Macomb]], a [[Confederate States Army]] stronghold that was taken over by one of the first all-Black [[Union Army]] units - the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|1st Louisiana Native Guard]] - and eventually destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Collection|first=Nick Weldon {{!}} The Historic New Orleans|title=The story behind the haunting ruins of Fort Macomb, featured in 'True Detective,' Beyoncé's 'Lemonade,' and more|url=https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/article_0849cf44-bf63-5c00-b2aa-20617c223d0f.html|access-date=2020-06-02|website=NOLA.com|language=en}}</ref> On the central track "Daddy Lessons", Beyoncé is seen standing in a hideaway in the fort, alluding to the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=":262" /> However, on the closer "All Night", Beyoncé is seen above ground, walking on top of the ruins of the fort in an [[Antebellum South|antebellum]]-style dress made in [[West Africa]]n material, possibly inspired by artist [[Yinka Shonibare]] who is known for reappropriating "European import — the cloth — to remake symbols of European cultural dominance in the spirit of Africa".<ref>{{Cite web|first=S.

On "[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyoncé song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]", Beyoncé samples [[Led Zeppelin]]’s "[[When the Levee Breaks]]". However, the classic rock song was originally written by black [[Delta blues]] artists [[Kansas Joe McCoy]] and [[Memphis Minnie]], with the song referring to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] which displaced hundreds of thousands of African Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-05|title=The Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927|url=https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/collection/great-mississippi-river-flood-1927|access-date=2020-04-18|website=National Museum of African American History and Culture|language=en}}</ref> With the sample, Beyoncé reappropriates the song that was written by Black people about black history.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|date=2016-04-26|title=How Beyonce's 'Lemonade' Reclaims Rock's Black Female Legacy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-beyonces-lemonade-reclaims-rocks-black-female-legacy-67463/|access-date=2020-04-18|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US}}</ref> In general, Beyoncé also reappropriates genres that were influenced by African Americans that are now seen as predominantly white genres on ''Lemonade'', such as [[Rock music|rock]] in "Don't Hurt Yourself" and [[Country music|country]] in "Daddy Lessons".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Johanna|date=2017-12-22|title=Sound, Vision, and Embodied Performativity in Beyoncé Knowles' Visual Album Lemonade (2016)|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ejas/12415|journal=European Journal of American Studies|language=en|volume=12|issue=12–4|doi=10.4000/ejas.12415|issn=1991-9336|doi-access=free}}</ref>

I was served lemons, but I made lemonade", referencing the proverb "[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyoncé also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Deréon, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations.<ref name=":282"/>

The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' is a [[still frame]] from the music video for "[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyoncé song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]" and features Beyoncé wearing [[cornrows]] and a fur coat, leaning against a [[minivan]] and covering her face with her arm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10pOVWHrWck|title=Beyoncé ft Jack White – Don't Hurt Yourself ( Official Music Video ) Pre Promo|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref>

''Lemonade'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]] and is also the most critically acclaimed studio album of Beyoncé's career to date. In ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', [[Greg Tate]] calls ''Lemonade'' "a triumph of marketing and musicality, spectacle and song, vision and collaboration, [[Assimilation (Star Trek)|Borg-like assimilation]], and — as of 2013 — the element of [[Surprise album|surprise]]". Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes "Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey’s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions.

In a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' "a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us", describing it as an "album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game". Sheffield writes "''Lemonade'' is her most emotionally extreme music, but also her most sonically adventurous... Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey’s voice", which is described as "her wildest, rawest vocals ever". Sheffield also compares ''Lemonade'' to [[Aretha Franklin]]’s ''[[Spirit in the Dark]]'' and [[Nina Simone]]’s ''[[Silk & Soul|Silk and Soul]]'' in the way that the album "reach[es] out historically, connecting her personal pain to the trauma of American blackness".<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|title=Lemonade|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Rob|last=Sheffield|author-link=Rob Sheffield|date=April 25, 2016|access-date=April 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531061410/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|archive-date=May 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Ray Rahman for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' agrees, writing that ''Lemonade'' is "a raw and intensely personal plunge into the heart of marital darkness" as well as "a feminist blueprint, a tribute to women, African-Americans, and, especially, African-American women". Rahman further praises the diversity of the album: "[Beyoncé] can do [[Rock music|rock]], [[blues]], [[Country music|country]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], whatever. ''Lemonade'' stands as Bey’s most diverse album to date. Sinister strip-club-in-the-future [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]... sits right next to a slab of Texas twang. [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Soulja Boy]] become bedfellows."<ref name="Entertainment Weekly" />

[[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the album "feels like a success" and that Beyoncé sounded "genuinely imperious". Petridis praises the musical arc of the album, commenting on how the music "slowly works itself up into a righteous frenzy of anger, shifting from the becalmed misery of opener "[[Pray You Catch Me]]" via the sparse simmer of "[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]"... before finally boiling over on the fantastic "[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyoncé song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]": a ferocious, distorted vocal as commanding as anything she’s recorded".<ref name="guardian" /> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writer Jonathan Bernstein felt it was her strongest work to date and "proves there's a thin line between love and hate."<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|title=Lemonade is Beyoncé at her most profane, political and personal&nbsp;— review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/lemonade-is-beyonc-at-her-most-profane-political-and-personal/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=April 24, 2016|access-date=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Nekesa Moody and Mohamad Soliman from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the album a "deeply personal, yet ... a bold social and political statement as well".<ref name="twp">{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Nekesa|title=Review: Beyoncé again proves to be center of pop universe|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/review-beyonce-again-proves-to-be-center-of-pop-universe/2016/04/24/5caaf9ce-0a2f-11e6-bc53-db634ca94a2a_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 24, 2016|access-date=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jon Pareles]] praised Beyoncé's vocals and her courage to talk about subjects that affect so many people, and noted that "the album is not beholden to radio formats or presold by a single".<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Review: Beyoncé Makes 'Lemonade' Out of Marital Strife|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/arts/music/beyonce-lemonade.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 24, 2016|access-date=April 24, 2016}}</ref> [[Greg Kot]] from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' felt that "artistic advances" seem "slight" in context towards the record's "more personal, raw and relatable" aspects, where it came out as a "clearly conceived" piece of music, meaning it had a "unifying vision" for what may have lent itself to being "a prettily packaged hodgepodge".<ref name="Chicago Tribune" />

Separated from the visual, the album itself acts as dexterously as the film, exposing the rawest elements of Beyoncé’s personal life while framing it against the universal — the machinations of internal paranoia, the all-consuming well of fury and anger, and the bottomless depths of sadness." Julious continues by praising the [[song cycle]] nature of the album: "Taken as a whole, we hear the threads of this from song to song on the record. If ''Lemonade'' is a record about dismantling the cycles of abuse, ripping open the secrets we keep hidden (especially within the closely guarded black community), and finding healing, purpose, and even greatness in the process, then it is personified in the arcs of each track... The songs stand as joined entities, two dichotomous halves of the grief process".<ref name="Consequence of Sound" /> [[PopMatters]] writer Evan Sawdey felt few albums could ever be considered "as bold, complex, or resolute as ''Lemonade'',"<ref name="PopMatters" /> and the [[BBC]]'s Mark Savage, describing ''Lemonade'' as "an album with a complex narrative arc... that demands to be heard in one sitting", noted that Beyoncé had become an albums artist with a range extending beyond that of radio play.<ref name="Albums artist.">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36160506|title=How Beyonce became an 'albums artist' – and what radio is doing about it|publisher=BBC|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>

''Lemonade'' won a [[Peabody Award]] in Entertainment, along with the following description by the board of jurors:<ref>Blanchard, Margaret,
 [http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/entertainment-winners-named-for-peabody-30 "Entertainment winners named for Peabody 30"], Peabody, April 20, 2017.</ref><blockquote>Adroitly bringing together stories about betrayal, renewal, and hope, ''Lemonade'' draws from the prolific [[African-American literature|literary]], [[Black music|musical]], [[Black film|cinematic]], and [[African-American art|aesthetic]] sensibilities of black cultural producers to create a rich tapestry of poetic innovation. Defying genre and convention, ''Lemonade'' immerses viewers in the sublime worlds of [[black women]], family, and community where we experience poignant and compelling stories about the lives of [[women of color]] and the bonds of friendship seldom seen or heard in American [[popular culture]]. This innovative and stunningly beautiful masterpiece challenges us to readjust our visual and sonic antennae and invites a reckoning with taken for granted ideas about who we are. For the audacity of its reach and the fierceness of its vision in challenging our cultural imagination about the intimacies and complexities of women of color, we recognize ''Lemonade'' as a [[Peabody Award]] winner.
