==History==

=== Founding ===
In 1951, after her father died, [[Felice Schwartz]] joined her brother Theodore Nierenberg to help turn around their father's failing business. Married and a mother, Schwartz worked as the vice president of production until they sold the business for a small profit three-and-a-half years later.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |last1=Reimer |first1=Gail Twersky |title=Felice Nierenberg Schwartz |website=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=Jewish Women’s Archive |date=March 20, 2009 |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schwartz-felice-nierenberg |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-date=September 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915121812/https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Schwartz-Felice-Nierenberg |url-status=live }}</ref> The experiences Schwartz gained while working and raising a family spurred her to found Catalyst in 1962 with the stated mission, “to bring to our country’s needs the unused abilities of intelligent women who want to combine work and family.”<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

=== The Early Years: 1960s ===
The 1960s saw Catalyst focused on promoting [[Job sharing|job-sharing]] programs and collecting and disseminating information to women who were interested in pursuing a career.

In 1966, Catalyst partnered with the [[Massachusetts]] Department of Public Welfare to launch a pilot job-sharing program for women. Twenty-five jobs as a [[Social work|welfare case worker]] were opened for 50 women. In 1971, ''Part-Time Social Workers in Public Welfare''<ref>{{cite book |title=Part-time Social Workers in Public Welfare: A Report on a Catalyst Demonstration Project in Boston, Mass. in Which Mature Women College Graduates were Employed Half-time by the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare |date=1971 |publisher=Catalyst |location=Boston, MA}}</ref> was published showing that the 50 part-time women were 89% as productive as full-time case workers and had one-third as much [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] as full-time case workers.

=== The 1970s & 1980s ===
As more women entered the workforce, Catalyst shifted its focus to topics such as dual career families, [[child care]] and women on corporate boards. Catalyst branched out from the [[public sector]] into the [[private sector]], gaining corporate supporters.

Schwartz became a more prominent voice in the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]]. She authored numerous articles, was interviewed by the media and co-authored her first book, ''How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against It, Your Children Aren’t Old Enough, and There’s Nothing You Can Do Anyhow'', along with her Catalyst colleagues Margaret H. Schifter and Susan S. Gillotti.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Go to Work When Your Husband is Against It, Your Children Aren't Old Enough, and There's Nothing You Can Do Anyhow|url=https://archive.org/details/howtogotoworkwhe00feli|url-access=registration|last1=Schwartz|first1=Felice N.|last2=Schifter|first2=Margaret H.|last3=Gillotti|first3=Susan S.|date=|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> She launched the Catalyst Awards to recognize women board directors.<ref name=":1" /> And, Catalyst established the Corporate Child Care Resource to monitor child care activities around the country and report on best practices.<ref name=":1" />

=== The Mommy Track Controversy ===
Schwartz was a prolific writer but is most known for her 1989 article, ''Management Women and the New Facts of Life''<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Felice N.|date=January–February 1989|title=Management Women and the New Facts of Life|url=https://hbr.org/1989/01/management-women-and-the-new-facts-of-life|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|via=|access-date=2018-11-14|archive-date=2018-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115071224/https://hbr.org/1989/01/management-women-and-the-new-facts-of-life|url-status=live}}</ref> published in ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''. Schwartz sparked a national debate by stating that “the cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,” and suggesting that employers create two tracks for women, one for the career focused and one for the family focused.<ref name=":6">{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Tony |title=Life/Work – Issue 30 |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/38490/life-work-issue-30 |work=Fast Company |date=November 30, 1999 |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-date=November 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115112905/https://www.fastcompany.com/38490/life-work-issue-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In response to Schwartz's article, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published ''<nowiki/>'Mommy Career Track' Sets Off a Furor,''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/us/mommy-career-track-sets-off-a-furor.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title='Mommy Career Track' Sets Off a Furor|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=March 8, 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-date=November 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012543/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/us/mommy-career-track-sets-off-a-furor.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|url-status=live}}</ref> and branded Schwartz as the “[[mommy track]]” creator. The ''Times'' article quoted prominent feminists who called the idea of two career paths “horrifying” and “damaging to women’s advancement.” Critics claimed the article validated the idea that women could have a family or a career but not both. Adding to the controversy was the lack of corroborating evidence for Schwartz's assertions. Her critics stated, <nowiki>''If this is such hot stuff, where's the documentation?''</nowiki><ref name=":5" />

Schwartz claimed that her article was misinterpreted, saying, "I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men. What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.'"<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=End of Line, No Regrets: ‘Mommy Track’ Essayist to Retire|last=Lewis|first=Diane E.|date=March 23, 1992|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=}}</ref>

In 1992, Schwartz published the book, ''Breaking with Tradition: Women and Work, The New Facts of Life,''<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Breaking With Tradition: Women and Work, the New Facts of Life|last=Schwartz|first=Felice N.|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|year=1992|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> a response and expansion of the "mommy track" idea.<ref name=":7" />

Ten years after the original article was published, Schwartz's son Tony revisited the debate and offered up some insights from the controversy. In his article, Tony Schwartz argues that his mother's idea of dividing women into two categories was misguided, but her argument that to retain women companies need to give them more flexibility to manage a career and family, was on point.<ref name=":6" />

=== The End of the Schwartz Era ===
After 31 years at the helm of Catalyst, Schwartz retired in 1993. She was in failing health and passed away in 1996 at the age of 71.<ref name=":2" /> Shortly thereafter, her final book was published, ''The Armchair Activist: Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Armchair Activist: Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right|last=Schwartz|first=Felice N.|last2=Levine|first2=Suzanne K.|publisher=Riverhead Books|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> co-authored with Suzanne K. Levine.

=== 1993 and Beyond ===
Since the Schwartz era and through its next three presidents, Catalyst expanded its offerings and geographic footprint.
In 1993, the Board appointed Sheila Wellington, a former secretary of [[Yale University]], to become the new president and CEO. As the leader of Catalyst, Wellington instituted more rigorous research standards, expanded Catalyst studies to include non-US geographies and women of color, and launched the annual ''Census of Women Board Directors,'' which became one of Catalyst's signature studies.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/media/sheila-wellington-leaves-catalyst-join-faculty-new-york-universitys-stern-school-business|title=Sheila Wellington Leaves Catalyst to Join the Faculty of New York University's Stern School of Business|last=|first=|date=2003|website=Catalyst press release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115153441/https://www.catalyst.org/media/sheila-wellington-leaves-catalyst-join-faculty-new-york-universitys-stern-school-business|archive-date=2018-11-15|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Wellington resigned in 2003 to accept a position at [[New York University]]'s [[New York University Stern School of Business|Leonard N. Stern School of Business]].<ref name=":8" />

In 2003, Ilene H. Lang assumed the role of president. Lang was a seasoned tech industry executive. She was the founding CEO of [[AltaVista|AltaVista Internet Software Inc.]], a First Light Capital [[Venture capital|venture]] partner, and a previous senior executive at [[Lotus Software|Lotus Development Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/media/former-tech-ceo-ilene-h-lang-takes-helm-catalyst|title=Former Tech CEO Ilene H.

During her tenure, Lang further expanded Catalyst globally, opening offices in Europe, India, Australia and Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auschwitzinstitute.org/board-advisers/ilene-lang/|title=International Advisory Board: Ilene H. Lang|last=|first=|date=|website=The Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115112843/http://www.auschwitzinstitute.org/board-advisers/ilene-lang/|archive-date=2018-11-15|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Lang stepped down, and Deborah Gillis was named President & CEO. A Canadian, Gillis was the first non-American President & CEO. Prior to joining Catalyst, she worked in the public sector for the governments of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Ontario]] and as a consultant for [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] and [[Grant Thornton International|Grant Thornton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catalyst.org/media/ilene-h-lang-step-down-catalyst-president-ceo-deborah-gillis-named-successor|title=Ilene Lang to Step Down as Catalyst President & CEO; Deborah Gillis Named as Successor|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2013|website=Catalyst press release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115071245/https://www.catalyst.org/media/ilene-h-lang-step-down-catalyst-president-ceo-deborah-gillis-named-successor|archive-date=November 15, 2018|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/canadas-deborah-gillis-named-new-catalyst-ceo/article14327846/|title=Canada’s Deborah Gillis Named New Catalyst CEO|last=McFarland|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2013|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=|archive-date=June 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620003820/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/canadas-deborah-gillis-named-new-catalyst-ceo/article14327846/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2018, Deborah Gillis stepped down to accept the position of President & CEO of the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH) Foundation, and Ilene H. Lang resumed her former leadership role as Catalyst's Interim President & CEO. In August 2018, [[Lorraine Hariton]] became President & CEO.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/camh-foundation-announces-global-non-profit-leader-deborah-gillis-as-president--ceo-672952683.html|title=CAMH Foundation Announces Global Non-Profit Leader Deborah Gillis as President & CEO|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2018|work=Centre for Addiction and Mental Health/News Wire Canada press release|access-date=|archive-date=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115112952/https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/camh-foundation-announces-global-non-profit-leader-deborah-gillis-as-president--ceo-672952683.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catalyst.org/who-we-are/our-people/executive-staff/ilene-h-lang|title=Executive Staff: Ilene H.

==Major Initiatives==

=== Catalyst CEO Champions For Change ===
Launched on [[International Women's Day]] in 2017, the ''Catalyst CEO Champions For Change'' initiative showcases commitments by CEOs to advancing all women, including [[women of color]], into more leadership positions in their companies and on their boards. To participate, Catalyst asks CEOs to publicly declare their support, take a pledge of organizational and personal commitments, and report their company's progress each year against established diversity metrics.<ref name=":3" /> The first report on the participating companies’ progress was released in November 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/champions/everyday-heroes-catalyst-ceo-champions-change|title=Everyday Heroes: Catalyst CEO Champions For Change|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Catalyst|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115153557/https://www.catalyst.org/champions/everyday-heroes-catalyst-ceo-champions-change|archive-date=2018-11-15|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Catalyst Awards ===
Originally begun in 1976 to celebrate individual women board members, the Catalyst Award shifted to recognizing individual organizations in 1987.<ref name=":1" /> Since then, the award has recognized corporations and the specific programs they've created to recruit, develop, and advance women. Company initiatives are evaluated on seven criteria: strategy and rationale, senior leadership activities, accountability and transparency, communication, employee engagement, innovation, and measurable results.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/apply-catalyst-award-0|title=Apply for the Catalyst Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Catalyst|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115120622/https://www.catalyst.org/apply-catalyst-award-0|archive-date=2018-11-15|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Catalyst has recognized 94 initiatives at 85 organizations from around the world since 1987.

To be considered for the award, companies must submit an application. For each applicant, the Catalyst Award Evaluation Committee conducts research and phone interviews before narrowing the field to a few organizations. For the selected companies, the Committee conducts further research via onsite visits. The Committee and Catalyst executive leadership determine the winners.<ref name=":9" />

Initiatives are publicly celebrated at the annual Catalyst Awards Conference and Dinner held in New York City. The 2018 awards dinner had more than 2,000 attendees, including executives from global corporations, professional firms, governments, NGOs, and educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catalyst.org/media/2018-catalyst-award-winners-boston-consulting-group-ibm-nationwide-and-northrop-grumman|title=2018 Catalyst Award Winners: The Boston Consulting Group, IBM, Nationwide, and Northrop Grumman Corporation|last=|first=|date=January 18, 2018|website=Catalyst press release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903103011/http://www.catalyst.org/media/2018-catalyst-award-winners-boston-consulting-group-ibm-nationwide-and-northrop-grumman|archive-date=September 3, 2018|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>
