==History==

A succession of public libraries, known by a variety of names, served the people of Nashville. The early libraries were generally small, offered a narrow range of services, and operated on a fee schedule. In 1897, the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] authorized cities of a certain size to establish and maintain free public libraries and reading rooms. With this authority, in 1901 the Howard Library became Nashvilleâ€™s first free circulating library. Also in 1901, [[Andrew Carnegie]] offered to donate $100,000 for a new library building if the city would take care of its maintenance. The city accepted those terms, and in 1904, the [[Carnegie Library]] Building was completed on Polk Avenue. Andrew Carnegie enabled the building and opening of an additional three branches between 1912 and 1919. Two of those buildings are still in use today, the North Branch and the East Branch.

The Carnegie Library Building was razed and replaced with the Ben West Public Library in 1963. The Main Library was housed in the [[Ben West]] building for 38 years.<ref name="Library History">{{cite web|title=Library History|url=http://www.library.nashville.org/about/abt_libhistory.asp|publisher=Nashville Public Library|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref>

The new Main Library Building, designed by [[Robert A.M. Stern Architects]], was opened in 2001.<ref name="Library Architecture">{{cite web|title=Library Architecture|url=http://www.library.nashville.org/artgallery/art_libraryartarchitecture.asp|publisher=Nashville Public Library|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref> Previously on the site for the Main Library was a downtown shopping mall called [[Church Street Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadmalls.com/malls/church_street_center.html |title=Church Street Center |publisher=deadmalls.com |date=2005-12-03 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>
