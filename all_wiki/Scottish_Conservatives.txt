The '''Scottish Conservatives''' ({{lang-gd|Pàrtaidh Tòraidheach na h-Alba}}), officially the '''Scottish Conservative & Unionist Party''', is a centre-right political party in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scottish Conservatives|url=https://www.scottishconservatives.com/what-we-stand-for/ |title=What we stand for |publisher=Conservatives in Scotland|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> It is the second-largest party in the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[local government in Scotland|Scottish local government]]. The party has the second largest number of Scottish MPs in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

The Leader of the party is [[Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)|Douglas Ross]].
He replaced [[Jackson Carlaw]] who briefly served from February to July 2020, taking over from [[Ruth Davidson]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]], who held the post from [[2011 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|2011]] to 2019.

In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]], the party increased its number of MPs to 13 on 28.6 per cent of the popular vote – its best performance since 1983 and in terms of votes since 1979 - but it fell back to six Westminster seats in [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]]. In the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 election for the Scottish Parliament]] the Scottish Conservatives gained 16 seats, making it the largest opposition party, with 31 of 129 seats.

==History==
===Scottish Conservatism pre-1912===

Prior to 1912, the Conservative Party organised in Scotland. With the emergence of mass party political organisations in the second half of the 19th century, distinct organisations emerged in Scotland. The voluntary party organisation, the National Union of Conservative Associations for Scotland (mirroring the [[National Union of Conservative Associations]]), emerged in 1882, organising a distinct Conservative conference in Scotland.<ref>James Kellas, The Scottish Political System, p. 115</ref>

A previous organisation, the Scottish National Constitutional Association, existed from 1867, with the patronage of UK party leader [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. [[The Scotsman]] newspaper reported that following the 1874 election "[[Association of Conservative Clubs|Conservative Clubs]] and Working Men's Conservative Associations have spring up like mushrooms in all parts of [Scotland]".<ref>S Ball and I Holliday (eds), Catriona Burness, Mass Conservativism: The Conservatives and the Public Since the 1880s, pp.18-19</ref>

From the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]] until 1918, the [[Scottish Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] was the dominant political force in Scotland, operating in a largely two-party system with the Scottish Conservatives. In 1886, the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] had broken away from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to [[William Gladstone]]'s proposals for [[Irish Home Rule]]. Joint Liberal Unionist and Conservative candidates were run across the United Kingdom, but with the organisations of these parties remaining separate.

===The Unionist Party (1912–1965)===
{{main|Unionist Party (Scotland)}}

Following the merger of the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists to create the modern [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] in England and Wales, a committee was formed of the National Union of Conservative Associations for Scotland and regional Liberal Unionist associations which recommended a merger in Scotland. This was agreed in December 1912, creating the Scottish Unionist Association and the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]].<ref>D. Torrance, Whatever Happened to Tory Scotland, p. 3-5</ref>

From 1918 and through the 1920s, the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] became more prominent, displacing the Liberals as one of the two main parties in Scottish politics. The Unionist Party had a number of electoral successes, topping the poll in Scotland in a number of elections from the 1930s to 1950s. During the period of its existence, the Unionist Party produced two Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom - [[Bonar Law]] and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] - and uniquely among parties in the post-war period, achieved more than half of the popular vote within Scotland in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]]. The majority of the vote achieved in these two General Elections was combined with the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal Party]] who later merged with the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] in 1968 alongside the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] which had already merged into the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] in 1965.

While taking the Conservative [[whip (politics)|whip]] in the [[House of Commons]], the Unionist Party had a lengthy "unionist-nationalist" tradition, emphasising its Scottish identity within the United Kingdom and the [[British Empire]]. This was represented by elected members such as [[John Buchan]] (who said "I believe every Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalist") <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsindependent.org/features/quotations/quotations_1.htm |title=''Scots Independent'' — Features — Scottish quotations |publisher=Scotsindependent.org |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107024554/http://www.scotsindependent.org/features/quotations/quotations_1.htm |archivedate=7 November 2010}}</ref> and those former Unionists who in 1932 founded the pro-[[home rule]] [[Scottish Party]] (which later merged with the [[National Party of Scotland]] to form the Scottish National Party).

===Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party===
Following a decline in performance, coming second to the Labour Party at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]] and [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], the Unionist Party proposed a number of reforms which involved amalgamation with the Conservative and Unionist Party in England and Wales - taking place in 1965. The modern Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, as part of the wider UK Conservative Party, came into existence from this point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brian Monteith: Time for a Unionist Party?|publisher=The Scotsman|date=4 January 2015|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/brian-monteith-time-for-a-unionist-party-1-3650715|first=Brian|last=Monteith}}</ref>

However its electoral fortunes continued to decline throughout the 1960s. Following [[Harold Wilson]]'s failure to obtain a Labour majority in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], a second general election was held in October of the same year which saw the party decline to below 25% of the vote and drop from 21 seats to 16. At the same time, the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] were to gain an unprecedented 11 MPs, unseating a number of Conservative MPs in rural constituencies.

The party's fortunes recovered somewhat in 1979 under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], but her tenure as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] was to see the party's fortunes drop further from holding 22 seats in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] to 10 in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]. The party increased its share of the vote and number of MPs to 11 in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] under [[John Major]]'s leadership before dropping to 17.5% of the popular vote and failing to have any MPs returned from Scotland in 1997. It continued to return only a single MP from Scottish constituencies at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] and [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] general elections, before winning 13 seats in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].

Following the 2010 general election performance, the party commissioned a review under [[Charles Sanderson, Baron Sanderson of Bowden|Lord Sanderson of Bowden]] to consider the party's future organisation. The Sanderson Commission's report recommended a single Scottish leader (replacing a leader of the Scottish Parliamentary group), reforms to governance and constituency structures, the creation of regional campaigning centres, greater focus on policy development and a new membership and fundraising drive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_11_10_toryreport.pdf|title=Building for Scotland|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Scottish devolution===
[[File:Scottish Conservatives 2001 logo.svg|thumb|Former logo of the Scottish Conservatives, used until 2006]]
The party's commitments to a devolved Scottish Assembly were to decline under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. Previously the party had offered some support for a [[Scottish Assembly]], including in the so-called [[Declaration of Perth]] in 1968 under UK party leader [[Edward Heath]]. John Major, while endorsing further powers for the [[Scottish Grand Committee]] and the [[Scottish Office]] did not support a devolved parliament. With the Labour Party's victory in 1997, referendums on devolution were organised in Scotland and Wales, both receiving agreement that devolved legislatures should be formed.

In 1999, the first elections to a devolved Scottish Parliament were held. Following the Conservatives electoral wipe-out in Scotland in 1997, devolution provided the party with a number of parliamentary representatives in Scotland. Less than a year following the first Scottish Parliament election, a [[2000 Ayr by-election|2000 by-election]] was held in the [[Ayr (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Ayr]] constituency with [[John Scott (Scottish politician)|John Scott]] winning the seat from Labour.

In the party leadership elections in 2011, the previous deputy leader [[Murdo Fraser]] proposed disbanding the party and creating a new Scottish party of the centre-right, similar to the previous Unionist Party and compared this arrangement to the relationship between the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] in Germany. The move was opposed by the other three candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garnett|first=Mark|title=The Conservatives in Crisis The Tories After 1997|url=https://archive.org/details/conservativescri1997mark|url-access=limited|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|page=[https://archive.org/details/conservativescri1997mark/page/n178 168]|author2=Phillip Lynch }}</ref><ref>[http://ww1.sundayherald.com/49903 ''Sunday Herald'']{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> Victory went to the newly elected MSP Ruth Davidson who suggested that she would oppose further devolution beyond the new powers proposed by the [[Calman Commission]].

The party was one of the three main Scottish political parties to join together in the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign opposing Scotland becoming independent in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]]. Although a Conservative majority government was returned in Westminster in the 2015 general election, [[David Mundell]] remained their only MP elected in Scotland and was appointed [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. He replaced [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] incumbents who served during the [[First Cameron ministry|2010-15 Coalition government]]. The UK Government set about implementing the recommendations of the cross-party [[Smith Commission]].

===Recent elections===
====2011 Scottish Parliament election====
[[Annabel Goldie]] led the party into the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], having successfully campaigned in budget negotiations with the minority SNP [[Scottish Government]] for a number of concessions over the 2007-11 Scottish Parliament. This had resulted in commitments to 1,000 extra police officers, four-year council tax freeze and £60m town regeneration fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishconservatives.com/downloads/scottish-conservative-manifesto-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719004451/http://www.scottishconservatives.com/downloads/scottish-conservative-manifesto-2011.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>

With an SNP majority delivered, the Scottish Conservatives were reduced from 17 seats to 15, losing the [[Edinburgh Pentlands (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]] constituency to the SNP, seeing notional loses in [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] and [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]] to Labour. Following the election, Annabel Goldie resigned as leader and a [[2011 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election was held in November 2011]] - the first to appoint a Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, rather than the Scottish Parliament group, as required by the Sanderson Commission. [[Ruth Davidson]] was returned, beating the original front-runner and former deputy leader [[Murdo Fraser]].

Davidson drove forward a number of the Sanderson Commission's reforms, including replacing the party's [[Banyan]] (or Indian Fig) tree logo with a "union saltire".

====2015 UK general election====
The Conservatives made little advance at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Scotland)|2015 UK general election]] compared to 2010, with Scotland's sole Conservative MP [[David Mundell]] holding on to his [[Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale]] constituency with a reduced majority of just 798 votes ahead of the SNP's [[Emma Harper]]. The Conservatives made no seat gains at the election in Scotland, with Conservative targets such as [[Argyll and Bute (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll and Bute]]; [[West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (UK Parliament constituency)|West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine]] and [[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus]] being won by the Scottish National Party with an increased majority compared to 2010. In spite of this, the Conservatives narrowly missed out on having 2 MP's elected in Scotland, missing out in the [[Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk]] constituency by only 328 votes behind the SNP's [[Calum Kerr]]: this was the most marginal result in Scotland and the eighth most marginal result in the United Kingdom.

====2016 Scottish Parliament election====
[[File:Scottish Parliament election, 2016 - Conservative vote share.svg|thumb|Conservative share of the constituency vote by constituency in the 2016 election.]]
At the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]] the Scottish Conservative campaign focused on providing strong opposition to the SNP government in Scotland, opposing calls for a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum on Scottish independence]]. The party manifesto focused on freezing business tax rates to promote economic growth and greater employment opportunities; investing in mental health treatment over the course of the next parliament; a commitment to building 100,000 affordable homes within 5 years and a re-introduction of the [[Right to Buy]] scheme in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36037531|title=Holyrood 2016: Scottish Conservative manifesto at-a-glance|publisher=BBC|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> The Scottish Conservatives were the only major party in Scotland to oppose higher taxes to the rest of the United Kingdom during the campaign as tax reductions came in force across the rest of the UK which were opposed by the SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35830150|title=Budget 2016: Higher rate tax cut is 'wrong choice', says Nicola Sturgeon|publisher=BBC|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref>

At the election the party saw major gains, particularly on the regional list vote. The Conservatives doubled their representation in the Scottish Parliament by taking 31 seats (compared to 15 in 2011), making them the leading opposition party in the Scottish Parliament ahead of [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Labour]]. On the constituency element of the vote the Conservatives held on to their three [[First-past-the-post|first past the post]] constituency seats ([[Ayr (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Ayr]]; [[Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire]] and [[Galloway and West Dumfries (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Galloway and West Dumfries]]), making gains in [[Aberdeenshire West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]]; [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]]; [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] and [[Edinburgh Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]], where party leader Ruth Davidson stood for election. This marked the party's best electoral performance in Scotland since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992 (Scotland)|1992 UK general election]].

====2017 UK general election====
[[File:UK general election, 2017 (Scotland) - Conservative vote share.svg|thumb|Conservative share of the vote by constituency in the 2017 election.]]
Campaigning in opposition to proposals put forward by [[Nicola Sturgeon]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]] for a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum on Scottish independence]] to be held following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|a referendum held in 2016]] which was not supported by a majority of Scottish voters, the Scottish Conservatives had their best ever election in Scotland in seat terms since [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. The Conservatives gained 12 MP's in Scotland to give them 13 in total. The party had their largest vote share in a general election in Scotland since [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], taking a total of 757,949 votes (28.6%) in Scotland.

David Mundell held on to his [[Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfrieesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale]] seat with an increased majority of 9,441 votes (19.3%). The party also gained the [[Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock]]; [[Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk]]; and [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] constituencies to the south of the country, and gained [[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]] on the outskirts of [[Glasgow]].

The Conservatives also took a majority of seats in the North East of Scotland, gaining former [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond|Alex Salmond's]] [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]] constituency, alongside [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]], the seat of the SNP's Westminster leader [[Angus Robertson]]. Other gains for the party in the North East included [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]]; [[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus]]; [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]]; and [[West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (UK Parliament constituency)|West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine]]. The party took the [[Ochil and South Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Ochil and South Perthshire]]; and [[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]] constituencies in central Scotland and missed out to the SNP in [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]] by just 21 votes.

==== 2019 European Elections ====
The Scottish Conservatives retained their [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|single seat]] in the [[European Parliament]] at the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]]. Incumbent MEP [[Nosheena Mobarik]] was reelected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48417424|title=SNP to increase its MEPs as Labour collapses|date=2019-05-27|access-date=2020-01-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==== 2019 UK general election ====
On 29 August 2019, Davidson stood down citing several political and personal reasons for her decision to resign as leader.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/ruth-davidson-quits-as-scottish-tory-leader|title=Ruth Davidson quits as Scottish Tory leader citing Brexit and family|last=correspondent|first=Libby Brooks Scotland|date=2019-08-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/29/davidsons-departure-threatens-scottish-tories-and-the-union|title=Davidson's departure threatens Scottish Tories and the union|last=correspondent|first=Libby Brooks Scotland|date=2019-08-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Scottish Conservatives lost more than half of their seats in Scotland to the [[Scottish National Party]] in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019 general election]], with a 3.5% swing away from the party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/conservative-seats-scotland-2019-seven-21088422|title=Conservative seats in Scotland 2019 as seven constituencies fall to SNP|last=Dunnett|first=Julie|date=2019-12-13|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50789131 |title = Election 2019: The result in Scotland in numbers|work = BBC News|date = 13 December 2019|last1 = Sim|first1 = Philip}}</ref>

TO DO - ENDS-->The Scottish Conservatives are a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] political party, with a commitment to Scotland [[Unionism in Scotland|remaining a part of]] the United Kingdom. It is autonomous from the Conservative Party across the UK in the creation of policy in devolved areas. In August 2006, the-then Leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], said that the party should recognise "that the policies of Conservatives in Scotland and Wales will not always be the same as our policies in England" and that the "[[West Lothian question]] must be answered from a [[Unionism in Scotland|Unionist]] perspective".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=1202392006 "'Revolutionary' Cameron offers party in Scotland autonomy over policies"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 17 August 2006</ref>

In certain areas, the party has adopted different policy positions from the UK Conservatives. Following the Sutherland Report in 1999, the party voted with the [[Scottish Executive]] in 2002 to introduce free personal care for the elderly funded from general taxation.

At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], the Scottish Conservatives pledged opposition to a [[proposed second Scottish independence referendum]], delivering on [[Brexit]] and to strengthen the [[United Kingdom]]. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50561293|title=At-a-glance: Scottish Conservatives manifesto|date=2019-11-26|access-date=2019-12-13|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scottishconservatives.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GE-Manifesto_Scotland.pdf]</ref>
== Party organisation ==
The Scottish branch of the Conservative party is governed by a Party Management Board convened the Party Chairman, currently Robert Forman. The Management Board also consists of the party leader, conference convener, secretary, treasurer and three regional conveners representing the north, east and west of Scotland areas. As of June 2016, these are-

* Robert Forman, Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives 
* Douglas Ross, Leader of the Scottish Conservatives
* Leonard Wallace, Honorary Secretary
* Bryan Johnston, Treasurer
* Charles Kennedy, East of Scotland Regional Convener
* George Carr, North of Scotland Regional Convener
* Gordon Wallace-Brown, West of Scotland Regional Convener

The party leader is elected by members on a one-member-one-vote basis, with the chairman appointed by the Scottish leader after consultation with the UK party leader. The Conference convener is a voluntary officer elected by members at the party's annual conference who must have been a former regional convener, and is responsible for chairing the conference and the party's convention.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_11_10_toryreport.pdf Sanderson Commission], p. 19</ref>

=== Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party ===
The position of Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party was created in 2011. Between 1999 and 2011, the position listed below was '''Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament'''. The new position of Scottish party leader was created following the recommendations of the Sanderson Commission.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_11_10_toryreport.pdf Sanderson Commission report], p. 15</ref> The position of leader is currently held by [[Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)|Douglas Ross]].<ref name="rossleader">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-53655975|title= Douglas Ross confirmed as Scottish Conservative leader|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=5 August 2020|accessdate=5 August 2020}}</ref> As Ross is not an MSP and instead serves in Westminster, Davidson returned to frontline politics as the Scottish Conservative Party’s Holyrood Leader until the [[Next Scottish Parliament election]].
