The '''''Yale Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review]] affiliated with the [[Yale Law School]]. Published continuously since 1891, it is the most widely known of the eight [[law review]]s published by students at Yale Law School. The journal is one of the most cited legal publications in the nation (with an impact factor of 5.000)<ref>{{cite book |title=Journal Citation Reports|date=2019 |publisher=[[Clarivate Analytics]] |edition=Social Sciences}}</ref> and usually generates the highest number of citations per published article.<ref>[https://managementtools4.wlu.edu/LawJournals/ Law journals' ranking], [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Washington & Lee Law School]].</ref>

The journal, which is published eight times per year, contains articles, essays, features, and book reviews by professional legal scholars as well as student-written notes and comments. It is edited entirely by students. The journal has an online companion, the ''Yale Law Journal Forum'', which features op-ed length pieces and responses from scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.

The ''Yale Law Journal'', in conjunction with the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', and the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', publishes the ''[[Bluebook|Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', the most widely followed authority for [[legal citation]] formats in the United States.
