'''George Hugh Niederauer''' (June 14, 1936 – May 2, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He was the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Archbishop Emeritus of San Francisco]]. Before that, Niederauer served as [[Bishop of Salt Lake City]] from 1994 to 2005.

==Biography==
George Niederauer was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], the [[only child]] of George and Elaine Niederauer. He attended [[St. Catherine's Academy|St. Catherine's Military School]] and then [[St. Anthony High School (California)|St. Anthony High School]]; he was a classmate of Cardinal [[William Levada]]. After graduating in 1954, he attended [[Stanford University]]. During his freshman year Niederauer changed course and decided to enter [[St. John's Seminary (California)|St. John's Seminary]] in [[Camarillo, California|Camarillo]], from where in 1959 he earned a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. He further completed his studies with a [[Bachelor of Sacred Theology]] degree from the [[Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in English literature from [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]], Los Angeles in 1962. Niederauer also earned a [[Ph.D.]] in [[English Literature]] at [[University of Southern California|USC]].

Niederauer was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on April 30, 1962. He was raised to the rank of [[Monsignor|Honorary Prelate of His Holiness]] in 1984. Niederauer served as Rector of St. John’s Seminary in Camarillo from 1987 to 1992.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150220135738/http://www.sfarchdiocese.org/home/archdiocese/archbishops-emeriti/most-reverend-george-h-niederauer]</ref> He was appointed the eighth [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City|Bishop of Salt Lake City]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on November 3, 1994. Niederauer received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on January 25, 1995 from Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], with Archbishop [[William Levada]] and Bishop [[Tod David Brown]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. As bishop he was seen as "the most approachable of persons and one whose homilies were almost magical in their ability to make potentially difficult Scripture passages and theological concepts comprehensible and applicable – even inspiring – in our daily lives."<ref>{{cite news|last=Topping|first=Gary|title=The Bishops of Salt Lake City: The Scholar – Bishop George H. Niederauer|url=http://www.icatholic.org/article/the-bishops-of-salt-lake-city-the-scholar-bishop-7456025|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=Intermountain Catholic|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>

On December 15, 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] named him to succeed William Levada as the eighth [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Metropolitan Archbishop of San Francisco]], following Levada's appointment to Pope Benedict's former post of [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] in the [[Roman Curia]]. Archbishop Niederauer was the chairman of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] Committee on Communication, and a member of the [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfarchdiocese.org/web_csf_12.21.07.pdf |format=PDF| title='Hooting and hollering' greet Catholic radio station's 'cut-over' (page 6) | work=Catholic San Francisco | publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]] | date=December 21, 2007 | author=Tom Burke | accessdate=February 9, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On August 29, 2011, Niederauer underwent emergency double by-pass heart surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php?newsid=22&id=58845|title=Archbishop Niederauer recovering from heart surgery|publisher=SF Catholic|date=August 29, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182143/http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php?newsid=22&id=58845|archivedate=September 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On July 27, 2012, the apostolic nuncio to the United States announced that the [[Holy See]] had accepted Niederauer's letter of resignation, and Salvatore J. Cordileone was appointed the Archbishop-elect of San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/news/2012/12-132e.cfm|title=Pope names Oakland Bishop Cordileone as Archbishop of San Francisco|publisher=USCCB|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> On that day, the see of San Francisco became vacant, and Niederauer attained the title Archbishop Emeritus.

==Views==
===Support of Proposition 8===
In 2008, Archbishop Niederauer campaigned in favor of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], a ballot measure to recognize heterosexual marriage as the only valid marriage within California. Niederauer claims to have been instrumental in forging alliances between Catholics and [[Mormons]] to support the measure. Wrote the ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' "Niederauer drew in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and proved to be a critical move in building a multi-religious coalition—the backbone of the fundraising, organizing and voting support for the successful ballot measure. By bringing together Mormons and Catholics, Niederauer would align the two most powerful religious institutions in the Prop. 8 battle."<ref>Kuruvila, Matthai (November 10, 2008) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/10/MNU1140AQQ.DTL "To Pass Measure, Catholics and Mormons Allied."] San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 11-10-08.)</ref>

===Films===
The archbishop said that he had seen ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', making him the first senior American cleric to state that he has viewed the film. When asked for his reaction he said that "I thought it was very powerful, and I probably had a different take on it than a lot of people did.... It was a story not only about the relationship between the two principal characters, but very much a cluster of relationships... And I think in all of that one of the lessons is the destructiveness of not being honest with yourself, and not being honest with other people – and not being faithful, trying to live a double life, and what that does to each of the lives you try to live."<ref name="sfgate.com">{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/chroncast/2006/02/08/an-interview-with-san-franciscos-new-archbishop/|title=An interview with San Francisco’s new archbishop|date=February 8, 2006|publisher=}}</ref>

===Abstinence===
"Our belief is that we have to hold up the standard of [[abstinence]], and we do that in all of our teaching about sexuality by saying that sexual activity outside of [[marriage]] is wrong. Now that's a very high bar to set and I understand that. And I don't regret that – I subscribe to it and I teach it. I understand why people find it difficult and disagree with it. I understand why they do. I don't agree with them.... What I would say is that people who disagree with us can disagree without being disagreeable."<ref name="sfgate.com"/>

===Moral teaching===
"Authentic moral teaching is based on objective truth, not polling."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfarchdiocese.org/about-us/news/?i=1308 | title=Archbishop Addresses Recent Comments Made by House Speaker Pelosi | work=Catholic San Francisco | publisher=Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco | author=[[George Niederauer]] | date=September 5, 2008 | accessdate=October 5, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913235647/http://www.sfarchdiocese.org/about-us/news/?i=1308 | archivedate=September 13, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
