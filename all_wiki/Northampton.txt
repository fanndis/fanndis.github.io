'''Northampton''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Northampton.ogg|n|ɔːr|ˈ|θ|æ|m|p|t|ə|n}} is a large market town, [[civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/7000000000179766|title=Northampton|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=22 October 2020}}</ref> [[non-metropolitan district]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/7000000000007473|title=Northampton|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=22 October 2020}}</ref> and the [[county town]] of [[Northamptonshire]] in the [[East Midlands]] region of [[England]]. It lies on the [[River Nene]], {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} north-west of [[London]] and {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} south-east of [[Birmingham]]. It's one of the largest towns (as opposed to cities) in England,<ref>{{Cite news |date=18 August 2011 |title=Britain's 20 biggest towns |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8705932/Britains-20-biggest-towns.html}}</ref> it had a population of 212,100 at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] (223,000 est. 2019).

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates to the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman]]s and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].

Northampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.

Northampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town. It unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mead |first=Nick Van |date=18 January 2015 |title=How UK cities compare for population, jobs, new businesses and house prices |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2015/jan/19/uk-cities-ranked-jobs-migration-house-prices-broadband-speeds-data }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The earliest reference to Northampton in writing occurred in 914 under the name ''Ham tune'', literally meaning "home town".<ref name=britishhistory /> The prefix "North" was added later to distinguish it from other towns called Hampton, most prominently [[Southampton]].<ref name="visionofbritain">{{Cite web |title=NORTHAMPTON &#124; As described in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=445DFDCCA215340BB5C3C71703542FC1?text_id=977650&word=NULL |access-date=29 August 2013 |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref> The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' (1086) records the town as ''Northantone'', which evolved into ''Norhamptone'' by the 13th century and later ''Northampton'' by the 17th century.<ref name=britishhistory /><ref>{{Cite web |date=22 June 2003 |title=Charles II, 1675 – An Act for the better and more easy rebuilding the Towne of Northampton. |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47460 |access-date=29 August 2013 |website=Statutes of the Realm: volume 5 |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |pages=798–801)}}</ref>

=== Ancient ===
[[File:Danes Camp Earthworks Northampton.jpg|thumb|upright|Earthworks at [[Hunsbury Hill]], which was a settlement during the [[Iron Age]]]]
Present-day Northampton is the latest in a series of settlements that began in the [[Bronze Age]].

During the [[British Iron Age]], people typically lived in protected [[hill fort]]s.

Following a [[Viking|Danish]] invasion, the central area of the town was turned into a stronghold called a ''burh'' probably by the English. This may have been by 841 when the Mercians successfully defended the town in a siege by the Danish [[Scandinavian York|King Olaf of York]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Roman saxon and Viking |url=https://northantsbattles.com/roman-saxon-and-viking/ |url-status=live |access-date=6 August 2020 |website=Northamptonshire Battlefields Society}}</ref> By the time of the [[Peace of Wedmore]] in 878 the Burgh was in possession of the Danes and became the base for one of the Danish armies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Mike |title=We're a little bit Saxon and a little bit Viking |url=https://nenequirer.com/2019/05/28/were-a-little-bit-saxon-and-a-little-bit-viking/ |journal=Nene Quirer}}</ref>  A ditch was dug around the settlement and it was fortified with earth [[Defensive wall|ramparts]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vince |first=Alan |title=An Archaeological Resource Assessment and Research Agenda for the Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon Period (c. 400-850) in the East Midlands |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/publications/documents/emidas_000.pdf |access-date=12 September 2013 |publisher=le.ac.uk}}</ref> Having conquered [[Mercia]], the Danes turned the settlement into a centre for military and administrative purposes, which was part of the [[Danelaw]].

With the [[Norman conquest of England]], the town rose to national significance: its geographical location in the centre of England made Northampton a valuable strategical point for government and as a convenient meeting place for political, social, ecclesiastical and military events.<ref name=britishhistory /><ref name="histparl">{{Cite web |title=Northampton |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/constituencies/northampton#constituency-main-article |access-date=12 September 2013 |publisher=historyofparliamentonline.org}}</ref>

[[Northampton Castle]] is thought to have been built by [[Simon I de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton|Simon de Senlis]], who became the first [[Earl of Northampton]], circa 1084.<ref name=britishhistory /> It was originally an earth and timber [[stockade]]d construction which was later rebuilt in stone.<ref name="andrewmartin">Andrew, Martin: ''Northampton'' The Francis Frith Collection, 2002</ref> The castle became an occasional royal residence from the reign of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in 1130 until that of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].<ref name=histparl /> [[John, King of England|King John]] regularly stayed at the castle and moved [[HM Treasury|The Treasury]] there in 1205.

Significant events in the castle's history include the trial of [[Thomas Becket]] in 1164, the publication of the [[Assize of Northampton]] in 1176, the declaration of peace with Scotland in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton]], the passage of the [[Statute of Northampton]] in 1328 and the imposition of [[Tax per head|poll tax]] in 1380. Royal tournaments and feasts were also held at the castle.<ref name="britishhistory">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66252 The borough of Northampton – Introduction | A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3 (pp. 1-26)].

Simon de Senlis is also thought to have built the medieval town walls, which enclosed about {{convert|245|acres|0|abbr=on}} and had four main [[City gate|gates]]. Though demolished now, the circular pattern of the main roads surrounding the town centre marks the original position of the walls.<ref name="andrewmartin" /> de Senlis founded the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[St Andrew's Priory, Northampton|Priory of St Andrew's]]{{mdash}}in the area of Semilong {{mdash}}and  built [[The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton|The Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]{{mdash}}one of four remaining [[round church]]es in England{{mdash}}and All Hallows Church on the current site of [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saint's Church]].<ref name="britishhistory" /><ref name="andrewmartin" /> His son, [[Simon II de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton|Simon II de Senlis]], built [[St Peter's Church, Northampton|St Peter's Church]] on a site between a former Anglo-Saxon palace and Northampton Castle.<ref name="andrewmartin" /> Simon II de Senlis also founded [[Delapré Abbey]]{{mdash}}another Cluniac priory{{mdash}}which still stands today. Other priories in medieval Northampton include [[Northampton Abbey|St James' Abbey]], Graye Friers, Blackfriars and Whitefriars. St. John's, a medieval hospital, was situated east of Bridge Street.<ref name="andrewmartin" /> A [[Northampton's tunnels|network of medieval tunnels]] remains under the centre of Northampton around All Saint's Church and the Market Square but their purpose, extent and significance have been disputed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 April 2009 |title=Underground Northampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northamptonshire/content/articles/2009/04/03/underground_northampton_tunnels_feature.shtml |access-date=29 August 2013 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The town was originally controlled by officials acting for the King who collected taxes and upheld the law. This changed on 18 November 1189 when King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] granted the town its first charter in exchange for money to fund his crusades.<ref name="britishhistory" /> The charter allowed the townspeople certain rights and independence in legal and administrative matters. In 1215, King John authorised the appointment of William Tilly as the town's first Mayor and ordered that "twelve of the better and more discreet [residents] of your town" join him as a council to assist him.<ref name="britishhistory" /><ref name="NBC Mayors">{{Cite web |title=''Mayors of Northampton'' W N Terry Central Art Gallery, Northampton, updated June 2011, accessed 5 October 2012 |url=https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?source=search_app#hl=en&sugexp=les%3B&gs_nf=1&cp=21&gs_id=2d&xhr=t&q=mayors+of+northampton&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&oq=Mayors+of+Northamptom&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=34d01fe90270ff60&biw=1920&bih=951 |access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref> The importance of Northampton at this time is underlined by the fact that only London, [[York]] and [[King's Lynn]] had mayors by this date.<ref name="andrewmartin" /> The mayor later ruled with 24 councillors and 48 freemen in a closed body until 1835.<ref name="andrewmartin" />

Markets and fairs were a key element in the town's economy in medieval times.

The [[First Barons' War]] caused significant destruction to Northampton. The barons [[Siege|besieged]] Northampton Castle in protest at King John's oppression of his subjects. In retaliation, royalist forces destroyed a large part of the town. When the forces of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] overran the supporters of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], the [[Second Barons' War]] broke out. The [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|First Battle of Northampton]] took place in 1264 at the site of Northampton Castle where King Henry III and his son [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]] attacked with a large army, pillaged the town and took prisoners.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] pandemic killed more than half the population of Northampton. In 1377, the population was 2,200.<ref name=histparl /> The town was rapidly losing its wealth and its importance as a national centre. In 1460, the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Second Battle of Northampton]] took place during the [[War of the Roses]] in the meadows between the River Nene and Delapré Abbey. The [[House of York|Yorkists]] defeated the Lancastrians and [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] was taken prisoner. In 1484, the Mayor declared that Northampton was "in great desolation and ruin". The dissolution of the monasteries in 1538 led to further destruction of what remained of the medieval town. Northampton was severely affected by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] between March and September 1638 when 533 people{{mdash}}a seventh of the population{{mdash}}died.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Early Modern ===
The royal connection to Northampton Castle became less significant, and by the time of the [[English Civil War]], Northampton was decidedly pro-Parliament.<ref name=andrewmartin /> Though [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Spencer Compton]], Earl of Northampton, was a royalist ([[Cavalier]]) and backed King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the people of Northampton supported Parliament and [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s republican [[Roundhead]] army. The town had a long history of religious dissent from the [[Lollardy|Lollards]] and [[Puritan]]ism gained a strong hold on the town. The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious [[ship money]] tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against [[papist]]s and [[bishop]]s.<ref name=andrewmartin />

When war broke out in 1642, the town willingly became the main Parliamentarian [[garrison]] for the south-east Midlands area with the former royal castle as its headquarters. In 1643, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] attacked Northampton with approximately 2,000 men, but was beaten back at the North Gate of the town. Oliver Cromwell visited in 1645 and [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|General Fairfax]] marched from the town to [[Naseby]], where Charles I's Royalist army was decisively defeated.<ref name=andrewmartin /> Over 4,000 pairs of leather shoes and 600 pairs of cavalry jack-boots for the Parliamentary armies were manufactured in Northampton during the Civil War, and a further 2,000 for Cromwell's [[New Model Army]] in 1648. Until well into the 19th century, the shoe industry boomed in and around the town with small manufacturing workshops set up in the surrounding areas.<ref name=andrewmartin />

The War ended with a Parliamentary victory, resulting in England becoming a [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], which lasted a decade. Following the [[Restoration (1660)|restoration of King Charles II]] in 1660, he took revenge on the town by ordering the destruction of its walls and partial demolition of its castle in 1662, since it did not support his father Charles I and his cavaliers.<ref name="castle">[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/community/discover-northampton-s-own-lost-castle-1-2874922] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603123806/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/community/discover-northampton-s-own-lost-castle-1-2874922 |date=3 June 2015 }}</ref> From then on, the castle was used as a court and a gaol, but its physical condition worsened.<ref name=castle /> The new council of the town had to pay £200 to have its charter renewed and also required all officials to swear the oath of allegiance and some confirmed by the Crown.<ref name=andrewmartin />

By the end of the 18th century, Northampton had become a major centre of footwear and leather manufacture. In 1801, the population was 7,020; it more than doubled to 15,351 in 1831, attributed to the fact that there was great demand for footwear caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=andrewmartin /> A third of the adult males alone were shoemakers at the time.<ref name=andrewmartin /> Northampton grew beyond the old town walls and industry grew rapidly with the mechanisation of factories by the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=andrewmartin />

[[File:Cole-roper northampton 1810.jpg|thumb|A map of Northampton in 1810]]
The Nene Navigation Company had previously made the River Nene navigable from King's Lynn as far up as Northampton in 1762, allowing cheap transportation of coal and other goods to the town, but in 1815, the [[Grand Union Canal]] reached the town, joining the River Nene, giving the town a direct link to the Midlands coalfields and to [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and London.<ref name=britishhistory />

The first railway to be built into Northampton was the [[Northampton and Peterborough Railway]], a branch from the main [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from [[Blisworth]] to [[Peterborough]] through Northampton which opened in 1845 along with the town's first railway station, [[Northampton Bridge Street railway station|Bridge Street station]].

Tram lines were also laid down in the town in 1881 and electrified in 1903.<ref name=britishhistory /> An early omnibus service ran to Wellingborough, and since 1919 motor omnibus services ran to villages around the town which brought buyers and sellers to the market.<ref name=britishhistory />

There were iron ore quarries in the countryside around the town during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which have left their mark on the landscape. Some of the quarries were in what is now the town area in an arc from Kingsthorpe through Duston and Hunsbury round to Hardingstone beginning in about 1860. Some have now been built over and not all lasted very long. The town area quarries that lasted the longest and closed last were at Hunsbury which began working in 1877 and closed in 1920. There are remains of some of these quarries at Hunsbury Hill. There was an iron works by the river to the west of  the town next to the railway that then operated  between Northampton and Blisworth. This was called the Hunsbury Ironworks and operated between about 1874 and January 1921 using ore from these quarries and elsewhere.<ref>{{Tonks ironstone |part=3 |page=90–153}}</ref>

=== Contemporary ===
Following [[World War I]], the shoe industry was increasingly in decline, despite the town's factories supplying over 23 million pairs of boots to the armed forces.<ref name=andrewmartin /> A total of 1,700 men from the town were lost of the 6,000 killed from the [[Northamptonshire Regiment]].<ref name=andrewmartin /> The town expanded further during the 1920s and saw the erection of [[Northampton Power Station]], which supplied electricity to areas as far away as [[Wolverton]], until its closure in 1975. Much council housing was also built largely to the east, north and south of the town, including [[Abington, Northamptonshire|Abington]], [[Far Cotton]], Kingsley, [[Kingsthorpe]] and [[Dallington, Northamptonshire|Dallington]] – areas which had been incorporated within the borough's boundaries in 1901.<ref name=andrewmartin /> However, the population growth slowed down as people moved beyond its boundaries. In 1901, the population had expanded to 90,923; in 1931, the population was 92,341.<ref name=andrewmartin />

[[File:NptonPop.GIF|left]]
After [[World War II]], Northampton vastly changed. In 1959, the [[M1 motorway]] was opened to the south-west of the town; in 1968,  Northampton was designated a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]]. Both these events and the rail link helped Northampton's growth as a [[commuter town]] for London.<ref name=andrewmartin /> The Northampton Development Corporation (NDC) was set up in 1968 to substantially redevelop the town in partnership with the local council, spending £205 million to build new housing and industrial estates, initially in Lumbertubs, Moulton Park and Round Spinney to the east, followed by Briar Hill, Camp Hill and East and West Hunsbury in the south of the town, mainly to accommodate the overflow population of new residents from the London area.<ref name=andrewmartin /><ref name="bbcndc">{{Cite news |date=3 February 2015 |title=Fifty years since a plan that transformed Northampton |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-31110173}}</ref> In the town centre, older buildings were demolished and replaced or redeveloped for other buildings, including the former [[Northampton Greyfriars bus station|Greyfriars bus station]], the [[Grosvenor Centre]], Peacock Place (now Market Walk), shops, flats and hotels.<ref name=andrewmartin />

Although growth was slower than planned, the population grew from 105,421 in 1961 to 157,217 by 1981,<ref name=andrewmartin /> with 15,655 new homes added to the town between 1970 and 1985.<ref name="bbcndc" /> The borough boundaries also changed following a split of the [[Northampton parliamentary constituency]] into [[Northampton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton North]] and [[Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South]] in 1974. Northampton was reconstituted as a [[non-metropolitan district]] which also covered areas outside the former borough boundaries but inside the designated New Town. The town tried for [[Unitary authority|unitary status]] during the [[1990s UK local government reform]], but failed and remains a non-metropolitan district to this day, meaning it relies on a two-tier system of government. On [[Good Friday]] 1998, Northampton suffered severe flooding, particularly in the areas of Far Cotton and St James; two people were killed and thousands of homes were affected.

Since the turn of the Millennium, the town has continued to expand. Northampton applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000 and again in 2002, but failed on both occasions and remains a town.<ref name="MillenniumLeakAngers">{{Cite news |date=7 March 2000 |title=Millennium city leak angers bookies |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/669580.stm |access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref><ref name="MillenniumWinnersNamed">{{Cite news |date=18 December 2000 |title=City winners named |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1074434.stm |access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Five new cities creates row |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1872577.stm |website=BBC News}}</ref> In 2006, Northampton became a government expansion zone with new growth promoted by [[West Northamptonshire Development Corporation]] (WNDC), an unelected [[quango]], which has provoked a series of regeneration schemes across the town. Some have been completed, including the opening of the [[Radlands]] Plaza Skatepark and the development of Becket's Park Marina just south of Northampton's town centre, as well as the improvement of the town's Market Square, the building of the new North Gate bus station, the rebuilding of the railway station and the designation of a Cultural Quarter. Current projects include the improvement of Northampton's waterside, the building of a new Council headquarters, the restoration of [[Delapré Abbey]], the expansion of [[Northampton Museum]], the resiting and rebuilding of the university on one new campus in town centre and the renovation of both the Grosvenor Shopping Centre and Weston Favell Centre.<ref name="WNDC">[http://www.wndc.co.uk/ West Northamptonshire Development Corporation website].

{{Details|topic=politics in Northampton|Northampton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)}}
[[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton]] in 1295 was inaugurated as a constituency, that is (for many centuries) it returned two [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] to the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. [[Spencer Perceval]] was elected as one of these in 1796 and became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1809, the only Solicitor General and only Attorney General to have done so, but also the only Prime Minister to be assassinated. The murder was by a highly disgruntled business owner [[John Bellingham]] in the House of Commons lobby in 1812. By the late 19th century, Northampton had acquired a reputation for political vanguardism. In 1880, radical non-conformist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was elected as one of the MPs. During one of his election cross-candidate hustings a riot broke out in the Market Square. Local figures of authority called military to disperse it. For some decades from the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] representation was reduced to one MP.

[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] saw the seat replaced by the new constituencies of [[Northampton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton North]] and [[Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South]], which as all current ones do elect one MP. From the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], new, [[South Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Northamptonshire]] took a southern sector of the borough.

Northampton is currently represented by three [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs: 
*Andrew Lewer (Northampton South)
*[[Michael Ellis (British politician)|Michael Ellis]] (Northampton North)
*[[Andrea Leadsom]] (South Northamptonshire).

The town existed as an [[ancient borough]] in the medieval period before being one of the 178 boroughs to be reformed under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act]] in 1835, with a democratically elected council replacing the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] corporation before it.<ref name=andrewmartin /> Town government alternated between the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], and the town achieved independence from Northamptonshire in 1888 when it became a [[county borough]].<ref name=andrewmartin /> It had 6 electoral wards from 1898, 9 wards from 1900 and 12 wards from 1911.<ref name=britishhistory />

=== Health services ===
NHS Northampton guides primary care services (general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) in the town, directly provides adult social care and services in the community such as [[Health visitor|health visiting]] and [[physiotherapy]] and also funds hospital care and other specialist treatments. [[Northampton General Hospital]] is an [[NHS trust]] hospital which founded in 1744 and moved to its present site in 1793, and has continued to provide healthcare to the local community for more than 200 years. The [[East Midlands Ambulance Service]] NHS Trust is responsible for the provision of statutory [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|emergency medical services]] in Northampton.

[[St Andrew's Hospital]], the flagship mental health facility of the private company St Andrew's Healthcare, is also based in Northampton. Originally opened in 1838<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 September 2014 |title=St Andrew's Healthcare to build £45m Northampton unit |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-29156142 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> to serve Northampton, St Andrew's became a charity and private healthcare provider when the Berrywood Asylum (later the Northampton County Lunatic Asylum, then St Crispin Hospital in 1948, and since 2010 Berrywood Hospital) opened in 1876.

As with the rest of the British Isles, Northampton experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The official [[Met Office]] weather station for Northampton is the [[Moulton Park]] Weather Station at the [[University of Northampton]]. Situated at an elevation of around {{convert|130|m|0|abbr=on}}  [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] compared to Northampton town centre at {{convert|50|to|60|m|0|abbr=on}}, it is one of the highest points in the Borough, and so may not be a perfect representation of other parts of the town. Its hilltop location means less pooling of cold air on calm clear nights, and lower maxima during summer. The absolute maximum recorded is {{convert|34.7|C|1|abbr=on}}<ref name="northampton1">{{Cite web |title=Moulton Park Weather |url=http://www.northampton.ac.uk/appliedsciences/appliedscience/geoenvsci/climatological-station/temperature |access-date=23 February 2011}}</ref> on 3 August 1990. A high of {{convert|34.4|C}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=19th July 2006 |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/july2006/MaxTemp1907Points_jpeg.JPG |access-date=23 February 2011}}</ref> was recorded on 19 July 2006. The absolute minimum is {{convert|−16.8|C}},<ref name="northampton1" /> recorded during February 1986. It is likely the absolute maximum in the town centre is a degree or so higher owing to the lower elevation, and absolute minimum on the eastern and western edges of the Borough around the Nene valley a couple of degrees colder due to katabatic drainage of cold air allowing a frost hollow effect. Most recently, the temperature fell to {{convert|−9.6|C}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rogers |first=Simon |date=21 December 2010 |title=20 December 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/20/winter-weather-coldest-places-britain |access-date=23 February 2011}}</ref> on 20 December 2010.

Rainfall, at around {{convert|650|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year is not high, though is often unpredictable, giving rise to flooding events such as 1998, but also short term droughts. Desborough Weather Station also supplies the public with a local weather service.

[[File:Barratts factory, Northampton.jpg|thumb|The [[Barratts Shoes|Barratt]] Boot and Shoe factory operational since 1911.]]
Northampton was a major centre of shoemaking and other leather industries, although only specialist shoemaking companies such as Barker Shoes, [[Church's]],<ref>[http://www.church-footwear.com/ Church's English Shoes].

A large number of old shoe factories remain, mostly now converted to offices or accommodation, some of which are surrounded by terraced houses built for factory workers.

Engineering became a major employer in Northampton during the post war years following the establishment of the [[Timken Company|British Timken]] tapered roller bearing factory at [[Duston]] in 1941 as a ''[[shadow factory]]'' for the main site in Birmingham during the Second World War. The factory which closed in 2002 employed over 4,000 employees at its peak and was a major engineering apprentice training employer.

These free papers mostly consist of advertising and have limited news. ''The Mercury'' was one of the oldest newspapers still in circulation first published in 1720, founded by William Dicey, an ancestor of the public law commentator, A.V. Dicey. It was the fifth-oldest such newspaper in the United Kingdom and the tenth-oldest such in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Association of Newspapers |url=http://www.wan-press.org/article2823.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107070325/http://www.wan-press.org/article2823.html |archive-date=7 January 2004 |access-date=30 August 2009}}</ref>

The Church of [[The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton|the Holy Sepulchre]], is one of the largest and best-preserved [[round church]]es in England. It was built in 1100 on the orders of the first [[Earl of Northampton]], [[Marquess of Northampton|Simon de Senlis]] and based on a plan of the original [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Northampton's oldest building |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northamptonshire/content/articles/2007/06/19/church_of_the_holy_sepulchre_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Simon de Senlis also built [[Northampton Castle]] c. 1084, which was for many years one of the country's most important castles. It was a royal residence, held The [[Parliament of England]] many times, and was the site of royal tournaments and feasts. [[Thomas Becket]] was imprisoned there until he escaped. The castle suffered many fates and was eventually demolished to make way for the railway station in 1879.<ref>https://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/northampton-castle-remains-revealed-in-pictures-1-4671880</ref> A [[postern]], dismantled from its original position and rebuilt into a wall by the station, and a part of the keep mound are all that remains.

The current [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saints' Church]] was built on the site of a great Norman church, All Hallows, which was almost completely destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675. All that remained was the medieval tower and the fine vaulted crypt, but by 1680 [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saints']] had been rebuilt, with the help of donations from all over England, including 1,000 tons of timber from [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], whose statue can be seen above the [[portico]]. Famously, the poet [[John Clare]] liked to sit beneath the portico of the church. It is home to a choral foundation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Northampton Express Lift tower.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[National Lift Tower]] is a prominent feature of the town's skyline]]
Other notable church buildings include [[Northampton Cathedral]], the mother church of the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Northampton]] and seat of the [[Bishop of Northampton]]; St Peter's (mostly built in Norman times);  St Giles' Church; [[St Matthew's Church, Northampton|St Matthew's]] in Phippsville, which was built between 1891 and 1894, has a [[Henry Moore]] sculpture of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]. St Edmund's Church (built in 1850) closed in 1978 and was demolished in 1980<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holloway |first=Roland |title=Roland Holloway's Northamptonshire |publisher=Northamptonshire Libraries |year=1985 |isbn=0-905391-10-1 |editor-last=Unknown |location=Northampton |pages=Plate 68}}</ref> (its bells are now in [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington]]).

Just south of the town centre [[Delapré Abbey]], a former [[Cluniac]] nunnery, the County Records Office and site of the second [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], which was founded by [[Simon II de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton|Simon II de Senlis]], the son of first Earl of Northampton, in 1145. At the edge of the Abbey, one of the three standing [[Eleanor cross]]es still remains, in memory of [[Eleanor of Castile]], whose body rested here on its way to London. The original top of the monument has been knocked off and replaced several times from as early as 1460.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/535329 Hardingstone Eleanor Cross:: OS grid SP7558 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square!].

St Andrew's Hospital, which opened 1838, and its new building William Wake House, is one of the largest [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] structures in England. Northampton & County Club, which was established in 1873, was also the old county hospital before becoming a private members' club; the cellars are medieval. [[Northampton Guildhall]], which is Grade II* listed, was constructed mostly in the 1860s in [[Victorian Gothic]] architecture designed by [[Edward William Godwin]], and extended in 1889–92<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |title=Northamptonshire |publisher=Penguin |year=1973 |isbn=0-14-0710-22-1 |editor-last=Cherry |editor-first=Bridget |edition=Second |series=Buildings of England |location=London |pages=325}}</ref> and in the 1990s.

[[78 Derngate]] is a Grade II* listed Georgian Town House remodelled by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] for [[Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke]] in 1916–17. It contains notable Mackintosh interiors (which have been restored) and is his only major domestic commission outside Scotland. It is open to the public. One of these Derngate buildings was previously home to Northampton High School, an independent Northampton girls' school.

The {{convert|127.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall [[National Lift Tower]] is a dominant feature and visible from most of the town. A [[Terry Wogan]] radio phone-in during the 1980s came up with the name "Northampton Lighthouse" as Northampton is one of the furthest places from the sea. It is also known as the "Cobblers' Needle". It was built for testing new lifts at the Express Lifts factory, now closed. Though now redundant, it is a [[listed building]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Architectural Heritage – Northampton's "Lighthouse" |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/northants/article_2.shtml |website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The former [[Northampton Greyfriars bus station|Greyfriars bus station]] served the town from 1976 until 2014. In the 2000s, it was featured on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Demolition (television)|Demolition]]'' programme as the ugliest transport station in the United Kingdom and worthy of demolition. Demolition work began in March 2014, following the move of bus services to [[North Gate bus station]]. The Greyfriars was completely destroyed on 15 March 2015 by way of a controlled explosion.<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 March 2015 |title=Northampton Greyfriars bus station demolished |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-31895351}}</ref>

=== Memorials ===
[[File:Town and County War Memorial, Northampton (15).jpg|thumb|The [[Northampton War Memorial|Town and County War Memorial]]]]
Northampton contains several significant war memorials. The [[Northampton War Memorial|Town and County War Memorial]], unveiled in 1926, commemorates casualties of the First World War from all of Northamptonshire; it replaced a temporary cenotaph which stood in Abington Square from 1919. Designed by [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], it consists of two large obelisks and an altar-like stone sited in a small garden behind All Saints' Church. The Town and County memorial is a grade I listed building and part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1191327 |desc=The Town and County War Memorial |accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref> As the Town and County memorial does not contain a list of names of the fallen, the [[Royal British Legion]] launched a campaign which resulted in the construction of a second memorial, dedicated solely to the town; this memorial, in Abington Square, takes the form of a garden of remembrance with the names of the dead inscribed on the garden walls. A bust of [[Edgar Mobbs]] was later moved into the garden; Mobbs was a rugby player for [[Northampton Saints]] who was killed while serving in the First World War.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sawford |first=Philip |title=Northampton: Remembering 1914–18 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-7509-6154-7 |location=[[Stroud, Gloucestershire]] |page=136}}</ref>

Northampton is near junctions 15, 15a and 16 of the [[M1 motorway]] which connects Northampton with London at its most southern point and Leeds at its most northern. Both the [[A45 road|A45]] and [[A43 road|A43]] link Northampton with the other major towns in Northamptonshire, and can be accessed by a partially completed [[ring road]]. The [[A14 road (England)|A14]] is close by to the north of Northampton, providing links east and west of the town.

[[Northampton railway station]] is on the [[Northampton Loop Line|Northampton Loop]] of the [[West Coast Main Line]], and has services southbound to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] and northbound to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] and [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] provided by [[West Midlands Trains]]. [[Avanti West Coast]] also provide two daily services to London.

[[Sywell Aerodrome]] is the nearest airfield which has recently been upgraded with a {{convert|1000|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} concrete runway, however it only caters for private flying, flight training and corporate flights.<ref name="Sywell">[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Controversial-runway-to-open-at.5077789.jp Sywell Aerodrome – new concrete runway to open]. Northamptonchron.co.uk. Retrieved 25 August 2011.</ref> For international links, the [[East Midlands Airport]] and [[Luton Airport]] are quickly accessible by the M1; [[Birmingham Airport]] is also just north of the town via the M1 and [[M6 motorway|M6]] motorways and also by train.

In the town, buses are mainly operated by [[Stagecoach Midlands]] from the [[North Gate bus station]] with some services from [[Uno (bus company)|Uno]]. Stagecoach serves areas within the town and also provides travel to outlying villages and towns within the county, making links to [[Corby]], [[Daventry]], [[Kettering]], [[Rushden]] and [[Wellingborough]]. They also go as far afield as [[Bedford]], [[Leicester]], [[Market Harborough]], [[Milton Keynes]], [[Peterborough]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. Uno serve the University and Kingsthorpe area as well as Rectory Farm, Abington and Sixfields. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] also operates in Northampton, covering routes between major towns and cities in the United Kingdom.

Northampton is the terminus of an arm of the [[Grand Union Canal]]. The arm connects to the [[River Nene]] and from that to the [[River Great Ouse]] and the [[North Sea]]. No longer used for freight, the waterway is now popular with anglers and [[narrowboat]]ers. Principal outlying villages on the canal include [[Gayton, Northamptonshire|Gayton]], [[Blisworth]], [[Braunston]] and [[Stoke Bruerne]].

Northampton once had a [[Northampton Street Tramways|horse-drawn tramway]] which opened in 1881. The system was extended in stages and taken over by the council in 1897 and named [[Northampton Corporation Tramways]]. It was electrified in 1904, but closed in 1934 mainly as a result of competition from motor buses which were introduced in 1929. Two of the original tram shelters are preserved: one at the Racecourse park and another in Kingsthorpe opposite the Cock Hotel.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trams |url=http://cottonites.co.uk/transport.htm |access-date=7 October 2009 |publisher=Far Cotton History Group}}</ref>

This was eventually repealed and the university's name was revived in 2005 when the unconnected University College Northampton, which was founded in 1924, was upgraded to full university status and renamed the [[University of Northampton]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 April 2012 |title=University of Northampton considering plans to move to new site |work=Northampton Chronicle and Echo |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/politics/university-of-northampton-considering-plans-to-move-to-new-site-1-3739420 |access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref> This is the only [[higher education]] (HE) establishment in the town and offers courses from foundation and undergraduate levels to postgraduate, professional and doctoral qualifications. The university is made of up six schools: Business, Education, Health, Science and Technology, Social Sciences and The Arts. The university was originally spread over two campuses across the town, but moved to its new £330 million waterside campus by the River Nene in the town centre in 2018.

Northampton's only [[further education]] (FE) college is [[Northampton College]], one of the largest FE colleges in the South Midlands, which has two campuses across the town, offering vocational courses, [[GCSE]]s and [[GCE Advanced Level in the United Kingdom|A Levels]]. [[Moulton College]] is another FE college just north of Northampton which provides many vocational courses, specialising in land-based subjects, sports and construction. In collaboration with the University of Northampton, both colleges also offer some HE programmes.

There are 50 [[primary school]]s and 8 [[secondary school]]s in the town. Until 2004, Northamptonshire operated a three-tier system in education of lower, middle and upper schools. In 2001, the move to a two-tier system to primary and secondary schools began, aimed at improving educational standards.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1412003.stm – Education – Parents' concern over school closures].
