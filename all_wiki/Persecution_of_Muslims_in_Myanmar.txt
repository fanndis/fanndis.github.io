== History ==
Muslims have lived in Myanmar (also known as Burma) since the 11th century AD. The first Muslim documented in Burmese history (recorded in ''Hmannan Yazawin'' or ''[[Glass Palace Chronicle]]'') was Byat Wi during the reign of Mon, a [[Thaton Kingdom|Thaton]] king, circa 1050&nbsp;AD.<ref>Pe Maung Tin and G. H. Luce, ''The Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma'', Rangoon University Press, Rangoon, Burma, January 1960</ref> The two sons of Byat Wi's brother Byat Ta, known as Shwe Byin brothers, were executed as children either because of their Islamic faith, or because they refused forced labour.<ref>Yegar, Moshe ''The Muslims of Burma: a Study of a Minority Group'', Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1972; p. 2, paragraph 3</ref> It was recorded in the Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma that they were no longer trusted.<ref>Pe Maung Tin and G. H. Luce, ''The Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma'' p. 83 paragraph 3, lines 2&3</ref> During a time of war, King Kyansittha sent a hunter as a sniper to assassinate him.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 2, lines 1&2</ref><ref>Pe Maung Tin and G. H. Luce, ''The Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma'', p. 103, paragraph 3</ref>

=== Pre-modern persecution ===
The Burmese king [[Bayinnaung]] (1550–1581&nbsp;AD) imposed restrictions upon his Muslim subjects, but not actual persecution.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 10, lines 11&12</ref> In 1559&nbsp;AD, after conquering Pegu (present-day [[Bago, Myanmar|Bago]]), Bayinnaung banned [[Dhabihah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], thereby prohibiting Muslims from consuming [[halal]] meals of goats and chicken. He also banned [[Eid al-Adha]] and [[Udhiyyah or Qurbani|Qurbani]], regarding killing animals in the name of religion as a cruel custom.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 10, lines 10–16</ref><ref>Hmanan Yazawin (The Glass Palace Chronicle) Vol II p.312</ref>

In the 17th century, Indian Muslims residing in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] were massacred.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} These Muslims had settled with [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]], who had fled India after losing the Mughal war of succession. Initially, the Arakan pirate Sandathudama (1652–1687&nbsp;AD) who was the local pirate of Chittagong and Arakan, allowed Shuja and his followers to settle there. But a dispute arose between Sandatudama and Shuja, and Shuja unsuccessfully attempted to rebel. Sandathudama killed most of Shuja's followers, though Shuja himself escaped the massacre.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 21, paragraph 2; pp. 22–24.</ref><ref>Colonel Ba Shin, ''Coming of Islam to Burma down to 1700&nbsp;AD'', Lecture at the Asia History Congress.

King [[Alaungpaya]] (1752–1760) prohibited Muslims from practicing the [[Dhabihah|Islamic method of slaughtering cattle]].<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 10, line 21</ref>

King [[Bodawpaya]] (1782–1819) arrested four prominent Burmese Muslim [[Imam]]s from Myedu and killed them in Ava, the capital, after they refused to eat pork.<ref name="Yegar p. 12">Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 12, paragraph 3</ref> According to the Myedu Muslim and Burma Muslim version, Bodawpaya later apologised for the killings and recognised the Imams as saints.<ref name="Yegar p. 12" /><ref>Siddiq Khan, M., "Captain George Sorrel's Mission to the court of Amarapura, 1793–4", ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Pakistan'' (Dacca); II (1957), pp. 132–140</ref>

=== British rule ===
In 1921, the population of Muslims in Burma was around 500,000.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 29 paragraph 1 and footnote 1; p. 31 lines 1, 2, 11</ref> During British rule, Burmese Muslims were seen as "Indian", as the majority of Indians living in Burma were Muslims, even though the Burmese Muslims were different from Indian Muslims. Thus, Burmese Muslims, Indian Muslims and Indian Hindus were collectively known as "kala".<ref name="Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma">Collis, Maurice, ''Trials in Burma''</ref>

After World War I, there was an upsurge in anti-Indian sentiments.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 32</ref> There were several causes of anti-Indian and anti-Muslim sentiments in Burma. In India, many Buddhists had been persecuted by the [[Mughal empire]]. There was significant job competition between Indian migrants, who were willing to do unpleasant jobs for low income, and the native Burmese. The [[Great Depression]] intensified this competition, aggravating anti-Indian sentiment.<ref name="Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma" /><ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p.111, paragraph 4, lines 8–15; p. 27, paragraph 4, lines 5–7; p. 31, paragraph 2; p. 32, paragraph 4</ref>

'''British Official White Paper'''

He was the judge in Rangoon, eyewitness to the riots, who wrote his book based on the '''British Official White Paper''' given by '''The Simon Commission''' (The Royal Statutory Commission, appointed according to the Law of the Government of India 1919, The Montague-Chelmsford Law.)<ref name="Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma" />

In 1930, [[1930 Rangoon riots|anti-Indian riots were sparked]] by a labour issue at the [[Yangon]] port. After Indian workers at the port went on strike, the British firm [[Stevedore]]s tried to [[Union busting|break the strike]] by hiring Burmese workers. Realizing they'd lose their jobs, the Indian workers returned to work, and Stevedores then laid off the recently hired Burmese workers. The Burmese workers blamed Indian workers for their loss of jobs, and a riot broke out. At the port, at least 200 Indian workers were massacred and dumped into the river. Another 2,000 were injured. Authorities fired upon armed rioters who refused to lay down their weapons, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The riots rapidly spread throughout Burma, targeting Indians and Muslims.<ref name="Maurice Collis, Trials in Burma" /><ref name=SciencePo>{{cite web|first=Egreteau|last=Renaud|title=Burma (Myanmar) 1930–2007|url=https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/printpdf/2864|date=19 October 2009|website=SciencePo|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance – Research Network|accessdate=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824062153/http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/printpdf/2864|archive-date=24 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1938, anti-Muslim riots again broke out in Burma. Moshe Yegar writes that the riots were fanned by anti-British and nationalistic sentiments, but were disguised as anti-Muslim so as not to provoke a response by the British. Nevertheless, the British government responded to the riots and demonstrations. The agitation against Muslims and the British was led by Burmese newspapers.<ref name=SciencePo/><ref>Democratic Voice of Burma, Media conference ( 19–20 July, Oslo) Burmese Media: Past, present and future by U Thaung (Mirror/Kyae Mon news paper Retired Chief Editor)</ref><ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 32, paragraph 4; p. 36, paragraph 1, lines 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15</ref>

Another riot started after a marketplace scuffle between Indians and Burmese. During the "Burma for Burmese" campaign, a violent demonstration took place in Surti Bazaar, a Muslim area.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 36, paragraph 3.</ref> When the police, who were ethnically Indian, tried to break up the demonstration, three monks were injured. Images of monks being injured by ethnically Indian policemen were circulated by Burmese newspapers, provoking riots.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 36, paragraph 4; p. 37 lines 1, 2</ref> Muslim properties, including shops and houses were looted.<ref name=Yegar37/> According to official sources, 204 Muslims were killed and over 1,000 were injured.<ref name=SciencePo/> 113 mosques were damaged.<ref name=Yegar37>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 37, paragraph 2.</ref>

On 22 September 1938, the British Governor set up the Inquiry Committee to investigate the riots.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 38, line 1</ref> It was determined that the discontent was caused by the deterioration in sociopolitical and economic condition of Burmese.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 38, paragraph 2</ref> This report itself was used to incite sectarianism by Burmese newspapers.<ref>Yegar ''Muslims''; p. 38, paragraph 2, lines 12–14</ref>

[[Panlong Subtownship|Panglong]], a Chinese Muslim town in [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], was entirely destroyed by the Japanese invaders in the [[Japanese invasion of Burma]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Forbes |first1=Andrew |last2=Henley |first2=David |date=December 2015 |title='Saharat Tai Doem' Thailand in Shan State, 1941–45 |url=http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&acid=120518152031&aiid=120529165129 |work=CPA Media }}</ref> The [[Hui people|Hui Muslim]] Ma Guanggui became the leader of the Hui Panglong self defense guard created by Su who was sent by the [[Kuomintang]] government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] to fight against the Japanese invasion of Panglong in 1942.

=== Muslims under General Ne Win ===
When General [[Ne Win]] came to power in 1962, the status of Muslims changed. For example, Muslims were expelled from the army.<ref name="irrawaddy.org" /> Muslim communities that segregated themselves from the Buddhist majority faced greater difficulties than those who integrated, potentially forfeiting observance of Islamic laws.<ref name="irrawaddy.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=5380&z=102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127183834/http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=5380&z=102 |archive-date=27 November 2006  }}</ref>

The [[Persecution of Buddhists|anti-Buddhist]] actions of the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan (the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]]) was also used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslims in Burma by Buddhist mobs. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that there was mounting tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in [[Taungoo]] for weeks before it erupted into violence in the middle of May 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in "retaliation" for the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burma-bck4.htm#P103_22688 |title=Taungoo Violence (May 2001): Crackdown on Burmese Muslims (Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, July 2002) |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>

=== 1997 Mandalay riots ===
Tension grew between Buddhists and Muslims during the renovation of a Buddha statue. The bronze Buddha statue in the Maha Muni pagoda, originally from the Arakan, brought to Mandalay by King Bodawpaya in 1784 was renovated by the authorities. The Mahamyat Muni statue was broken open, leaving a gaping hole in the statue, and it was generally presumed that the regime was searching for the Padamya Myetshin, a legendary ruby that ensures victory in war to those who possess it.<ref>Houtman, Gustaaf.

On 16 March 1997, in [[Mandalay]], a mob of 1,000–1,500 Buddhist monks and others shouted anti-Muslim slogans as they targeted mosques, shop-houses, and vehicles that were in the vicinity of mosques for destruction. Looting, the burning religious books, acts of sacrilege, and vandalizing Muslim-owned establishments were also common. At least three people were killed and around 100 monks arrested. The unrest in Mandalay allegedly began after reports of an attempted rape of a girl by Muslim men.<ref>{{cite web|title=Riots in Burmese History|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-805050|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=20 June 2012|quote=On 16 March 1997 beginning at about 3:30 p.m. a mob of 1,000–1,500 Buddhist monks and others shouted anti-Muslim slogans.

Attacks by Buddhist monks spread to the then capital of Myanmar, [[Rangoon]] as well as to the central towns of [[Pegu]], [[Prome]], and [[Toungoo]]. A curfew remains in force in Mandalay until today and the army patrols the streets in many cities. In Mandalay alone, 18 mosques were destroyed and Muslim-owned businesses and property vandalized. Copies of the Qur'an were burnt. The [[Tatmadaw|military junta]] that ruled Myanmar turned a blind eye to the disturbances as hundreds of monks were not stopped from ransacking mosques.<ref name=UMD/>

=== 2001 anti-Muslim riots in Taungoo ===
In 2001, anti-Muslim pamphlets, most notably ''The Fear of Losing One's Race'', were widely distributed by monks. Many Muslims feel that this exacerbated the anti-Muslim feelings that had been provoked by the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] in Afghanistan.<ref>Crackdown on Burmese Muslims, July 2002 http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burmese_muslims.pdf</ref> On 15 May 2001, anti-Muslim riots broke out in Taungoo, Pegu division, resulting in the deaths of about 200 Muslims, in the destruction of 11 mosques and the setting ablaze of over 400 houses. On 15 May, the first day of the anti-Muslim uprisings, about 20 Muslims who were praying in the Han Tha mosque were killed and some were beaten to death by the pro-junta forces. On 17 May, Lt. General Win Myint, Secretary No.&nbsp;3 of the [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]] and deputy Home and Religious minister, arrived in Taungoo and curfew was imposed there until 12 July 2001.<ref>Burma Net News:16 July 2001 http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/200107/msg00034.html</ref> Buddhist monks demanded that the ancient Han Tha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in retaliation for the destruction in Bamiyan.<ref name="hrw.org">Crackdown on Burmese Muslims, Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burma-bck4.htm</ref> On 18 May, the Han Tha mosque and Taungoo Railway station mosque were razed to the ground by bulldozers owned by the SPDC junta.<ref name="hrw.org" /> The mosques in Taungoo remained closed as of May 2002. Muslims have been forced to worship in their homes. Local Muslim leaders complain that they are still harassed. After the violence, many local Muslims moved away from Taungoo to nearby towns and to as far away as Yangon.

{{main|2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots}}
Since March 2013, riots have flared up in various cities in central and eastern Myanmar. The violence has coincided with the rise of the [[969 Movement]] which is a Buddhist nationalist movement against the influx of Islam in traditionally Buddhist Myanmar. Led by Sayadaw U [[Wirathu]], "969" has claimed that he/they do not provoke attacks against Muslim communities, although some people have called him ''the Buddhist Bin Laden"''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Burma's 'bin Laden of Buddhism' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/10177815/Burmas-bin-Laden-of-Buddhism.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> In an open letter, U Wirathu claims he treated both journalist, [[Hannah Beech]]{{clarify|date=December 2015}} and photographer with hospitality during the interview for TIME magazine, and that he "could see deceit and recognize his sweet words for all people's sake." In the letter, he claims he has respect for the Western media, but that the TIME reporter misinterpreted his peaceful intentions. "My preaching is not burning with hatred as you say," U Wirathu says to Beech in his open letter.

== Human rights violations against Rohingya ==
=== Background ===
[[File:Map of Rohingya people in Rakhine State.png|thumb|280px|Rohingya people in Rakhine State]]
According to [[Amnesty International]], the Rohingya Muslim people have continued to suffer from [[human rights]] violations under the [[State Peace and Development Council|Burmese junta]] since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] as a result.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18921960], Muslims in Burma's Rakhine state 'abused' – Amnesty International, 20 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8605669.stm], Desperate Plight of Burma's Rohingya people, 4 June 2010</ref> However, the reality is that the Rohingya people have been oppressed for many years prior to 1978, though perhaps not as significantly. They have lived in [[Myanmar]] for centuries but tensions with Myanmar's Buddhist majority have caused discrimination and harassment. Cases of rape, torture, arbitrary detention, and violence against Rohingya are commonplace, with many incidents going unreported as enforcement officers turn a blind eye. These perpetrators are not solely confined to the local population, but also include the authorities and law enforcers themselves. Tensions increased in 2012, when three Rohingya Muslim men were convicted of raping a local Rakhine Buddhist woman, which led to the [[2012 Rakhine State riots]].<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/death-sentences-muslims-accused-rape-murder-sparked-353800], Myanmar: Three Muslims Sentenced to Death for Rape and Murder of Buddhist Woman, 19 June 2012</ref> There are currently over a million Rohingya people living in Myanmar, however, systemic oppression has led to an increase in migrations. In early 2015 alone, around 25,000 asylum-seekers, consisting of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis, sailed out of the [[Rakhine State]] to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Rohingyas: The most persecuted people on Earth? |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21654124-myanmars-muslim-minority-have-been-attacked-impunity-stripped-vote-and-driven |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=13 June 2015}}</ref> Aside from Bangladesh, majority of asylum-seekers also set out to other South-east Asian countries such as [[Thailand]], but also to [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], which are predominantly Muslim countries. Mass exoduses due to persecution and mass violence, such as the one in 2012, has happened before in 1978 and 1992, with many of the fleeing Rohingya people being marginalised and excluded in host States. They are often not recognised and not protected as refugees, and as a result, they live in extreme poverty, have to resort to illegal employment and are vulnerable to exploitation.<ref>[http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Equal%20Only%20in%20Name%20-%20Malaysia%20-%20Full%20Report.pdf], The Equal Rights Trust & Mahidol University ''Equal Only in Name: The Human Rights of Stateless Rohingya in Malaysia'' at [13].</ref>

=== Legal framework ===
The Rohingya people have been denied Burmese citizenship since the [[Burmese nationality law]] (1982 Citizenship Act) was enacted.<ref name=rohingya>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7872635.stm|title=What drive the Rohingya to sea? |publisher=BBC |date=5 February 2009|accessdate=29 July 2012| author=Jonathan Head }}</ref> The Government of Myanmar claims that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants who arrived during the British colonial era, and were originally [[Bengalis]].<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/malaysia/maybr008-01.htm], Human Rights Watch Report on Malaysia (2000).</ref> The Rohingya that are allowed to stay in Myanmar are considered 'resident foreigners' and not citizens. They are not allowed to travel without official permission and were previously required to sign a commitment not to have more than two children, though the law was not strictly enforced. Many Rohingya children cannot have their birth registered, thus rendering them [[Statelessness|stateless]] from the moment they are born. In 1995, the Government of Myanmar responded to UNHRC's pressure by issuing basic identification cards, which does not mention the bearer's place of birth, to the Rohingya.<ref>[http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908012511/http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf |date=8 September 2017 }}, Chris Lewa ''North Arakan: An Open Prison for the Rohingya in Burma'' FMR 32 at [11].</ref> Without proper identification and documents, the Rohingya people are officially stateless with no state protection and their movements are severely restricted. As a result, they are forced to live in squatter camps and slums.

=== International Conventions ===
Myanmar, otherwise known as Burma at the time, was one of the 48 countries that voted for the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130927221000/http://unyearbook.un.org/1948-49YUN/1948-49_P1_CH5.pdf Yearbook of the United Nations 1948–1949 at [535] Archived from the original (PDF) on 27 September 2013.</ref> Article 2 of the UDHR states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/] Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 2.</ref> Also, Article 5 of the UDHR states that "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]] or punishment."<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/], Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 5.</ref> However, the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] which aims to prevent [[torture]] and other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, around the world, has not been signed nor ratified by Myanmar, as of 2016.<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx], United Nations Convention against Torture.</ref> In addition, Myanmar is also not a party to the [[Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]], which aims to protect stateless individuals<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/3bbb25729.html], Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.</ref> or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) that aims to ensure States respect individual's civil and political rights, which includes but are not limited to, the [[right to life]] and [[freedom of religion]].<ref>[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-4&chapter=4&lang=en], Signatories of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</ref><ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx], International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</ref>

That being said, a number of international treaties have been ratified or acceded to by Myanmar, namely the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (UNCRC), on 2 July 1997 and 15 July 1991 respectively.<ref>[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-8&chapter=4&lang=en], Signatories of Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</ref><ref>[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-11&chapter=4&lang=en], Signatories of Convention on the Rights of the Child.</ref> There are slow but positive developments in recent years. For instance, Myanmar signed (but has not ratified) the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), which protects the [[right to education]], the [[right to health]], and the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], on 16 July 2015.<ref>[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-3&chapter=4&lang=en], Signatories of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</ref>

=== Universal Periodic Review ===
The [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) is a mechanism of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that reviews the human rights records of all UN member States. It is a unique process that is undertaken by the [[Human Rights Council]], which allows each State to recognise key areas of human rights issue that has had progress in the country, and also to identify further steps and efforts that will be taken to meet their international obligations. As a member of the UN, Myanmar is obliged to be involved in the UPR process. On 23 December 2015, a Report of the Working Group on the UPR on Myanmar looked at the current human rights situation in Myanmar and noted that the Government of Myanmar has made positive advances in political, administrative, social and judicial reforms.<ref>[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/290/35/PDF/G1529035.pdf?OpenElement], Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (Myanmar), 23 December 2015</ref> Nonetheless, many States, such as [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[United Kingdom]], expressed concern about, amongst other things, human rights violations against the Rohingya people, as there were still much more room for improvement in this area. For instance, [[Bahrain]] expressed concern about ethnic purification and discrimination against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. It was also noted in the report that the ethnic rights protection law of 2015 would broaden the rights of all ethnic minorities in Myanmar. However, the Government of Myanmar reiterated their stance that there was no minority community in Myanmar under the name of "Rohingya". Nonetheless, the aftermath of the 2012 Rakhine State violence led to the formation of a Commission of Inquiry, which recommended that a central committee be set up for the implementation of stability and development. Since then, the Government has provided humanitarian access, such as food, water and education services, to displaced people around the Rakhine State. In addition, a project for citizenship verification was launched, which granted 900 displaced people citizenships. The Report was concluded by various recommendations from member States, with many of the States suggesting that Myanmar ratify other main human rights treaties that it is not a party to and to further enhance their international obligations towards the Rohingya people.

=== Human rights violations ===
Despite Myanmar's commitment to some international conventions, its domestic laws severely oppresses various minority groups, especially the Rohingya. The 1982 Citizenship Law represents systemic discrimination at a policy level by the Government of Myanmar, which openly denies the Rohingya access to basic human rights such as, access to education, employment, marriage, reproduction and freedom of movement.<ref name="burmacampaign.org.uk">[http://burmacampaign.org.uk/media/International-investigation-urgently-needed-into-human-rights-abuses-against-the-Rohingya.pdf], A Briefing by Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (January 2015).</ref> Rohingya people are also subjected to routine forced labour. Typically, a Rohingya man will have to give up one day a week to work on military or government projects, and one night for sentry duty. The Rohingya have also lost a lot of arable land, which has been confiscated by the military to give to Buddhist settlers from elsewhere in Myanmar.{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=19}}<ref name=rohingya /> The movement of the Rohingya people are strictly limited to only a few surrounding areas and even so, a travel pass is required.<ref name="fmreview.org">[http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908012511/http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf |date=8 September 2017 }} Chris Lewa ''North Arakan: An Open Prison for the Rohingya in Burma'' FMR 32 at [12].</ref> If they travel without permission or overstay the time allowed on their travel pass, they are open to being prosecuted and may even receive jail sentences.

The quality of education and health care in the Rakhine State is undeveloped and inadequate, as compared to other parts of Myanmar. Despite this, the Rohingya severely lack basic access to these services and in addition, international humanitarian agencies are not allowed to train Muslim health workers. As a result, the standard of health is severely lacking and the illiteracy rate amongst the Rohingyas is high, estimated at 80%.<ref>[http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908012511/http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/11-13.pdf |date=8 September 2017 }} Chris Lewa ''North Arakan: An Open Prison for the Rohingya in Burma'' FMR 32 at [13].</ref>

There are growing concerns that a [[genocide]] is occurring against the Rohingya in Myanmar. Research done by scholars in [[Yale Law School]] found empirical evidence that the Rohingya have historically suffered serious and persistent human right abuses, and these actions have increased in frequency in recent years.<ref>[http://www.fortifyrights.org/downloads/Yale_Persecution_of_the_Rohingya_October_2015.pdf], Yale Law School Report ''Persecution of the Rohingya Muslims: Is Genocide Occurring in Myanmar's Rakhine State?''</ref> Since 2012, living conditions and human rights abuses have worsened with reports of beheadings, stabbings, killings, beatings, mass arrests and villages and neighbourhoods being burned to the ground, however, there remains a lack of justice and accountability by the Government of Myanmar, thus representing failure of state protection.<ref name="burmacampaign.org.uk" />

As of 2005, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.<ref>{{cite web

Human rights violations against the Rohingya are not only confined to Myanmar and Bangladesh. The status of the Rohingya is unrecognised in most South-east Asian countries. Although they do not receive the same persecution in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, than in Myanmar, they are subjected to exclusions and poverty. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. On February 2009, there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February, there were reports that of a group of five boats were towed out to open sea, of which four boats sank in a storm, and one washed up on the shore. On 12 February 2009 Thailand's prime minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] said there were "some instances" in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.

<blockquote>There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It's not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account.<ref>{{cite web|author= Dan Rivers CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/thailand.refugees.admission/index.html |title=Thai PM admits boat people pushed out to sea |publisher=CNN |accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

October 2015, [[Al Jazeera]]'s Investigative Unit has uncovered what amounts to strong evidence of a [[genocide]] coordinated by the [[Myanmar]] government against the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] people. Based on many evidences, the investigation concluded that Myanmar government agents have been involved in triggering anti-Muslim riots. An official military document shows the use of several ways, including [[hate speech]] and hiring thugs to stir hatred. The investigation stressed that in the case of the Rohingya, and [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] State, that could amount to the crime of genocide, several of the most powerful people in the country should reasonably be the subject of an international investigation into this situation of Rakhine State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/exclusive-strong-evidence-genocide-myanmar-151024190547465.html|title=Exclusive: 'Strong evidence' of genocide in Myanmar|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref>

Those who have made it to the border have walked for days, hiding in jungles and crossing mountains and rivers. Many are sick and some have bullet wounds. Aid agencies have warned of a growing humanitarian crisis in overstretched border camps, where water, food rations and medical supplies are running out of stock. Most refugees are now living in established camps, makeshift settlements or sheltering in host communities. Nearly 50,000 are in new spontaneous settlements that have sprung up along the border, where access to services is especially limited.There are also fears for Rohingya people trapped in conflict zones. On 4 September, the UN said its aid agencies had been blocked from supplying life-saving supplies such as food, water and medicine to thousands of civilians in northern Rakhine state. In November 2018, Foreign Secretary Myint Thu explained that Myanmar is ready to take in 2,000 Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh camps over the coming month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/regional/myanmar-prepares-for-the-repatriation-of-2000-rohingya|title=Myanmar prepares for the repatriation of 2,000 Rohingya|website=The Thaiger|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== International response ===
There is a lack of co-operation between Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, with regards to the Rohingya crisis. In May 2015, as many as 8,000 Rohingya "[[boat people]]" were believed to be stranded in rickety boats at sea, with little food and unsanitary conditions, and were left in limbo as countries refused the boats to dock.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/14/southeast-asia-end-rohingya-boat-pushbacks], Human Rights News ''Southeast Asia: End Rohingya Boat Pushbacks'' (14 May 2015).</ref> Critics have accused South-east Asian governments of playing "human ping-pong" by refusing permission for these refugee boats to land and instead, pushing them back out to sea in the direction of other countries.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/11596731/Malaysia-detains-more-than-a-thousand-Bangladeshi-and-Rohingya-refugees-after-rescue.html], The Telegraph ''Malaysia detains more than a thousand Bangladeshi and Rohingya refugees after rescue'' (11 May 2015).</ref> Though at various times in the past these countries of flight have been accepting of Rohingya refugees, most of them have not signed nor ratified the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (1951 Refugee Convention) and the [[Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]], thus the rights of the Rohingya people as refugee cannot be ensured.<ref>[http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Equal%20Only%20in%20Name%20-%20Malaysia%20-%20Full%20Report.pdf] The Equal Rights Trust & Mahidol University ''Equal Only in Name: The Human Rights of Stateless Rohingya in Malaysia'' at [18].</ref>

Rasheduzzaman, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, said the reformist administration of Myanmar is said to be democratic; however, there were no signs that its strategy on the Rohingya would see an improvement soon. Indeed, even the opposition democratic pioneer Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been kept under house arrest for nearly 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, is quiet on it.

Rohingya Muslims are a small/minority group of people in Myanmar Burma. Rohingya Muslims have been exposed to methodical harassment and serious human right misuses by authorities for years. On 25 August 2017 the struggle had created an unparalleled humanitarian disaster with over half a million families in worried need of shelter, food, and water. This disaster caused more than 2 thousand Rohingya Muslims to leave their houses and live in camps. These Rohingya Muslims have no freedom of movement, access to food, water, healthcare, and education. Meanwhile, there were Muslim women who were raped by the army and the common men and then they were killed by them.

Iran and Turkey are two Muslim countries which helped and aid the Rohingyas Muslims who became homeless and landless by the people of Myanmar (Buddhist). The president of Iran is Hassan Rouhani and the Turkish president is Recap Tayyip Erdogan. Among all the other Muslim countries and communities these two countries were more sensitive and sympathetic about the Rohingyas Muslims. They both asked and spoke to the organization of Islamic cooperation and asked them to find a solution and end the violence against the poor people especially women and children. These two presidents are more worried about the life, healthcare, food, and mainly the water problem which Rohingyas Muslims are facing.

After the attack on Rohingyas Muslims which was done by the Myanmar army, they were supposed to leave their homes and villages and they had to go somewhere else, therefore they started moving to Bangladesh. During their move to Bangladesh, they had to cross the rivers with the small babies. When they were moving to Bangladesh both of the countries Iran and Turkey they helped them with necessary things like food, water, and other things.

On 28 September 2018, [[Sheikh Hasina]] the president of Bangladesh spoke at the 73rd united nations General Assembly. She said there are 1.1 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/09/27/bangladesh-point-finger-at-myanmar-for-rohingya-genocide.html Bangladesh point finger at Myanmar for Rohingya 'genocide']</ref>
