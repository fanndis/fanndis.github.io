A '''CT scan''' or '''computed tomography scan''' (formerly known as a '''computed axial tomography''' or '''CAT scan''') is a medical [[image|imaging]] [[Scientific technique|technique]] that uses computer-processed combinations of multiple [[X-ray]] measurements taken from different angles to produce [[Tomography |tomographic]] (cross-sectional) images (virtual "slices") of a body, allowing the user to see inside the body without cutting. The personnel that perform CT scans are called ''[[radiographer]]s'' or ''radiologic technologists''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arrt.org/Patient-Public/Patient-Page |title=Patient Page |website= ARRT – The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141109192141/https://www.arrt.org/Patient-Public/Patient-Page |archive-date=9 November 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asrt.org/main/standards-regulations/state-legislative-affairs/individual-state-licensure-info | title=Individual State Licensure Information | publisher=American Society of Radiologic Technologists | access-date=19 July 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718215951/http://www.asrt.org/main/standards-regulations/state-legislative-affairs/individual-state-licensure-info | archive-date=18 July 2013 }}</ref> 

The 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded jointly to South African American physicist [[Allan M. Cormack]] and British electrical engineer [[Godfrey N.

Initially, the images generated in CT scans were in the [[transverse plane|transverse]] (axial) [[anatomical plane]], perpendicular to the long axis of the body. Modern scanners allow the scan data to be reformatted as images in other [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]s. [[Geometry processing|Digital geometry processing]] can generate a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of an object inside the body from a series of two-dimensional [[radiography|radiographic]] images taken by [[rotation around a fixed axis]].<ref name="ref1">Herman, G.

==Medical use==
Since its introduction in the 1970s, CT has become an important tool in [[medical imaging]] to supplement [[X-ray]]s and [[medical ultrasonography]]. It has more recently been used for [[preventive medicine]] or [[screening (medicine)|screening]] for disease, for example [[Ct colonography|CT colonography]] for people with a high risk of [[colon cancer]], or full-motion heart scans for people with high risk of heart disease. A number of institutions offer [[full-body scan]]s for the general population although this practice goes against the advice and official position of many professional organizations in the field primarily due to the [[radiation dose]] applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hps.org/documents/ctscreening_ps018-0.pdf|title=CT Screening|website=hps.org|access-date=1 May 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013203907/http://hps.org/documents/ctscreening_ps018-0.pdf|archive-date=13 October 2016}}</ref>

CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect [[infarction]], tumors, [[calcification]]s, [[haemorrhage]], and bone trauma. Of the above, [[hypodense]] (dark) structures can indicate [[edema]] and infarction, hyperdense (bright) structures indicate calcifications and haemorrhage and bone trauma can be seen as disjunction in bone windows. Tumors can be detected by the swelling and anatomical distortion they cause, or by surrounding edema. Ambulances equipped with small bore multi-slice CT scanners respond to cases involving stroke or head trauma. CT scanning of the head is also used in CT-[[image guided surgery|guided]] [[stereotactic surgery]] and [[radiosurgery]] for treatment of intracranial tumors, [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the [[N-localizer]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Galloway | first1 = RL Jr. | editor1-last = Golby | editor1-first = AJ | title = Image-Guided Neurosurgery | chapter = Introduction and Historical Perspectives on Image-Guided Surgery | pages = 3–4 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Tse | first1 = VCK | last2 = Kalani | first2 = MYS | last3 = Adler | first3 = JR | editor1-last = Chin | editor1-first = LS | editor2-last = Regine | editor2-first = WF |title = Principles and Practice of Stereotactic Radiosurgery | chapter = Techniques of Stereotactic Localization | page = 28 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Saleh | first1 = H | last2 = Kassas | first2 = B | editor1-last = Benedict | editor1-first = SH | editor2-last = Schlesinger | editor2-first = DJ | editor3-last = Goetsch | editor3-first = SJ | editor4-last = Kavanagh | editor4-first = BD |title = Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy | chapter = Developing Stereotactic Frames for Cranial Treatment | pages = 156–159 | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Khan | first1 = FR | last2 = Henderson | first2 = JM | editor1-last = Lozano | editor1-first = AM | editor2-last = Hallet | editor2-first = M |title = Brain Stimulation: Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 116 |chapter = Deep Brain Stimulation Surgical Techniques | pages = 28–30 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Arle | first = J | editor1-last = Lozano | editor1-first = AM | editor2-last = Gildenberg | editor2-first = PL | editor3-last = Tasker | editor3-first = RR |title = Textbook of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery | chapter = Development of a Classic: the Todd-Wells Apparatus, the BRW, and the CRW Stereotactic Frames | pages = 456–461 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown RA, Nelson JA |title=Invention of the N-localizer for stereotactic neurosurgery and its use in the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=70 |issue=2 Supplement Operative |pages=173–176 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22186842 |doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e318246a4f7|s2cid=36350612 }}</ref>

A CT scan can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|lung parenchyma]], the tissue of the [[lung]]s. It is particularly relevant here because normal two-dimensional X-rays do not show such defects. A variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality. For evaluation of chronic interstitial processes such as [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and [[Pulmonary fibrosis#|fibrosis]], thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstructions are used; often scans are performed both on inspiration and expiration. This special technique is called [[high resolution CT]] that produces a sampling of the lung, and not continuous images.

{{Main|Computed tomography angiography}}

[[Computed tomography angiography]] (CTA) is [[contrast CT]] to visualize the [[arteries]] and [[vein]]s throughout the body.  This ranges from arteries serving the [[brain]] to those bringing blood to the [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s. An example of this type of exam is [[CT pulmonary angiogram]] (CTPA) used to diagnose [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE).

The main forms of cardiac CT scanning are:
*[[Coronary CT angiography]] (CTA): the use of CT to assess the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] of the [[heart]]. The subject receives an [[intravenous injection]] of [[radiocontrast]], and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually in order to diagnose coronary artery disease.
*[[Coronary CT calcium scan]]: also used for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of heart attack.<ref name=mayo>{{cite web|title=Heart scan (coronary calcium scan)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/basics/definition/prc-20015000|publisher=Mayo Clinic|access-date=9 August 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905084216/http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/basics/definition/prc-20015000|archive-date=5 September 2015}}</ref> A typical coronary CT calcium scan is done without the use of radiocontrast, but it can possibly be done from contrast-enhanced images as well.<ref name="van der BijlJoemai2010">{{cite journal|last1=van der Bijl|first1=Noortje|last2=Joemai|first2=Raoul M.

{{main|Abdominal and pelvic CT}}
CT is an accurate technique for diagnosis of [[Human abdomen|abdominal]] diseases. Its uses include diagnosis and staging of cancer, as well as follow up after cancer treatment to assess response. It is commonly used to investigate [[acute abdominal pain]].

===Axial skeleton and extremities===
[[File:Computed tomographs of normal cervical vertebrae (thumbnail).jpg|thumb|link=Commons:Scrollable computed tomography images of normal cervical vertebrae|Normal cervical vertebrae {{noprint|[[Commons:Scrollable computed tomography images of normal cervical vertebrae|(Click here to scroll through the image stacks)]]}}]]
For the [[axial skeleton]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]], CT is often used to image complex [[fracture (bone)|fracture]]s, especially ones around joints, because of its ability to reconstruct the area of interest in multiple planes. Fractures, ligamentous injuries, and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocations]] can easily be recognised with a 0.2&nbsp;mm resolution.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00391| title=Ankle Fractures| publisher=American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons| website=orthoinfo.aaos.org| access-date=30 May 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530103553/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00391| archive-date=30 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Musculoskeletal Imaging with Multislice CT| author= Buckwalter, Kenneth A. | journal=American Journal of Roentgenology| volume=176| issue=4| pages=979–986| date=11 September 2000|display-authors=etal| doi=10.2214/ajr.176.4.1760979| pmid=11264094}}</ref> With modern dual-energy CT scanners, new areas of use have been established, such as aiding in the diagnosis of [[gout]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ramon|first1=André|last2=Bohm-Sigrand|first2=Amélie|last3=Pottecher|first3=Pierre|last4=Richette|first4=Pascal|last5=Maillefert|first5=Jean-Francis|last6=Devilliers|first6=Herve|last7=Ornetti|first7=Paul|date=2018-03-01|title=Role of dual-energy CT in the diagnosis and follow-up of gout: systematic analysis of the literature|journal=Clinical Rheumatology|volume=37|issue=3|pages=587–595|doi=10.1007/s10067-017-3976-z|pmid=29350330|s2cid=3686099|issn=0770-3198}}</ref>

== Geological use ==
X-ray CT is used in geological studies to quickly reveal materials inside a drill core.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/chikyu/e/about/laboratory.html|title=Laboratory {{!}} About Chikyu {{!}} The Deep-sea Scientific Drilling Vessel CHIKYU|website=www.jamstec.go.jp|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> Dense minerals such as pyrite and barite appear brighter and less dense components such as clay appear dull in CT images.

== Cultural heritage use ==
X-ray CT and [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] can also be used for the conservation and preservation of objects of cultural heritage. For many fragile objects, direct research and observation can be damaging and can degrade the object over time. Using CT scans, conservators and researchers are able to determine the material composition of the objects they are exploring, such as the position of ink along the layers of a scroll, without any additional harm. These scans have been optimal for research focused on the workings of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] or the text hidden inside the charred outer layers of the [[En-Gedi Scroll]]. However, they are not optimal for every object subject to these kinds of research questions, as there are certain artifacts like the [[Herculaneum papyri]] in which the material composition has very little variation along the inside of the object. After scanning these objects, computational methods can be employed to examine the insides of these objects, as was the case with the virtual unwrapping of the [[En-Gedi Scroll#Recovery|En-Gedi scroll]] and the [[Herculaneum papyri#Virtual unrolling|Herculaneum papyri]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seales|first1=W.

==Advantages==
CT scanning has several advantages over traditional [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] medical [[radiography]]. First, CT eliminates the superimposition of images of structures outside the area of interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Second, CT scans have greater [[image resolution]], enabling examination of finer details.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} CT can distinguish between [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s that differ in radiographic [[density]] by  1% or less.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Third, CT scanning enables multiplanar reformatted imaging: scan data can be visualized in the [[transverse plane|transverse (or axial)]], [[Coronal plane|coronal]], or [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] plane, depending on the diagnostic task.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The improved resolution of CT has permitted the development of new investigations. For example, CT [[angiography]] avoids the invasive insertion of a [[catheter]]. CT scanning can perform a [[virtual colonoscopy]] with greater accuracy and less discomfort for the patient than a traditional [[colonoscopy]].<ref name="Heiken">{{cite journal | last=Heiken | first=JP |author2=Peterson CM |author3=Menias CO  | title=Virtual colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening: current status: Wednesday 5 October 2005, 14:00–16:00 | journal=Cancer Imaging | volume=5 | issue=Spec No A | pages=S133–S139 | publisher=International Cancer Imaging Society | date=November 2005 | pmid=16361129 | doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2005.0108 | pmc=1665314 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16106357">{{cite journal |author=Bielen DJ |title=Clinical validation of high-resolution fast spin-echo MR colonography after colon distention with air |journal=J Magn Reson Imaging |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=400–5 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16106357 |doi=10.1002/jmri.20397 |name-list-style=vanc|author2=Bosmans HT |author3=De Wever LL |display-authors=3 |last4=Maes |first4=Frederik |last5=Tejpar |first5=Sabine |last6=Vanbeckevoort |first6=Dirk |last7=Marchal |first7=Guy J.F.}}</ref> Virtual colonography is far more accurate than a [[barium enema]] for detection of tumors and uses a lower radiation dose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} CT VC is increasingly being used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and US as a screening test for colon polyps and colon cancer and can negate the need for a [[colonoscopy]] in some cases.

People with mild kidney impairment are usually advised to ensure full hydration for several hours before and after the injection. For moderate kidney failure, the use of  [[iodinated contrast]] should be avoided; this may mean using an alternative technique instead of CT. Those with severe [[kidney failure]] requiring [[dialysis]] require less strict precautions, as their kidneys have so little function remaining that any further damage would not be noticeable and the dialysis will remove the contrast agent; it is normally recommended, however, to arrange dialysis as soon as possible following contrast administration to minimize any adverse effects of the contrast.

In addition to the use of intravenous contrast, orally administered contrast agents are frequently used when examining the abdomen. These are frequently the same as the intravenous contrast agents, merely diluted to approximately 10% of the concentration. However, oral alternatives to iodinated contrast exist, such as very dilute (0.5–1% w/v) [[barium sulfate]] suspensions. Dilute barium sulfate has the advantage that it does not cause allergic-type reactions or kidney failure, but cannot be used in patients with suspected bowel perforation or suspected bowel injury, as leakage of barium sulfate from damaged bowel can cause fatal [[peritonitis]].

{{Main|Operation of computed tomography}}
Computed tomography operates by using an [[X-ray generator]] that rotates around the object; [[X-ray detector]]s are positioned on the opposite side of the circle from the X-ray source. A visual representation of the raw data obtained is called a sinogram, yet it is not sufficient for interpretation. Once the scan data has been acquired, the data must be processed using a form of [[tomographic reconstruction]], which produces a series of cross-sectional images. [[Pixel]]s in an image obtained by CT scanning are displayed in terms of relative [[radiodensity]]. The pixel itself is displayed according to the mean [[attenuation]] of the tissue(s) that it corresponds to on a scale from +3,071 (most attenuating) to −1,024 (least attenuating) on the [[Hounsfield scale]]. [[Pixel]] is a two dimensional unit based on the matrix size and the field of view. When the CT slice thickness is also factored in, the unit is known as a [[voxel]], which is a three-dimensional unit. The phenomenon that one part of the detector cannot differentiate between different tissues is called the ''partial volume effect''. This means that a big amount of cartilage and a thin layer of compact bone can cause the same attenuation in a voxel as hyperdense cartilage alone. Water has an attenuation of 0 [[Hounsfield units]] (HU), while air is −1,000&nbsp;HU, cancellous bone is typically +400&nbsp;HU, and cranial bone can reach 2,000&nbsp;HU or more (os temporale) and can cause [[artifact (error)#Medical imaging|artifacts]]. The attenuation of metallic implants depends on the atomic number of the element used: Titanium usually has an amount of +1000&nbsp;HU, iron steel can completely extinguish the X-ray and is, therefore, responsible for well-known line-artifacts in computed tomograms. Artifacts are caused by abrupt transitions between low- and high-density materials, which results in data values that exceed the dynamic range of the processing electronics. Two-dimensional CT images are conventionally rendered so that the view is as though looking up at it from the patient's feet.<ref name="auto">[http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/ctanatomy/extrem/index.html Computerized Tomography chapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001946/http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/ctanatomy/extrem/index.html |date=2016-03-04 }} at [[University of Connecticut Health Center]].</ref> Hence, the left side of the image is to the patient's right and vice versa, while anterior in the image also is the patient's anterior and vice versa. This left-right interchange corresponds to the view that physicians generally have in reality when positioned in front of patients. CT data sets have a very high [[dynamic range]] which must be reduced for display or printing. This is typically done via a process of "windowing", which maps a range (the "window") of pixel values to a grayscale ramp. For example, CT images of the brain are commonly viewed with a window extending from 0 HU to 80 HU. Pixel values of 0 and lower, are displayed as black; values of 80 and higher are displayed as white; values within the window are displayed as a grey intensity proportional to position within the window. The window used for display must be matched to the X-ray density of the object of interest, in order to optimize the visible detail.

===Contrast===
{{Main|Contrast CT}}
[[Contrast media]] used for X-ray CT, as well as for [[radiography|plain film X-ray]], are called [[radiocontrast]]s. Radiocontrasts for X-ray CT are, in general, iodine-based.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=W. Richard|last2=Brant|first2=William E.|last3=Major|first3=Nancy M.|title=Fundamentals of Body CT|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323263580|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcjsAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA152}}</ref> This is useful to highlight structures such as blood vessels that otherwise would be difficult to delineate from their surroundings. Using contrast material can also help to obtain functional information about tissues. Often, images are taken both with and without radiocontrast.

The table reports average radiation exposures, however, there can be a wide variation in radiation doses between similar scan types, where the highest dose could be as much as 22 times higher than the lowest dose.<ref name=Furlow2010/>  A typical plain film X-ray involves radiation dose of 0.01 to 0.15&nbsp;mGy, while a typical CT can involve 10–20&nbsp;mGy for specific organs, and can go up to 80&nbsp;mGy for certain specialized CT scans.<ref name="crfdr">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall EJ, Brenner DJ | title = Cancer risks from diagnostic radiology | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 81 | issue = 965 | pages = 362–78 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18440940 | doi = 10.1259/bjr/01948454 }}</ref>

[[Lead]] is the main material used by radiography personnel for [[shielding (radiography)|shielding]] against scattered X-rays.

===Radiation dose units===
The radiation dose reported in the [[Gray (unit)|gray or mGy]] unit is proportional to the amount of energy that the irradiated body part is expected to absorb, and the physical effect (such as DNA [[double strand breaks]]) on the cells' chemical bonds by X-ray radiation is proportional to that energy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Polo SE, Jackson SP | title = Dynamics of DNA damage response proteins at DNA breaks: a focus on protein modifications | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 409–33 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21363960 | pmc = 3049283 | doi = 10.1101/gad.2021311 }}</ref>

The [[sievert]] unit is used in the report of the [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]]. The sievert unit, in the context of CT scans, does not correspond to the actual radiation dose that the scanned body part absorbs but to another radiation dose of another scenario, the whole body absorbing the other radiation dose and the other radiation dose being of a magnitude, estimated to have the same probability to induce cancer as the CT scan.<ref>[http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_96.pdf The Measurement, Reporting, and Management of Radiation Dose in CT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623014823/https://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_96.pdf |date=2017-06-23 }} "It is a single dose parameter that reflects the risk of a nonuniform exposure in terms of an equivalent whole-body exposure."</ref> Thus, as is shown in the table above, the actual radiation that is absorbed by a scanned body part is often much larger than the effective dose suggests. A specific measure, termed the [[computed tomography dose index]] (CTDI), is commonly used as an estimate of the radiation absorbed dose for tissue within the scan region, and is automatically computed by medical CT scanners.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill B, Venning AJ, Baldock C | year = 2005 | title = A preliminary study of the novel application of normoxic polymer gel dosimeters for the measurement of CTDI on diagnostic X-ray CT scanners | journal = Medical Physics | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 1589–1597 | doi=10.1118/1.1925181| pmid = 16013718 | bibcode = 2005MedPh..32.1589H }}</ref>

The [[equivalent dose]] is the effective dose of a case, in which the whole body would actually absorb the same radiation dose, and the sievert unit is used in its report. In the case of non-uniform radiation, or radiation given to only part of the body, which is common for CT examinations, using the local equivalent dose alone would overstate the biological risks to the entire organism.

===Effects of radiation===
{{See|Radiobiology}}
Most adverse health effects of radiation exposure may be grouped in two general categories:
*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to the killing/ malfunction of cells following high doses; and
*stochastic effects, i.e., cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.<ref>Paragraph 55 in: {{cite web|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|website=[[International Commission on Radiological Protection]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116084754/http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP+Publication+103|archive-date=2012-11-16}} Ann. ICRP 37 (2-4)</ref>

The added lifetime risk of developing cancer by a single abdominal CT of 8 mSv is estimated to be 0.05%, or 1 one in 2,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-ct-scans-cause-cancer|title=Do CT scans cause cancer?|date=March 2013|website=[[Harvard Medical School]]|access-date=2017-12-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209152338/https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-ct-scans-cause-cancer|archive-date=2017-12-09}}</ref>

Because of increased susceptibility of fetuses to radiation exposure, the radiation dosage of a CT scan is an important consideration in the choice of [[medical imaging in pregnancy]].

===Excess doses===
In October, 2009, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) initiated an investigation of brain perfusion CT (PCT) scans, based on [[radiation burn]]s caused by incorrect settings at one particular facility for this particular type of CT scan. Over 256 patients over an 18-month period were exposed, over 40% lost patches of hair, and prompted the editorial to call for increased CT quality assurance programs, while also noting that "while unnecessary radiation exposure should be avoided, a medically needed CT scan obtained with appropriate acquisition parameter has benefits that outweigh the radiation risks."<ref name=Furlow2010>{{cite journal | author = Furlow B | title = Radiation dose in computed tomography | journal = Radiologic Technology | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 437–50 | date = May–Jun 2010 | pmid = 20445138 | url = http://www.northernradiology.com/assets/Imaging%20Services/Images/furlow%20ct%20scan%20info.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wintermark M, Lev MH | title = FDA investigates the safety of brain perfusion CT | journal = AJNR Am J Neuroradiol | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–3 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19892810 | doi = 10.3174/ajnr.A1967 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Similar problems have been reported at other centers.<ref name=Furlow2010/> These incidents are believed to be due to [[human error]].<ref name=Furlow2010/>

===Campaigns===
In response to increased concern by the public and the ongoing progress of best practices, The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging was formed within the [[Society for Pediatric Radiology]]. In concert with The [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], The [[American College of Radiology]] and The [[American Association of Physicists in Medicine]], the Society for Pediatric Radiology developed and launched the Image Gently Campaign which is designed to maintain high quality imaging studies while using the lowest doses and best radiation safety practices available on pediatric patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pedrad.org/associations/5364/ig/?page=365 |title=Image Gently |publisher=The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging |access-date=19 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609063515/http://www.pedrad.org/associations/5364/ig/?page=365 |archive-date=9 June 2013 }}</ref> This initiative has been endorsed and applied by a growing list of various professional medical organizations around the world and has received support and assistance from companies that manufacture equipment used in Radiology.

Following upon the success of the ''Image Gently'' campaign, the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists have launched a similar campaign to address this issue in the adult population called ''Image Wisely''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imagewisely.org/ | title=Image Wisely | publisher=Joint Task Force on Adult Radiation Protection | access-date=19 July 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721032437/http://imagewisely.org/ | archive-date=21 July 2013 }}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) of the United Nations have also been working in this area and have ongoing projects designed to broaden best practices and lower patient radiation dose.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://new.paho.org/hq10/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3365&Itemid=2164 | title=Optimal levels of radiation for patients | publisher=World Health Organization | access-date=19 July 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525051814/http://new.paho.org/hq10/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3365&Itemid=2164 | archive-date=25 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/about/GI_TM_Report_2008_Dec.pdf | title=Global Initiative on Radiation Safety in Healthcare Settings | publisher=World Health Organization | access-date=19 July 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029171805/http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/about/GI_TM_Report_2008_Dec.pdf | archive-date=29 October 2013 }}</ref>

Use of CT has increased dramatically over the last two decades.<ref name=Smith2009/> An estimated 72&nbsp;million scans were performed in the United States in 2007.<ref name=Berrington2009/> Of these, six to eleven percent are done in children,<ref name=Risk2011/> an increase of seven to eightfold from 1980.<ref name=Furlow2010/> Similar increases have been seen in Europe and Asia.<ref name=Furlow2010/>  In Calgary, Canada 12.1% of people who present to the emergency with an urgent complaint received a CT scan, most commonly either of the head or of the abdomen.

The increased use of CT scans has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of [[appendicitis]]).<ref name="Brenner2007" /> As of 2007 in the United States a proportion of CT scans are performed unnecessarily.<ref name=Semelka2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Semelka RC, Armao DM, Elias J, Huda W | title = Imaging strategies to reduce the risk of radiation in CT studies, including selective substitution with MRI | journal = J Magn Reson Imaging | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 900–9 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17457809 | doi = 10.1002/jmri.20895 }}</ref> Some estimates place this number at 30%.<ref name=Risk2011/> There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public.<ref name=Semelka2007/> For example, some healthy people avidly pay to receive full-body CT scans as [[screening (medicine)|screening]], but it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs, because deciding whether and how to treat [[incidentaloma]]s is fraught with complexity, radiation exposure is cumulative and not negligible, and the money for the scans involves [[opportunity cost]] (it may have been more effectively spent on more targeted screening or other health care strategies).<ref name=Semelka2007/>

The result of a CT scan is a volume of [[voxel]]s, which may be presented to a human observer by various methods, which broadly fit into the following categories:
*Thin slice. This is generally regarded as planes representing a thickness of less than 3&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Goldman2008">{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=L.

Technically, all volume renderings become projections when viewed on a [[Display device#Full-area 2-dimensional displays|2-dimensional display]], making the distinction between projections and volume renderings a bit vague. Still, the epitomes of volume rendering models feature a mix of for example coloring<ref name="SilversteinParsad2008">{{cite journal|last1=Silverstein|first1=Jonathan C.|last2=Parsad|first2=Nigel M.|last3=Tsirline|first3=Victor|title=Automatic perceptual color map generation for realistic volume visualization|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|volume=41|issue=6|year=2008|pages=927–935|issn=1532-0464|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.02.008|pmid=18430609|pmc=2651027}}</ref> and shading<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zndnSzkfkXwC&pg=PA185 Page 185] {{cite book|title=Vision, Modeling, and Visualization 2006: Proceedings, November 22-24|author=Leif Kobbelt|publisher=IOS Press|year=2006|isbn=9783898380812}}</ref> in order to create realistic and observable representations.

Two-dimensional CT images are conventionally rendered so that the view is as though looking up at it from the patient's feet.<ref name="auto"/> Hence, the left side of the image is to the patient's right and vice versa, while anterior in the image also is the patient's anterior and vice versa. This left-right interchange corresponds to the view that physicians generally have in reality when positioned in front of patients.

===Grayscale===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[Pixel]]s in an image obtained by CT scanning are displayed in terms of relative [[radiodensity]]. The pixel itself is displayed according to the mean [[attenuation]] of the tissue(s) that it corresponds to on a scale from +3,071 (most attenuating) to −1,024 (least attenuating) on the [[Hounsfield scale]]. [[Pixel]] is a two dimensional unit based on the matrix size and the field of view. When the CT slice thickness is also factored in, the unit is known as a [[Voxel]], which is a three-dimensional unit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Brant and Helms' fundamentals of diagnostic radiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=9781496367389 |pages=1600 |edition=Fifth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63xxDwAAQBAJ |access-date=24 January 2019|date=2018-07-19 }}</ref> The phenomenon that one part of the detector cannot differentiate between different tissues is called the ''"Partial Volume Effect"''. That means that a big amount of cartilage and a thin layer of compact bone can cause the same attenuation in a voxel as hyperdense cartilage alone. Water has an attenuation of 0 [[Hounsfield units]] (HU), while air is −1,000&nbsp;HU, cancellous bone is typically +400&nbsp;HU, and cranial bone can reach 2,000&nbsp;HU or more (os temporale) and can cause artifacts. The attenuation of metallic implants depends on the atomic number of the element used: Titanium usually has an amount of +1000&nbsp;HU, iron steel can completely extinguish the X-ray and is, therefore, responsible for well-known line-artifacts in computed tomograms. Artifacts are caused by abrupt transitions between low- and high-density materials, which results in data values that exceed the dynamic range of the processing electronics.

CT data sets have a very high [[dynamic range]] which must be reduced for display or printing. This is typically done via a process of "windowing", which maps a range (the "window") of pixel values to a grayscale ramp. For example, CT images of the brain are commonly viewed with a window extending from 0 HU to 80 HU. Pixel values of 0 and lower, are displayed as black; values of 80 and higher are displayed as white; values within the window are displayed as a grey intensity proportional to position within the window. The window used for display must be matched to the X-ray density of the object of interest, in order to optimize the visible detail.

===Multiplanar reconstruction and projections===
[[Image:Ct-workstation-neck.jpg|thumb|Typical screen layout for diagnostic software, showing one volume rendering (VR) and multiplanar view of three thin slices in the [[axial plane|axial]] (upper right), [[sagittal plane|sagittal]] (lower left), and [[coronal plane]]s (lower left)]]
[[File:CT of spondylosis causing radiculopathy.png|thumb|Special planes are sometimes useful, such as this oblique longitudinal plane in order to visualize the neuroforamina of the vertebral column, showing narrowing at two levels, causing [[radiculopathy]]. The smaller images are axial plane slices.]]
Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) is the creation of slices in more [[anatomical plane]]s than the one (usually [[Transverse plane|transverse]]) used for initial tomography acquisition. It can be used for thin slices as well as projections. Multiplanar reconstruction is feasible because contemporary CT scanners offer [[isotropy|isotropic]] or near isotropic resolution.<ref name="ref3">

MPR is frequently used for examining the spine. Axial images through the spine will only show one vertebral body at a time and cannot reliably show the intervertebral discs. By reformatting the volume, it becomes much easier to visualise the position of one vertebral body in relation to the others.

Modern software allows reconstruction in non-orthogonal (oblique) planes so that the optimal plane can be chosen to display an anatomical structure. This may be particularly useful for visualization of the structure of the bronchi as these do not lie orthogonal to the direction of the scan.

For vascular imaging, curved-plane reconstruction can be performed. This allows bends in a vessel to be "straightened" so that the entire length can be visualised on one image, or a short series of images. Once a vessel has been "straightened" in this way, quantitative measurements of length and cross sectional area can be made, so that surgery or interventional treatment can be planned.

==={{anchor|3D}} Volume rendering===
{{Main|Volume rendering}}

A threshold value of radiodensity is set by the operator (e.g., a level that corresponds to bone). From this, a three-dimensional model can be constructed using [[edge detection]] image processing algorithms and displayed on screen. Multiple models can be constructed from various thresholds, allowing different colors to represent each anatomical component such as bone, muscle, and cartilage. However, the interior structure of each element is not visible in this mode of operation.

Surface rendering is limited in that it will display only surfaces that meet a threshold density, and will display only the surface that is closest to the imaginary viewer. In [[volume rendering]], transparency, colors and [[Phong shading|shading]] are used to allow a better representation of the volume to be shown in a single image. For example, the bones of the pelvis could be displayed as semi-transparent, so that, even at an oblique angle, one part of the image does not conceal another.

==Image quality==
[[File:3d CT scan animation.gif|thumb|A series of CT scans converted into an animated image using Photoshop]]

===Artifacts===
Although images produced by CT are generally faithful representations of the scanned volume, the technique is susceptible to a number of [[artifact (error)#Medical imaging|artifacts]], such as the following:<ref name="ref1"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bhowmik|first=Ujjal Kumar |author2=Zafar Iqbal, M. |author3=Adhami, Reza R. |title=Mitigating motion artifacts in FDK based 3D Cone-beam Brain Imaging System using markers|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=28 May 2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=369–382|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0011-7|bibcode = 2012CEJE....2..369B |doi-access=free}}</ref><sup>Chapters 3 and 5</sup>

;{{Visible anchor|Streak artifact}}: Streaks are often seen around materials that block most X-rays, such as metal or bone. Numerous factors contribute to these streaks: undersampling, photon starvation, motion, beam hardening, and [[Compton scatter]]. This type of artifact commonly occurs in the posterior fossa of the brain, or if there are metal implants. The streaks can be reduced using newer reconstruction techniques<ref name="P. Jin and C. A.

;Partial volume effect: This appears as "blurring" of edges. It is due to the scanner being unable to differentiate between a small amount of high-density material (e.g., bone) and a larger amount of lower density  (e.g., cartilage). The reconstruction assumes that the X-ray attenuation within each voxel is homogeneous; this may not be the case at sharp edges. This is most commonly seen in the z-direction, due to the conventional use of highly [[isotropic|anisotropic]] voxels, which have a much lower out-of-plane resolution, than in-plane resolution. This can be partially overcome by scanning using thinner slices, or an isotropic acquisition on a modern scanner.

;Ring artifact: Probably the most common mechanical artifact, the image of one or many "rings" appears within an image. They are usually caused by the variations in the response from individual elements in a two dimensional X-ray detector due to defect or miscalibration.<ref name=Jha>{{cite journal|last1=Jha|first1=Diwaker|title=Adaptive center determination for effective suppression of ring artifacts in tomography images|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=105|date=2014|issue=14|pages=143107|doi=10.1063/1.4897441|bibcode=2014ApPhL.105n3107J}}</ref> Ring artefacts can largely be reduced by intensity normalization, also referred to as flat field correction.<ref name=vvn15>{{cite journal|last1=Van Nieuwenhove|first1=V|last2=De Beenhouwer|first2=J|last3=De Carlo|first3=F|last4=Mancini|first4=L|last5=Marone|first5=F|last6=Sijbers|first6=J|title=Dynamic intensity normalization using eigen flat fields in X-ray imaging|journal=Optics Express|volume=23|date=2015|issue=21|pages=27975–27989|doi=10.1364/oe.23.027975|pmid=26480456|bibcode = 2015OExpr..2327975V |hdl=10067/1302930151162165141|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/120683/1/oe-23-21-27975.pdf}}</ref> Remaining rings can be suppressed by a transformation to polar space, where they become linear stripes.<ref name="Jha"/> A comparative evaluation of ring artefact reduction on X-ray tomography images showed that the method of Sijbers and Postnov <ref name=jsap>{{cite journal|vauthors = Sijbers J, Postnov A|title=Reduction of ring artefacts in high resolution micro-CT reconstructions|journal=Phys Med Biol|volume=49|date=2004|issue=14|pages=N247–53|pmid=15357205|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/49/14/N06}}</ref> can effectively suppress ring artefacts.

;Noise: This appears as grain on the image and is caused by a low signal to noise ratio. This occurs more commonly when a thin slice thickness is used. It can also occur when the power supplied to the X-ray tube is insufficient to penetrate the anatomy.

;Windmill: Streaking appearances can occur when the detectors intersect the reconstruction plane. This can be reduced with filters or a reduction in pitch.

;Beam hardening: This can give a "cupped appearance" when grayscale is visualized as height. It occurs because conventional sources, like X-ray tubes emit a polychromatic spectrum. Photons of higher [[photon energy]] levels are typically attenuated less. Because of this, the mean energy of the spectrum increases when passing the object, often described as getting "harder". This leads to an effect increasingly underestimating material thickness, if not corrected. Many algorithms exist to correct for this artifact. They can be divided in mono- and multi-material methods.<ref name="P. Jin and C. A. Bouman and K. D.

===Dose versus image quality===
An important issue within radiology today is how to reduce the radiation dose during CT examinations without compromising the image quality. In general, higher radiation doses result in higher-resolution images,<ref name=Crowther>{{cite journal|title=The Reconstruction of a Three-Dimensional Structure from Projections and its Application to Electron Microscopy|year=1970|author1=R. A. Crowther |author2=D. J. DeRosier |author3=A. Klug |journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.

However, increased dosage raises the adverse side effects, including the risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]] – a four-phase abdominal CT gives the same radiation dose as 300 chest X-rays (See the [[#Scan dose|Scan dose]] section). Several methods that can reduce the exposure to ionizing radiation during a CT scan exist.<ref name="ata">Barkan, O; Weill, J; Averbuch, A; Dekel, S.

==Industrial use==
[[Industrial CT scanning]] (industrial computed tomography) is a process which utilizes X-ray equipment to produce 3D representations of components both externally and internally. Industrial CT scanning has been utilized in many areas of industry for internal inspection of components.

==Etymology==
The word "tomography" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''tome'' (slice) and ''graphein'' (to write). Computed tomography was originally known as the "EMI scan" as it was developed in the early 1970s at a research branch of [[EMI]], a company best known today for its music and recording business. It was later known as ''computed axial tomography'' (''CAT'' or ''CT scan'') and ''body section röntgenography''. 

The term "CAT scan" is not used anymore, since CT scans nowadays allow for multiplanar reconstructions. This makes "CT scan" the most appropriate term, which is used by Radiologists in common vernacular as well as in any textbook and any scientific paper.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

Although the term "computed tomography" could be used to describe [[positron emission tomography]] or [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT), in practice it usually refers to the computation of tomography from X-ray images, especially in older medical literature and smaller medical facilities.

In [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], "computed axial tomography" was used from 1977 to 1979, but the current indexing explicitly includes "X-ray" in the title.<ref>{{MeshName|Tomography, +X-Ray+Computed}}</ref>

The term [[wikt:sinogram|sinogram]] was introduced by Paul Edholm and Bertil Jacobson in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Edholm |first1=Paul |last2=Gabor |first2=Herman |title=Linograms in Image Reconstruction from Projections |journal=IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging |date=December 1987 |volume=MI-6 |issue=4 |pages=301–7 |doi=10.1109/tmi.1987.4307847 |pmid=18244038 |s2cid=20832295 }}</ref>

==Types of machines==

Spinning tube, commonly called [[Spiral computed tomography|spiral CT]], or helical CT is an imaging technique in which an entire [[X-ray tube]] is spun around the central axis of the area being scanned. These are the dominant type of scanners on the market because they have been manufactured longer and offer a lower cost of production and purchase. The main limitation of this type is the bulk and inertia of the equipment (X-ray tube assembly and detector array on the opposite side of the circle) which limits the speed at which the equipment can spin. Some designs use two X-ray sources and detector arrays offset by an angle, as a technique to improve temporal resolution.

[[Electron beam tomography]] (EBT) is a specific form of CT in which a large enough X-ray tube is constructed so that only the path of the electrons, travelling between the cathode and anode of the X-ray tube, are spun using deflection coils. This type had a major advantage since sweep speeds can be much faster, allowing for less blurry imaging of moving structures, such as the heart and arteries. Fewer scanners of this design have been produced when compared with spinning tube types, mainly due to the higher cost associated with building a much larger X-ray tube and detector array and limited anatomical coverage. Only one manufacturer (Imatron, later acquired by [[General Electric]]) ever produced scanners of this design. Production ceased in early 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Retsky|first=Michael|title=Electron beam computed tomography: Challenges and opportunities |journal=Physics Procedia |date=31 July 2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=149–154|doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2008.07.090|bibcode = 2008PhPro...1..149R |doi-access=free}}</ref>

In '''multislice computed tomography''' ('''MSCT''') or '''multidetector computed tomography''' ('''MDCT'''), a higher number of tomographic slices allow for higher-resolution imaging. Modern CT machines typically generate 64-640 slices per scan.

==Research directions==
[[Photon-counting computed tomography|Photon counting computed tomography]] is a CT technique currently under development. Typical CT scanners use energy integrating detectors; photons are measured as a voltage on a capacitor which is proportional to the x-rays detected. However, this technique is susceptible to noise and other factors which can affect the linearity of the voltage to x-ray intensity relationship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Ron|last2=Gould|first2=R W|last3=Gedcke|first3=Dale|title=Quantitative x-ray spectrometry|url=https://archive.org/details/quantitativexray00jenk|url-access=limited|date=1995|publisher=Dekker|location=New York|isbn=9780824795542|page=[https://archive.org/details/quantitativexray00jenk/page/n89 90]|edition=2nd |chapter=Instrumentation}}</ref> Photon counting detectors (PCDs) are still affected by noise but it does not change the measured counts of photons. PCDs have several potential advantages, including improving signal (and contrast) to noise ratios, reducing doses, improving spatial resolution, and through use of several energies, distinguishing multiple contrast agents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shikhaliev|first1=Polad M.|last2=Xu|first2=Tong|last3=Molloi|first3=Sabee|title=Photon counting computed tomography: Concept and initial results|journal=Medical Physics|date=2005|volume=32|issue=2|pages=427–36|doi=10.1118/1.1854779|pmid=15789589|bibcode=2005MedPh..32..427S}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taguchi|first1=Katsuyuki|last2=Iwanczyk|first2=Jan S.|title=Vision 20∕20: Single photon counting x-ray detectors in medical imaging|journal=Medical Physics|date=2013|volume=40|issue=10|pages=100901|doi=10.1118/1.4820371|pmid=24089889|pmc=3786515|bibcode=2013MedPh..40j0901T}}</ref> PCDs have only recently become feasible in CT scanners due to improvements in detector technologies that can cope with the volume and rate of data required.
