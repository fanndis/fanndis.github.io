The '''National Commission for Women''' ('''NCW''') is the statutory body of the [[Government of India]], generally concerned with advising the government on all policy matters affecting women. It was established in 31 January 1992 under the provisions of the [[Indian Constitution]],<ref name="NCW About">{{cite web |title=NCW :: About NCW |url=http://ncw.nic.in/frmAboutUS.aspx |website=ncw.nic.in |publisher=National Commission for Women |accessdate=28 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016194845/http://ncw.nic.in/frmAboutUS.aspx |archive-date=16 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as defined in the 1990 National Commission for Women Act.<ref>Act No. 20 of 1990 of Govt. of India</ref> The first head of the commission was [[Jayanti Patnaik]]. As of 30 November 2018, [[Rekha Sharma (politician)|Rekha Sharma]] is the chairperson.<ref name="rsharma">{{Cite web |url=http://ncw.nic.in/frmcurrentcommission.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115165615/http://ncw.nic.in/frmcurrentcommission.aspx |archive-date=15 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Activities==
The objective of the NCW is to represent the rights of women in India and to provide a voice for their issues and concerns. The subjects of their campaigns have included [[dowry]], politics, religion, equal representation for women in jobs, and the exploitation of women for labour. They have also discussed police abuses against women.<ref>http://www.indiatogether.org/2006/may/wom-ncw.htm</ref>

The commission regularly publishes a monthly newsletter, ''Rashtra Mahila'', in both Hindi and English.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ncw.nic.in/publications.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118155748/http://ncw.nic.in/publications.htm |archive-date=18 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code===
In December 2006 and January 2007, the NCW found itself at the center of a minor controversy over its insistence that Section 497<ref>{{cite news|title=NCW rejects proposal to punish women for adultery|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncw-rejects-proposal-to-punish-women-for-adultery/article3038719.ece|accessdate=15 August 2015|work=The Hindu|date=26 December 2006}}</ref> of the [[Indian Penal Code]] not be changed to make adulterous wives equally prosecutable by their husbands.

<blockquote>
But the grounds on which Ms. Vyas resists the logic of making this a criminal offence — particularly for women, as often recommended — are not as encouraging. She is averse to holding the adulterous woman equally culpable as the adulterous man because women, she believes, are never offenders. They are always the victims.<ref name="oneworld">{{Cite web |url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/article/view/144502/1/5339 |title=One World.net |access-date=7 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011455/http://southasia.oneworld.net/article/view/144502/1/5339 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
</blockquote>

The NCW has demanded that women should not be punished for adultery, as a woman is "the victim and not an offender" in such cases. They have also advocated the amendment of Section 198 of the [[CrPC]] to allow women to file complaints against unfaithful husbands and prosecute them for their promiscuous behaviour. This was in response to "loopholes" in the Indian Penal Code that allowed men to file adultery charges against other men who have engaged in illicit relations but did not allow women to file charges against their husbands.<ref>Prakash, Satya, "What constitutes adultery?" ''Hindustan Times'', 25 December 2006, [http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1880193,0008.htm]</ref>

The Commission has also worked to guarantee women security in unconventional relationships.<ref name="oneworld"/>

===Mangalore pub attack controversy===
{{Main|2009 Mangalore pub attack}}
The NCW came under sharp criticism for their response to the attack by forty male members of the Hindu right-wing [[Sri Ram Sena]] on eight women in a bar in [[Mangalore]] in late January 2009.  Video from the attack shows the women were punched, pulled by their hair, and thrown out of the pub.<ref name="mangalorean">{{cite news|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&broadcastid=110268|title=Mangalore: Attack on Pub now a National Concern!|accessdate=6 February 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130065059/http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&broadcastid=110268|archivedate=30 January 2009}}</ref><ref name="russiatoday">{{cite web |url=http://russiatoday.com/features/news/36875 |title=India shocked as 'moral police' beat girls out of pub|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=6 February 2009}}</ref> 

NCW member Nirmala Venkatesh was sent to assess the situation, and said in an interview that the pub did not have adequate security and that the women should have protected themselves. Venkatesh said, "If the girls feel they were not doing anything wrong why are they afraid to come forward and give a statement?"<ref name="rocheinterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=1023|title=Mangalore Pub Attack - National Commission for Women Recommends Punishment Under Article 307|last=Roche|first=Florine|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref> On 6 February, the NCW said they decided not to accept Venkatesh's report but would not be sending a new team to Mangalore. On 27 February, the Prime Minister's Office approved the removal of Nirmala Venkatesh on disciplinary grounds.<ref name="msnreject">{{cite news|url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1815488 |title=NCW rejects report, blames security lapse for pub attacks |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207080031/http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1815488 |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref>

===Guwahati molestation controversy===
{{Main|2012 Guwahati molestation case}}
The NCW came under fire again after the molestation of a 17-year-old girl by a gang of men outside a pub in [[Guwahati]] on 9 July 2012. NCW member [[Alka Lamba]] was accused of leaking the name of the minor victim to the media, and was subsequently removed from the fact-finding committee, though she remains a member of the commission.<ref name="NDTV">{{cite web |title=Guwahati molestation case: Chief Minister's office accidentally names victim, then retracts |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/guwahati-molestation-case-alka-lamba-national-commission-for-women-member-who-named-victim-is-sacked-244007 |website=www.ndtv.com |accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> The following week, NCW chairperson Mamta Sharma made comments suggesting that women "be careful how you dress", which invited criticism that she was guilty of [[victim blaming]]. The controversy led activists to call for a restructuring of the commission.<ref name="indiatoday">{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/guwahati-molestation-ncw-chief-mamta-sharma-advises-women-to-dress-carefully/1/208869.html|title=Guwahati molestation: NCW chief Mamta Sharma advises women to dress 'carefully'|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="ibnlive">{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/guwahati-shame-activists-demand-ncw-rejig/271979-3-251.html|title=Guwahati molestation: Activists demand NCW restructure|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>
