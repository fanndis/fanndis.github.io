'''Jam!''' was a Canadian website which covers entertainment news. It was part of the [[Canoe.com]] online portal, formerly owned and operated by [[Quebecor]] through its [[Sun Media]] division, and now owned by [[Postmedia Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecor.com/en/comm/sale-sun-media-corporation%E2%80%99s-english-language-operations-postmedia-closes|title=Sale of Sun Media Corporationâ€™s English-language Operations to Postmedia Closes|date=13 April 2015|website=quebecor.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>

Jam! was the only media outlet that published a comprehensive collection of the official Canadian record charts as compiled by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] SoundScan and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].

[[CKXT-TV]], Sun Media's television station in [[Toronto]], aired a nightly entertainment magazine series, ''Inside Jam!''.  However, due to low ratings the program's airtime was reduced substantially.  Effective March 24, 2006, the show went from a daily program to a weekend only show,<ref>{{cite news|last=Zerbisias |first=Antonia |title=Sun down |url=http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/03/more_blood_on_t.html |format=Blog |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=2006-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118123116/http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/03/more_blood_on_t.html |archive-date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> before later being removed from the schedule altogether.  One of the hosts of the show, [[Chris Van Vliet]], announced on the programme in February 2010 that he would be leaving the show to join the [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Cleveland]] as their entertainment reporter.  His co-host [[Tara Slone]] re-located in August 2010 to [[Calgary]] to become co-host of [[Breakfast Television]] on [[CKAL-TV|CityTV Calgary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btcalgary.ca/inside/|title=Show Notes - Show Notes - Breakfast Television Calgary|website=Breakfast Television Calgary|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>
