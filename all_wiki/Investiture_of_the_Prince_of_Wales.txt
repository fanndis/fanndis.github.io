The '''investiture of the Prince of Wales''' is the ceremony formally acknowledging a new [[Prince of Wales]]. The prince is presented and [[investiture|invested]] with the insignia of his rank and dignity, in the manner of a [[coronation]]. An investiture is purely ceremonial, as the title is created via [[letters patent]].

Investitures fell into abeyance and the revival of investing the Prince of Wales in 1911 was largely due to [[David Lloyd George]]'s instigation. A similar ceremony was also held in 1969 for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s son and heir, [[Prince Charles]].

==History==
[[Image:Edward I & II.jpg|thumb|Edward I and Edward II]]
The tradition of investing the [[heir apparent]] of the English, and subsequently the British, monarch with the title of "Prince of Wales" began in 1301, when King [[Edward I of England]], having completed the conquest of Wales, gave the title to his heir apparent, Prince Edward (later King [[Edward II of England]]).

==Form==
Investiture is not necessary for the official appointment Prince of Wales. Earlier, [[Peerage|peers]] were also invested; however, the investitures for peers ceased in 1621, at a time when peerages were being created so frequently that the investiture ceremonies became cumbersome. Most investitures for Princes of Wales were held in parliament.

===Modern form===
In 1911, the future King [[Edward VIII]] was invested in [[Caernarfon Castle]] in Wales. The present Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, was also invested there in 1969.

The ceremony in 1969 began with Prince Charles, led by the regalia bearers, entering the Chamberlain Tower, to await the arrival of Her Majesty. Once the royal family had arrived, the lesser members took their seats in the gallery, but the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, led by the [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]], the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Earl Marshal]] and the Gentleman Usher carrying the [[Great Sword of State]], made their way to the stage where the investiture was to be conducted. After reaching the podium,  where the Secretary of State for Wales, carrying the letters patent, was already standing, the Earl Marshal instructed Garter to conduct the Prince and his cortège from the tower. As they came to the stage Prince Charles knelt before the three thrones on the stage. During the reading of the letters patent in Welsh, the Queen invested Charles with the girdle, sword, coronet, ring, rod and kingly mantle, in that order. Prince Charles then declared, "I, Charles, Prince of Wales, do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship, and faith and truth I will bear unto thee, to live and die against all manner of folks." Charles then customarily kissed the Queen's cheek and they embraced. Charles then took his place in the throne at his mother's right, before standing to give two speeches, one in Welsh and one in English. A brief religious service was then conducted and the Queen led the Prince of Wales to Queen Eleanor's Gate, to receive the homage of his adopted nation. The numerous banners and standards of the Prince of Wales were hung from the balcony.

The letters patent stated that Charles Philip Arthur George would receive the title, style, honour and privilege of the Principality of Wales and Earldom of Chester.

==Regalia==
{{main|Honours of the Principality of Wales}} {{see also|Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales}}
During the reading of the letters patent creating the Prince, the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]] are delivered to the Prince. The coronet of the heir apparent bears four crosses pattées alternating with four [[fleur-de-lys|fleurs-de-lis]], surmounted by a single arch (the Sovereign's crowns are of the same design, but use two arches). A gold rod is also used in the insignia; gold rods were formerly used in the investitures of dukes, but survive now in the investitures of Princes of Wales only. Also part of the insignia are a ring, a girdle, a sword and a robe.

===Coronets===

It is recorded that [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] had deposited [[Llywelyn's coronet|his coronet]] along with his other [[regalia]] with the monks at [[Cymer Abbey]] for safekeeping at the start of his final campaign in 1282. He was killed later that year. It was seized and presented to King [[Edward I of England]] as a token of the complete annihilation of the independent Welsh state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Wales:+history+1066+to+1485|title=History of Wales}}</ref>

[[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], later had the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales]], made at a cost of £140 5s. in 1728. It is unknown whether Frederick ever wore the coronet himself, but it was used by both his son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and his grandson, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], when each was Prince of Wales.

Due to its age Frederick's coronet was replaced by the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales]], made for the future [[George V|King George V]]. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales.

When the former [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] went into exile as the [[Duke of Windsor]] in 1936 (following his [[Abdication of Edward VIII|abdication]]), he took with him the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales]], a highly controversial – and illegal – act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, then Prince of Wales, and he wore it at [[Edward VII|his father]]'s coronation in 1902. The traditional coronet being unavailable, and with the older Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales being viewed unusable due to age, a new Prince of Wales coronet was made to be used for the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. The [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales]], was produced by a committee under [[Antony Armstrong-Jones]], 1st [[Earl of Snowdon]], then husband of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]].

Prince Charles was made the Prince of Wales, [[Earl of Chester]] by [[letters patent]] on 26 July 1958,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=41460|page=4733|date=29 July 1958}}</ref><ref name="pow">{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/abouttheprince/previousprincesofwales/ |title=Previous Princes of Wales |publisher=[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827011843/https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/abouttheprince/previousprincesofwales/ |archivedate=27 August 2007 |accessdate=27 November 2019 }}</ref> but the official investiture was not held until 1 July 1969. The ceremony, at Caernarfon Castle, was well received by many Welsh people. Some nationalists, though, viewed it as being associated with the subjugation of [[Welsh people]] since the 13th century, when king [[Edward I of England]] deposed the last native Prince of Wales, {{lang|cy|[[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]|italic=no}}. 

Previous investitures had taken place at various locations, including the [[Palace of Westminster]], the seat of Parliament.<ref name="ROYGOV-POW">{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5659.asp |publisher=The Royal Family |title=Style and titles of The Prince of Wales |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}</ref> The Welsh borough of [[Swansea]] was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] to mark the occasion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faq.cityandcountyofswansea.info/index.php?action=artikel&cat=98&id=823&artlang=en&highlight=history |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) - When was Swansea given city status? |accessdate=2008-09-01 |publisher=[[Swansea|City and County of Swansea]] }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44986|page=12450|date=12 December 1969}}</ref> Taught by [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh-nationalist]] politician [[Edward Millward]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles termed serious, hard-working student |work=Leader-Post |date=24 May 1969 |page=1 }}</ref> Prince Charles spent ten weeks leading up to his investiture learning about [[Welsh culture]], [[history of Wales|history]] and [[Welsh language|language]], and during the ceremony he gave his replies in both English and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/biography/investiture/ |title=Investiture as Prince of Wales |publisher=[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] }}</ref>

The investiture was watched by millions on television, and attracted large and excited crowds in Caernarfon, but it also aroused considerable hostility among a minority of nationalist and republican Welsh people. The nationalist campaign against the investiture culminated with an attempted bombing by two members of the {{lang|cy|[[Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru]]}} ('Movement for the Defence of Wales'). On the eve of the investiture two bombers were killed whilst placing a bomb outside government offices in [[Abergele]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2008/11/20/militants-key-role-in-coming-of-devolution-left-ignored-deliberately-91466-22299413/ |title=‘Militants’ key role in coming of devolution left ignored deliberately’ |work=[[Wales Online]] |date=20 November 2008 }}</ref> In recent years, it has been claimed that the [[KGB]] plotted to disrupt the proceedings by bombing a bridge in [[Porthmadog]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/446072.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Prince of Wales 'bomb plot' revealed |date=13 September 1999 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>

In recent opinion polls, the majority of Welsh people (usually cited as over 60 per cent) have remained in favour of the monarchy, with a BBC Wales poll in 1999 finding that 73 per cent of Welsh speakers want the position of Prince of Wales to continue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/377976.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Wales backs Charles for king |date=25 June 1999 |accessdate=5 May 2010 }}</ref> A BBC poll, to mark the 40th anniversary of the investiture, showed that 38 per cent of the Welsh population was in favour of a similar public ceremony for [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] after Prince Charles becomes king.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8126785.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Poll shows support for monarchy |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2010 }}</ref> A poll in July 2018 again found the majority of Welsh people in support of the title passing on when the current prince becomes king, but 47 percent objected to another investiture.

On the evening of 28 June 2009—to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the investiture—[[BBC Parliament]] broadcast a repeat of the original BBC TV colour [[outside broadcast]] from 1 July 1969, fronted by [[Cliff Michelmore]] and [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]]. This was preceded by an interview with Prince Charles recorded a few days before his investiture. The BBC repeated the broadcast on 1 July 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary.
