Since Trump's inauguration, Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase "[[alternative facts]]" to discuss a "[[Bowling Green massacre]]" that never occurred, and claiming that [[Michael Flynn]] had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, [[Ivanka Trump]].<ref name=oversight /> In June 2019, the [[United States Office of Special Counsel|U.S. Office of Special Counsel]] recommended that Conway be fired for "unprecedented" multiple violations of the [[Hatch Act of 1939]].<ref name="auto1" />

Conway announced in August 2020 that she would be leaving the White House at the end of the month.

On December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign, at [[Harvard]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]], for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager [[Robby Mook]]. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a "shouting match"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist [[Joel Benenson]] said "The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump." Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: "Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate.

Conway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: "If you’re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Samuels |first1=Brett |title=Kellyanne Conway dismisses Hatch Act violation: 'Let me know when the jail sentence starts' |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/445914-kellyanne-conway-dismisses-hatch-act-violation-let-me-know-when-the |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=June 13, 2018}}</ref>

On June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, "by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as [[Amy Klobuchar]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Beto O'Rourke]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], and also called her violations "egregious, notorious, and ongoing". The OSC noted that this was the first time they "had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual".<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/office-of-special-counsel-recommends-removal-of-kellyanne-conway-from-federal-office-for-violating-the-hatch-act/2019/06/13/0786ae2e-8df4-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html|title=Federal watchdog agency recommends removal of Kellyanne Conway from federal office for violating the Hatch Act|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Freking |first1=Kevin |last2=Superville |first2=Darlene |title=Federal Watchdog Agency Says White House Should Fire Kellyanne Conway for Violating the Hatch Act |url=https://www.apnews.com/b2f61bdd9831460b98cba45fefc9b293 |website=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Peter |title=Trump Is Urged to Fire Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act Violations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-hatch-act.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 14, 2019 |date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, "You know what else is unprecedented?

Due to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to President Trump for consideration.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sonmez |first1=Felicia |title=Federal watchdog agency recommends removal of Kellyanne Conway from federal office for violating the Hatch Act |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/office-of-special-counsel-recommends-removal-of-kellyanne-conway-from-federal-office-for-violating-the-hatch-act/2019/06/13/0786ae2e-8df4-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html |access-date=13 June 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=13 Jun 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Singman |first1=Brooke |title=Special Counsel recommends firing Kellyanne Conway over alleged Hatch Act violations |url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-recommends-firing-of-kellyanne-conway-over-alleged-hatch-act-violations |access-date=13 June 2019 |work=Fox News |date=13 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Morin |first1=Rebecca |title=All the times Kellyanne Conway ran afoul of a federal watchdog over the Hatch Act |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/13/kellyanne-conway-times-trumps-counselor-ran-afoul-hatch-act/1446389001/ |website=[[USA Today]] |access-date=June 14, 2019 |date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-conway-idUSKCN1TE2FI|title=Government watchdog: Trump aide Conway should be fired for...|date=June 13, 2019|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> Trump said he thought the recommendation was "very unfair, it's called freedom of speech."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/politics/kellyanne-conway-trump-hatch-act/index.html|title=Trump won't fire Conway despite federal agency recommendation|last=Vazquez|first=Maegan|date=June 14, 2019|work=CNN|access-date=14 June 2019}}</ref>

On June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of 2 Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only 2 federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with 1 violation each.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kwong |first1=Jessica |title=Kellyanne Conway had more Hatch Act violation reports filed against her than anyone else in 30 years |url=https://www.newsweek.com/kellyanne-conway-subpoena-hatch-act-1446085 |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=June 27, 2019 |date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

===Michael Flynn comments and week-long suspension from television===

On February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor [[Michael Flynn]] had the president's "full confidence". Hours later, Flynn resigned.<ref name=conwaysuspend>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/22/media/kellyanne-conway-sidelined-from-tv/index.html|title=Kellyanne Conway sidelined from TV after Flynn debacle|first=Dylan|last=Byers|date=February 22, 2017|website=CNN Money|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref> The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]] said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation.<ref name=conwaysuspend /> It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/sean-spicer-white-house/index.html|title=Sean Spicer isn't finished|first=Dylan|last=Byers|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref>

She came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Jennifer Rubin (journalist)|Jennifer Rubin]] said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. "In recent days, [[George Stephanopoulos]] and [[Matt Lauer]] blasted her directly, essentially calling her a [[fable|fabulist]]. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment", Rubin wrote.<ref name=ignoringconway>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/02/15/can-we-start-ignoring-whatever-conway-and-spicer-say/ |title=Can we start ignoring whatever Conway and Spicer say? |first=Jennifer |last=Rubin |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 15, 2017 |access-date=February 21, 2017 }}</ref> Also on February 15 the [[MSNBC]] news show ''[[Morning Joe]]'' officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host [[Joe Scarborough]] said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being "out of the loop" and "in none of the key meetings". He added "She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance."<ref name=morningjoe>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/morning-joe-bans-trump-aide-kellyanne-conway-article-1.2973225 |title="Morning Joe" bans Trump aide Kellyanne Conway: She's not credible anymore |work=New York Daily News |date=February 15, 2017 |access-date=February 19, 2017 }}</ref> The show's co-host [[Mika Brzezinski]] said, "I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect."<ref name=morningjoe/>

For the week following her Flynn comments she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway.<ref name=conwaysuspend /> Denying the report, White House spokesperson [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] told ''[[CNNMoney]]'' that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told [[CNN]] journalist [[Dylan Byers]] that she would be appearing on [[Fox News]] that evening.<ref name=conwaysuspend /> The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of ''[[Hannity]]'' during the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/the-wrap/article/Why-Kellyanne-Conway-Hasn-t-Been-on-TV-Lately-10951521.php|title=Why Kellyanne Conway Hasn't Been on TV Lately|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref>
