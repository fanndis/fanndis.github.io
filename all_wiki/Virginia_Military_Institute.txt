==History==
===Early history===
In the years after the [[War of 1812]], the Commonwealth of Virginia built and maintained several [[arsenal]]s to store weapons intended for use by the [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] in the event of invasion or slave revolt.  One of them was placed in Lexington. Residents came to resent the presence of the soldiers, whom they saw as drunken and undisciplined. In 1826, one guard beat another to death.  Townspeople wanted to keep the arsenal, but sought a new way of guarding it, so as to eliminate the "undesirable element."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Wineman|first=Bradford|date=2006|title=J.T.L.

They unanimously concluded that it would. Lexington attorney [[John Thomas Lewis Preston]] became the most active advocate of the proposal.  In a series of three anonymous letters in the ''Lexington Gazette'' in 1835, he proposed replacing the arsenal guard with students living under military discipline, receiving some military education, as well as a liberal education. The school's graduates would contribute to the development of the state and, should the need arise, provide trained officers for the state's militia.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book |date=1995 |title=Southern California Review of Law and Women's Studies, Volume 5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDdMAQAAIAAJ&q=%22franklin+society%22 |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=University of Southern California |pages=232, 235}}</ref>

After a public relations campaign that included Preston meeting in person with influential business, military and political figures and many open letters from prominent supporters including [[Alden Partridge]] of [[Norwich University]], in 1836 the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia legislature]] passed a bill authorizing creation of a school at the Lexington arsenal, and the [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] signed the measure into law.<ref>{{cite book |last= Couper |first=William |date=1936 |title=Claudius Crozet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQESAAAAYAAJ&q=cives |location= Palisades, NY |publisher=Historical Publishing Company, Inc. |pages=93, 100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Andrew |first= Rod, Jr. |date=2001 |title=Long Gray Lines: The Southern Military School Tradition, 1839-1915 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVnhbt32r7AC&q=%22John+t+l+preston%22+%22alden+partridge%22&pg=PA12 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=12 |isbn=0-8078-2610-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Farwell |first=Byron |date=1992 |title=Stonewall: A Biography of General Thomas J.

The organizers of the planned school formed a board of visitors, which included Preston, and the board selected [[Claudius Crozet]] as their first president. Crozet had served as an engineer in Napoleon Bonaparte's army before immigrating to the United States. In America, he served as an engineering professor at West Point, as well as state engineer in Louisiana and mathematics professor at [[Jefferson College (Louisiana)|Jefferson College]] in [[Convent, Louisiana|Convent]], Louisiana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Robert F., and Edwin L.

The board delegated to Preston the task of deciding what to call the new school, and he created the name Virginia Military Institute.<ref>{{cite book |date=1967 |title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuopAQAAMAAJ&q=%22john+t+l+preston%22+born+lexington+1811 |location=New York, NY |publisher=J. T. White |page= 245}}</ref>

Under Crozet's direction, the board of visitors crafted VMI's program of instruction, basing it off of those of the [[United States Military Academy]] and Crozet's [[alma mater]] the [[École Polytechnique]] of Paris.  So, instead of the mix of military and liberal education imagined by Preston, the board created a military and engineering school offering the most thorough engineering curriculum in America, outside of West Point.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonson|url=https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11675767|title=Engineering Manhood: Race and the Antebellum Virginia Military Institute|publisher=Lever Press|year=2020|isbn=9781643150178|pages=104–105, 113–114|doi=10.3998/mpub.11675767}}</ref>

Preston was also tasked with hiring VMI's first Superintendent.  He was persuaded that [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and former Army officer [[Francis Henney Smith]], then professor of mathematics at [[Hampden–Sydney College]], was the most suitable candidate.  Preston successfully recruited Smith, and convinced him to become the first Superintendent and Professor of Tactics.<ref name=":0" />

After Smith agreed to accept the Superintendent's position, Preston applied to join the faculty, and was hired as Professor of Languages.<ref>{{cite book |date=1855 |title=Governor's Message and Reports of the Public Officers of the State, of the Board of Directors, and of the Visitors, Superintendents, and Other Agents of Public Institutions or Interests of Virginia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjoUAAAAYAAJ&q=%22j+t+l+preston%22+hired+professor+1839&pg=RA3-PA27 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=William F.

The Class of 1842 graduated 16 cadets. Living conditions were poor until 1850 when the cornerstone of the new [[barracks]] was laid. In 1851 [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson]] became a member of the faculty and professor of [[Natural philosophy|Natural and Experimental Philosophy]]. Under Jackson, then a major, and Major [[William Gilham]], VMI [[infantry]] and [[artillery]] units were present at the [[execution (legal)|execution]] by [[hanging]] of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]) in 1859.

===Civil War period===
VMI cadets and alumni played instrumental roles in the [[American Civil War]]. On 14 occasions, the Confederacy called cadets into active military engagements. VMI authorized [[Campaign streamer|battle streamers]] for each one of these engagements but chose to carry only one: the battle streamer for New Market.  Many VMI Cadets were ordered to Camp Lee, at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], to train recruits under General Stonewall Jackson. VMI alumni were regarded among the best officers of the South and several distinguished themselves in the [[Union army|Union]] forces as well. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army, and one rose to this rank in the Union Army.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/Civil_War/cwgen.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427103436/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/Civil_War/cwgen.html |archivedate=27 April 2005}}, VMI Archives</ref> Just before his famous flank attack at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], Jackson looked at his division and brigade commanders, noted the high number of VMI graduates and said, "The Institute will be heard from today."<ref name=sears>Sears, Stephen W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=2oS7DFLSRq8C&dq=editions:ZLEcCjMP96MC&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TKZRU8_EKoH_PK3fgaAF&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ "Chancellorsville"].

====Battle of New Market====
[[File:VMI 1863 register wood engraving.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of VMI ca. 1863]]
On 14 May 1864, the Governor of Virginia once again called upon the cadets from VMI to participate in the American Civil War. After marching overnight 80 miles from Lexington to New Market, on 15 May 1864, 247 members of the VMI Corps of Cadets fought at the [[Battle of New Market]]. This event marks the only time in U.S. history wherein the student body of an operating college fought as an organized unit in pitched combat in battle (as recognized by the American Battlefield Trust).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/history/battle-of-new-market/|title=Battle of New Market – Shenandoah at War}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/maps/battle-new-market|title=The Battle of New Market|date=24 March 2017|website=American Battlefield Trust}}</ref> This event was the 14th time VMI Cadets were called into action during the Civil War.

At New Market, in a matter of minutes, VMI suffered fifty-five casualties with ten cadets killed; the cadets were led into battle by the Commandant of Cadets and future VMI Superintendent Colonel [[Scott Shipp]]. Shipp was also wounded during the battle. Six of the ten fallen cadets are buried on VMI grounds behind the statue "Virginia Mourning Her Dead" by sculptor [[Moses Ezekiel]], a VMI graduate who was also wounded in the Battle of New Market.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evm00002669mets.xml |title=Virginia Mourning Her Dead |publisher=Virginia Foundation for the Humanities |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Virginia |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

General [[John C. Breckinridge]], the commanding Southern general, held the cadets in reserve and did not use them until Union troops broke through the Confederate lines. Upon seeing the tide of battle turning in favor of the Union forces, Breckinridge stated, "Put the boys in...and may God forgive me for the order."<ref name="Andrew2004">{{cite book|last=Andrew|first=Rod Jr.|title=Long Gray Lines: The Southern Military School Tradition, 1839–1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVnhbt32r7AC&pg=PA33|year=2004|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5541-6|page=33}}</ref> The VMI cadets held the line and eventually pushed forward across an open muddy field, capturing a Union artillery emplacement, and securing victory for the Confederates. The Union troops were withdrawn and Confederate troops under General Breckinridge held the Shenandoah Valley.

On 12 June 1864 Union forces under the command of General [[David Hunter]] shelled and burned the Institute as part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. The destruction was almost complete and VMI had to temporarily hold classes at the Alms House in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In April 1865 Richmond was evacuated due to the impending fall of Petersburg and the VMI Corps of Cadets was disbanded. The Lexington campus reopened for classes on 17 October 1865.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/Civil_War/cwchron.html |title=VMI Civil War Chronology |accessdate=2013-06-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112184324/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/Civil_War/cwchron.html |archivedate=12 January 2006}}</ref> One of the reasons that Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] burned the town of [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]] was in retaliation for the shelling of VMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wv/wasec9/chambersburg.html |title=The Burning of Chambersburg |publisher=Angelfire.com |date=22 September 2001 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Following the war, [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], the pioneering [[oceanographer]] known as the "Pathfinder of the Seas", accepted a teaching position at VMI, holding the [[physics]] chair.  Following the war, David Hunter Strother, who was chief of staff to General Hunter and had advised the destruction of the institute, served as Adjutant General of the Virginia Militia and member of the VMI Board of Visitors; in that position he promoted and worked actively for the reconstruction.

===World War II===
VMI produced many of America's commanders in World War II. The most important of these was [[George C. Marshall]], the top U.S. Army general during the war. Marshall was the Army's first [[five-star general]] and the only career military officer ever to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="Nordlinger2012">{{cite book|last=Nordlinger|first=Jay|title=Peace, They Say: A History of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Most Famous and Controversial Prize in the World|url=https://archive.org/details/peacetheysayhist0000nord|url-access=registration|accessdate=12 October 2012|date=20 March 2012|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=978-1-59403-598-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/peacetheysayhist0000nord/page/177 177]}}</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] dubbed Marshall the "Architect of Victory" and "the noblest Roman of them all". The Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army during the war was also a VMI graduate as were the Second U.S. Army commander, 15th U.S. Army commander, the commander of Allied Air Forces of the Southwest Pacific and various corps and division commanders in the Army and Marine Corps. China's General [[Sun Li-jen]], known as the "Rommel of the East", was also a graduate of VMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=3951 |title=Letters, Diaries and Manuscripts Guide. VMI Faculty & Alumni Papers |publisher=Vmi.edu |accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref>

During the war, VMI participated in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]'s Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) from 1943 to 1946. The program provided training in engineering and related subjects to [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] men at colleges across the United States. Over 2,100 ASTP members studied at VMI during the war.

VMI admitted its first female student in 1995 after the U.S. Justice Department pursued a seven-year long lawsuit against the institution alleging discrimination. Although that first female student dropped out soon after matriculating, 30 female students enrolled in 1997, cementing VMI's new status as a coeducational institution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/vmi/vmi0317.htm |title=VMI Women Reach End of Rat Line |first=Peter |last=Finn |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=17 March 1998 |accessdate=27 October 2020}}</ref>

On 20 October 2020, a letter from Governor [[Ralph Northam]] and multiple other state officials reported that they had received reports from students of a racist culture at VMI.

The VMI campus covers {{convert|134|acre}}, 12 of which are designated as the [[Virginia Military Institute Historic District]], a designated [[National Historic Landmark District]]. The campus is referred to as the "Post," a tradition that reflects the school's military focus and the uniformed service of its alumni. A training area of several hundred additional acres is located near the post. All cadets are housed on campus in a large five-story building, called the "barracks." The [[Barracks, Virginia Military Institute|Old Barracks]], which has been separately designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], stands on the site of the old arsenal. This is the structure that received most of the damage when Union forces shelled and burned the Institute in June 1864. The new wing of the barracks ("New Barracks") was completed in 1949. The two wings surround two quadrangles connected by a [[sally port]]. All rooms open onto porch-like stoops facing one of the quadrangles. A third barracks wing was completed, with cadets moving in officially spring semester 2009. Four of the five arched entries into the barracks are named for [[George Washington]], [[Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson]], [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall '901]]<ref>{{cite web|title=VMI Alumni Flag Rank Officers – Alumni Generals & Admirals|url=http://www.vmi.edu/uploadedFiles/Archives/Alumni/VMI%20Flag%20Rank%20Officers.pdf|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> and [[Jonathan Daniels|Jonathan Daniels '61]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jonathan Myrick Daniels (VMI Class of 1961) Civil Rights Hero|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=14481|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> Next to the Barracks are offices and meeting areas for VMI clubs and organizations, the cadet visitors center and lounge, a snack bar, and a [[Follett Corporation]]-operated bookstore.

VMI's "Vision 2039" capital campaign raised more than $275 million from alumni and supporters in three years. The money is going to expand The Barracks to house 1,500 cadets, renovate and modernize the academic buildings. VMI is spending another $200 million to build the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics, to be used by cadets, [[Washington and Lee University]] students, and other U.S. and international students. The funding will also support "study abroad" programs, including joint ventures with [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] Universities in England and many other universities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vmi.edu/content.aspx?id=520 | title=Vision 2039 – Focus on Leadership | publisher=VMI | accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>{{clear left}}

==Students==

Prospective cadets must be between 16 and 22 years of age. They must be unmarried, and have no legal dependents, physically fit for enrollment in the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC), and be graduates of an accredited secondary school or have completed an approved homeschool curriculum. The Class of 2022 at VMI had an average high school [[GPA]] of 3.70 and a mean SAT score of 1210.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vmi.edu/uploadedFiles/Admissions/Class_of_2015%20Sheet1.pdf | title=Profile of the Class of 2015 | publisher=VMI | accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

Eligibility is not restricted to Virginia residents, although it is more difficult to gain an appointment as a non-resident, because VMI has a goal that no more than 45 percent of cadets come from outside Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/media/cm_publications/Vision2039.pdf |title=VMI Vision 2039 Document |publisher=Vmi.edu |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Virginia residents receive a discount in [[tuition]], as is common at most state-sponsored schools. Total tuition, room & board, and other fees for the 2008–2009 school year was approximately $17,000 for Virginia residents and $34,000 for all others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/FinAid.aspx?id=8617|title=Virginia Military Institute - Page Not Found|work=vmi.edu}}</ref>

The first African-American regimental commander was [[Darren W. McDew|Darren McDew]], class of 1982. McDew is a retired [[U.S. Air Force]] [[General (United States)|General]] and former Commander, [[United States Transportation Command]], [[Scott Air Force Base]], IL. It is unknown when the first Muslim cadet graduated from VMI, but before the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, under [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], several Persian cadets attended and graduated from VMI. Other Muslim graduates have included cadets from Bangladesh, Jordan, Indonesia, Somalia and other nations.

===Admission of women===
{{Main|United States v. Virginia}}
In 1997, VMI ended its prohibition and became the last U.S. military college to admit women. In 1990 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a discrimination lawsuit against VMI for its all-male admissions policy. While the court challenge was pending, a state-sponsored [[Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership]] (VWIL) was opened at [[Mary Baldwin College]] in [[Staunton, Virginia]], as a parallel program for women. The VWIL continued, even after VMI's admission of women.<ref>Cabe, Crista (1 March 2005). [http://www.mbc.edu/news/r_detail.asp?id=1631 "MBC Celebrates VWIL's 10th Anniversary March 18, 2004"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903170719/http://www.mbc.edu/news/r_detail.asp?id=1631 |date=3 September 2006 }}. Mary Baldwin College web site.</ref>

After VMI won its case in [[U.S. District Court]], the case went through several appeals until 26 June 1996, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], in a 7–1 decision in ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', found that it was unconstitutional for a school supported by public funds to exclude women. (Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] [[recuse]]d himself, presumably because his son was attending VMI at the time.) Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], and thus avoid the ruling.<ref name=strum />

Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Frederick Pang]], however, warned the school that the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] would withdraw [[Reserve Officer Training Corps|ROTC]] programs from the school if privatization took place. As a result of this action by Pang, Congress passed a resolution on 18 November 1997 prohibiting the Department of Defense from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six [[Senior Military College|senior military colleges]], including VMI. This escape clause provided by Congress came after the VMI Board of Visitors had already voted 9–8 to admit women; the decision was not revisited.<ref name=strum />

In August 1997, VMI enrolled its first female cadets. The first co-ed class consisted of thirty women, and matriculated as part of the class of 2001. In order to accelerate VMI's matriculation process several women were allowed to transfer directly from various junior colleges, such as [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), and forgo the traditional four-year curriculum that most cadets had been subjected to. The first female cadets "walked the stage" in 1999, although by VMI's definitions they are considered to be members of the class of 2001.

===Student life===
[[File:Vmi 164.jpg|thumb|alt=The Regimental Commander gives commands during a parade. text|The Regimental Commander gives commands to the Corps of Cadets during a parade in coatee.]]

Just as cadets did nearly 200 years ago, today's cadets give up such comforts as beds, instead lying upon cots colloquially referred to as "hays". These hays are little more than foam mats that must be rolled every morning and aired every Monday. Further, cadet uniforms have changed little; the [[coatee]] worn in parades dates to the [[War of 1812]].  New cadets, known as "Rats", experience even further deprivations from many "creature comforts" common to college life at other schools: they are not permitted to watch TV or listen to music outside of an academic setting. To this end, living conditions are considered more austere here than other service academies.<ref>{{cite web|title=USA Military schools|url=https://usamilitaryschools.com/virginia/}}</ref>

===Ratline===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}
During the first six months at VMI, New Cadets are called "Rats," the accepted term (since the 1850s) for a New Cadet. The VMI ratline is a tough, old-fashioned indoctrination-system which dates back to the institute's founding. All "Rats" refer to their classmates, male or female, as "Brother Rats."  The term "Brother Rat" is a term of endearment which lasts a lifetime amongst VMI graduates. Legend has it that when Washington College (now [[Washington and Lee University]]) students and VMI cadets drilled together in the 1830s, the students called the cadets "Rats" perhaps because of their gray uniforms. The cadets responded in kind calling the neighboring students "Minks" perhaps because many of them were from wealthy backgrounds. The purpose of the Ratline is to teach self-control, self-discipline, time-management, and [[followership]] as prerequisites for becoming a VMI cadet.<ref name="VMI ratline">{{cite web|title=Virginia Military Institute - Purpose of the Ratline|url=http://www.vmi.edu/content.aspx?id=12547|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>

New freshmen, known collectively as the "Rat Mass", walk along a prescribed line in [[barracks]] while maintaining an exaggerated form of attention, called "straining". This experience, called the Rat Line, is intended by the upper classes to instill camaraderie, pride, and discipline into the incoming class. Under this system, the Rats face numerous mental and physical challenges, starting with "Hell Week." During Hell Week, Rats receive basic military instruction from select upper classmen ("Cadre"); they learn to march, to clean their [[M14 rifle]], and to wear their uniforms. During Hell Week, Rats also meet the members of various cadet-run organizations and learn the functions of each.

At the end of the first week, each Rat is paired with a first classman ([[Senior (education)|senior]]) who serves as their mentor for the rest of the first year. The first classman is called a "Dyke," reference to an older Southern pronunciation of "to deck out," or to get into a uniform, as one of the roles of the rat is to help prepare their "Dyke's" uniform and dress them for parades.<ref name="WeinsteinWhite1997">{{cite book|last1=Weinstein |first1=Laurie Lee|author2=Christie C. White|title=Wives and Warriors: Women and the Military in the United States and Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DyxnheEf-sC&pg=PA64|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-491-3|pages=66–69}}</ref> While the Dyke watches out for the Rat and the Rat works for the Dyke in accordance with Institute policy, Cadre still enforce all rules for the Rats. In combining the softness of the Dykes with the hardness of the system they lead, with countless push-ups, sweat parties, and runs, the Rats are instilled with the virtue of time management and attention to detail.

The Ratline experience culminates with Resurrection Week ending in "Breakout," an event where the Rats are formally "welcomed" to the VMI community. After the successful completion of Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and no longer have to strain in the barracks or eat "square meals." Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s, Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to let them get to the top. The stoops would often be slick with motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill, where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down.<ref name="WeinsteinWhite1997"/> The Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and teamwork.

The entire body of Rats during the Ratline is called a "Rat Mass." Since Rats are not officially fourth classmen until after Breakout, the Rat Mass is also not officially considered a graduating class until that time either. Prior to Breakout, the Rat mass is given a different style of year identifier to emphasize this difference. The year identifier starts with the year of the current graduating class (their dykes' class), followed by a "+3" to indicate the anticipated year of their own class. For example, cadets that make up the Class of 2022 were considered the "Rat Mass of 2019+3" as the members of their dykes' class graduated in 2019 and they themselves will graduate three years onward from then.

===Traditions===
In addition to the Ratline, VMI has other traditions that are emblematic of the school and its history including the new cadet oath ceremony, the pageantry of close-order marching, and the nightly playing of "[[Taps]]". An event second only to graduation in importance is the "Ring Figure" dance held every November. During their junior year, cadets receive [[class ring]]s at a ring presentation ceremony followed by a formal dance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cadet Life: Class Rings and Ring Figure The History of a VMI Tradition|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=7689|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> Most cadets get two rings, a formal ring and a combat ring; some choose to have the combat ring for everyday wear, and the formal for special occasions.

Every year, VMI honors its fallen cadets with a New Market Day parade and ceremony. These events take place on 15 May, the same day as the [[Battle of New Market]] in which the VMI cadets fought during the Civil War that was in 1864. During this ceremony, the roll is called for cadets who "died on the Field of Honor" and wreaths are placed on the graves of those who died during the Battle of New Market.<ref name="CouperGibson2005">{{cite book|last1=Couper|first1=William|author2=Keith E.

The requirement that all cadets wishing to eat dinner in the mess hall must be present for a prayer was the basis for a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said before dinner.<ref name="ACLU Prayer Case">{{cite web|title=ACLU Files Lawsuit to Stop Coerced Prayers at Virginia Military Institute|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/aclu-files-lawsuit-stop-coerced-prayers-virginia-military-institute|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref> The non-denominational prayer had been a daily fixture since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Josiah Bunting, III, and J.

The tradition of guarding the institute is one of the longest standing and is carried out to this day. Cadets have been posted as sentinels guarding the barracks 24 hours a day, seven days a week while school is in session since the first cadet sentinel, Cadet John B. Strange, and others relieved the Virginia Militia guard team tasked with defending the Lexington Arsenal (that later became VMI) in 1839. The guard team wears the traditional school uniform and each sentinel is armed with an M14 rifle and bayonet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=5471 |title=John B.

===Honor code===
VMI is known for its strict [[honor code]], which is as old as the Institute and was formally codified in the early 20th century.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=7251 |title=VMI History FAQ |publisher=Vmi.edu |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Under the VMI Honor Code, "a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do."<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref>{{cite web|title=VMIhonor|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives.aspx?id=4294973008}}</ref> There is only one punishment for violating the VMI Honor Code: immediate expulsion in the form of a [[drumming out]] ceremony of dismissal, in which the entire corps is awakened by drums in barracks and the honor court to hear the formal announcement. VMI is the only military college or academy in the Nation which maintains a single-sanction Honor Code and in recent times, the dismissed cadet is removed from post before the formal announcement is made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/vmi/vmihonor.html|accessdate=2010-01-01|title=The honor code is 'simple and all-encompassing'|first=Matt|last=Chittum|newspaper=Roanoke Times|date=9 March 1997|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909021555/http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/vmi/vmihonor.html|archivedate=9 September 2012}}</ref>

===Clubs and activities===
VMI currently offers over 50 school-sponsored clubs and organizations, including recreational activities, military organizations, musical and performance groups, religious organizations and service groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clubs and Organizations|url=http://www.vmi.edu/show.aspx?tid=25935&id=15947|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Academic & Professional Societies|url=http://www.vmi.edu/show.aspx?tid=25935&id=15945|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> Although VMI prohibited cadet membership in fraternal organizations starting in 1885, VMI cadets were instrumental in starting several fraternities. [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity was founded by VMI cadets [[Otis Allan Glazebrook]], Alfred Marshall, and [[Erskine Mayo Ross]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]] on 11 September 1865 while the school was closed for reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ato.org/AlphaTauOmega/atohistory/foundingstory.aspx |title=ATO website |publisher=Ato.org |date=26 April 1931 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

After the re-opening, [[Kappa Sigma Kappa]] fraternity was founded by cadets on 28 September 1867 and [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity was founded by cadets on 1 January 1869.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> VMI cadets formed the second chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Shelton|first=Todd|title=Our Kappa Alpha Heritage |url=http://www.kappaalphaorder.org/resources/varlet_materials/varlet_kaheritage.asp|publisher=Kappa Alpha Order|accessdate=2 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728055921/http://www.kappaalphaorder.org/resources/varlet_materials/varlet_kaheritage.asp |archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref> In a special arrangement, graduating cadets may be nominated by Kappa Alpha Order alumni and inducted into the fraternity, becoming part of [[Kappa Alpha Order]]'s Beta Commission (a commission as opposed to an active chapter).
