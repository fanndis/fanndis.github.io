In 2000, she became president of ''Generations Le Pen'', a loose association close to the party which aimed at "''de-demonizing'' the Front National".<ref name="biography" /> She became a member the FN Executive Committee ({{lang-fr|link=no|bureau politique}}) in 2000, and vice-president of the FN in 2003.<ref name="biography" /> In 2006, she managed the [[2007 French presidential election|presidential campaign]] of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.

====Controversy====
Marine Le Pen received substantial media attention during the campaign as a result of comments, made during a speech to party members in [[Lyon]] on 10 December 2010, in which she compared the blocking of public streets and squares in French cities (in particular rue Myrha in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]) for Muslim prayers with the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War&nbsp;II|Nazi occupation of France]]. She said:

{{quote|For those who want to talk a lot about World War&nbsp;II, if it's about occupation, then we could also talk about it (Muslim prayers in the streets), because that is occupation of territory ...

In a 2010 [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]] interview, Le Pen stated that her strategy was not about changing the FN's program but about showing it as it really is, instead of the image given to it by the media in the previous decades.

[[Eric Zemmour]], journalist for the conservative newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'', wrote during the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]] that the FN had become a left-wing party under the influence of adviser [[Florian Philippot]].

During her opening speech in Tours on 16 January 2011, she advocated to "restore the political framework of the national community" and to implement the [[direct democracy]] which enables the "civic responsibility and the collective tie" thanks to the participation of public-spirited citizens for the decisions. The predominant political theme was the uncompromising defence of a protective and efficient [[State (polity)|state]], which favours [[secularism]], prosperity and liberties. She also denounced the "Europe of Brussels" which "everywhere imposed the destructive principles of ultra-liberalism and [[free trade]], at the expense of public utilities, employment, social equity and even our economic growth which became within twenty years the weakest of the world".<ref name="speechtours">{{cite web |url=http://www.frontnational.com/videos/congres-du-fn-a-tours-discours-d%E2%80%99investiture-de-marine-le-pen/|title=FN Congress in Tours : Marine Le Pen's opening speech|publisher=Front National|date=17 January 2011|access-date=24 January 2011|language=fr}}</ref> After the traditional [[Joan of Arc]] march and [[Labour Day]] march in Paris on 1 May 2011, she gave her first speech in front of 3,000 supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/videos/discours-du-1er-mai-2011/|title=1 May march: Marine Le Pen's speech|publisher=Front National|date=1 May 2011|access-date=3 May 2011|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125140539/http://www.frontnational.com/videos/discours-du-1er-mai-2011/|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/1/briefing-page-briefs-971292619/|title=Marine Le Pen stakes out mainstream in speech|work=The Washington Times|date=1 May 2011|access-date=3 May 2011}}</ref> On 11 August 2011, she held a press conference about the current systemic crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/videos/conference-de-presse-exceptionnelle-de-marine-le-pen-sur-la-crise/|title=Marine Le Pen's exceptional press conference about the systemic crisis|publisher=Front National|date=11 August 2011|access-date=11 August 2011|language=fr}}</ref>

A French sociologist, Sylvain Crépon, who analysed the social and occupational groups of the FN voters in 2012, explained: "The FN vote is made up of the victims of globalisation. It is the small shopkeepers who are going under because of the economic crisis and competition from the out-of-town hypermarkets; it is low-paid workers from the private sector; the unemployed. The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet."<ref name="BBC2012FPE" /> Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in "rural" areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate [[Metropolitan area|commuter belts]] built on the distant outskirts of the cities: "The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they can no longer afford to live there. Many of these people will have had recent experience of living in the [[banlieue]]s (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity."<ref name="BBC2012FPE" /> Commentators also pointed that there were more young people and women voting for the party in 2012.<ref name="BBC2012FPE" />

On 1 May 2012, during a speech delivered in Paris after the traditional Joan of Arc and Labor Day march, Le Pen refused to back either incumbent president Sarkozy or socialist Hollande in the run-off on 6 May. Addressing the party's annual rally at [[Place de l'Opéra]], she vowed to cast a blank ballot and told her supporters to vote with their conscience, saying: "Hollande and Sarkozy – neither of them will save you. On Sunday I will cast a blank [[protest vote]]. I have made my choice. Each of you will make yours." Accusing both candidates of surrendering to Europe and financial markets, she asked: "Who between Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy will impose the austerity plan in the most servile way? Who will submit the best to the instructions of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) or the European Commission?".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17906203|title=France election: Le Pen 'to cast blank vote' in run-off|work=BBC News|date=1 May 2012|access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref>

===Electoral progress: 2012–2016===
Following the increase in support for the FN in the presidential election, Le Pen announced the formation an electoral coalition to contest the [[2012 French legislative election|June 2012 parliamentary elections]] called the [[Rassemblement bleu Marine|Blue Marine Gathering]]. Standing as a candidate in the [[Pas-de-Calais' 11th constituency]], Le Pen won 42.36% of the vote, well ahead of the Socialist representative [[Philippe Kemel]] (23.50%) and far-left candidate [[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]] (21.48%). She was beaten in the second round with 49.86% and filed an appeal with the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]], which was rejected despite noting some irregularities. Nationally, the FN had two lawmakers elected: Le Pen's niece [[Marion Maréchal]] and [[Gilbert Collard]].

In 2014, Le Pen led the party to further electoral advances in the [[2014 French municipal elections|municipal]] and [[2014 French Senate election|senatorial elections]]: eleven Mayors and two Senators were elected, with the FN entering the upper chamber for the first time.
[[File:Lille - Meeting de Marine Le Pen pour les élections régionales, le 30 novembre 2015 à Lille Grand Palais (39).JPG|thumb|France's regional elections in 2015]]

On 24 May 2014, the FN won the [[2014 European Parliament election in France|European elections in France]], with 24.90% of the vote. Marine Le Pen came in first place in her [[North-West France (European Parliament constituency)|North-West constituency]] with 33.60%. 25 FN representatives were elected to the [[European Parliament]] from France. They voted against the [[Juncker Commission]] when it was formed in July 2014. One year later, Le Pen announced the formation of [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]], a parliamentary grouping composed of the National Front, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]], [[Lega Nord]] of [[Italy]], the Dutch [[Party for Freedom]], the [[Congress of the New Right]] from [[Poland]], the Flemish [[Vlaams Belang]] of [[Belgium]], and British independent MEP [[Janice Atkinson]], formerly of [[UKIP]]. Le Pen's first attempt to assemble this grouping in 2014 had failed due to UKIP and the [[Sweden Democrats]] refusing to join, as well as some controversial statements from her father, [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. Le Pen sat on the commission for international trade. In 2016, ''[[Politico]]'' ranked her as the second most influential MEP after [[Martin Schulz]].

In April 2015, Le Pen's father gave two interviews including controversial statements about [[World War II]] and about minorities in France, causing a political crisis in the FN. Marine Le Pen organised a postal vote to ask FN members to change the party's statutes in order to expel her father. J-M Le Pen pursued his movement and the justice cancelled the vote. On 25 August, the FN executive office voted to expel him from the party he had founded forty years earlier. Many observers noted Marine's dependence on her closest adviser, [[Florian Philippot]], a former left-wing technocrat. The party instigated a purge to expel the members who had opposed the changes within the FN under Marine Le Pen's leadership.

Le Pen subsequently announced her candidacy for the presidency of the regional council of [[Hauts-de-France|Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie]] in the [[2015 French regional elections|2015 regional elections]], though she expressed her regret over the proximity of these elections to the next presidential election. On 6 December, she finished first with 40.6% of the vote, but the Socialist candidate (third with 18.12%) withdrew and declared support for her right-wing opponent [[Xavier Bertrand]], who won with 57.80% of the vote. Her niece Marion also lost, by a smaller margin.

===Second presidential candidacy: 2016–2017===

====Leading candidate in polls====
[[File:Marine Présidente 2017.png|thumb|left|Marine Le Pen's 2017 campaign logo]]
Marine Le Pen announced her candidacy for the [[2017 French presidential election]] on 8 April 2016, and from the start maintained high support in opinion polling. She appointed FN Senator [[David Rachline]] as her campaign manager. The FN had difficulty finding funding because of the refusal of French banks to provide credit. Instead, the NF borrowed {{euro|link=yes}}9&nbsp;million from the First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow in 2014, despite [[European Union]] sanctions placed on [[Russia]] following the [[Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)|annexation of Crimea]]. In February 2016, the FN asked Russia for another loan, this time of {{euro|link=no}}27&nbsp;million, but the second loan was not paid.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|last1=Walt|first1=Vivienne|title=Why France's Marine Le Pen Is Doubling Down on Russia Support|url=http://time.com/4627780/russia-national-front-marine-le-pen-putin/|website=Time|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Lille - Meeting de Marine Le Pen pour l'élection présidentielle, le 26 mars 2017 à Lille Grand Palais (132).JPG|thumb|Marine Le Pen during her presidential campaign, on 26 March 2017.]]
Political analysts suggested that Le Pen's strong position in opinion polls was due to the absence of a primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), the news of the [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and the very right-wing campaign of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). In a 2016 interview with the [[BBC]], Le Pen said that [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the US Presidential election would help her, saying that Trump had "made possible what had previously been presented as impossible".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37964776|title=Marine Le Pen: Trump win boosts my chances|date=13 November 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=30 November 2016}}</ref> However, she said she would not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and preferred to keep a low media profile and use thematic think tanks to expand and promote her political program. As a result, her rare media appearances attracted large audiences (2.3&nbsp;million viewers for ''Vie politique'' on [[TF1]] on 11 September 2016 and 4 million for ''Une ambition intime'' on [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] on 16 October).

The NF's communications also received media attention: a new [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]]-inspired poster depicting her in a rural landscape with the slogan "Appeased France" was a response to surveys indicating that she remained controversial for large parts of the French electorate. Satirical treatment of this poster led to the slogan being changed to: "In the name of the people". Meanwhile, the FN logo and the name Le Pen were removed from campaign posters.

Le Pen launched her candidacy on 4 and 5 February 2017 in [[Lyon]], promising a referendum on France's membership of the [[European Union]] if she could not achieve her territorial, monetary, economic and legislative goals for the country within six months renegotiation with the EU. Her first campaign appearance on television, four days later, received the highest viewing figures on [[France 2]] since the previous presidential election (16.70% with 3.7&nbsp;million viewers).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leprogres.fr/france-monde/2017/02/10/marine-le-pen-explose-les-records-de-l-emission-politique|title=Marine Le Pen explose les records de "L'Émission politique" (in French)|date=10 February 2017|website=Le Progrès|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>  Her 2017 presidential campaign emphasized Le Pen as a softer, feminine figure, with a blue rose as a prominent campaign symbol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Geva|first=Dorit|date=2020-03-01|title=Daughter, Mother, Captain: Marine Le Pen, Gender, and Populism in the French National Front|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article/27/1/1/5259255|journal=Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State & Society|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1093/sp/jxy039|issn=1072-4745|doi-access=free}}</ref>

====Campaign====
On 2 March 2017, the [[European Parliament]] voted to revoke Le Pen's immunity from prosecution for tweeting violent imagery. Le Pen had tweeted an image of beheaded journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] in December 2015, which was deleted following a request from Foley's family. Le Pen also faced prosecution for allegedly spending EU Parliament funds on her own political party; the lifting of her immunity from prosecution did not apply to the ongoing investigation into the misuse of parliamentary funds by the FN.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAuley|first=James|title=European Parliament lifts Marine Le Pen's immunity for tweeting gruesome images of violence|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-parliament-lifts-marine-le-pens-immunity-for-tweeting-gruesome-images-of-violence/2017/03/02/99bb9c9a-ff5e-11e6-9b78-824ccab94435_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, Le Pen argued that France as a nation bore no responsibility for the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]], in which Paris policemen arrested Jewish citizens for deportation to [[Auschwitz]] as part of [[the holocaust]]. She repeated a [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] thesis according to which France was not represented by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but by [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]].<ref name="Marine Le Pen sparks outrage over Holocaust comments">{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=James|last2=Deygas|first2=Margaux|title=Marine Le Pen sparks outrage over Holocaust comments|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/10/europe/france-marine-le-pen-holocaust/|website=CNN|access-date=16 April 2017}}</ref>

On 20 April 2017, in the wake of [[2017 shooting of Paris police officers|a shooting targeting police officers]] that was treated as a suspected terrorist attack, Le Pen cancelled a planned campaign event. The next day, she called for the closure of all "extremist" mosques, a remark that was criticised by Prime Minister [[Bernard Cazeneuve]], who accused her of attempting to "capitalise" on the incident. She also called for the expulsion of hate preachers and people on the French security services' watch list, and the revocation of their citizenship. ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that the attack could serve as "ammunition" for right-wing candidates in the election, including Le Pen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Willsher|first1=Kim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/21/fears-that-paris-shooting-will-affect-presidental-election-as-first-round-looms|title=Fears that Paris shooting will affect presidential election as first round looms|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 2017|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

On 21 April 2017, United States President [[Donald Trump]] wrote on Twitter that the shooting would have "a big effect on the presidential election."<ref>{{cite web | last1=Jacobs | first1=Peter | title=Trump Predicts the Attack in Paris Will Have a 'Big Effect on Presidential Election!' | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-predicts-paris-terror-attack-effect-french-presidential-election-2017-4 | date=21 April 2017 | website=[[Business Insider]] | access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> Later that day, Trump said that Le Pen was the "strongest on borders, and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France."<ref>{{cite web | last1=Quigley | first1=Aidan | title=Trump Expresses Support for Le Pen | url=http://www.politico.eu/article/trump-expresses-support-for-french-candidate-le-pen/ | date=21 April 2017 | publisher=[[Politico]] | access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> Meanwhile, former US President [[Barack Obama]] phoned [[Emmanuel Macron]] to express his support.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Amaro | first1=Silvia | title=Obama Wishes French Presidential Hopeful Macron Good Luck Ahead of Key Vote | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/21/obama-wishes-french-presidential-hopeful-macron.html | date=21 April 2017 | publisher=[[CNBC]] | access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref>

====Second round====
[[File:Élection présidentielle de 2017 par département T1.svg|thumb|right|Results of the first round of the 2017 presidential election. Departments in which Le Pen received the largest share of the vote are shaded dark blue.]]
Le Pen won 21.3% of the vote (7.7&nbsp;million votes) in the first round of the election on 23 April 2017, placing her second behind Macron, who received 24.0%,<ref>{{cite web|title=Election présidentielle 2017|url=http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/FE.html|publisher=French Ministry of the Interior|access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref> meaning that they would face each other in the run-off on 7 May. On 24 April 2017, the day after the first round of voting, Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the leader of the NF in an attempt to unite voters.<ref name=IRISHTIMES24APR>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/marine-le-pen-steps-down-as-front-national-leader-1.3059180|title=Marine Le Pen steps down as Front National leader|date=24 April 2017|website=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref> "The President of the Republic is the president of all the French people, they must bring them all together," she said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MLP_officiel/status/856574805692362752|title=Marine Le Pen on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|date=24 April 2017}}</ref>

After progressing to the second round, she said that the campaign was now "a referendum for or against France" and tried to convince those voting for the hard-left candidate [[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]] to support her. This choice was later criticised by those in her party who believed that she had abandoned [[François Fillon]]'s voters in spite of their conservative and anti-immigration stance. On 1 May 2017, a video emerged of Le Pen copying sections of a speech by Francois Fillon word-for-word.<ref>{{cite news|date=2 May 2017|last=Willsher|first=Kim|title=Marine Le Pen accused of plagiarising Fillon in May Day speech|work=The Guardian|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/02/marine-le-pen-francois-fillon-phrases-may-day-speech|access-date=6 May 2017}}</ref>

In the first days of the second round campaign, the gap in opinion polls began to narrow. On 25 April, Le Pen went to [[Amiens]] in an unexpected visit to meet workers at the Whirlpool factory while Macron was in a meeting with local officials at the same time, with Le Pen receiving a positive welcome. Macron then also visited the factory workers, but was booed by a hostile crowd.

Le Pen was generally regarded as the loser of the televised debate between the two candidates. Her performance was strongly criticised by politicians, commentators, and members of her own party, and described as a "sabotage" by conservative journalist [[Eric Zemmour]]. Le Pen herself subsequently acknowledged that she had "misfired" during the debate. In the following days, she began to fall back in opinion polls.

On 7 May, she conceded defeat to Emmanuel Macron. Her vote share of 33.9% was lower than any polls had predicted, and was attributed to her poor performance in the debate. She immediately announced a "full transformation" of the FN in the following months.<ref name="auto4"/>

===Member of Parliament: 2017–present===
On 18 May 2017, Le Pen announced that she would run as a candidate at the [[2017 French legislative election|parliamentary elections]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais's 11th constituency]], in her fifth attempt to be elected as a deputy. She received just under 46% of the vote in the first round, and won the second with just under 58% against Anne Roquet of [[En Marche]]. She became a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. She then resigned as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/818570/Marine-Le-Pen-French-election-seat-parliament-Emmanuel-Macron|title=Marine Le Pen elected to French parliament in her fifth attempt|agency=Express|author=Rebecca Flood|date=18 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, it was reported that Le Pen no longer wants France to leave the European Union, nor for it to leave the euro currency. Instead, it was reported she wants to change the EU bloc from the inside along with allied parties.<ref name="chrisafis">{{cite news |last= Chrisafis |first= Angelique |date= 26 May 2019 |title= Marine Le Pen ahead of Macron's centrist party, say French exit polls |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/26/marine-le-pen-national-rally-ahead-of-macron-centrist-party-french-exit-polls |work= The Guardian |access-date= 30 January 2020}}</ref>

Le Pen's success in these elections reinforced her internal position within the FN. As a member of the [[standing committee]] and a president of the regional group (Front National/Gathering for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais), she led opposition to the left-wing regional executive managed by Daniel Percheron.

====2009 Hénin-Beaumont by-election====
{{Main|2009 municipal by-election in Hénin-Beaumont}}A municipal by-election was held in Hénin-Beaumont on 28 June and 5 July 2009. As in 2008, Steeve Briois was the FN top candidate with Le Pen in second position.

Briois, Le Pen and the six other FN councillors formed the opposition against the new [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] Daniel Duquenne and his successor Eugène Binaisse.

On 24 February 2011, Le Pen resigned as a municipal councillor because of the law on the accumulation of mandates ("[[cumul des mandats]]").<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-politique/cumul-des-mandats-marine-le-pen-quitte-le-conseil-municipal-d-henin-beaumont-24-02-2011-1330084.php|title=Accumulation of mandates : Marine Le Pen leaves the municipal council of Hénin-Beaumont|work=[[Le Parisien]] (AFP)|date=24 February 2011|access-date=26 February 2011|language=fr}}</ref> In a letter entitled "I stay in Hénin-Beaumont!", she expressed the view that her political activities would be more effective for the city at regional and European levels than in the municipal council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationspresse.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Lettre-de-Marine-Le-Pen-aux-habitants-dH%C3%A9nin-Beaumont.pdf|title=I stay in Hénin-Beaumont !|work=Nations Presse Info|date=24 February 2011|access-date=26 February 2011|language=fr}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
