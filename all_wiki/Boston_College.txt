===Early history===

In 1825, [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], a Jesuit from [[Maryland]], became the second [[Bishop]] of Boston. He was the first to articulate a vision for a "College in the City of Boston" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy (Jesuit)|John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for "The Boston College" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings—a schoolhouse and a [[Church (building)|church]]—welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.

On {{Start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://bc.edu/about/history.html |title=History – Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=1909-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103122335/http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].

[[File:Gasson Tower.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]]]]

===Move to Chestnut Hill===
Boston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927, when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a "[[city upon a hill]]", he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the "new" university. Construction began in 1909.<ref name="history"/>

By 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], "New BC's" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first "capital campaign"—which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress—ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education|Lynch School of Education and Human Development]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHP/1963/Month%2004/Day%2020/JFKWHP-1963-04-20-D |title=Trip to Boston: President Kennedy's Address at Boston College Centennial Ceremonies.

At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates dominated Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century. However, cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced the university to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources, and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Operation Menu|bombings in Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.

===The Monan Era===
By the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. After Monan's appointment, the Boston College Board of Trustees was reconfigured.  The board was broadened beyond its historic membership of members of the [[Society of Jesus]], as lay alumni and business leaders were brought in, bringing new business models and an ability to raise funds. A similar restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], and Edmund Stephan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html |title=Edmund Stephan, 86, Lawyer Who Reorganized Notre Dame|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1998-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813105624/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html |archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]] was merged into BC, allowing expansion of Boston College to the Newton College {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} Boston College Law School moved to the campus, and its dormitories provided needed housing for a student population that was increasingly residential, for which the school had to lease off-campus apartments and even motel rooms. Monan was credited with turning around the school's financial position, leading to an improved reputation and increasing attention from around the world. In 1996, Monan's 24-year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J.

===Recent history===
[[File:BC Campus Green.jpg|thumb|right|Gasson Quadrangle]]
Since assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor, as well as by what some critics see as abandonment of the college's initial mission to provide a college education for residents of Boston.  It has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, while dramatically reducing the greenery of its middle campus, although portions of the college's legendary "Dustbowl" were removed to accommodate additional expansion of its buildings. During this period, undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000. At the same time, BC students, faculty and athletic teams have seen indicators of success—winning record numbers of [[Fulbright Award|Fulbrights]], [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]], and other academic awards; setting new marks for research grants; and winning conference and national titles. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in light of the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|clergy sexual abuse scandal]]. His effort brought BC worldwide praise and recognition for "leading the way on Church reform."<ref>{{cite news|first=Scot|last=Lehigh|title=BC is leading the way on church reform|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2002-06-19|url=https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories2/061902_lehigh.htm |access-date=April 10, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041906/http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories2/061902_lehigh.htm |archive-date=February 16, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Recent plans to merge with the [[Weston Jesuit School of Theology]] were followed by an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' claiming "such a merger would further Boston College's quest to become the nation's Catholic intellectual powerhouse" and that, once approved by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] and Jesuit authorities in [[Rome]], BC "would become ''the'' center for the study of Roman Catholic theology in the United States."<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Gibson|title=Jesuits Show Strength, Even as Their Numbers Shrink|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2004-12-12|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F16FB35550C718DDDAB0994DC404482 |access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520003117/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F16FB35550C718DDDAB0994DC404482 |archive-date=May 20, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> On February 16, 2006, the merger was authorized by the [[Jesuit Conference]].<ref>http://www.wjst.edu/File/BC_Weston_Press_Release.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

In 2003, after years of student-led discussions and efforts, and administrators' repeated rejection of pleas from students, the school approved a Gay-Straight Alliance, the first university-funded gay support group on campus. In 2004, between 1,000 and 1,200 students rallied behind a student-led campaign to expand the school's non-discrimination statement to include equal protection for gays and lesbians.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Russell|title=1,000 rally for gay rights at college|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2005-04-16|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/04/16/1000_rally_for_gay_rights_at_college/ |access-date=October 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528175507/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/04/16/1000_rally_for_gay_rights_at_college/ |archive-date=May 28, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Earlier that year 84% of the student body voted in favor of a student referendum calling for a change in policy.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexis|last=Mark |title=Support shown for referendum|work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]|date=2005-03-03 |url=http://www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/03/03/News/Support.Shown.For.Referendum-884268.shtml?norewrite200610020930&sourcedomain=www.bcheights.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729161554/http://www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/03/03/News/Support.Shown.For.Referendum-884268.shtml?norewrite200610020930&sourcedomain=www.bcheights.com |url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-29}}</ref> After several months of discussion the university changed its statement of nondiscrimination to make it more welcoming to gay students in May 2005, but stopped short of prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jenna|last=Russell|title=Boston College set to adopt language that welcomes gays|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2005-05-10|url=https://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/05/10/boston_college_set_to_adopt_language_that_welcomes_gays/ |access-date=October 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524004419/http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/05/10/boston_college_set_to_adopt_language_that_welcomes_gays/ |archive-date=May 24, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Stokes Hall Amphitheater.jpg|thumb|right|Stokes Hall amphitheater]]

On December 5, 2007, Boston College announced a master plan, a $1.6 billion, 10-year plan to revamp the campus and hire new faculty. The plan includes over $700 million for new buildings and renovations of the campus, including construction of four new academic buildings, a sharp reduction in the size of the legendary "dustbowl" campus green, a {{convert|200000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} recreation center to replace the Flynn Recreation Complex, a {{convert|285000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} university center to replace McElroy Commons (which is slated for destruction), and the creation of 610 beds for student housing, as well as many other constructions and renovations.<ref>[http://www.vhb.com/bostoncollege/imp/pdf/masterplan07.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326103232/http://www.vhb.com/bostoncollege/imp/pdf/masterplan07.pdf |date=March 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/07/ChronicleSupplementDec07.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227095342/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/07/ChronicleSupplementDec07.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The plan has been criticized by Boston city officials. On February 21, 2008, [[Mayor of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Thomas M. Menino]] warned the school to construct new dormitory building on its main campus, rather than on property acquired from the [[Archdiocese of Boston]]. The school was long an institution that targeted commuter students from the Boston area, however in the school's pursuit of a national legacy, that function has been forgotten as the number of commuter students enrolled dropped from well over 50% to a mere three students, according to statistics published by the alumni magazine.

===Chestnut Hill main campus===
{{Main|Boston College Main Campus Historic District}}

Boston College's main campus in Chestnut Hill, {{convert|6|mi|km}} west of downtown Boston, is {{convert|175|acres|m2|adj=on}} and includes over 120 buildings set on a hilltop overlooking the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. A "[[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]]" streetcar station on Boston's [[MBTA]] public transit system, is located at St. Ignatius Gate; it is the western terminus of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]'s [[Green Line B branch|B branch]] (also known as the "Boston College" line) and connects the school to Boston's [[city center]] and to other destinations in the city. Due largely to its location and presence of buildings featuring gothic towers reaching into the sky, the Boston College campus is known generally as the "Heights" and to some as the "Crowned Hilltop".<ref name="bc-facts">{{cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/about/bc-facts.html |title=Boston College Facts – Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BWtXAgjG?url=http://www.bc.edu/about/bc-facts.html |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Boston College Main Campus Historic District|main campus]] is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2007a}} Reference#: 90000109</ref>
[[File:BCburnslawnsunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Collegiate Gothic]] buildings on Chestnut Hill]]
Designed by [[Charles Donagh Maginnis]] and his firm [[Maginnis & Walsh]] in 1908, the Boston College campus is a seminal example of [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture. Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. Maginnis's design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it—and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[Bell tower|belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new "[[city upon a hill]]". Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the [[Bapst Library]] has been called the "finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for "most beautiful building in Boston". The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor-style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.

Boston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes. Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items. Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by [[Galileo]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and [[Francis Xavier]] as well as world-renowned collections in [[Jesuit]]ana, [[Ireland|Irish]] literature, sixteenth-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] tapestries, ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] pottery, [[Caribbean]] folk art and literature, [[Japanese art|Japanese prints]], [[United States federal government|U.S. government]] documents, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. Opened in 1928, [[Bapst Library]] was named for the first president of Boston College ([[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original "Oxford in America" master plan. Bapst served as the university's main library until 1984. A guide to the building's stained glass windows is available online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/publications/atbc/features/innerfire/slideshow/01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503124321/http://www.bc.edu/publications/atbc/features/innerfire/slideshow/01.html |url-status=dead|title=@BC|archive-date=May 3, 2005}}</ref> The Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections is home to more than 150,000 volumes, some 15 million manuscripts and other important works, including a world-renowned collection of Irish literature. A rare facsimile of the [[Book of Kells]] is on public display in the library's Irish Room, and each day one page of the [[illuminated manuscript]] is turned. It also houses the papers of prominent Boston College alumni. The library is named after the Honorable John. J. Burns (1901 to 1957), Massachusetts Superior Court Justice and a member of the Boston College Class of 1921.

There are a variety of student housing options for students on campus. Those located on lower campus are Walsh, Rubenstein, Ignacio, 90 St. Thomas More Road, 66 Commonwealth Ave, Vanderslice, Gabelli, Voute, Stayer, and 'The Mods'. Roncalli, Welch, and Williams Halls are located on the middle campus on College Road. Freshman housing on Upper Campus includes Kostka, Gonzaga, Fitzpatrick, Medeiros, Cheverus, Claver, Loyola, Xavier, Fenwick, and Shaw House. Additional freshman housing is on the Newton Campus and includes Cushing, Duchesne (East and West), Hardey, and Keyes (North and South).

In the fall of 2010, Boston College began construction of Stokes Hall, a {{convert|183000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} academic building on what was formerly known as the Dustbowl. Stokes Hall is the first academic building to be constructed on the Middle Campus since 2001. It was completed in December 2012, and opened for use in January 2013. In 2014, the university reconstructed St. Mary's Hall and renovated indoor pieces of Carney Hall. More Hall had been demolished to make way for a new residence hall in July 2014, slated to open sometime in 2016.

===Middle Campus===
[[File:Burns Library Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Burns Library]]
* Carney Faculty Center
Located on middle campus, Carney Faculty Center no longer hosts classes and is largely vacant. Rather, the building houses the offices of the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank', the building is distinct from the quadrangle area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of the campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain in the middle of the courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10-year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30–50-year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quadrangle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392 |title=Urban Legends of Boston College - Features - The Heights - Boston College|accessdate=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192700/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392 |archive-date=April 16, 2014}}</ref>

* McElroy Commons
Located on the Southwest Corner of middle campus, McElroy is referred to by students as 'Mac', reflecting the common, but incorrect, pronunciation of the building's name. McElroy Commons holds a variety of offices and contains Carney's Dining Hall which serves the majority of students living on College Road and Upper Campus. Eagle's Nest, a lunch spot is located on the second floor of the building. The first floor of the building was updated in the summer of 2013.

One of the most iconic images of Boston College lies within Gargan Hall of Bapst Library. Gargan Hall is a widely popular study location for students, open 24 hours on most days and known as the quietest place on campus. Gargan Hall regularly finds itself in the top 10 of the world's most beautiful libraries.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} While for years the hall contained a red rug, the hall now is carpeted in emerald green. This art library contains over 51,000 volumes, 150 serial titles, and access to hundreds of journal databases and electronic journals in Art, Architecture, Museum Studies and Photography. The library maintains print and electronic reserves for courses in the Fine Arts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/libraries/collections/bapst.html |title=Bapst Art Library |publisher=Bc.edu |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331022809/http://www.bc.edu//libraries/collections/bapst.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Newton Campus ===
In addition to the main campus at Chestnut Hill, BC's {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} Newton Campus, formerly Newton College of the Sacred Heart, is located {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} to the west in the inner suburb of [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. The campus is home to the law school, Stuart Dining Hall, Trinity Chapel, and residential housing for roughly 40% of the freshman class. Freshman dormitories on Newton Campus include Hardey, Cushing, Duchesne, and Keyes. Two athletic fields and a recreation center are also located on the campus.  A new building opened in 1996 housing the Law Library for the [[Boston College Law School]] in Newton.

===Brighton Campus===
Between 2004 and 2007, Boston College acquired {{convert|65|acres|m2}} of land from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archdiocese of Boston]].<ref name="Factbook" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_sale.htm |title=Abuse in the Catholic Church / The financial cost |work=Boston Globe |date=April 21, 2004 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028123112/http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_sale.htm |archive-date=October 28, 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_statement.htm |title=Abuse in the Catholic Church / Scandal and coverup |work=Boston Globe |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830235347/http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_statement.htm |archive-date=August 30, 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref> This included the archdiocese's former headquarters, sold to the university in 2004 for $107,400,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paulson, Michael|url=http://archive.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_sale.htm |title=Diocesan headquarters sold to BC|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2004-04-21|accessdate=2020-06-27}}</ref>

The grounds are named after [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], the Boston neighborhood in which it is located, as the municipal border sits on the street intersection where the two properties meet.  It is adjacent to the main campus (on the opposite side of [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]]), and includes the Italian Renaissance-style historic mansion of the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]'s residence. The mansion now houses the [[McMullen Museum of Art]], which has a prominent permanent collection and organizes exhibits from all periods and cultures of [[art history]]. Recent exhibits and acquisitions include works by [[Edvard Munch]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Françoise Gilot]], [[John LaFarge]], and [[Jackson Pollock]]. Admission to the museum is free and open to the general public. In 2008, the Weston Jesuit School of Theology merged with Boston College, and the new School of Theology and Ministry moved to Brighton. In addition to other offices and facilities, the Brighton campus is home to baseball, softball and recreational fields.

=== Other properties in Chestnut Hill ===
In 2017, the university purchased the 24-acre Mishkan Tefila Synagogue property in Chestnut Hill. When purchased, the property was only used for administrative services and event parking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/real_estate/2016/07/closes-on-20m-acquisition-of-chestnut-hill.html |title=BC closes on $20M acquisition of Chestnut Hill synagogue campus|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708130623/http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/real_estate/2016/07/closes-on-20m-acquisition-of-chestnut-hill.html |archive-date=July 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The former synagogue's 806-seat auditorium has since been opened as a new rehearsal and event venue for Boston College's Robsham Theater Arts Center. It is currently the largest venue for theater at the university. Additionally, the building houses a large, ballroom-style, multi-purpose room and a hexagon-shaped meeting room for performances, events, and conferences.

===Philosophy===

Philosophy has long been an important part of the university's curriculum. In the seventies, Boston College's Philosophy Department distinguished itself from the majority of American Departments by promoting the study of [[Continental philosophy|Continental European philosophy]] over and above [[analytic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html |title=Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507202622/http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html |archive-date=May 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Under the direction of Department Chair Joseph Flanagan, SJ and following the example of [[Fordham University]], the department branched out from its traditional strengths in philosophy of religion, ancient/medieval philosophy, and [[Thomism]]. It has since become a leading university in the United States for the study of [[continental philosophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~guvenfe/gradsch.htm |title=Philosophy Graduate Schools Friendly to Continental Philosophy|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508160929/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~guvenfe/gradsch.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Department has featured as permanent faculty a number of noted continental philosophers including Heidegger scholar [[William J. Richardson]], SJ as well as experts in phenomenology [[Richard Cobb-Stevens]] and [[Jacques Taminiaux]]. The Department today still has a large proportion of experts in continental philosophy including European philosophy and literature expert [[Richard Kearney]], expert in phenomenology [[John Sallis]], expert in Christian philosophy and apologetics [[Peter Kreeft]], and experts in social and political philosophy [[David M. Rasmussen]] and James Bernauer, SJ. Since the seventies, the Department has also had a number of notable visiting professors including [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], and [[Bernard Lonergan]], SJ.

==Student life==

===AHANA===
AHANA is the term Boston College uses to refer to persons of [[African-American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent.<ref>A Companion to Media Studies - Page 289 by Angharad N. Valdivia</ref><ref>'Minority' Label Gets A Second Look in Boston - ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref> The term was coined at Boston College in 1979 by two students, Alfred Feliciano and Valerie Lewis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v13/n18/ahana.html |title=The Boston College Chronicle|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608191102/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v13/n18/ahana.html |archive-date=2015-06-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> who objected to the name "Office of Minority Programs" used by Boston College at the time. They cited the definition of the word [[minority group|minority]] as "less than" and proposed, instead, to use the term AHANA which they felt celebrated social cultural differences. After receiving overwhelming approval from the university's board of [[trustees]], and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where "[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]" is substituted for "Hispanic"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a [[trademark]], has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the [[United States]]. Many more use the term unofficially. Other institutions that use the AHANA acronym include [[Suffolk University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AHANA PROGRAMS & SERVICES|url=http://www2.suffolk.edu/campuslife/ahana.html |work=Suffolk University|publisher=Suffolk University|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229221341/http://suffolk.edu/campuslife/ahana.html |archive-date=December 29, 2011}}</ref> [[Cleveland State University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AHANA Program|url=http://www.csuohio.edu/offices/odama/ahana/ |work=Cleveland State University|publisher=Cleveland State University|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104011851/http://www.csuohio.edu/offices/odama/ahana/ |archive-date=January 4, 2013}}</ref> [[Eastern Mennonite University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The AHANA student grant|url=http://www.emu.edu/studentlife/multicultural/ahana/ |work=Eastern Mennonite University|publisher=Eastern Mennonite University|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112074416/http://emu.edu/studentlife/multicultural/ahana/ |archive-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> [[Saint Martin's University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AHANA Connections|url=http://www.stmartin.edu/oii/ProgramsServices/Ahana.aspx |work=Saint Martin's University|publisher=Saint Martin's University|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511155601/http://www.stmartin.edu/oii/ProgramsServices/Ahana.aspx |archive-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref> [[Le Moyne College]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Opportunity Programs|url=http://www.lemoyne.edu/tabid/501/Default.aspx |work=LeMoyne|publisher=LeMoyne College|accessdate=January 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508113244/http://www.lemoyne.edu/tabid/501/Default.aspx |archive-date=May 8, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Salem State University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AHANA Programs and Services|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/4068.php |work=Salem State University|publisher=Salem State University|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621003920/http://www.salemstate.edu/4068.php |archive-date=June 21, 2009}}</ref> With some support on campus, there are still racist incidents on campus, such as Black Lives Matter posters being torn down and anti-black vandalism on dorm walls.<ref name="bcgavel.com"/>

==Athletics==
{{Main|Boston College Eagles}}
[[File:Conte Forum Boston College.png|right|thumb|Silvio O. Conte Forum]]

Boston College teams are known as the Eagles. They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports (except men's lacrosse) since the 2005–06 season. The Eagles formerly competed as a charter member of the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] from 1979–80 to 2004–05. Up to that point, Boston College was the only Big East member affiliated with the Catholic Church that played football in the conference. All the football-playing members of the Big East are now secular (usually public) institutions. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), football, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse (non-ACC), sailing (non-ACC), skiing (non-ACC), soccer, swimming, tennis, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), field hockey, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]; while the women's rowing team competes in the [[Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges]] (EAWRC) as well as the ACC; and the co-ed skiing, fencing and sailing teams are non-ACC/NCAA. Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.
[[File:Ice Hockey Conte Forum.jpg|right|thumb|An ice hockey game played at "Kelley Rink," Conte Forum.]] 
The mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., "The Eagles". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the "bald" head of the American bald eagle and the word "win". The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.
[[File:Alumni Stadium Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Stadium, home of the Boston College Eagles.]]
In hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 31 times and has won the Beanpot 16 times, including the 2010, 2011 and 2012 championships. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[jetBlue Park]] after several years at [[City Of Palms Park]] both in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]]. The men's hockey team won the [[2008 NCAA Hockey Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]] on April 12, 2008 with a 4–1 victory over the University of Notre Dame in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]],  the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010 NCAA Championship]] with a 5–0 victory over Wisconsin on April 10, 2010, and in 2012 in the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]]  with a 4–1 victory over [[Ferris State University]] in Tampa.

Principal athletic facilities include [[Alumni Stadium]] (capacity: 44,500), [[Conte Forum]] (8,606), [[Kelley Rink]] (7,884), [[Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field]] (1,000), the Newton Soccer Complex (1,000), and the Flynn Recreation Complex. The [[Yawkey Athletics Center]] opened in the spring of 2005.

On March 18, 2002, Boston College's Athletics program was named to the College Sports Honor Roll as one of the nation's top 20 programs by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/020318/archive_020363.htm |title=College Sports - US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2002-03-18 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507164916/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/020318/archive_020363.htm |archive-date=2005-05-07 }}</ref>

Boston College athletes are among the most academically successful in the nation, according to the NCAA's [[Academic Progress Rate]] (APR). In 2006 Boston College received Public Recognition Awards with fourteen of its sports in the top 10% of the nation academically. The Eagles tied [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] for the highest total of any Division I-A university. Other schools having ten or more sports honored included [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] (12), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (11), and [[Duke University|Duke]] (11). Teams honored were football, men's fencing, men's outdoor track, men's skiing, women's rowing, women's cross country, women's fencing, women's field hockey, women's indoor track, women's outdoor track, women's skiing, women's swimming, women's soccer, women's tennis, and women's volleyball. Boston College's football program was one of only five Division I-A teams that were so honored. The other four were [[Auburn University|Auburn]], Navy, Stanford, and Duke.

===Football===
{{Main|Boston College Eagles football}}
[[File:Boston Eagles footb 1893.gif|thumb|right|Boston College's first football team in 1893.]]
The Boston College Eagles have achieved repeated success in college football. On November 16, 1940, BC's [[Frank Leahy]]-coached championship team took a win from two-season undefeated Georgetown University in the final seconds, in a game that renowned sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] called the greatest ever played.

Two of Boston College's most famous football victories came in dramatic fashion, on the final play of the game. On November 23, 1984, before a national audience on [[CBS]], [[Doug Flutie]] threw a {{convert|48|yd|adj=on}} [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]] to Gerard Phelan for a 47–45 victory over the University of Miami at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. The Eagles finished the [[1984 Boston College Eagles football team|1984 season]] with a 10–2 record, defeating the University of Houston in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]. The team completed the season with a #5 rank in the AP poll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cfreference.net/cfr/school.s?id=133&season=1984 |title=College Football Reference|date=2010-06-15|access-date=2017-10-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615025556/http://cfreference.net/cfr/school.s?id=133&season=1984 |archive-date=2010-06-15}}</ref> Flutie was awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]; the only Eagle to date so honored. (''See also: [[Flutie effect]]'') On November 20, 1993, the Eagles beat undefeated archrival Notre Dame 41–39 on a 41-yard field goal by [[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)|David Gordon]] as time expired, preventing the Fighting Irish a berth in the national championship game.(''See also: [[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)]]'')

In 2007, the Eagles reached the #2 rank in both the AP and Coaches' Poll as well as the [[BCS rankings]], led by [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]]. Ryan was awarded the 2007 [[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]], presented annually to the nation's most outstanding college senior quarterback.<ref>{{cite news | title=Matt Ryan Wins 2007 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award | date=December 3, 2007 | url=http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/news/2007_WinnerRelease.pdf | accessdate=2008-04-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528111845/http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/news/2007_WinnerRelease.pdf | archive-date=May 28, 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref> He was selected third in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] by the [[Atlanta Falcons]], making him the highest-chosen BC player in [[NFL Draft]] history.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2008/draft/players/5446.html | work=CNN | title=SI Grade | accessdate=2010-04-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501070907/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2008/draft/players/5446.html | archive-date=May 1, 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Eagles annually wear red bandanna-themed uniforms in honor of fallen [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] hero [[Welles Crowther]], class of 1999. Crowther, who played on BC's lacrosse team, was an equity trader who died saving the lives of at least 10 people during the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. He used a red bandanna that he often carried to keep from breathing in smoke and debris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/nyregion/welles-crowther-man-in-red-bandanna-911.html |title=Saved on 9/11, by the Man in the Red Bandanna|first=Corey|last=Kilgannon|date=September 8, 2017|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331145600/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/nyregion/welles-crowther-man-in-red-bandanna-911.html |archive-date=March 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtJJViD_Hh8 |title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025030132/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtJJViD_Hh8 |archive-date=October 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Fight Song: "For Boston"===

{{Main|For Boston}}
"For Boston" is claimed to be America's oldest college [[fight song]], composed by T. J. Hurley in 1885. It has two verses but the most commonly sung one is the first verse. Boston-based band [[Dropkick Murphys]] covered this song on their album ''[[Sing Loud, Sing Proud!]]''. Changes have been made to the song, including reworking the phrase "for here men are men" into "for here all are one" in the first verse.

BC students were universally called "'''Heightsmen'''" until 1925 when Caitlin Beckman became the first "'''Heightswoman'''" to receive a BC degree. "'''Heightsonian'''" was originally conceived as a way to gender neutralize the original term "Heightsmen", though "'''Eagles'''", once exclusively used for members of the university's athletics teams, is more commonly used.<ref name=disamBCM /> The term "Golden Eagles" refers strictly to BC graduates who have celebrated their 50th anniversary reunion. "Double Eagles" refer to alumni who attended [[Boston College High School]] and graduated from the college and "Triple Eagles" are those alumni who are also graduates of a graduate program.

There are over 179,000 alumni in over 120 countries around the world.<ref name=Factbook/> Boston College students have enjoyed success in winning prestigious post-graduate fellowships and awards, including recent [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], [[Marshall scholarship|Marshall]], [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon]], [[Fulbright Award|Fulbright]], [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], and [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] [[scholarship]]s, among others.
