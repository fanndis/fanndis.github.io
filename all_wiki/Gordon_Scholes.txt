'''Gordon Glen Denton Scholes''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (7 June 1931 – 9 December 2018) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) and served in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 1967 to 1993, representing the [[Division of Corio]]. He served terms as [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (1975–1976), [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] (1983–1984), and [[Department of Territories (1984–87)|Minister for Territories]] (1984–1987).

==Early life==
Scholes was born in [[Melbourne]], the son of Thomas Glen Denton Scholes and his wife Mary Louisa O'Brien. He was the Victorian Amateur Heavyweight Boxing Champion in 1949.  He joined the [[Australian Labor Party]] in 1955 and was President of the [[Geelong]] ALP Branch from 1962 to 1964. He was President of the [[Geelong Trades Hall Council]] from 1965 to 1966, and a councillor of the [[City of Geelong|Geelong City Council]] from 1965 to 1967.

==Parliament==
[[File:GordonScholes1968.jpg|thumb|left|Scholes in 1968.]]
Scholes was the Labor Party candidate in the [[Division of Corio]], centred on Geelong, in the [[1966 Australian federal election|1966 election]], and was defeated by incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Sir [[Hubert Opperman]].  However, Opperman resigned a few months after the election to become Australia's first High Commissioner to [[Malta]].  Scholes won the seat at the [[1967 Corio by-election|ensuing by-election]] on a swing of 11 percent.  He won the seat in his own right at the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 election]].

===Speaker of the House===
Scholes served as Speaker from 27 February 1975 until 16 February 1976, a period taken up almost entirely by the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]].  On 11 November 1975, following the dismissal of the Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, and the appointment by Kerr of the Leader of the Opposition, [[Malcolm Fraser]], as caretaker Prime Minister, the House of Representatives passed a motion of no confidence in the Fraser government, by 10 votes. The no confidence motion also called on the Governor-General to reinstate the Whitlam government.  As Speaker, Scholes was charged with conveying that resolution of the House to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] and to request Kerr to dismiss Fraser and re-appoint Whitlam. Kerr refused to see the Speaker or to recognise the motion of no confidence in the Fraser government by the House of Representatives, keeping Scholes waiting for more than an hour.<ref>Jenny Hocking The Dismissal Dossier: Everything You Were Never Meant to Know About November 1975 MUP 2017</ref> By the time the Governor-General agreed to see Scholes, Kerr had already dissolved the Parliament on Fraser's advice, which was something Fraser had undertaken to do once he had secured passage of the Supply bills through the Senate. Scholes later accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker shortly after 3pm, and then not waiting to hear from him before dissolving Parliament more than an hour later, with the appointed Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser still as Prime Minister, without the confidence of the House of Representatives.

===Government minister===
Scholes was [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] in the [[first Hawke Ministry]] from March 1983 to December 1984 and then [[Minister for Territories]] until July 1987. He retired before the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 election]].
