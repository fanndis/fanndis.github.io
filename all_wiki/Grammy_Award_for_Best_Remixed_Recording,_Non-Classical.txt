The '''Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical''' is an honor presented to producers for quality [[remix]]ed recordings at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref> Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/|title=Overview|archive-date=October 27, 2009|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027163924/http://www.grammy.com/recording_academy/}}</ref>

The award was first presented as the '''Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical''' at the [[40th Grammy Awards]] in 1998 to [[Frankie Knuckles]]. While the award was under this name, it was presented without specifying a work; when it shifted to its current name in 2002 works were named. According to the category description guide for the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], the award is presented "to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance".<ref name=52nd>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |title=52nd OEP Category Description Guide |accessdate=April 28, 2011 |page=7 |format=PDF |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027172820/http://www.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |archive-date=October 27, 2009 }}</ref> The prize is given to the remixer(s), not the original artist(s).<ref name=52nd/>

French DJ [[David Guetta]], British producer [[Jacques Lu Cont]], and [[Skrillex]] have each won the award twice. Three-time nominees are [[Steve "Silk" Hurley]] and [[Masters at Work]], although neither artist has won the award. American producer [[Maurice Joshua]] was put forward in 2001 and 2003, and won in 2004 for Maurice's Soul Mix of "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]". [[Dave Audé]], [[Frankie Knuckles]], [[David Morales]], [[Roger Sanchez]], [[Hex Hector]] and [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]] have each been nominated for the award twice and have won it once.
