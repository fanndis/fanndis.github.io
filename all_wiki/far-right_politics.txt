[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Benito Mussolini]], dictator and founder of [[Italian Fascism]], a far-right ideology]]
The core of the far-right's worldview is [[organicism]], the idea that society functions as a complete, organized and homogeneous living being. Adapted to the community they wish to constitute or reconstitute (whether based on ethnicity, nationality, religion or race), the concept leads them to reject every form of [[universalism]] in favor of ''[[Self-love|autophilia]]'' and ''alterophobia'', or in other words the idealization of a "we" excluding a "they".{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=22}} The far-right tends to absolutize differences between nations, races, individuals or cultures since they disrupt their efforts towards the [[utopia]]n dream of the "closed" and naturally organized society, perceived as the condition to ensure the rebirth of a community finally reconnected to its quasi-eternal nature and re-established on firm [[metaphysical]] foundations.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=21}}{{sfn|Bar-On|2016|p=xiii}}

As they view their community in a state of decay facilitated by the ruling elites, far-right members portray themselves as a natural, sane and alternative elite, with the redemptive mission of saving society from its promised doom. They reject both their national political system and the global geopolitical order (including their institutions and values, e.g. [[political liberalism]] and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[humanism]]) which are presented as needing to be abandoned or purged of their impurities, so that the "redemptive community" can eventually leave the current phase of [[Liminality|liminal]] crisis to usher in the new era.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=22}}{{Sfn|Bar-On|2016|p=xiii}} The community itself is idealized through great [[Archetype|archetypal]] figures (the [[Golden Age]], the savior, [[decadence]] and global [[conspiracy theories]]) as they glorify [[irrationalistic]] and non-[[materialistic]] values such as the youth or the cult of the dead.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=22}}

Political scientist [[Cas Mudde]] argues that the far-right can be viewed as a combination of four broadly defined concepts, namely [[exclusivism]] (e.g. [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[ethnocentrism]], or [[ethnopluralism]]), [[anti-democratic]] and non-individualist traits (e.g. [[cult of personality]], [[hierarchism]], [[monism]], [[populism]], [[anti-particracy]], an [[organicist]] view of the state), a [[Traditionalist School|traditionalist]] value system lamenting the disappearance of historic frames of reference (e.g. [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], the family, the ethnic, linguistic and religious community and nation as well as the [[natural environment]]) and a socioeconomic program associating [[corporatism]], state control of certain sectors, [[agrarianism]] and a varying degree of belief in the free play of [[socially Darwinistic]] market forces. Mudde then proposes a subdivision of the far-right nebula into moderate and radical leanings, according to their degree of exclusionism and [[essentialism]].<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]]. "The Extreme Right Party Family: An Ideological Approach" (PhD diss., [[Leiden University]], 1998).</ref>{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=44–45}}

Relying on those concepts, far-right politics includes yet is not limited to aspects of [[authoritarianism]], [[anti-communism]] and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]].<ref name="Hilliard"/> Claims that superior people should have greater rights than inferior people are often associated with the far-right, as they have historically favored a social Darwinistic or [[elitist]] hierarchy based on the belief in the legitimacy of the rule of a supposed superior minority over the inferior masses.{{sfn|Woshinsky|2008|pp=154–155}} Regarding the socio-cultural dimension of nationality, culture and migration, one far-right position is the view that certain ethnic, racial or religious groups should stay separate and it is based on the belief that the interests of one's own group should be prioritized.<ref name="Anders1">Widfeldt, Anders, "A fourth phase of the extreme right? Nordic immigration-critical parties in a comparative context". In: ''NORDEUROPAforum'' (2010:1/2), 7–31, [http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2010-1/widfeldt-anders-7/XML/ Edoc.hu]</ref>

== Modern debates ==
=== Terminology ===
According to [[Jean-Yves Camus]] and [[Nicolas Lebourg]], the modern ambiguities in the definition of the "far-right" lie in the fact that the concept is generally used by political adversaries to "disqualify and stigmatize all forms of partisan nationalism by reducing them to the historical experiments of [[Italian Fascism]] [and] [[German National Socialism]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Camus|Lebourg|pp=1–2|2017}}; {{Harvnb|Mudde|2002|p=10}} agrees and notes that "...the term is not only used for scientific purposes but also for political purposes. Several authors define right-wing extremism as a sort of anti-thesis against their own beliefs..."</ref> While the existence of such a political position is widely accepted among scholars, figures associated with the far-right rarely accept this denomination, preferring terms like  "national movement" or "national right".{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|pp=1–2|2017}} There is also debate about how appropriate the labels [[neo-fascist]] or [[neo-Nazi]] are. In the words of Mudde, "the labels Neo-Nazi and to a lesser extent neo-Fascism are now used exclusively for parties and groups that explicitly state a desire to restore the [[Third Reich]] or quote historical National Socialism as their ideological influence".{{Sfn|Mudde|2002|p=12}}

One issue is whether parties should be labelled radical or extreme, a distinction that is made by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] when determining whether or not a party should be banned. An extremist party opposes liberal democracy and the constitutional order while a radical one accepts free elections and the parliament as legitimate structures.{{refn|{{harvnb|Mudde|2002|p=12|ps=: "Simply stated, the difference between radicalism and extremism is that the former is ''verfassungswidrig'' (opposed to the constitution), whereas the latter is ''verfassungsfeindlich'' (hostile towards the constitution). This difference is of the utmost practical importance for the political parties involved, as extremist parties are extensively watched by the (federal and state) ''Verfassungsschutz'' and can even be banned, whereas radical parties are free from this control."}}|group=nb}} After a survey of the academic literature, Mudde concluded in 2002 that the terms "right-wing extremism", "[[right-wing populism]]", "national populism", or "neo-populism" were often used as synonyms by scholars, in any case with "striking similarities", except notably among a few authors studying the extremist-theoretical tradition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Mudde|2002|p=13|ps=: "All in all, most definitions of (whatever) populism do not differ that much in content from the definitions of right-wing extremism ... When the whole range of different terms and definitions used in the field is surveyed, there are striking similarities, with the various terms often being used synonymously and without any clear intention. Only a few authors, most notably those working within the extremist-theoretical tradition, clearly distinguish between the various terms."}}|group=nb}} The label "radical right" is also used in the US tradition, although it has a broader meaning in [[Radical right (United States)|America]] than in [[Radical right (Europe)|Europe]].{{refn|{{harvnb|Mudde|2002|p=13|ps=: "The American Radical Right denotes an "old school of nativism, populism, and hostility to central government [which] was said to have developed into the post-World War II combination of ultranationalism and anti-communism, Christian fundamentalism, militaristic orientation, and anti-alien sentiment."}}|group=nb}}

=== Relation to right-wing politics ===
Another question is what the label "right" implies when it is applied to the extreme [[Right-wing politics|right]], given the fact that many parties that were originally labeled right-wing extremist tended to advance [[neoliberal]] and [[free market]] agendas as late as the 1980s, but now advocate economic policies which are more traditionally associated with the [[Left-wing politics|left]] such as [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]], [[nationalization]] and [[protectionism]]. One approach, drawing on the writings of [[Norberto Bobbio]], argues that attitudes towards political equality are what distinguish the left from the right and they therefore allow these parties to be positioned on the right of the [[political spectrum]].<ref>Bobbio, Norberto (1997). ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction''. Translated by Cameron, Allan. [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0-226-06246-5}}.</ref>

Aspects of far-right ideology can be identified in the agenda of some contemporary right-wing parties, in particular the idea that superior persons should dominate society while undesirable elements should be purged which in extreme cases resulted in [[genocide]]s.{{sfn|Woshinsky|2008|p=156}}  Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform in London, has distinguished between [[fascism]] and right-wing nationalist parties which are often described as far-right such as the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in France.<ref name=":0" /> Mudde notes that the most successful European far-right parties in 2019 were "former mainstream right-wing parties that have turned into populist radical right ones".{{sfn|Mudde|2019}} According to historian [[Mark Sedgwick]], "[t]here is no general agreement as to where the mainstream ends and the extreme starts, and if there ever had been agreement on this, the recent shift in the mainstream would challenge it".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0SCDwAAQBAJ|title=Key Thinkers of the Radical Right: Behind the New Threat to Liberal Democracy|date=2019|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-087760-6|pages=xiii|language=en|author-link=Mark Sedgwick}}</ref>

Proponents of the [[horseshoe theory]] interpretation of the [[Left–right political spectrum|left–right spectrum]] identify the [[far-left]] and the far-right as having more in common with each other as [[extremists]] than each of them has with [[centrists]] or [[moderate]]s.<ref>William Safire.

''The Conversation''. Retrieved 10 June 2020.</ref>

=== Nature of support ===
[[Jens Rydgren]] describes a number of theories as to why individuals support far-right political parties and the academic literature on this topic distinguishes between demand-side theories that have changed the "interests, emotions, attitudes and preferences of voters" and supply-side theories which focus on the programmes of parties, their organization and the opportunity structures within individual political systems.<ref>Rydgren, J. (2007) ''[http://www.jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf The Sociology of the Radical Right]'', Annual Review of Sociology, pp. 241–63</ref> The most common demand-side theories are the [[social breakdown thesis]], the [[relative deprivation thesis]], the [[Modernisation losers thesis|modernization losers thesis]] and the [[ethnic competition thesis]].<ref>Rydgren, J. (2007) ''[http://www.jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf The Sociology of the Radical Right]'', Annual Review of Sociology, p. 247</ref>

The rise of far-right political parties has also been viewed as a rejection of [[post-materialism|post-materialist]] values on the part of some voters. This theory which is known as the [[reverse post-material thesis]] blames both left-wing and [[Progressivism|progressive]] parties for embracing a post-material agenda (including [[feminism]] and [[environmentalism]]) that alienates traditional working class voters.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cleavage politics and the populist right the new cultural conflict in Western Europe|last=Bornschier, Simon.|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|oclc=748925475}}</ref><ref>Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 52–53</ref> Another study argues that individuals who join far-right parties determine whether those parties develop into major political players or whether they remain marginalized.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Art|first1=David|title=Inside the Radical Right|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dUTXJakqLoC|isbn=9781139498838}}</ref>

Early academic studies adopted psychoanalytical explanations for the far-right's support. The 1933 publication ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' by [[Wilhelm Reich]] argued the theory that fascists came to power in Germany as a result of [[sexual repression]]. For some far-right political parties in Western Europe, the issue of immigration has become the dominant issue among them, so much so that some scholars refer to these parties as "anti-immigrant" parties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Trevor J.|date=8 July 2015|title=All in the party family?

== Intellectual history ==
=== Background ===
The [[French Revolution]] in 1789 created a major shift in political thought by challenging the established ideas supporting hierarchy with new ones about universal [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Beiner, Ronald Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1148094406|title=Dangerous Minds : Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Return of the Far Right|date=12 March 2018|isbn=978-0-8122-9541-2|pages=11|oclc=1148094406}}</ref> The modern [[left–right political spectrum]] also emerged during this period: democrats and proponents of [[universal suffrage]] were located on the left side of the elected French Assembly, while monarchists seated farthest to the right.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=1–2}}

The strongest opponents of [[liberalism]] and [[democracy]] during the 19th century, such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], were highly critical of the Revolution.<ref name=":1" /> Those who advocated a return to the [[absolute monarchy]] during the 19th century called themselves "ultra-monarchists" and embraced a "[[Mysticism|mystic]]" and "[[Providentialism|providentialist]]" vision of the world where royal dynasties were seen as the "repositories of divine will". The opposition to liberal modernity was based on the belief that hierarchy and rootedness are more important than equality and liberty, with the latter two being dehumanizing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beiner, Ronald Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1148094406|title=Dangerous Minds : Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Return of the Far Right|date=12 March 2018|isbn=978-0-8122-9541-2|pages=14|oclc=1148094406}}</ref>

=== Emergence ===
In the French public debate following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], ''far right'' was used to describe the strongest opponents of the ''[[far left]]'', i.e. those who supported the events occurring in Russia.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=21}} A number of thinkers on the far-right nonetheless claimed an influence from an [[anti-Marxist]] and [[Egalitarianism|anti-egalitarian]] definition of [[socialism]], based on a military comradeship that rejected [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class analysis]],{{refn|What [[Oswald Spengler]] had called a "socialism of the blood".|group=nb}} and sometimes described by scholars as a form of "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|socialist revisionism]]".<ref name=":28">{{citation|last=Bar-On|first=Tamir|title=Intellectual Right – Wing Extremism – Alain de Benoist's Mazeway Resynthesis since 2000|date=7 December 2011|work=The Extreme Right in Europe|pages=333–358|editor-last=Backes|editor-first=Uwe|edition= 1|publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht|language=en|doi=10.13109/9783666369223.333|isbn=9783525369227|editor2-last=Moreau|editor2-first=Patrick}}</ref> They included [[Charles Maurras]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] and [[Ernst Niekisch]].<ref name="woods">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEKHDAAAQBAJ|title=The Conservative Revolution in the Weimar Republic|last=Woods|first=Roger|date=25 March 1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230375857|pages=1–2|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":132">{{cite web|url=https://tempspresents.com/2009/08/24/stephane-francoisqu%e2%80%99est-ce-que-la-revolution-conservatrice/|title=Qu'est ce que la Révolution Conservatrice ?|last=[[Stéphane François]]|date=24 August 2009|website=Fragments sur les Temps Présents|language=fr-FR|access-date=23 July 2019}}</ref>{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=7–8}} Those thinkers eventually split along nationalist lines from the original [[communist movement]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] contradicting [[nationalist]] theories with the idea that "the working men [had] no country".{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=9–10}} The main reason for that ideological confusion can be found in the consequences of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, which according to Swiss historian {{ill|Philippe Burrin|fr}} had completely redesigned the political landscape in Europe by diffusing the idea of an anti-individualistic concept of "national unity" rising above the right and left division.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=7–8}}

As the concept of "the masses" was introduced into the political debate through [[industrialization]] and the [[universal suffrage]], a new right-wing founded on national and social ideas began to emerge, what [[Zeev Sternhell]] has called the "revolutionary right" and a foreshadowing of [[fascism]]. The rift between the left and nationalists was furthermore accentuated by the emergence of anti-militarist and anti-patriotic movements like [[anarchism]] or [[syndicalism]], which shared even less similarities with the far-right.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=9–10}} The latter began to develop a "nationalist mysticism" entirely different from that on the left, and antisemitism turned into a credo of the far-right, marking a break from the traditional economic "anti-Judaism" defended by parts of the far-left, in favour of a racial and pseudo-scientific notion of [[alterity]]. Various nationalist leagues began to form across Europe like the [[Pan-German League]] or the [[Ligue des Patriotes]], with the common goal of a uniting the masses beyond social divisions.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=11–12}}<ref name=":39">{{Cite journal|last=Dupeux|first=Louis|author-link=Louis Dupeux|date=1994|title=La nouvelle droite " révolutionnaire-conservatrice " et son influence sous la république de Weimar|journal=Revue d'Histoire Moderne & Contemporaine|volume=41|issue=3|pages=474–75|doi=10.3406/rhmc.1994.1732}}</ref>

=== ''Völkisch'' and revolutionary right ===
[[File:Llegada de integrantes de la División Azul a la estación del Norte (33 de 40) - Fondo Marín-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Spanish [[Falangism|Falangist]] volunteer forces of the [[Blue Division]] entrain at [[San Sebastián]], 1942]]
The [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] emerged in the late 19th century, drawing inspiration from [[German Romanticism]] and its fascination for a [[Holy Roman Empire|medieval Reich]] supposedly organized into a harmonious hierarchical order. Erected on the idea of "[[blood and soil]]", it was a [[Racialism|racialist]], [[Populism|populist]], [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], [[Romantic nationalism|romantic nationalist]] and an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] movement from the 1900s onward as a consequence of a growing exclusive and racial connotation.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=16–18}} They idealized the myth of an "original nation", that still could be found at their times in the rural regions of Germany, a form of "primitive democracy freely subjected to their natural elites".<ref name=":132"/> Thinkers led by [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] distorted [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] to advocate a "race struggle" and an hygienist vision of the world. The purity of the bio-mystical and primordial nation theorized by the ''Völkischen'' then began to be seen as corrupted by foreign elements, Jewish in particular.{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|pp=16–18|p=}}

Translated in [[Maurice Barrès]]' concept of "the earth and the dead", these ideas influenced the pre-fascist "revolutionary right" across Europe. The latter had its origin in the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' intellectual crisis and, in the words of [[Fritz Stern]], the deep "cultural despair" of thinkers feeling uprooted within the [[rationalism]] and [[scientism]] of the modern world.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Stern|first=Fritz R.|url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofcultur00ster|title=The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of the Germanic Ideology|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520026438|language=en|author-link=Fritz Stern|url-access=registration}}</ref> It was characterized by a rejection of the established social order, with revolutionary tendencies and anti-capitalist stances, a populist and [[Referendum|plebiscitary]] dimension, the advocacy of violence as a means of action and a call for individual and collective [[palingenesis]].{{Sfn|Camus|Lebourg|2017|p=19}}

=== Contemporary thought ===
The key thinkers of contemporary far-right politics are claimed by [[Mark Sedgwick]] to share four key elements, namely [[Declinism|apocalyptism]], fear of global elites, belief in [[Carl Schmitt|Carl Schmitt's]] friend-enemy distinction and the idea of [[metapolitics]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1060182005|title=Key thinkers of the radical right : behind the new threat to liberal democracy|others=Sedgwick, Mark J.|date=4 January 2019|isbn=978-0-19-087760-6|location=New York, NY|oclc=1060182005}}</ref> The apocalyptic strain of thought begins in [[Oswald Spengler|Oswald Spengler's]] ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' and is shared by [[Julius Evola]] and [[Alain de Benoist]]. It continues in ''[[The Death of the West]]'' by [[Pat Buchanan]] as well as in the fears of [[Eurabia|Islamization of Europe]].<ref name=":2" /> Related to it is the fear of global elites, who are seen as responsible for the decline.<ref name=":2" /> [[Ernst Jünger]] was concerned about [[rootless cosmopolitan]] elites, while de Benoist and Buchanan oppose the [[managerial state]] and [[Curtis Yarvin]] is against "the Cathedral".<ref name=":2" /> Schmitt's friend-enemy distinction has inspired the French [[Nouvelle Droite]] idea of [[ethnopluralism]] which has become highly influential on the [[alt-right]] when combined with American [[racism]].<ref name=":2" /> [[File:Manifestazione Napoli 2011.jpg|thumb|[[CasaPound]] rally in Naples]]
In a 1961 book deemed influential in the European far-right at large, French neo-fascist writer [[Maurice Bardèche]] introduced the idea that fascism could survive the 20th century under a new [[Metapolitics|metapolitical]] guise adapted to the changes of the times. Rather than trying to revive doomed regimes with their [[One-party state|single party]], [[secret police]] or public display of [[Caesarism]], Bardèche argued that its theorists should promote the core philosophical idea of [[fascism]] regardless of its framework,{{sfn|Bar-On|2016|p=xiii}} i.e. the concept that only a minority, "the physically saner, the morally purer, the most conscious of national interest", can represent best the community and serve the less gifted in what Bardèche calls a new "[[Feudalism|feudal]] contract".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desbuissons|first=Ghislaine|date=1990|title=Maurice Bardèche, écrivain et théoricien fasciste?|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|language=fr|volume=37|issue=1|pages=148–159|doi=10.3406/rhmc.1990.1531|issn=0048-8003|jstor=20529642}}</ref>

Another influence on contemporary far-right thought has been the [[Traditionalist School]] which included [[Julius Evola]] and has influenced [[Steve Bannon]] and [[Aleksandr Dugin]], advisors to [[Donald Trump]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] as well as the [[Jobbik]] party in Hungary.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Teitelbaum|first=Benjamin R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdHADwAAQBAJ|title=War for Eternity: The Return of Traditionalism and the Rise of the Populist Right|date=2020-04-21|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-199204-4|pages=2–3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Teitelbaum|first=Benjamin R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdHADwAAQBAJ|title=War for Eternity: The Return of Traditionalism and the Rise of the Populist Right|date=2020-04-21|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-199204-4|pages=11|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Teitelbaum|first=Benjamin R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdHADwAAQBAJ|title=War for Eternity: The Return of Traditionalism and the Rise of the Populist Right|date=2020-04-21|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-199204-4|pages=58|language=en}}</ref>

== History by country ==
=== Africa ===
==== Rwanda ====
A number of far-right extremist and paramilitary groups carried out the [[Rwandan genocide]] under the [[racist]] [[Supremacism|supremacist]] ideology of [[Hutu Power]], developed by  journalist and Hutu supremacist [[Hassan Ngeze]].<ref name="Saha">{{cite book |editor-last=Saha |editor-first=Santosh C |title=Ethnicity and sociopolitical change in Africa and other developing countries: a constructive discourse in state building |date=2008 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-2332-4 |page=92 |edition= first}}</ref>

On 5 July 1975, exactly two years after the [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état]] the far-right [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (''Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement'', or MRND) was founded under President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]. Between 1975 and 1991, the MRND was the only legal political party in the country. It was dominated by [[Hutu]]s, particularly from Habyarimana's home region of Northern Rwanda. An elite group of MRND party members who were known to have influence on the President and his wife [[Agathe Habyarimana]] are known as the [[akazu]], an informal organization of [[Hutu]] extremists whose members planned and lead the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Lennart |last=Aspegren |title=Never again?: Rwanda and the World |work=Human Rights Law: From Dissemination to Application — Essays in Honour of Göran Melander |series=The Raoul Wallenberg Institute human rights library |volume=26 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=9004151818 |page=173}}</ref><ref name=HRW>{{cite book|last1=Des Forges|first1=Alison|title=Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda – History → The Army, the Church and the Akazu |date=March 1999|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|isbn=1-56432-171-1|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-09.htm}}</ref>

===== Interahamwe =====
{{main|Interahamwe}}
The Interahamwe was formed around 1990 as the [[youth wing]] of the MRND and enjoyed the backing of the Hutu Power government. The Interahamwe were the main perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, during which an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 [[Tutsi]], [[Twa]] and moderate Hutus were killed from April to July 1994, and the term ''Interahamwe'' was widened to mean any civilian bands killing Tutsi.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reyntjens|first1=Filip|title=Rwanda's Untold Story.

The Interahamwe were driven out of Rwanda after Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] victory in the [[Rwandan Civil War]] in July 1994, and are considered a [[terrorist organisation]] by many African and Western governments. The Interahamwe and splinter groups such as the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] continue to wage an [[insurgency]] against Rwanda from neighboring countries, where they are also involved in local conflicts and terrorism.

===== Coalition for the Defence of the Republic =====
{{main|Coalition for the Defence of the Republic}}
Other far-right groups and paramilitaries involved included the [[anti-democratic]] [[segregationist]] Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) which called for complete segregation of Hutus from Tutsis. The CDR had a paramilitary wing known as the [[Impuzamugambi]]. Together with the Interahamwe militia, the Impuzamugambi played a central role in the Rwandan genocide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rwanda genocide of 1994 |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Rwanda-genocide-of-1994/Genocide#ref1111309 |website=Encyclopedia Britanica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=3 June 2020 |page=3}}</ref><ref name="Saha" />

==== South Africa ====
===== Herstigte Nasionale Party =====
{{main|Herstigte Nasionale Party}}
The far-right in South Africa emerged as the Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP) in 1969, formed by [[Albert Hertzog]] as breakaway from the predominant right-wing South African [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], an [[Afrikaner]] [[ethno-nationalist]] party that implemented the racist, segregationist program of [[apartheid]], the legal system of political, economic and social separation of the races intended to maintain and extend political and economic control of South Africa by the White minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/pcw/98678.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233840/http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/pcw/98678.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=The End of Apartheid|work=Archive: Information released online prior to January 20, 2009|publisher=United States Department of State|date=2009|access-date=5 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvet.org.za/displayvideo.php?vid=2D-F5-64|title=The prohibition of the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party and a number of subsidiary organizations is being rescinded|date=2 February 1990|publisher=CVET - Community Video Education Trust|website=www.cvet.org.za|quote=Organizations: Nationalist Party}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/national-party-np|title=National Party (NP)|last=sahoboss|date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

===== Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging =====
{{main|Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging}}
In 1973, [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], a former [[South African Police|police officer]] founded the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), a South African [[neo-Nazi]] paramilitary organisation, often described as a [[white supremacist]] group.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Turpin-Petrosino|first1= Carolyn|year= 2013|title= The Beast Reawakens: Fascism's Resurgence from Hitler's Spymasters to Today's Neo-Nazi Groups and Right-Wing Extremists|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VFasBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT181|publisher= Taylor and Francis|isbn= 9781134014248|quote= There are hate groups in South Africa.

Since its founding in 1973 by Eugène Terre'Blanche and six other far-right Afrikaners, it has been dedicated to [[secessionist]] Afrikaner nationalism and the creation of an independent [[Boer]]-Afrikaner republic in part of South Africa. During [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]] in the early 1990s, the organization terrorized and killed black South Africans.<ref name="trc">{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/decisions/1999/ac990221.htm|title=Amnesty decision|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission|year=1999|access-date=22 April 2007}}</ref>

==== Togo ====
Togo has been ruled by members of the Gnassingbé family and the far-right [[military dictatorship]] formerly known as the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] since 1969. Despite the legalisation of political parties in 1991 and the ratification of a democratic constitution in 1992, the regime continues to be regarded as oppressive. In 1993, the European Union cut off aid in reaction to the regime's human-rights offenses. After's Eyadema's death in 2005, his son Faure Gnassingbe took over, then stood down and was re-elected in elections that were widely described as fraudulent and occasioned violence that resulted in as many as 600 deaths and the flight from Togo of 40,000 refugees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Togo profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14106781|work=BBC News|access-date=11 January 2013}}</ref>

===== Human rights =====
{{main|Human rights in Togo}}
Throughout the reign of the Gnassingbé family, Togo has been extremely oppressive. According to a [[United States Department of State]] report based on conditions in 2010, human rights abuses are common and include "security force use of excessive force, including [[torture]], which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on [[freedom of the press|freedoms of press]], [[Freedom of Assembly|assembly]], and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]; and forced labor, including by children."<ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Togo">{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Togo|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154374.htm|work=US Department of State|access-date=11 January 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Masakro-ĉe-Suchitoto-Salvadoro.jpg|thumb|A billboard serving as a reminder of one of many [[List of massacres in El Salvador|massacres]] that occurred during the civil war]]
During the [[El Salvador Civil War]], far-right death squads known in Spanish by the name of ''Escuadrón de la Muerte'', literally "Squadron of Death, achieved notoriety when a [[sniper]] assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] while he was saying [[Mass (Roman Rite)|Mass]] in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|three American nuns and a lay worker]] were [[gangrape]]d and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing thousands of peasants and activists. Funding for the squads came primarily from right-wing Salvadoran businessmen and landowners.<ref>Bonner, Raymond, Weakness and Deceit:: U.S. Policy and El Salvador, New York Times Books, 1984, p.330</ref>

Honduras also had far-right death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 3-16 (Honduras)|Battalion 3–16]].

===== National Synarchist Union =====
{{main|National Synarchist Union}}
The largest far-right party in Mexico is the National Synarchist Union. It was historically a movement of the [[Roman Catholic]] extreme right, in some ways akin to [[clerical fascism]] and [[falangism]], implacably opposed to the [[left-wing]] and [[secularist]] policies of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] and its predecessors that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and 2012 to 2018.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hammett |first1=Brian |date=1999 |title=A Concise History of Mexico}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin T. |last= Smith |title=Pistoleros and Popular Movements: The Politics of State Formation in Postrevolutionary Oaxaca|url=https://archive.org/details/pistolerospopula00smit |url-access=limited |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2009|location=Lincoln|page=[https://archive.org/details/pistolerospopula00smit/page/n305 289]|isbn=978-0-8032-2280-9}}</ref>

[[File:Ku Klux Klan parade7.jpg|thumb|left|Ku Klux Klan parade in Washington, D.C., September 1926]]
The term ''far-right'', along with ''extreme right'' and ''ultra-right'', has been used in the United States to describe "militant forms of insurgent revolutionary right ideology and separatist ethnocentric nationalism" such as [[Christian Identity]], the [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] and the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]].<ref name=":8" /> They share conspiracist views of power which are overwhelmingly antisemitic and reject pluralist democracy in favour of an organic oligarchy that would unite the perceived homogeneously-racial ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkish]]'' nation.<ref name=":8">{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/research/chart_of_sectors.html|title=Sectors of the U.S. Right Active in the Year 2011|website=The Public Eye|publisher=[[Political Research Associates]]|access-date=9 September 2019}}</ref>

===== Radical right =====
{{main|Radical right (United States)}}
Starting in the 1870s and continuing through the late 19th century, numerous white supremacist paramilitary groups operated in the South, with the goal of organizing against and intimidating supporters of the Republican Party. Examples of such groups included the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and the [[White League]]. The [[Second KKK|Second Ku Klux Klan]], which was formed in 1915, combined [[Christian fundamentalism|Protestant fundamentalism]] and moralism with right-wing extremism. Its major support came from the urban south, the midwest and the Pacific Coast.<ref>Lipset & Raab, p. 116</ref> While the Klan initially drew [[Upper middle class in the United States|upper middle class]] support, its bigotry and violence alienated these members and it came to be dominated by less educated and poorer members.<ref>Lipset & Raab, p. 125</ref>

The Klan claimed that there was a secret Catholic army within the United States loyal to the [[Pope]], that one million [[Knights of Columbus]] were arming themselves and that [[Irish-American]] policemen would shoot [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]] as heretics. They claimed that the Catholics were planning to take [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and put the Vatican in power and that all presidential assassinations had been carried out by Catholics. The prominent Klan leader [[D. C. Stephenson]] believed in the [[antisemitic canard]] of [[Jewish control of finance]], claiming that international Jewish bankers were behind the [[World War I]] and planned to destroy economic opportunities for Christians. Other Klansmen in the [[Jewish Bolshevism]] conspiracy theory and claimed that the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[communism]] were controlled by [[Jews]]. They frequently reprinted parts of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[New York City]] was condemned as an evil city controlled by Jews and Catholics. The objects of the Klan fear tended to vary by locale and included [[African Americans]] as well as American [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholics]], [[American Jews|Jews]], [[Labor unions in the United States|labour unions]], [[Temperance movement|liquor]], [[Asian Americans|Orientals]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobblies]]. They were also anti-elitist and attacked "the intellectuals", seeing themselves as egalitarian defenders of the common man.<ref>Lipset & Raab, pp. 138–39</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], there were a large number of small nativist groups, whose ideologies and bases of support were similar to those of earlier nativist groups. However, proto-fascist movements such as [[Huey Long]]'s [[Share Our Wealth]] and [[Charles Coughlin]]'s [[National Union for Social Justice (organization)|National Union for Social Justice]] emerged which differed from other right-wing groups by attacking big business, calling for economic reform and rejecting nativism. Coughlin's group later developed a racist ideology.<ref>Lipset & Raab, p. 152</ref>

Although small militias had existed throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the groups became more popular during the early 1990s, after a series of standoffs between armed citizens and federal government agents such as the 1992 [[Ruby Ridge]] siege and 1993 [[Waco Siege]]. These groups expressed concern for what they perceived as government tyranny within the United States and generally held [[Constitutionalism in the United States|constitutionalist]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] political views, with a strong focus on the Second Amendment gun rights and tax protest. They also embraced many of the same conspiracy theories as predecessor groups on the radical right, particularly the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] conspiracy theory. Currently active examples of such groups are the [[Oath Keepers]] and the [[Three Percenters]]. A minority of militia groups such as the [[Aryan Nations]] and the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] were white nationalists and saw militia and patriot movements as a form of white resistance against what they perceived to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[multiculturalist]] government. More recently, militia and patriot organizations were involved in the 2014 [[Bundy standoff]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Examining the Sovereign Citizen Movement in the Obama Era|url=http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/examining-sovereign-citizen-movement-obama-era|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140502161959/http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/examining-sovereign-citizen-movement-obama-era|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 2, 2014|publisher=Politics & Policy|access-date=May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sovereign Citizens: A Growing Domestic Threat to Law Enforcement|url=https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/sovereign-citizens-a-growing-domestic-threat-to-law-enforcement|publisher=FBI|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref> and the 2016 [[occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Karina |date=May 10, 2016 |title=Bundy Filing Shows Intent Behind Refuge Takeover |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/05/10/bundy-filing-shows-intent-behind-refuge-takeover.htm |location=Pasadena, California|agency=[[Courthouse News Service]] |access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/other/2016/05/09/ABmotiondismiss.pdf |title=Defendant Ammon Bundy's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction |last1=Casey |first1=Lissa |last2=Arnold |first2=Michael |date=May 9, 2016 |access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' Rally (35780274914) crop.jpg|thumb|Far-right flags on display at the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville]]
After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[Counterjihad]] movement, supported by groups such as [[Stop Islamization of America]] and individuals such as [[Frank Gaffney]] and [[Pamela Geller]], began to gain traction among the American right. The Counterjihad members were widely dubbed [[Islamophobic]] for their vocal condemnation of the Islamic faith and their belief that there was a significant threat posed by Muslims living in America. Its proponents believed that the United States was under threat from "Islamic supremacism", accusing the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and even prominent [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] such as [[Suhail A. Khan]] and [[Grover Norquist]] of supporting radical Islamists such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The [[alt-right]] emerged during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] election cycle in support of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump presidential campaign]]. It draws influence from [[paleoconservatism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[white nationalism]], the [[manosphere]] and the [[Identitarian movement|Identitarian]] and [[neoreactionary movement|neoreactionary]] movements. The alt-right differs from previous radical right movements due to its heavy internet presence on sites such as [[4chan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

{{main|Uyoku dantai}}
In 1996, the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] estimated that there were over 1,000 extremist right-wing groups in Japan, with about 100,000 members in total. These groups are known in Japanese as ''Uyoku dantai''. While there are political differences among the groups, they generally carry a philosophy of anti-leftism, hostility towards China, North Korea and South Korea and justification of Japan's role in World War II. ''Uyoku dantai'' groups are well known for their highly visible [[Sound trucks in Japan|propaganda vehicles fitted with loudspeakers]] and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles play patriotic or wartime-era songs.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Activists affiliated with such groups have used [[Molotov cocktail]]s and time bombs to intimidate moderate politicians and public figures, including former Deputy Foreign Minister Hitoshi Tanaka and [[Fuji Xerox]] Chairman [[Yotaro Kobayashi]]. An ex-member of a right-wing group set fire to [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] politician [[Koichi Kato (politician, born 1939)|Koichi Kato]]'s house.

The skinhead culture gained momentum during the late 1980s and peaked during the late 1990s. In 1991, Finland received a number of Somali immigrants who became the main target of Finnish skinhead violence in the following years, including four attacks using explosives and a racist murder. Asylum seeker centres were attacked, in [[Joensuu]] skinheads would force their way into an asylum seeker centre and start shooting with shotguns.

{{main|Far-right politics in Germany (1945–present)}}
In 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] took control of Germany and banned the [[swastika]], [[Nazi Party]] and the publication of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.

In 1960, the West German parliament voted unanimously to "make it illegal to incite hatred, to provoke violence, or to insult, ridicule or defame 'parts of the population' in a manner apt to breach the peace". Today, German law outlaws anything that "approves of, glorifies or justifies the violent and despotic rule of the National Socialists".<ref name="naziban"/> Section 86a of the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' (Criminal Code) outlaws any "use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations" outside the contexts of "art or science, research or teaching". The law primarily outlaws the use of Nazi symbols, flags, insignia, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting.<ref name="iuscomp">{{cite web|title=Section 86a Use of Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#86a|work=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB)|publisher=German Law Archive}}</ref>

{{main|Far-right politics in Poland}}
[[File:Trytek i NOP.jpg|thumb|[[National Revival of Poland]] demonstration led by Catholic-[[sedevacantist]] priest Rafał Trytek]]
Following the collapse of [[Communist Poland]], the far-right ideology became visible. The pan-Slavic and neopagan Polish National Union political party at its peak was one of the larger groups active in the early 1990s, numbering then some 4,000 members and making international headlines for its antisemitism and anti-Catholicism. The [[National Revival of Poland]], being a marginal political party under the leadership of Adam Gmurczyk, operates since the late 1980s. It is a member of [[European National Front]] and a co-founder of [[International Third Position]]. The organization [[Association for Tradition and Culture "Niklot"]] was founded in 1998 by Tomasz Szczepanski, a former NOP{{clarification needed|date=September 2020|reason=what is the full name of NOP?}} member, promoting Slavic supremacy and neopaganism. Since the mid-1990s, the ultra-Catholic [[Radio Maryja]] station has been on air with an anti-modernist, nationalist and xenophobic program.<ref>Liang (2007), p. 265f.</ref> [[All-Polish Youth]] and [[National Radical Camp (1993)|National Radical Camp]] were "recreated" in 1989 and 1993, respectively becoming Poland's most prominent far-right organizations.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1995, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] estimated the number of far-right and [[white power skinhead]]s in Poland at 2,000, the fifth highest number after Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United States.<ref>Suall et al., ''The Skinhead International'' (1995), p. 1.</ref> Since late 2000s, native [[white power skinhead]], [[white supremacy]] and [[neo-Nazi]] groups largely were absorbed into more casual and better organized [[Autonome Nationalisten|Autonomous Nationalists]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

[[File:Onr kraków 2007 04.jpg|thumb|[[National Radical Camp (1993)|National Radical Camp]] march in [[Kraków]], July 2007]]
On the political level, the biggest victories achieved so far by the far-right were in the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001]], [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005]], [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015]] and [[2019 Polish parliamentary election|2019]] elections. The [[League of Polish Families]] won 38 seats in 2001, and 34 in 2005. In 2015, entering parliament from the list of [[Kukiz'15]], the far-right [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement]] gained five seats out of Kukiz's forty-two. In April 2016, the National Movement leadership decided to break-off with [[Kukiz'15|Kukiz's movement]], but only one [[Member of parliament|parliamentarian]] followed the party's instructions. The ones that decided to stay with [[Kukiz'15]], together with few other Kukiz's parliamentarians, formed parliamentary nationalist association called National Democracy (Endecja).<ref>

==== Romania ====
===== Greater Romania Party =====
{{main|Greater Romania Party}}
The preimenant far-right party in Romania is the Greater Romania Party, founded in 1991 by Tudor, who was formerly known as a "[[Poet laureate|court poet]]" of [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist]] dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]<ref>{{cite book|first1=Georgi|last1=Verbeeck|first2=Mariana|last2=Hausleitner|chapter=Cultural Memory and Legal Responses: Holocaust Denial in Belgium and Romania|title=Facing the Catastrophe: Jews and Non-Jews in Europe During World War II|publisher=Berg|year=2011|page=238|isbn=9781845208257}}</ref> and his literary mentor, the writer [[Eugen Barbu]], one year after Tudor launched the ''România Mare'' weekly magazine, which remains the most important propaganda tool of the PRM. Tudor subsequently launched a companion daily newspaper called ''Tricolorul''. The historical expression ''[[Greater Romania]]'' refers to the idea of recreating the former [[Kingdom of Romania]] which existed during the interwar period. Having been the largest entity to bear the name of ''Romania'', the frontiers were marked with the intent of uniting most territories inhabited by [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] into a single country and it is now a rallying cry for [[Romanian nationalists]]. Due to internal conditions under [[Communist Romania]] after World War II, the expression's use was forbidden in publications until after the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989. The party's initial success was partly attributed to the deep rootedness of Ceaușescu's [[national communism]] in Romania.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Shafir|chapter=Memories, Memorials and Membership: Romanian Utilitarian Anti-Semitism and Marshal Antonescu|title=Romania Since 1989: Politics, Economics, and Society|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2004|page=71|isbn=9780739105924}}</ref>

Both the ideology and the main political focus of the Greater Romania Party are reflected in frequently strongly nationalistic articles written by Tudor. The party has called for the outlawing of the ethnic Hungarian party, the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]], for allegedly plotting the secession of Transylvania.<ref>Cinpoeș, Radu (October 2012).

==== Serbia ====
{{main|Far-right politics in Serbia}}
The far-right in Serbia mostly focuses on [[Serbian nationalism|national]] and [[Religious extremism|religious]] factors and it refers to any manifestation of far-right politics in the [[Republic of Serbia]]. Today a large number of far-right groups operate in Serbia including the [[Serbian Radical Party]], [[Serbian Party Oathkeepers]], [[Leviathan Movement]], Serbian Right and the explicitly neo-Nazi [[Nacionalni stroj]] (National Alignment). Nacionalni stroj was banned in Serbia in 2012.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Minkenberg|title=Historical Legacies and the Radical Right in Post-Cold War Central and Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eA3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|date=15 April 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-3-8382-6124-9|page=192}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/serbian/news/2006/01/060109_stroj_ns.shtml "Nacionalni stroj" pred sudom], [[BBC]] Serbian.com, 9 January 2006</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.novossti.com/2012/02/tempirane-bombe-mrznje/|title=Tempirane bombe mržnje|journal=[[Novosti (Croatia)|Novosti]]|issue=633|date=4 February 2012|language=hr|access-date=6 February 2012}}</ref>

==== United Kingdom ====
{{main|Far-right politics in the United Kingdom}}
The British far-right rose out of the [[fascist]] movement. In 1932, [[Oswald Mosley]] founded the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF) which was banned during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&q=BUF+50,000+members&pg=PA181|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref> Founded in 1954 by [[A. K. Chesterton]], the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] became the main British far-right group at the time. It was a [[pressure group]] rather than a political party, and did not contest elections. Most of its members were part of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and were known for politically embarrassing stunts at party conferences.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Martin |title=The National Front |date=1977 |publisher=Fontana |location=Glasgow |isbn=0006348246 |pages=28–29}}</ref> Other fascist parties included the [[British National Front|National Front]] (NF), the [[White Defence League]] and the [[National Labour Party (UK 1950s)|National Labour Party]] who eventually merged to form the [[British National Party (1960s)|British National Party]] (BNP).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barberis |first1=Peter |last2=McHugh |first2=John |last3=Tyldesley |first3=Mike |title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century |date=2000 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=0826458149 |page= 177}}</ref>

With the decline of the [[British Empire]] becoming inevitable, British far-right parties turned their attention to internal matters. The 1950s had seen an increase in immigration to the UK from its former colonies, particularly India, Pakistan, the Caribbean and Uganda.

Right-wing terrorism is [[terrorism]] motivated by a variety of far right ideologies and beliefs, including [[anti-communism]], [[neo-fascism]], [[neo-Nazism]], [[racism]], [[xenophobia]] and [[opposition to immigration]]. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation.<ref name="Aubrey, p. 45">Aubrey, Stefan M. ''The New Dimension of International Terrorism''. p. 45. Zurich: vdf Hochschulverlag AG, 2004. {{ISBN|3-7281-2949-6}}</ref> Modern right-wing terrorism first appeared in western Europe in the 1980s and it first appeared in Eastern Europe following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="Moghadam, pp. 57-58"/>

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with nationalist or fascist-oriented governments.<ref name="Aubrey, p. 45"/> The core of this movement includes [[white power skinhead|neo-fascist skinheads]], far-right [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]], youth sympathisers and intellectual guides who believe that the state must rid itself of foreign elements in order to protect rightful citizens.<ref name="Moghadam, pp. 57-58"/> However, they usually lack a rigid ideology.<ref name="Moghadam, pp. 57-58">Moghadam, Assaf.

New York: Infobase Publishing, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7910-8307-1}}</ref>

According to [[Cas Mudde]], far-right terrorism and violence in the West have been generally perpetrated in recent times by individuals or groups of individuals "who have at best a peripheral association" with politically relevant organizations of the far-right. Nevertheless, Mudde follows, "in recent years far-right violence has become more planned, regular, and lethal, as terrorists attacks in [[Christchurch mosque shootings|Christchurch]] (2019), [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting|Pittsburgh]] (2018), and [[2011 Norway attacks|Utøya]] (2011) show."{{sfn|Mudde|2019}}
