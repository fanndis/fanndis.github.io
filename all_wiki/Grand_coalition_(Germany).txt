In current German politics, '''grand coalition''' ({{lang-de|Große Koalition}}) describes a governing coalition of the parties [[CDU/CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]],<ref>https://www.bundestagswahl-2021.de/koalitionen/</ref><ref>https://taz.de/Buergerschaftswahl-in-Hamburg/!5514873/</ref> since they have historically been the [[major party|major parties]] in most state and federal elections since 1949. The meaning of the term may  change due to the growth of some formerly [[minor party|minor parties]] in recent years.<ref>https://www.zeit.de/hamburg/2020-03/koalition-sondierung-spd-gruene-cdu-hamburg</ref>

==Weimar Republic (1919–1933)==
In the [[Weimar Republic]] of 1919 to 1933, the term "[[The Great Coalition (Weimar Republic)|grand coalition]]" was used for a coalition that included the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party, SPD]], the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] and the liberal parties [[German Democratic Party|Democratic Party, DDP]] and [[German People's Party|People's Party, DVP]]. Such a coalition was in power in 1923 and from 1928 until 1930, although the latter was a conglomerate of parties with somewhat conflicting interests that banded together as a safeguard for democracy against the radical political parties, the KPD and the NSDAP.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}
In March 1930, the Great Coalition broke apart, with the resignation of the SPD over the contentious issue of increasing employees' national insurance contributions at a time when wages were falling.<ref>'The Third Reich' by D.G. Williamson</ref>

==Federal Republic (1949–)==

=== Federal level ===
In the post-war [[politics of Germany]], four grand coalitions (''Große Koalitionen'') have been formed at the federal level through the [[Bundestag]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-12/grosse-koalition-unterzeichnung-koalitionsvertrag|title=Bundesregierung: Die Große Koalition ist besiegelt|date=2013-12-16|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|language=de|trans-title=The grand coalition (deal) is sealed|issn=0044-2070|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref>

==== Kiesinger cabinet (1966–1969) ====
On 1 December 1966, the government was formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], the two major political parties in the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. It was the result of arguments about tax increases between the CDU/CSU–FDP coalition of the time. The FDP ministers stood down and a new government was formed with the SPD under [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] of the CDU. The grand coalition was in control of 90% of the Bundestag (468 of 518 seats), leaving some politically active students disillusioned; this disillusionment led to the formation of the [[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]] which formed a core of the [[German student movement]]. The Kiesinger grand coalition lasted until 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/hintergrund-die-gro%25C3%259Fe-koalition-1966-1969/a-1741075|title=Hintergrund: Die große Koalition 1966-1969|date=2005-10-15|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=de|trans-title=Background: The grand coalition 1966-1969|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article167329/Wie-die-erste-grosse-Koalition-entstand.html|title=Wie die erste große Koalition entstand|last=Sturm|first=Daniel Friedrich|date=2005-09-27|newspaper=[[Welt Online]]|language=de|trans-title=How the first grand coalition came about|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref>

==== 1st, 3rd and 4th Merkel cabinets (2005–2009, 2013–2018, 2018–) ====
After the inconclusive result of the [[2005 German federal election]], neither of the traditional coalitions could form a majority government. Another possible coalition existed, comprising the SPD, Greens, and the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS), but a desire to exclude the PDS, the successor party to East Germany's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]], from government (i.e. a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (politics)|cordon sanitaire]]'') led the leaders of the SPD and the CDU/CSU to agree to form a grand coalition with CDU leader [[Angela Merkel]] as chancellor and an equal number of cabinet seats for each party. The chancellor was elected on 22 November, and the [[Cabinet Merkel I|1st Merkel Cabinet]] took office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kanzler-wahl-merkel-auf-der-zielgeraden-a-386235.html|title=Kanzler-Wahl: Merkel auf der Zielgeraden|website=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|trans-title=Chancellor Election: Merkel on the home stretch.|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref> The second grand coalition in German history ended when, after the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], a coalition was agreed between the CDU/CSU and the FDP, thus forming the [[Cabinet Merkel II|2nd Merkel Cabinet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/reformprogramm-merkel-verspricht-weitreichende-entlastung-a-657123.html|title=Reformprogramm: Merkel verspricht weitreichende Entlastung|date=2009-10-24|website=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|trans-title=Reform Programme: Merkel promises far-reaching relief|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref>

Following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 election]], on 27 November 2013 a third grand coalition was formed by the CDU/CSU and the SPD.<ref name=":0" /> Again it would have been possible to form a center-left government with the SPD, Greens, and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], the successor party to the PDS, but a grand coalition was formed instead. The term ''GroKo'' (shortening for ''Große Koalition'') was named 2013 [[Word of the year (Germany)|word of the year]] in Germany.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article122885876/GroKo-ist-das-Wort-des-Jahres-2013.html|title="GroKo" ist das Wort des Jahres 2013|date=2013-12-13|newspaper=[[Welt Online]]|language=de|trans-title="GroKo" is the word of the year 2013|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref>

=== State level ===
Historically grand coalitions have been quite frequent at state level. Currently, there are only two states out of sixteen which have never been governed by a grand coalition:

*[[Hamburg]]
*[[North Rhine-Westphalia]]

As of October 2020, three states are currently governed by grand coalitions:

*[[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], the [[Manuela Schwesig|Schwesig cabinet]] supported by SPD and CDU (in office since July 2017).
*[[Niedersachsen]], the [[Cabinet Weil II|Weil cabinet]] supported by SPD and CDU (in office since November 2017).
*[[Saarland]], the [[Tobias Hans|Hans cabinet]] supported by CDU and SPD (in office since March 2018).
