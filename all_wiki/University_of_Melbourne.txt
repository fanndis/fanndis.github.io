The '''University of Melbourne''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in Melbourne, Australia. Founded in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria.<ref name="futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au">{{cite web|url=http://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/explore/about |title=About the University : Future Students |publisher=Futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> Its [[Parkville Campus (University of Melbourne)|main campus]] is located in [[Parkville, Victoria|Parkville]], an inner suburb north of [[Melbourne central business district|Melbourne's central business district]], with several other campuses located across Victoria.

Incorporated by the [[State of Victoria|Victoria Colony]], the University of Melbourne is one of Australia's six [[sandstone university|sandstone universities]] and a member of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]], [[Universitas 21]], [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University's]] McDonnell International Scholars Academy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://global.wustl.edu/mcdonnell-academy/|title=McDonnell International Scholars Academy|website=Global|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref> and the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]]. Since 1872 various [[residential colleges]] have become affiliated with the university, offering accommodation for students and faculty, and academic, sporting and cultural programs. There are ten colleges located on the main campus and in nearby suburbs.

The university comprises ten separate academic units and is associated with numerous institutes and research centres, including the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research]], [[Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health]], the [[Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research]] and the [[Grattan Institute]]. Amongst the university's fifteen [[graduate schools]], the [[Melbourne Business School]], the [[Melbourne Law School]] and the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences|Melbourne Medical School]] are particularly well regarded.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne University regarded top in the country, but reputation isn't everything|url=http://theconversation.com/melbourne-university-regarded-top-in-country-but-reputation-isnt-everything-5874|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Universities|url=http://www.australianuniversities.com.au/info/4/melbourne/|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne tops discipline based ranking|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/melbourne-tops-discipline-based-ranking/story-e6frgcjx-1226637055540|accessdate=19 May 2013 | work=The Australian|date=8 May 2013}}</ref>

The university's coat of arms is a blue shield on which a depiction of "[[Nike (mythology)|Victory]]" in white colour holds her laurel wreath over the stars of the Southern Cross. The motto, ''Postera crescam laude'' ("Later I shall grow by praise" or, more freely, "We shall grow in the esteem of future generations"), is written on a scroll beneath the shield. The Latin is from a line in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'': ''ego postera crescam laude recens''.

==History==
[[File:Melbourne University grand building.jpg|thumb|right|Old Quad, the original building of the University of Melbourne]]

=== Foundations of the university ===

[[File:The University of Melbourne, 1857.jpg|thumb|The original University of Melbourne building, 1857, Victoria Illustrated collection, State Library Victoria.]]

The University of Melbourne was established following a proposal by [[Hugh Childers]], the Auditor-General and Finance Minister, in his first Budget Speech on 4{{nbsp}}November 1852, who set aside a sum of [[£]]10,000 for the establishment of a university.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36869578 |title=Bools of the Week. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=27 February 1937 |accessdate=8 February 2012 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The university was established by Act of Incorporation on 22 January 1853, with power to confer degrees in arts, medicine, laws and music. The act provided for an annual endowment of £9,000, while a special grant of £20,000 was made for buildings that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10961588 |title=Melbourne University. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 September 1934 |accessdate=8 February 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The foundation stone was laid on 3{{nbsp}}July 1854, and on the same day the foundation stone for the [[State Library Victoria|State Library]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10961588 |title=Melbourne University. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 September 1934 |accessdate=9 February 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Classes commenced in 1855 with three professors and sixteen students; of this body of students only four graduated. The original buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir [[Charles Hotham]], on 3{{nbsp}}October 1855.

A law school was established in 1857 at the Parkville campus, following which a Faculty of Engineering and School of Medicine were established in 1861 and 1862 respectively. The university's residential colleges were first opened on the northern aspect of the campus in 1872, divided between the four main Christian denominations.<ref name="The University of Melbourne">{{cite web |title=The University of Melbourne Timeline |url=http://our-history.unimelb.edu.au/timeline/ |website=Our History |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 May 2019 |ref=20}}</ref>

The first chancellor, [[Redmond Barry]] (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880. The inauguration of the university was made possible by the wealth resulting from [[Victorian gold rush|Victoria's gold rush]]. The institution was designed to be a "civilising influence" at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth.<ref>Selleck, 2003</ref> In 1881, the admission of women was a seen as victory over the more conservative ruling council.<ref>Selleck 2003, p 164–165</ref> [[Bella Guerin|Julia 'Bella' Guerin]] graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1883, and became the first woman to graduate from an Australian University.<ref name="The University of Melbourne"/>

[[File:The University of Melbourne.JPG|thumb|The view of the Melbourne Law School, Business and Economics, The Spot and Alan Gilbert Building.]]

=== 1900s – 1970s ===

Early in the 1900s the university expanded its offerings to more utilitarian courses. In 1901 the number of students enrolled at the University of Melbourne exceeded 500 students for the first time. The university established the Diploma of Education in 1903, following negotiations with the Victorian Education Department. Despite the economic depression of the 1890s and the discovery of a significant fraud by a university registrar in 1901, the university continued to expand during this period. This growth included the construction of several buildings between 1900 and 1906. Such growth was facilitated largely through an increased government funding allocation, and the coinciding university led funding campaign. To accompany the training dentists received by the Melbourne Dental Hospital, a School of Dentistry was established to teach the scientific basis of dentistry at the university. Agriculture was established in 1911 following the appointment of the State Director of Agriculture as the first professor. During this period the university became a notable site for research, emerging as a leader in Australia. Following World War II the demand for higher education increased rapidly, and as a result became a transformative period for the university.<ref name="brandhub.unimelb.edu.au">{{cite web |title=The University of Melbourne Brand Story |url=https://brandhub.unimelb.edu.au/our-brand/brand-story |website=Brand Hub |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 May 2019 |ref=23}}</ref>

In 1940, the first issue of ''Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand'', now ''[[Australian Historical Studies]]'', was published by the Department of History.<ref>{{cite web | title=Academic journals | website=University of Melbourne.

=== 1980s – present ===

[[File:Unimelb main entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance (Gate 10) to Parkville Campus of The University of Melbourne from Grattan Street]]

Expansion of the university increased significantly during the 1980s and 1990s, as the university amalgamated with a number of tertiary colleges. In 1988 the Melbourne Teachers' College was brought into the Faculty of Education, and the amalgamation lead to the formation of a distinctly new Faculty of Education. The College of Advanced Education was incorporated into the university in 1989. During this period, more students than ever had before attended the university. The university had expanded its student population to beyond 35,000 students. Such amalgamations continued into the 1990s, with the Victorian College of the Arts affiliation with the University of Melbourne in 1992. This grew the number of campuses for the University of Melbourne, which would now include a new St Kilda Road location.

In 2001, the Melbourne School of Population Health was established, the first of its kind in Australia, and continued the growth of the university. Work at the centre involved contributions from many disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to epidemiology. Health fields such as Indigenous, women's, mental, sexual, and rural health have all been researched at the centre. A significant change in curriculum was established in 2008. The newly created model for education was developed, known at the university as The Melbourne Model. In this curriculum model, students firstly undertake a general bachelor's degree before specialising in either a professional or research graduate course.<ref name="brandhub.unimelb.edu.au"/>

The university's 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unimelb.edu.au/150/|title=The University of Melbourne 150th Anniversary|date=2011-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210090414/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/150/|archive-date=2011-02-10|url-status=|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref>

The [[Melbourne School of Land and Environment]] was disestablished on 1{{nbsp}}January 2015. Its agriculture and food systems department moved alongside veterinary science to form the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences|Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences]], while other areas of study, including horticulture, forestry, geography and resource management, moved to the Faculty of Science in two new departments.

Today over 8900 academic and professional staff support the more than 52,000 strong student population. The student population consists of more than 13,000 international students, from more than 130 countries.<ref name="brandhub.unimelb.edu.au"/>

In 2020, on-campus teaching was limited to selected clinical placements as a result of social distancing restrictions imposed by [[Victoria_State_Government|the Victorian State Government]] in response to the [[COVID-19_pandemic_in_Australia|COVID-19 pandemic]]. The majority of teaching was moved to online delivery during the first semester.<ref>https://www.unimelb.edu.au/coronavirus/update</ref> Like many other institutions and workplaces, university faculty members elected to use [[Zoom Video Communications]] to conduct live tutorials online.

==Organisation and administration==

=== Governance ===

Governance of the university is grounded in an act of parliament, the University of Melbourne Act 2009.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|uoma2009288|University of Melbourne Act 2009}}</ref> The peak governing body is the "Council" the key responsibilities of which include appointing the vice-chancellor and principal, approving the strategic direction and annual budget, establishing operational policies and procedures and overseeing academic and commercial activities as well as risk management. The chair of the council is the "chancellor". The "academic board" oversees learning, teaching and research activities and provides advice to the council on these matters. The "committee of convocation" represents graduates and its members are elected in proportion to the number of graduates in each faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/search.php?arch_style=1|title=Neo-Gothic Buildings (Searching) – Buildings [Walking Melbourne&#93;|publisher=Walkingmelbourne.com|accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref>

The University of Melbourne's operations are governed through a hierarchy of delegations framework. A 13-member council is the university's governing body. It establishes the university's council, determines its core functions, and allows the university to enact subordinate legislation through statutes and regulations. Under legislative elements associated with the council, university policies exist as a formal statement of principle to regulate university operations. Under university policies, university processes exist to support workplace agreements, policy, and relevant legislation by noting day-to-day operation tasks and activities to be performed by staff.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulatory Framework |url=https://about.unimelb.edu.au/strategy/governance/regulatory-framework |website=About The University of Melbourne |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>

The academic board is held responsible to the council for quality assurance in activities such as the maintenance of high standards in teaching, research and learning. The University of Melbourne Executive is the university's principal management committee. The university consists of academic and administrative structures. University leadership encompasses the chancellor, vice-chancellor and senior executives, who are responsible for the strategic vision of the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peak Bodies and Structures |url=https://about.unimelb.edu.au/strategy/governance/peak-bodies-structures |website=About The University of Melbourne |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>

=== Endowment ===

The University of Melbourne has an endowment of approximately $1.335 billion,<ref name="endowment">{{cite web|url=http://publications.unimelb.edu.au/docs/UoM-AR-2015.pdf|title=University of Melbourne Investment Report 2013|accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> the largest of any Australian tertiary institution. However, Australian endowments are relatively small compared with those of the [[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|wealthiest US universities]].

The university's endowments recovered after hardship following the 2008 [[Great Recession]], which shrank its investments by 22%. This required restructuring of the university, including cutting of some staff, largely through redundancies and early retirements.<ref name="endowment2">[http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/battered-melbourne-uni-slashes-220-jobs-20090728-e075.html Battered Melbourne Uni slashes 220 jobs], ''The Age'', 29 July 2009</ref> A further round of cuts, driven by lingering concerns about finances and declining Federal contributions to the tertiary sector, took place under the 'Business Improvement Program'(BIP) from 2014–16 and involved another 500 jobs.<ref>https://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/farrago/inside-the-business-improvement-program/</ref>

Under former vice-chancellor [[Glyn Davis]], the university publicly launched Believe – the Campaign for the University of Melbourne in 2013. The campaign's goal was to raise $500 million by the end of 2017. With more than 20,000 international donors, the university reached its target two years ahead of schedule. In March 2016, Davis launched the second phase of the campaign. Phase two aims to raise a total of $1 billion by 2021, and to engage 100,000 alumni in the process.<ref>{{cite web |title=Believe Campaign |url=https://www.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/about/campaign |website=The University of Melbourne |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>

=== Teaching and learning ===<!-- this is the commonly used term, which is far more widely understood than "growing esteem"-->
{{Main|Melbourne Model}}

The University of Melbourne is unlike any other university in Australia so far as it offers nine generalised three-year degrees instead of more traditional specialised undergraduate degrees:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coursesearch.unimelb.edu.au/|title=Study in Melbourne, Australia – Courses at The University of Melbourne, Australia|work=unimelb.edu.au|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>

*Bachelor of Arts
*Bachelor of Agriculture
*Bachelor of Biomedicine
*Bachelor of Commerce
*Bachelor of Design
*Bachelor of Fine Arts
*Bachelor of Music
*Bachelor of Oral Health
*Bachelor of Science

The Bachelor of Design was a new addition that begun in 2017; this corresponded with the closure of the Bachelor of Environments (2008-2016), which was controversially axed in 2016 against the wishes of several participating Departments wishing to retain an environmental focus.<ref>http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/undergraduate/course-planning/sample-course-plans-bachelor-of-environments</ref> The change from the former curriculum, which offered many single and joint degrees, is often described as the "[[Melbourne Curriculum|Melbourne Model]]", and was implemented under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor [[Glyn Davis]] in 2008. <!-- the reference supplied does not support these claims: a combination of various practices from American and European universities, aimed at consistency with the European Union's "[[Bologna process]]" and international relevance and standing for its degrees.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23430526-27958,00.html "The long road to Bologna"], ''The Australian'', 26 March 2008</ref> --> The university also offers postgraduate courses (including professional-entry master's degrees) that follow undergraduate courses with greater specialization.<ref>http://environment.unimelb.edu.au/</ref> in the early 2000s, which offers an innovative cross-Faculty environmental master's degree<ref>Batterbury, S., & Toscano, M.

''Revista Internacional de Educación para la Justicia Social'', 7(1), 141-156.</ref>

As of 2007, Melbourne University aimed to offer 75% of graduate places as HECS (with the remaining 25% paying full fees).<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/a-matter-of-degrees/2007/04/13/1175971346781.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 A matter of degrees], ''The Age'', 14 April 2007</ref>
