The '''1980 United States presidential election''' was the 49th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 1980. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in a landslide victory. This was the second consecutive election in which the incumbent president was defeated after Carter himself defeated [[Gerald Ford]] four years earlier in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. Additionally, it was only the second time, and the first in nearly 100 years that a Republican candidate defeated an incumbent Democrat. Carter was the last elected incumbent president to lose reelection to a challenger who won greater than 50.00 percent of the national popular vote until [[Donald Trump]] lost to [[Joe Biden]] [[2020 United States presidential election|40 years later]]. Due to the rise of [[conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] following Reagan's victory, some historians consider the election to be a [[political realignment]] that marked the start of the [[Reagan Era]].

Carter's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a younger brother of former President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|Democratic primaries]], but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. The [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|Republican primaries]] were contested between Reagan, who had previously served as the Governor of California, former Congressman [[George H. W. Bush]] of Texas, Congressman [[John B. Anderson]] of Illinois, and several other candidates. All of Reagan's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush. Anderson entered the race as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] candidate, and convinced former Wisconsin Governor [[Patrick Lucey]], a Democrat, to serve as his running mate.

Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending, implementation of [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, and a balanced budget. His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter, the [[Iran hostage crisis]], and a worsening economy at home marked by [[stagflation|high unemployment and inflation]]. Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist and warned that Reagan would cut [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].

Reagan won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]], taking a large majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] and 50.7% of the popular vote. Reagan received the highest number of electoral votes ever won by a non-incumbent presidential candidate. In the simultaneous Congressional elections, Republicans [[United States Senate elections, 1980|won control of the]] [[United States Senate]] for the first time since 1955. Carter won 41% of the vote but carried just six states and [[Washington, D.C.]] Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote, and he performed best among liberal Republican voters dissatisfied with Reagan. Reagan, then 69, was the oldest person to ever be elected to a first term. [[Donald Trump]] and [[Joe Biden]] have both since broken that record in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] and in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], respectively. Trump was elected at the age of 70 and Biden at the age of 77.

==Background==

Throughout the 1970s, the United States underwent a wrenching period of [[stagflation|low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates]], and intermittent energy crises.<ref name="'70s 292">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/292 292]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/292}}</ref> By October 1978, Iran—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a [[Iranian revolution|major uprising]] that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil.<ref name=uppafb>{{cite magazine| title=Oil Squeeze | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html | magazine= Time magazine | date= 1979-02-05| accessdate=December 18, 2013 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html| archive-date= 7 March 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] fled the country, Iranian opposition figure [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] ended his 14-year exile in France and returned to Iran to establish an Islamic Republic, largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country.<ref name=uppafb/> In the spring and summer of 1979, inflation was on the rise and various parts of the United States were experiencing energy shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/inflation-proofing-6-07/overview/0607_inflation_proofing_ov.htm |title=Inflation-proofing |publisher=ConsumerReports.org |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>

Carter was widely blamed for the return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that was last seen just after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. He planned on delivering his fifth major speech on energy, but he felt that the American people were no longer listening. Carter left for the presidential retreat of [[Camp David]]. "For more than a week, a veil of secrecy enveloped the proceedings. Dozens of prominent Democratic Party leaders—members of Congress, governors, labor leaders, academics and clergy—were summoned to the mountaintop retreat to confer with the beleaguered president." His pollster, [[Pat Caddell]], told him that the American people simply faced a crisis of confidence because of the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]]; the [[Vietnam War]]; and [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/carter-crisis-speech/ | publisher = PBS | work = American Experience | title = Jimmy Carter}}</ref> On July 15, 1979, Carter gave a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a "crisis of confidence" among the American people. This came to be known as his "[[Malaise speech]]", although Carter never used the word in the speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3402 |title="Crisis of Confidence" Speech (July 15, 1979) |publisher=Miller Center, University of Virginia |format=text and video |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721024329/http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3402 |archive-date=July 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all |date=October 20, 2016 }}</ref>

Many expected Senator Ted Kennedy to successfully challenge Carter in the upcoming Democratic primary. Kennedy's official announcement was scheduled for early November. A television [[Roger Mudd#Ted Kennedy interview|interview with Roger Mudd]] of CBS a few days before the announcement went badly, however. Kennedy gave an "incoherent and repetitive"<ref name="bg-series-4">{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/18/chapter_4_sailing_into_the_wind/ | title=Chapter 4: Sailing Into the Wind: Losing a quest for the top, finding a new freedom | author=Allis, Sam | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref> answer to the question of why he was running, and the polls, which showed him leading the President by 58–25 in August now had him ahead 49–39.<ref>Time Magazine, 11/12/79</ref>

Meanwhile, Carter was given an opportunity for political redemption when the Khomeini regime again gained public attention and allowed the taking of [[Iran hostage crisis|52 American hostages]] by a group of [[Islamism|Islamist]] students and militants at the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] on November 4, 1979. Carter's calm approach towards the handling of this crisis resulted in his approval ratings jump in the 60-percent range in some polls, due to a "rally round the flag" effect.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=174181|title=Foreign Policy and Presidential Popularity: Creating Windows of Opportunity in the Perpetual Election|first1=Robin F.|last1=Marra|first2=Charles W.|last2=Ostrom|first3=Dennis M.|last3=Simon|date=1 January 1990|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=34|issue=4|pages=588–623|doi=10.1177/0022002790034004002|s2cid=154620443}}</ref>

By the beginning of the election campaign, the prolonged [[Iran hostage crisis]] had sharpened public perceptions of a national crisis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021016003953/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/19/iran/main265499.shtml ]</ref> On April 25, 1980, Carter's ability to use the hostage crisis to regain public acceptance eroded when his high risk [[Operation Eagle Claw|attempt to rescue the hostages]] ended in disaster when eight servicemen were killed. The unsuccessful rescue attempt drew further skepticism towards his leadership skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472108670-03.pdf |title=Chapter 3 : The Iranian Hostage Rescue Mission |website=Press.umich.edu |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>

Following the failed rescue attempt, Carter took overwhelming blame for the Iran hostage crisis, in which the followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini burned [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] and chanted anti-American slogans, paraded the captured American hostages in public, and burned Carter in [[effigy]]. Carter's critics saw him as an inept leader who had failed to solve the worsening economic problems at home. His supporters defended the president as a decent, well-intentioned man being unfairly criticized for problems that had been escalating for years.<ref name="christian science">{{cite news |title=A historic victory. A changed nation. Now, can Obama deliver? |author=Jerry Lanson |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=November 6, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1106/p09s02-coop.html

Meanwhile, in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] challenger [[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in a decisive victory defeating incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]]. The UK Election was held against the backdrop of stagflation, high oil prices, high inflation, a large welfare state, turmoil in public sector unions and the [[Winter of Discontent]] summed up by the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper headline, "Crisis? What crisis?". The scenario which played out in Britain would essentially be repeated and would foreshadow Carter's loss.

Another event that polarized the electorate was the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Shortly following the [[Soviet Union]]'s December 1979 [[Soviet Afghan war|invasion of Afghanistan]], Carter demanded that the USSR withdraw from Afghanistan or the U.S. would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics, set to be staged in Moscow. The USSR did not withdraw (for ten years). Carter's stance was controversial—he was both praised for his moral stand and criticized for politicizing the Olympics. With many allied countries joining the U.S. in the boycott, the contrasting spirits of competitive goodwill and campaign animosity, a feature of most presidential campaign years, was absent and the press had additional time to devote to national and international strife.

In a [[tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] response four years later, the Soviet Bloc countries [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.

Former governor [[Ronald Reagan]] of [[California]] was the odds-on favorite to win his party's nomination for president after [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976#Republican National Convention|nearly beating]] incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] just four years earlier. Reagan dominated the primaries early, driving from the field Senate Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]] from Tennessee, former governor [[John Connally]] of Texas, Senator [[Robert Dole]] from Kansas, Representative [[Phil Crane]] from Illinois, and Representative [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] from Illinois, who dropped out of the race to run as an Independent. George Bush from Texas posed the strongest challenge to Reagan with his victories in the Pennsylvania and Michigan primaries, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Reagan won the nomination on the first round at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], in July, then chose [[George H. W. Bush]], his top rival, as his running mate.

The three major Democratic candidates in early 1980 were incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]], Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts, and Governor [[Jerry Brown]] of California. Brown withdrew on April 2. Carter and Kennedy faced off in 34 primaries. Not counting the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]] in which [[Lyndon Johnson]] withdrew his candidacy, this was the most tumultuous [[Primary election#Primaries in the United States|primary race]] that an elected incumbent president had encountered since [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]], during the highly contentious [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]].

During the summer of 1980, there was a short-lived "Draft Muskie" movement; Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]] was seen as a favorable alternative to a deadlocked convention. One poll showed that Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as to the fact that he was not Carter. Muskie was polling even with Ronald Reagan at the time, while Carter was seven points behind.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robbins, James S. |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/13/opinion/main4091259.shtml |title=Clinton Campaign Reminiscent of 1980 Race |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref> Although the underground "Draft Muskie" campaign failed, it became a political legend.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161048/http://www.startribune.com/business/15887132.html ]</ref>

After defeating Kennedy in 24 of 34 primaries, Carter entered the party's [[1980 Democratic National Convention|convention]] in New York in August with 60 percent of the delegates pledged to him on the first ballot. Still, Kennedy refused to drop out. At the convention, after a futile last-ditch attempt by Kennedy to alter the rules to free delegates from their first-ballot pledges, Carter was renominated with 2,129 votes to 1,146 for Kennedy. Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] was also renominated. In his acceptance speech, Carter warned that Reagan's conservatism posed a threat to world peace and progressive social welfare programs from the [[New Deal]] to the [[Great Society]].<ref>William DeGregorio, ''The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents'', Gramercy 1997</ref>

=== Other candidates ===
[[John B. Anderson]] was defeated in the Republican primaries, but entered the general election as an independent candidate. He campaigned as a liberal Republican alternative to Reagan's conservatism. Anderson's campaign appealed primarily to frustrated anti-Carter voters from Republican and Democratic backgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/history/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/04/04/third_party_myth_easterbrook|title=The myths that just won't die - History - Salon.com|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|date=2011-04-06|website=Salon.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406213710/http://www.salon.com/books/history/index.html?story=%2Fpolitics%2Fwar_room%2F2011%2F04%2F04%2Fthird_party_myth_easterbrook|archive-date=April 6, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-02-07|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Despite maintaining the support of millions of liberal, pro-ERA, anti-Reagan and anti-Carter voters all the way up to election day to finish third with 5.7 million votes, Anderson's poll ratings had ebbed away through the campaign season as many of his initial supporters were pulled away by Carter and Reagan. Anderson's running mate was [[Patrick Lucey]], a Democratic former governor of [[Wisconsin]] and then ambassador to Mexico, appointed by President Carter.

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominated [[Ed Clark]] for president and [[David Koch]] for vice president. They received almost one million votes and were on the ballot in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. Koch, a co-owner of [[Koch Industries]], pledged part of his personal fortune to the campaign. The Libertarian Party platform was the only political party in 1980 to contain a plank advocating for the equal rights of homosexual men and women as well as the only party platform to advocate explicitly for "amnesty" for all illegal non-citizens.<ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/platforms.php http://www.lpedia.org/1980_Libertarian_Party_Platform#3._Victimless_Crimes</ref> The platform was also unique in favoring the repeal of both the National Labor Relations Act and all state Right to Work laws.<ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"/> Clark emphasized his support for an end to the war on drugs.<ref>Ed Clark emphasized his opposition to the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT3LisckcdU</ref> He advertised his opposition to the draft and wars of choice.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSZCthogmM</ref>

The Clark–Koch ticket received 921,128 votes (1.1% of the total nationwide), finishing in fourth place nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980&off=0&f=1|title=1980 Presidential General Election Results|author=David Leip|year=2005|website=Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref> This was the highest overall number of votes earned by a Libertarian candidate until the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], when [[Gary Johnson]] and [[James P.

The 1980 total remained the highest percentage of popular votes a Libertarian Party candidate received in a presidential race until Johnson and [[William Weld]] received 3.3% of the popular vote in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. Clark's strongest support was in [[Alaska]], where he came in third place with 11.7% of the vote, finishing ahead of Independent candidate John B. Anderson and receiving almost half as many votes as Jimmy Carter.

The [[Socialist Party USA]] nominated [[David McReynolds]] for president and Sister [[Diane Drufenbrock]] for vice president, making McReynolds the first openly gay man to run for president and Drufenbrock the first nun to be a candidate for national office in the U.S.

The [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]] ran [[biologist]] [[Barry Commoner]] for president and [[Comanche]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] activist [[LaDonna Harris]] for vice president. The Commoner–Harris ticket was on the ballot in twenty-nine states and in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Elections A-Z|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uVVcAgAAQBAJ&q=commoner+harris+ticket&pg=PA73|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-12-16|isbn = 9781135938703|first = John|last = Moore}}</ref>

The [[Communist Party USA]] ran [[Gus Hall]] for president and [[Angela Davis]] for vice president.

The [[American Party (1969)|American Party]] nominated [[Percy L. Greaves Jr.]] for president and Frank L. Varnum for vice president.

Rock star [[Joe Walsh]] ran a mock campaign as a [[write-in candidate]], promising to make his song "[[Life's Been Good]]" the new national anthem if he won, and running on a platform of "Free Gas For Everyone." Though the 33-year-old Walsh was not old enough to actually assume the office, he wanted to raise public awareness of the election.

==General election==



===Campaign===
Under federal election laws, Carter and Reagan received $29.4 million each, and Anderson was given a limit of $18.5 million with private fund-raising allowed for him only. They were not allowed to spend any other money. Carter and Reagan each spent about $15 million on television advertising, and Anderson under $2 million. Reagan ended up spending $29.2 million in total, Carter $29.4 million, and Anderson spent $17.6 million—partially because he (Anderson) didn't get [[Federal Election Commission]] money until after the election.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 1980 election is considered by some to be a [[political realignment]], reaching a climate of confrontation practically not seen since 1932. Reagan's supporters praise him for running a campaign of upbeat optimism.<ref name="strategy campaigning">{{cite book | title = The Strategy of Campaigning | author1 = Skinner|author2=Kudelia|author3=Mesquita|author4=Rice | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F0dCiDh4fMsC | accessdate = October 20, 2008 | isbn = 978-0-472-11627-0}}</ref> [[David Frum]] says Carter ran an attack-based campaign based on "despair and pessimism" which "cost him the election."<ref name="'70s 161">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/161 161]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/161}}</ref> Carter emphasized his record as a peacemaker, and said Reagan's election would threaten [[civil rights]] and social programs that stretched back to the [[New Deal]].

The election of 1980 was a key turning point in American politics. It signaled the new electoral power of the suburbs and the [[Sun Belt]]. Reagan's success as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] would initiate a realigning of the parties, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Republicans and [[Reagan Democrat|conservative Democrats]] would either leave politics or change party affiliations through the 1980s and 1990s to leave the parties much more ideologically polarized.<ref name="christian science"/> While during [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 campaign]], many voters saw his warnings about a too-powerful government as hyperbolic and only 30% of the electorate agreed that government was too powerful, by 1980 a majority of Americans believed that government held too much power.<ref name="'70s 283">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/283 283]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/283}}</ref>

====Promises====
Reagan promised a restoration of the nation's military strength, at the same time 60% of Americans polled felt defense spending was too low.<ref name="'70s 344">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/344 344]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/344}}</ref> Reagan also promised an end to "trust me government" and to restore economic health by implementing a [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policy. Reagan promised a [[balanced budget]] within three years (which he said would be "the beginning of the end of inflation"), accompanied by a 30% reduction in tax rates over those same years. With respect to the economy, Reagan famously said, "A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his."<ref name="strategy campaigning"/> Reagan also criticized the "[[windfall profit tax]]" that Carter and Congress enacted that year in regards to domestic oil production and promised to attempt to repeal it as president.<ref name="tax history">{{cite web| last = Thorndike| first = Joseph J.| title = Historical Perspective: The Windfall Profit Tax -- Career of a Concept| work = TaxHistory.org| date = November 10, 2005| url = http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/cf7c9c870b600b9585256df80075b9dd/edf8de04e58e4b14852570ba0048848b| accessdate = November 6, 2008}}</ref> The tax was not a tax on profits, but on the difference between the [[price controls|price control]]-mandated price and the market price.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33305_20060309.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 12, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211074013/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33305_20060309.pdf |archive-date=February 11, 2012 }}, CRS Report RL33305, The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of the 1980s: Implications for Current Energy Policy, by Salvatore Lazzari, p. 5.</ref>

On the issue of women's rights there was much division, with many feminists frustrated with Carter, the only major-party candidate who supported the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. After a bitter Convention fight between Republican feminists and antifeminists the Republican Party dropped their forty-year endorsement of the ERA.<ref>{{cite web |last=Melich |first=Tanya |url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/2379/context/archive |title=O'Connor's Tenure Began One Hot Summer |publisher=Women's eNews |date=July 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817044630/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/2379/context/archive |archive-date=August 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Reagan, however, announced his dedication to women's rights and his intention to, if elected, appoint women to his cabinet and the first female justice to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref name="presidential leadership">{{cite book | title = Presidential Leadership |author1=James Taranto |author2=Leonard Leo | publisher = Wall Street Journal Books | year = 2004 | url = https://archive.org/details/presidentiallead00tara | url-access = registration | accessdate = October 20, 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7432-7226-1}}</ref> He also pledged to work with all 50 state governors to combat discrimination against women and to equalize federal laws as an alternative to the ERA.<ref name="strategy campaigning"/> Reagan was convinced to give an endorsement of women's rights in his nomination acceptance speech.

The media's main criticism of Reagan centered on his gaffes. When Carter kicked off his general election campaign in [[Tuscumbia, Alabama|Tuscumbia]], Reagan—referring to the Southern U.S. as a whole—claimed that Carter had begun his campaign in the birthplace of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In doing so, Reagan seemed to insinuate that the KKK represented the South, which caused many Southern governors to denounce Reagan's remarks.<ref>White House Diary, by Jimmy Carter, pp 461-462.</ref> Additionally, Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats for saying that trees caused pollution; he later said that he meant only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted.<ref name="cbs news">{{cite news |title=Here We Go Again! | first=Andrew |last=Bridges |work=CBS News |date=March 17, 2003 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/17/tech/main544188.shtml |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Carter was burdened by a continued weak economy and the [[Iran hostage crisis]].<ref name="'70s 344"/> [[Inflation]], high [[interest rates]], and [[unemployment]] continued through the course of the campaign, and the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran became, according to David Frum in ''How We Got Here: The '70s'', a symbol of American impotence during the Carter years.<ref name="'70s 344"/> John Anderson's independent candidacy, aimed at eliciting support from liberals, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan,<ref name="strategy campaigning"/> especially in reliably Democratic states such as [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].

}}<blockquote></blockquote>

The [[League of Women Voters]], which had sponsored the 1976 Ford/Carter debate series, announced that it would do so again for the next cycle in the spring of 1979. However, Carter was not eager to participate with any debate. He had repeatedly refused to a debate with Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] during the primary season, and had given ambivalent signals as to his participation in the fall.

The League of Women Voters had announced a schedule of debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had much of a problem with this until it was announced that Rep. [[John B. Anderson]] might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980, in the [[Baltimore Convention Center]]. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: "He [Carter] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by [[Jody Powell]]."<ref name="Reagan on Carter in Baltimore 478">{{cite book |title= Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America|last= Shirley|first= Craig|author-link= Craig Shirley|year= 2009|publisher= ISI Books|location= Wilmington, Delaware|isbn= 978-1-933859-55-2|page= 478}}</ref> The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the league to take it out. The debate was moderated by [[Bill Moyers]]. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch Reagan, managed only a narrow win, according to many in the media at that time, with Reagan putting up a much stronger performance than expected. Despite the narrow win in the debate, Anderson, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and at the time of the debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after, although Anderson got back up to winning 6.6% of the vote on election day. In the debate, Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan enough on their social issue differences and on Reagan's advocation of supply-side economics. Anderson instead started off by criticizing Carter: "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," to which Reagan added: "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement."<ref name="Reagan Anderson Debate 479">{{cite book |title= Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America|last= Shirley|first= Craig|author-link= Craig Shirley|year= 2009|publisher= ISI Books|location= Wilmington, Delaware |isbn=978-1-933859-55-2 |page=479}}</ref> In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/fred-barnes/ |title=Fred Barnes on Conversations with Bill Kristol |website=Conversationswithbillkristol.org |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>

As September turned into October, the situation remained essentially the same. Governor Reagan insisted Anderson be allowed to participate in a three-way debate, while President Carter remained steadfastly opposed to this. As the standoff continued, the second debate was canceled, as was the vice presidential debate.

With two weeks to go to the election, the Reagan campaign decided that the best thing to do at that moment was to accede to all of President Carter's demands, including that Anderson not feature, and LWV agreed to exclude Congressman Anderson from the final debate, which was rescheduled for October 28 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

[[File:Carter Reagan Debate 10-28-80.png|thumb|President Carter ''(left)'' and former Governor Reagan ''(right)'' at the presidential debate on October 28, 1980]]
The presidential debate between President Carter and Governor Reagan was moderated by [[Howard K. Smith]] and presented by the League of Women Voters. The showdown ranked among the highest ratings of any [[television]] program in the previous decade. Debate topics included the Iranian hostage crisis, and nuclear arms treaties and proliferation. Carter's campaign sought to portray Reagan as a reckless "war hawk," as well as a "dangerous right-wing radical". But it was President Carter's reference to his consultation with 12-year-old daughter [[Amy Carter|Amy]] concerning nuclear weapons policy that became the focus of post-debate analysis and fodder for late-night television [[joke]]s. President Carter said he had asked Amy what the most important issue in that election was and she said, "the control of [[nuclear arms]]." A famous political cartoon, published the day after Reagan's landslide victory, showed Amy Carter sitting in Jimmy's lap with her shoulders shrugged asking "the economy? the hostage crisis?"

When President Carter criticized Reagan's record, which included voting against [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, Governor Reagan audibly sighed and replied: "[[There you go again]]".<ref name="pbs debate">{{cite web | title = The Second 1980 Presidential Debate | publisher = PBS | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/80debates/cart1.html | accessdate = October 20, 2008}}</ref>

In describing the national debt that was approaching $1 trillion, Reagan stated "a billion is a thousand millions, and a trillion is a thousand billions." When Carter would criticize the content of Reagan's campaign speeches, Reagan began his counter with the words: "Well ... I don't know that I said that. I really don't."

In his closing remarks, Reagan asked viewers: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have."

After trailing Carter by 8 points among registered voters (and by 3 points among likely voters) right before their debate, Reagan moved into a 3-point lead among likely voters immediately afterward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111451/late-upsets-rare-happened.aspx|title=Late Upsets Are Rare, but Have Happened|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>

Former Democratic Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of Minnesota (who in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] had challenged [[Lyndon Johnson]] from the left, causing the then-President to all but abdicate) endorsed Reagan.<ref name="MacNeil-Lehrer">MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour (December 12, 2005).

Three days before the November 4 voting in the election, the [[National Rifle Association]] endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time in its history, backing Reagan. Reagan had received the California Rifle and Pistol Association's Outstanding Public Service Award. Carter had appointed [[Abner J. Mikva]], a fervent proponent of [[gun control]], to a federal judgeship and had supported the Alaska Lands Bill, closing {{convert|40000000|acre|km2}} to hunting.<ref>Facts on File 1980 Yearbook, p.844</ref>

[[File:1980 Presidential Election, Results by Congressional District.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Results by congressional district]]
The election was held on November 4, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=feST4K8J0scC&dat=19801104&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title= Voters the choice is yours |date=4 November 1980|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref> Ronald Reagan and running mate [[George H. W. Bush]] beat Carter by almost 10 percentage points in the popular vote. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] also gained control of the Senate on [[Reagan's coattails]] for the first time since 1952. The electoral college vote was a landslide, with 489 votes (representing 44 states) for Reagan and 49 for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.).<ref>{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&dat=19801105&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title= Reagan in a landslide|date=5 November 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref> NBC News projected Reagan as the winner at 8:15 pm EST (5:15 PST), before voting was finished in the West, based on [[exit polls]]; it was the first time a broadcast network used exit polling to project a winner, and took the other broadcast networks by surprise. Carter conceded defeat at 9:50 pm EST.<ref>Facts on File Yearbook 1980 p. 865</ref><ref>Facts on File Yearbook 1980 p. 838</ref> Carter's loss was the worst performance by an incumbent president since Herbert Hoover lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt by a margin of 18% in 1932, and his 49 electoral college votes were the fewest won by an incumbent since [[William Howard Taft]] won only 8 in 1912. Also, Carter was the first incumbent Democrat to serve only one full term since [[James Buchanan]] and lose re-election since [[Martin Van Buren]]; [[Grover Cleveland]] served two non-consecutive terms while [[Harry Truman]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] served one full term in addition to respectively taking over following the deaths of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[John F. Kennedy]].

Carter carried only [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (his home state), [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]] (Mondale's home state), [[Hawaii]], [[West Virginia]], [[Rhode Island]], and the [[District of Columbia]].

John Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote but failed to win any state outright. He found the most support in [[New England]], fueled by liberal and moderate Republicans who felt Reagan was too far to the right and with voters who normally leaned Democratic but were dissatisfied with the policies of the Carter Administration. His best showing was in [[Massachusetts]], where he won 15% of the popular vote. Conversely, Anderson performed worst in the [[Southern United States|South]], receiving under 2% of the popular vote in South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Anderson claims that he was accused of [[Spoiler effect|spoiling the election]] for Carter by receiving votes that might have otherwise been cast for Carter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0928/p09s02-coop.html|title=Let the most popular candidate win|last=Anderson|first=John B.|date=2007-09-28|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-09-01|issn=0882-7729}}</ref> However, 37 percent of Anderson voters polled preferred Reagan as their second choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/04/04/third_party_myth_easterbrook/|title=The myths that just won't die|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|date=2011-04-04|website=Salon|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate [[Ed Clark]] received 921,299 popular votes (1.06%). The Libertarians succeeded in getting Clark on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Clark's best showing was in Alaska, where he received 11.66% of the vote. The 921,299 votes achieved by the Clark–Koch ticket was the best performance by a Libertarian presidential candidate until 2012, when the Johnson–Gray ticket received 1,273,667 votes. In addition, the popular vote percentage was the highest of a Libertarian presidential candidate until 2016, when the Johnson-Weld ticket received 3.28%.

Reagan won 53% of the vote in reliably Democratic [[South Boston]].<ref name="'70s 283"/> His electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) was the most lopsided electoral college victory for a first-time President-elect.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Although Reagan was to win an even greater Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some currently very strong Democratic counties gave a Republican majority or plurality. Notable examples are [[Jefferson County, Washington|Jefferson County]] in Washington State, [[Lane County, Oregon]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]] and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz Counties]] in California, [[McKinley County, New Mexico]], and [[Rock Island County, Illinois]].<ref>Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century 'How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century']; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> Conversely, this was the last time that the Democrats won Georgia and Maryland until 1992. This election is the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. This is the first time Massachusetts voted for the Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of a pair of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent president defeated, the other one happening in [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]]. This is the only time in the 20th century a party was voted out after a single four-year term.

At 69 years old, [[Ronald Reagan]] was the oldest non-incumbent presidential candidate to win a presidential election. Thirty-six years later in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] this record was surpassed by [[Donald Trump]] at 70 years old. It was then surpassed again by [[Joe Biden]] who was elected at 77 years old in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/05/oldest-president-joe-biden/6181672002/ |website=www.UsaToday.com |publisher=USA Today}}</ref>

Following George Bush’s loss in 1992, as of 2020, Carter's failure to win re-election four years after he helped his party take back the White House marked the third time that a party held control of the White House for only one term in the last 30 years. Trump failed in his re-election bid as the Republican nominee in 2020.
