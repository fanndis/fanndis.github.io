The series was created by [[Matt Williams (TV producer)|Matt Williams]], [[Carmen Finestra]], and [[David McFadzean]]. In the 1990s, it was one of the most watched sitcoms in the United States, winning many awards. The series launched Tim Allen's acting career and was the start of the television career of [[Pamela Anderson]], who was part of the recurring cast for the first two seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-17/entertainment/ca-2925_1_tim-allen |title=Tim Allen's Power Tools : Television: The comic who had Disney and cable executives abuzz parlayed his luck to develop 'Home Improvement.' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 17, 1991 |access-date=September 8, 2012 |first=Daniel |last=Cerone}}</ref>

== Show background ==
Based on the stand-up comedy of [[Tim Allen]], ''Home Improvement'' made its debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on September 17, 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/home-improvement/episodes-season-1/100210 |title=Home Improvement Season 1 episodes |work=TVGuide.com |access-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref> and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms for almost the entire decade. It went to No.&nbsp;1 in the ratings during the 1993–1994 season, the same year Allen had the No.&nbsp;1 book (''Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man'') and film (''[[The Santa Clause]]'').<ref>{{cite episode |title=Tim Allen |series=''Inside the Actors Studio'' |series-link=Inside the Actors Studio |airdate=2006-05-28 |season=12 |number=15}}</ref>

Beginning in season 2, ''Home Improvement'' began each episode with a [[cold open]], which features the show's logo during the teaser. From season 4 until the end of the series in 1999, an anthropomorphic version of the logo was used in different types of animation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/05/27/1999-05-27_power_ratings_for__home_.html |title=POWER RATINGS FOR 'HOME' |last=Petrozzello |first=Donna |date=May 27, 1999 |work=NY Daily News |access-date=February 24, 2010 |location=New York }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Plot details and storylines ==

=== Taylor family ===
The series centers on the Taylor family, which consists of [[Tim Taylor (character)|Tim]] ([[Tim Allen]]), his wife Jill ([[Patricia Richardson]]) and their three children: the oldest child, Brad ([[Zachery Ty Bryan]]), the middle child, Randy ([[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]) and youngest child, Mark ([[Taran Noah Smith]]). The Taylors live in suburban [[Detroit]], and have a neighbor named Wilson ([[Earl Hindman]]) who is often the go-to guy for solving the Taylors' problems.

Tim is a stereotypical American male, who loves [[power tools]], [[car]]s, and [[sport]]s. An avid fan of [[Sports in Detroit|the Detroit professional sports teams]], Tim wears [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]], [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]], and [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] clothing in numerous instances, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and is very much a cocky, overambitious, accident-prone [[know-it-all]]. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left at the beginning of the eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.

Brad, popular and athletic, was often the moving factor, who engaged before thinking, a tendency which regularly landed him in trouble. Randy, a year younger, was the comedian of the pack, known for his quick-thinking, wisecracks, and smart mouth. He had more common sense than Brad but was not immune to trouble. Mark was somewhat of a [[Mother's boy|mama's boy]], though later in the series (in the seventh season) he grew into a teenage outcast who dressed in black clothing. Meanwhile, Brad became interested in cars like his father and took up soccer. Randy joined the school drama club, and later the school newspaper, in the eighth season, he left for [[Costa Rica]].

In early seasons, Wilson was always seen standing on the other side of Tim's backyard fence as the two engaged in conversation, usually with Wilson offering sage advice as Tim grappled with his problems. In later seasons, a [[running joke]] developed in which more and more creative means were used to prevent Wilson's face below the eyes from ever being seen by the audience. Also in later seasons, Wilson's full name was revealed to be Wilson W. Wilson, Jr.

=== ''Tool Time'' ===
Each episode includes Tim's own Binford-sponsored home improvement show, called ''Tool Time'', a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]]. In hosting this show, Tim is joined by his friend and mild-mannered co-host [[Al Borland]] ([[Richard Karn]]), and a "Tool Time girl"—first Lisa ([[Pamela Anderson]]) and later Heidi ([[Debbe Dunning]])—whose main duty is to introduce the pair at the beginning of the show with the line "Does everybody know what time it is?" In reply, the audience yells, "TOOL TIME!" The Tool Time girl also assists Tim and Al during the show by bringing them tools.

Although revealed to be an excellent salesman and TV personality, Tim is spectacularly accident prone as a handyman, often causing massive disasters on and off the set, to the consternation of his co-workers and family. Many ''Tool Time'' viewers assume that the accidents on the show are done on purpose, to demonstrate the consequences of using tools improperly. Many of Tim's accidents are caused by his devices being used in an unorthodox or overpowered manner, designed to illustrate his mantra "More power!". This popular catchphrase would not be uttered after ''Home Improvement''{{'}}s seventh season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/homeimprovement-season3.html|title="Home Improvement" The Complete Third Season DVD Review – Page 1 of 2|work=ultimatedisney.com}}</ref> until Tim's last line in the series finale, which are the last two words ever spoken.

''Tool Time'' was conceived as a parody of the PBS home-improvement show ''[[This Old House]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Improvement|url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1|website=TimAllen.com|quote=Tim originally envisioned the show as This Old House combined with a Myrna Loy-type wife to a William Powell-type husband from "The Thin Man" movies from the forties.|access-date=November 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119193316/http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1#|archive-date=November 19, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Tim and Al are caricatures of the two principal cast members of ''This Old House'', host [[Bob Vila]] and master carpenter [[Norm Abram]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Storrs|first1=Francis|title=This Old House: An Oral History|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2009/01/this-old-house/|work=Boston Magazine|date=February 2009|quote=Vila: The Disney people contacted me before Home Improvement premiered. I think there was some concern in the legal department about whether I was being ripped off. The fact is, it’s a sitcom based on me and Norm, you know?}}</ref> Al Borland has a beard and always wears plaid shirts when taping an episode, reflecting Norm Abram's appearance on ''This Old House''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Storrs|first1=Francis|title=This Old House: An Oral History |url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2009/01/this-old-house/|agency=Boston Magazine|date=February 2009|quote=In the mid-1990s the ABC sitcom Home Improvement featured Tim Allen as a bumbling version of Bob Vila and Richard Karn as his able, flannel-clad assistant, a thinly veiled Norm Abram.}}</ref> Bob Vila appeared as a guest star on several episodes of ''Home Improvement'', while Tim Allen and Pamela Anderson both appeared on Bob Vila's show ''Home Again''.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Visiting Tim Allen at Home |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erv6Rr2Nmkw}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|title=Pamela Anderson Lee on Home Improvement|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR6YJ4yr_bI}}</ref>

The ''Tool Time'' theme music, an early 1960s-style saxophone-dominated instrumental rock tune, was sometimes used as the closing theme music for ''Home Improvement'', especially when behind the credits were running the blooper scenes that took place during the taping of a ''Tool Time'' segment.

== Production ==

=== Development and early recasts ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
''Home Improvement'' had been in the works between Tim Allen and the writing/producing team of [[Carmen Finestra]], [[David McFadzean]], and [[Matt Williams (TV producer)|Matt Williams]] since the summer of 1990. Originally, the project's proposed title was ''Hammer Time'', both a play on the catchphrase made popular by artist [[MC Hammer]] and the name of the fictional fix-it show within the series, which was also called ''Hammer Time''. By the time [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] committed to the project in early 1991, Allen and his team had already changed the title to ''Home Improvement''. The show hosted by Tim Taylor in the [[shooting script]] for ''Home Improvement'' was still called ''Hammer Time'' when the first pilot with [[Frances Fisher]] was filmed in April 1991. The catalyst for the series' name change was to represent the aspect of fixing problems within the family and home life, as well as the use of mechanics and tools. Once the second phase of the pilot was produced, with all the actors that made the final cut into the series (including [[Patricia Richardson]]), Tim Taylor's ''Hammer Time'' became ''Tool Time''.

The first pilot was produced in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by the studio audience as not being comedic enough, and too serious in her line delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.

Before the first pilot was shot, actor [[John Bedford Lloyd]] was in the running for one of two roles; that of Tim's ''Tool Time'' assistant (originally named "Glen") and the role of Wilson. Bedford Lloyd eventually got the part of Wilson, but his agent later made claims that the actor was unaware that most of his scenes would require his face to be partially hidden behind a fence. For this reason, the crew received news just one day prior to taping the first pilot that Bedford Lloyd had dropped out. Casting immediately contacted the other actor considered for the role, [[Earl Hindman]].

[[Stephen Tobolowsky]] was tapped to play the ''Tool Time'' co-host, Glen. However, he was still busy with a movie that was in the middle of production at the time the first pilot was to be shot. Therefore, the producers set out to cast an alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned [[Richard Karn]], for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would have no time to do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.

=== Casting changes ===

==== Pamela Anderson ====
In the first two years of the show, [[Pamela Anderson]] played the part of Tim's Tool Girl, Lisa, on ''Tool Time'', but left the show to focus on her role on the syndicated series ''[[Baywatch]]''. Her last episode as a series regular was "The Great Race", which aired on May 19, 1993. Tim's new assistant, Heidi, played by [[Debbe Dunning]], replaced Anderson as the Tool Time Girl for the following third season, starting with "Maybe Baby", which aired on September 15, 1993. Anderson did reprise the role of Lisa on the sixth-season finale episode "The Kiss and the Kiss-Off", which aired on May 20, 1997.

==== Departure of Jonathan Taylor Thomas ====
In the show's eighth and final season, the middle child Randy left for an environmental study program in [[Costa Rica]] in the episode "Adios", which aired on September 29, 1998. This was done because [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] reportedly wanted to take time off to focus on his academics. His last appearance on ''Home Improvement'' was the eighth season Christmas episode "Home for the Holidays", which aired on December 8, 1998.  He did not return to the show for the series finale, only appearing in archived footage.
=== End of series ===
The series ended after eight seasons in 1999. Richardson was offered $25 million to do a ninth season; Allen was offered $50 million. The two declined the offer and the series came to an end as a result.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/68477/14-sturdy-facts-about-home-improvement |title=14 Sturdy Facts About 'Home Improvement'|last=Cormier |first=Roger |magazine=Mental Floss |date=September 17, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2018 |quote=Richardson was offered $25 million to do a ninth season; Allen was offered double that. The two declined, and Home Improvement ended after eight seasons and 203 episodes.}}</ref>

== Theme song ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
The theme music for ''Home Improvement'' entitled "Iron John's Rock", was composed by Dan Foliart. The theme song is unique for its [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of [[power tool]] sounds as well as Allen's grunting which became his signature. The track also includes instruments such as [[flute]] and [[organ (music)|organ]]. From Season 7 until the end of the series, a remixed version of the theme song was used.

== Michigan college and university apparel ==
Throughout the show, Tim Taylor would often be wearing sweatshirts or T-shirts from various Michigan-based colleges and universities. These were usually sent by the schools to the show for him to wear during an episode.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Improvement|url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1|website=TimAllen.com|quote=Colleges and universities in Michigan sent Tim sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did..|access-date=November 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119193316/http://www.timallen.com/actor/tv_home_improvement.php?xpt=1#|archive-date=November 19, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Because Allen considered Michigan his home state, the rule was that only Michigan schools would get the free advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directexpose.com/home-improvement-didnt-know/12/|title=Bet You Didn't Know This About Home Improvement! - DirectExpose}}</ref> There were two notable exceptions to the general rule that Tim only supported Michigan educational institutions on the show. First, during the episode "Workshop 'Til You Drop" Tim wears a Wofford College sweatshirt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home Improvement: Wofford University |url=http://www.tshirtsonscreen.com/home-improvement-wofford-university/ |website=T-Shirts On Screen |access-date=5 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221030149/http://www.tshirtsonscreen.com/home-improvement-wofford-university/ |archive-date=December 21, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Second, during the episode "The Wood, the Bad and the Hungry" Tim wears an Owens Community College sweatshirt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home Improvement: Owens Community College |url=http://www.tshirtsonscreen.com/home-improvement-owens-community-college/ |website=T-Shirts On Screen |access-date=5 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204005215/http://www.tshirtsonscreen.com/home-improvement-owens-community-college/ |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== DVD notes ===
The [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVDs are on three discs (with the exception of the final season set, which has four discs), whereas the [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVDs are presented across four discs, but in Germany the fourth to seventh seasons are also three disc sets. The Region 2 packaging and programme menus for Season 1 vary compared to the Region 1 releases. The Season 3 menus in Region 1 are in [[widescreen]], but [[4:3]] in Region 2. The Region 1 releases of Seasons 2 and 3 consist of (deliberate) "holes" in the outer packaging—these do not exist in the Region 2 releases; in fact, the Season 3 outer packaging is physically printed where the hole would be in the Region 1 packaging.

Seasons 5 and 6 accidentally contain some slightly edited episodes, most likely due to using syndication prints. And the episode "The Feminine Mistake" from season 6, doesn't contain the 3D version of the episode as originally aired on ABC, instead using the 2D version as seen in syndication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitcomsonline.com/homeimprovementseason6dvdreview.html|title=Sitcoms Online - Home Improvement - The Complete Sixth Season DVD Review|website=sitcomsonline.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>

It has been mentioned on review sites about the lack of episode [[Audio commentary|commentaries]] and bonus features on the DVDs (except unaired blooper reels).  In an interview on [[About.com]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/skippingchristmas/a/kranksta111904_4.htm|title=Tim Allen Interview – Christmas with the Kranks, Toy Story 3|first=Rebecca|last=Murray|work=About.com Entertainment}}</ref> Tim Allen stated that it was a done deal that the DVDs would not contain interviews or episode commentaries. Whether this was before or after someone at Disney ordered the three commentaries available on the Season 1 DVDs is unknown.

On May 5, 2015, ''Hollywood Life'' reported that Allen and Karn had admitted talking about getting back together as a cast for a ''Home Improvement'' reboot or reunion show. Karn was quoted as saying, "There is always a chance, absolutely. Would I be on board? Yeah, I think so! I would love to see what the story lines could be, it could be very funny!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/05/04/home-improvement-reboot-tim-allen-richard-karn-interview/|title=[INTERVIEW] ‘Home Improvement’ Reboot Coming? — Tim Allen & Richard Karn Are In – Hollywood Life|first=Emily|last=Longeretta|work=Hollywood Life}}</ref>

On February 18, 2020, ''CinemaBlend'' reported that Allen wants to bring back ''Home Improvement'' for a revival:

<blockquote>"I like the idea of doing it as a one-off, like a one-hour movie [versus a full-fledged revival series]. I like the idea of finding out where the boys are now, and where... ''Tool Time'' would be in today's world. I just think it's a marvelous idea, and all the actors think it's a great idea."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2490358/how-tim-allen-wants-to-bring-home-improvement-back-for-a-revival|title=How Tim Allen Wants To Bring Home Improvement Back For A Revival|last=Venable|first=Nick|date=February 18, 2020|publisher=CinemaBlend|website=cinemablend.com|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>
