'''Rotten Tomatoes''' is an American [[review aggregator|review-aggregation website]] for film and television. The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-rotten-tomatoes-20170721-htmlstory.html|title=How Rotten Tomatoes became Hollywood's most influential — and feared — website|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 18, 2018 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entrepreneurship.berkeley.edu/events/bps-a-fireside-chat-with-patrick-lee/|title=Entrepreneurial Best Practices Series: A Fireside Chat with Rotten Tomatoes Founder Patrick Lee - Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program|work=Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program|access-date=April 18, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://alumni.berkeley.edu/community/berkeley-150/notable-alumni|title=Notable Cal Alumni|date=February 21, 2018|publisher=Cal Alumni Association, UC Berkeley|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://angel.co/swang75|title=Stephen Wang|website=angel.co|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref> Although the name "Rotten Tomatoes" connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten [[tomato]]es when disapproving of a poor stage performance, the original inspiration comes from a scene featuring tomatoes in the Canadian film ''[[Léolo]]'' (1992).<ref>"[https://www.wired.com/story/behind-the-scenes-rotten-tomatoes|Behind the Scenes at Rotten Tomatoes]" by Simon Van Zuylen-Wood.

Since January 2010, Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by [[Flixster]], which was in turn acquired by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2011. In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to [[Comcast]]'s [[Fandango Media|Fandango]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/17/media/fandango-rotten-tomatoes-flixster/index.html|title=Fandango acquires review site Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|work=CNNMoney|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref> Warner Bros. retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.<ref name="revamp" />

==History==
[[File:Foxinteractivemediaheadquarters.jpg|thumb|Fandango headquarters in Beverly Hills (home to Rotten Tomatoes)]]
Rotten Tomatoes was launched on August 12, 1998, as a spare-time project by Senh Duong.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Fresh-Look-For-Rotten-Tomatoes-Help-from-3304427.php |title=Fresh Look For Rotten Tomatoes / Help from college buddies elevates movie-rating website beyond hobby status|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date= April 26, 2001|access-date=January 12, 2013 | first=David | last=Lazarus}}</ref> His objective in creating Rotten Tomatoes was "to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of [[critic]]s in the [[United States|U.S.]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asianconnections.com/entertainment/rotten_tomatoes.php |title=Senh Duong interview | work= Asianconnections.com |date=August 19, 1999 |access-date=December 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090927130308/http://www.asianconnections.com/entertainment/rotten_tomatoes.php |archive-date=September 27, 2009  }}</ref> As a fan of [[Jackie Chan]], Duong was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan's [[Hong Kong action movies]] as they were being released in the United States. The catalyst for the creation of the website was ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'' (1998), Chan's first major Hollywood crossover, which was originally planned to release in August 1998. Duong coded the website in two weeks and the site went live the same month, but the release of ''Rush Hour'' was delayed until September 1998. Besides [[Jackie Chan filmography|Jackie Chan films]], he began including other films on Rotten Tomatoes, extending it beyond Chan's [[fandom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years Later, Rush Hour Is Still a Buddy-Cop Gem |url= https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/20-years-later-rush-hour-is-still-a-buddy-cop-gem/ |website= Rotten Tomatoes |date= September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Semley |first=John |title=Hater: On the Virtues of Utter Disagreeability |date=2018 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9780735236172 |pages=26–27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1tJDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT26}}</ref> The first non-Chan [[Hollywood movie]] whose reviews were featured on Rotten Tomatoes was ''[[Your Friends & Neighbors]]'' (1998). The website was an immediate success, receiving mentions by [[Netscape]], [[Yahoo!]], and ''[[USA Today]]'' within the first week of its launch; it attracted "600–1000 daily unique visitors" as a result.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Duong teamed up with [[University of California, Berkeley]] classmates Patrick Y. Lee and Stephen Wang, his former partners at the [[Berkeley, California]]-based web design firm Design Reactor, to pursue Rotten Tomatoes on a full-time basis. They officially launched it on April 1, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Tim |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1736415/2/an_oral_history_of_rt_part_one_the_beginning |title=Rotten Tomatoes Oral History |work= Rotten Tomatoes | publisher= Fandango Media |access-date=December 4, 2009}}</ref>

In June 2004, [[IGN|IGN Entertainment]] acquired Rotten Tomatoes for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://corp.ign.com/press/2004/ign-entertainment-to-acquire-rotten-tomatoes |title=IGN Entertainment to Acquire Rotten Tomatoes |publisher== IGN Entertainment| work= ign.com |date=June 29, 2004 |access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> In September 2005, IGN was bought by [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]'s [[Fox Interactive Media]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-09-10/news-corp-dot-acquires-ign-for-650-million |title=News Corp.

In early 2009, [[Current TV|Current Television]] launched ''The Rotten Tomatoes Show'', a televised version of the web review site. It was hosted by [[Brett Erlich]] and Ellen Fox and written by Mark Ganek. The show aired Thursdays at 10:30 EST<ref>{{cite web| url=http://current.com/shows/the-rotten-tomatoes-show|title=The Rotten Tomatoes Show on Current|date=November 23, 2009|work=The Rotten Tomatoes Show|access-date=December 4, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120202083229/http://current.com//shows//the-rotten-tomatoes-show/ | archive-date=February 2, 2012| url-status= dead}}</ref> until September 16, 2010. It returned as a much shorter segment of ''[[InfoMania]]'', a satirical news show that ended in 2011.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

By late 2009, the website was designed to enable Rotten Tomatoes users to create and join groups to discuss various aspects of film. One group, "The Golden Oyster Awards", accepted votes of members for various awards, spoofing the better-known [[Academy Awards]] or [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]]. When Flixster bought the company, they disbanded the groups.<ref>{{cite news| title= Notice| quote= The Groups area has been discontinued to pave the way for new community features coming soon. In the meantime, please use the Forums to continue your conversations about your favorite movie topics| work= Rotten Tomatoes| publisher= Flixster}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

As of February 2011, new community features have been added and others removed. For example, users can no longer sort films by Fresh Ratings from Rotten Ratings, and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

On September 17, 2013, a section devoted to scripted television series, called TV Zone, was created as a subsection of the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tv_editorial/news/1928345/welcome_to_the_rotten_tomatoes_tv_zone/?hub=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922042858/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tv_editorial/news/1928345/welcome_to_the_rotten_tomatoes_tv_zone/?hub=15|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 22, 2013|title=Welcome to the Rotten Tomatoes TV Zone| last= Atchity |first= Matt| work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= Fandango Media |access-date=September 17, 2013}}</ref>

In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to [[Comcast]]'s [[Fandango Media|Fandango]]. Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.<ref name="anthonyd'alessandro"/>

In December 2016, Fandango and all its various websites moved to [[Fox Sports Digital Media|Fox Interactive Media's]] former headquarters in [[Beverly Hills, California]].<ref name="Solomon">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Daina Beth |title=Fandango Moving to Larger Headquarters in Beverly Hills |url=https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/dec/21/fandango-moving-larger-headquarters-beverly-hills/ |access-date=15 November 2019 |work= [[Los Angeles Business Journal]] |date=21 December 2016}}</ref>

In July 2017, the website's [[editor-in-chief]] since 2007, Matt Atchity, left to join ''[[The Young Turks]]'' YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/rotten-tomatoes-matt-atchity-young-turks-programming-1202497403/|title=Rotten Tomatoes Editor-in-Chief Matt Atchity Joins The Young Turks as Head of Programming|date=July 16, 2017|work=Variety}}</ref>  On November 1, 2017, the site launched a new web series on [[Facebook]], ''See It/Skip It'', hosted by Jacqueline Coley and Segun Oduolowu.<ref>{{Cite news| url= https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/rotten-tomatoes-facebook-show-see-it-skip-it-1202599553/|title=Rotten Tomatoes to Launch Weekly 'See It/Skip It' Show on Facebook |last= Spangler |first= Todd| date=October 26, 2017| work= Variety| access-date=November 25, 2017 }}</ref>

==Features==
===Critic aggregate score===
Rotten Tomatoes staff first collect online reviews from writers who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic-associations. To be accepted as a critic on the website, a critic's original reviews must garner a specific number of "likes" from users. Those classified as "Top Critics" generally write for major newspapers. The critics upload their reviews to the movie page on the website, and need to mark their review "fresh" if it's generally favorable or "rotten" otherwise. It is necessary for the critic to do so as some reviews are qualitative and do not grant a numeric score, making it impossible for the system to be automatic.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The website keeps track of all the reviews counted for each film and calculates the percentage of positive reviews. Major recently released films can attract more than 400 reviews. If the positive reviews make up 60% or more, the film is considered "fresh", in that a [[supermajority]] of the reviewers approve of the film. If the positive reviews are less than 60%, the film is considered "rotten". An average score on a 0 to 10 scale is also calculated. With each review, a short excerpt of the review is quoted that also serves a [[hyperlink]] to the complete review essay for anyone interested to read the critic's full thoughts on the subject.

"Top Critics", such as [[Roger Ebert]], [[Desson Thomson]], [[Stephen Hunter]], [[Owen Gleiberman]], [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]], [[Peter Travers]] and [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] are identified in a sub-listing that calculates their reviews separately. Their opinions are also included in the general rating. When there are sufficient reviews, the staff creates and posts a consensus statement to express the general reasons for the collective opinion of the film.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

This rating is indicated by an equivalent icon at the film listing, to give the reader a one-glance look at the general critical opinion about the work. The "Certified Fresh" seal is reserved for movies that satisfy two criteria: a "Tomatometer" of 75% or better and at least 80 reviews (40 for limited release movies) from "Tomatometer" critics (including 5 Top Critics). Films earning this status will keep it unless the positive critical percentage drops below 70%.<ref name="licensing"/> Films with 100% positive ratings but fewer than required reviews may not receive the "Certified Fresh" seal.

==== Tomatometer Rankings ====

The "Certified Fresh" seal remains until the score drops below 70%.<ref name="licensing">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/licensing/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: Licensing|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>  Films with [[limited release]]s require only 40 reviews (including 5 from "Top Critics") to qualify for this seal.  For TV shows, only individual seasons are eligible for consideration, and each must have at least 20 critic reviews.<ref name="licensing" />
|- style="text-align:left;"
| [[File:Rotten Tomatoes.svg|30px]] || 60–100% || '''Fresh''': Films or TV shows with a score of 60% or higher that do not meet the requirements for the "Certified Fresh" seal.
|- style="text-align:left;"
| [[File:Rotten Tomatoes rotten.svg|30px]] || 0–59% || '''Rotten''': Films or TV shows with a score of 0–59% receive this seal.
|}

When a film or TV show reaches the requirements for the "Certified Fresh", it is not automatically granted the seal, but is instead flagged for the staff's consideration. Once the team assesses the reviews and response to the film or TV show, and decide that it is unlikely that the score will fall below the minimum requirements in the future, they will then mark it as "Certified Fresh".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about|title=Rotten Tomatoes: About|website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>

====Golden Tomato Awards====
In the year 2000, Rotten Tomatoes announced the RT Awards honoring the best-reviewed films of the year according to the website's rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/features/rtawards/index_2000.php|title=2nd Golden Tomato Awards |website=Rotten Tomatoes|date=January 1, 2013|access-date=April 21, 2013}}</ref> This was later renamed the Golden Tomato Awards.<ref name="Golden"/> The nominees and winners are announced on the website, although there is no actual awards ceremony.

The films are divided into [[wide release]] and [[limited release]] categories. Limited releases are defined as opening in 599 or fewer theaters at initial release. Platform releases, movies initially released under 600 theaters but later receiving wider distribution, fall under this definition. Any film opening in more than 600 theaters is considered wide release.<ref name="Golden"/> There are also two categories purely for [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Cinema of Australia|Australian]] films. The "User"-category represents the highest rated film among users, and the "Mouldy"-award represents the worst-reviewed films of the year. A movie must have 40 (originally 20) or more rated reviews to be considered for domestic categories. It must have 500 or more user ratings to be considered for the "User"-category.

Films are further classified based on [[film genre]]. Each movie is eligible in only one genre, aside from non-English language films, which can be included in both their genre and the respective "Foreign" category.

Once a film is considered eligible, its "votes" are counted. Each critic from the website's list gets one vote (as determined by their review), all weighted equally. Because reviews are continually added, manually and otherwise, a cutoff date at which new reviews are not counted toward the Golden Tomato awards is initiated each year, usually the first of the new year. Reviews without ratings are not counted toward the results of the Golden Tomato Awards.<ref name=Golden>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/golden-tomato-awards-2012/#readmore|title=14th Golden Tomato Awards|website=Rotten Tomatoes|date=January 1, 2013|access-date=April 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Critics consensus===
Each movie features a brief summary of the reviews used in that entry's Tomatometer aggregate score. These are written by Jeff Giles, a longtime author for the site.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/business/media/rotten-tomatoes-box-office.html|title=Attacked by Rotten Tomatoes|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2017-09-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-15 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Audience score and reviews===

}}
Each movie features a "user average", which calculates the percentage of registered users who have rated the film positively on a 5-star scale, similar to calculation of recognized critics' reviews.

In May 2019, Rotten Tomatoes introduced a verified rating system that would replace the earlier system where users were merely required to register in order to submit a rating. Henceforth, in addition to creating an account, users will have to verify their ticket purchase through [[Fandango Media|Fandango]], a ticketing company which Rotten Tomatoes is a subsidiary of. While users can still leave reviews without verifying, those reviews will not account for the average audience score displayed next to the Tomatometer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Anthony|last=Ha|url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/rotten-tomatoes-verified-audience-score/|title=Rotten Tomatoes will start verifying ticket purchases for audience reviews|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=May 23, 2019|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Napier|last=Lopez|url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/rotten-tomatoes-verified-audience-score/|title= Rotten Tomatoes' new Audience Score makes you prove you've seen the movie|website=[[The Next Web]]|date=May 24, 2019|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref>

===Localized versions===
Localized versions of the site available in the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], and [[Australia]] were discontinued following the acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes by Fandango. The [[Mexico|Mexican]] version of the site, {{ill|Tomatazos|es}}, remains active.

===API===
The Rotten Tomatoes [[Application programming interface|API]] provides limited access to critic and audience ratings and reviews, allowing developers to incorporate Rotten Tomatoes data on other websites. The free service is intended for use in the US only; permission is required for use elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/page|title=Welcome to the Rotten Tomatoes API|publisher=Flixster, Inc.|access-date=November 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219140243/http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/page|archive-date=December 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Influence==
[[Major film studio|Major Hollywood studios]] have come to see Rotten Tomatoes as a threat to their [[movie marketing|marketing]]. In 2017 several [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster films]] like ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' and ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' were projected to open with gross receipts of $90 million, $50 million and $45 million respectively, but ended up debuting with $62.6 million, $23.1 million and $31.6 million. Rotten Tomatoes, which scored the films at 30%, 19% and 16%, respectively, was blamed for undermining them. That same summer, films like ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (both 92%) received high scores and opened at or exceeded expectations with their $100+ million trackings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mendelson|first1=Scott|title=Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix And A Perfect Storm That Dooms Hollywood|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/06/13/box-office-rotten-tomatoes-netflix-and-a-perfect-storm-dooms-hollywood/ |access-date=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes LLC|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name="DEAD">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/05/pirates-of-the-caribbean-5-dead-men-tell-no-tales-baywatch-box-office-weekend-1202102887/|title=How 'Pirates' & 'Baywatch' Are Casualties Of Summer Franchise Fatigue At The Domestic B.O.|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 28, 2017|access-date=July 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=THR/>

As result of this concern, [[20th Century Fox]] commissioned a 2015 study, titled "Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office", that stated the website combined with [[social media]] was going to be an increasingly serious complication for the film business: "The power of Rotten Tomatoes and fast-breaking word of mouth will only get stronger. Many [[Millennials]] and even [[Generation X|Gen X-ers]] now vet every purchase through the Internet, whether it's restaurants, video games, make-up, consumer electronics or movies. As they get older and comprise an even larger share of total moviegoers, this behavior is unlikely to change".<ref name="VANITY">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Chris|title=How Hollywood Came to Fear and Loathe Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/how-hollywood-came-to-fear-and-loathe-rotten-tomatoes|access-date=October 29, 2017|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> Other studios have commissioned a number of studies on the subject, with them finding that seven out of 10 people said they would be less interested in seeing a film if the Rotten Tomatoes score was 0-25, and that the site has the most influence on people 25 and younger.<ref name="THR" />

The scores have reached a level of online ubiquity which film companies have found threatening.  For instance, the scores are regularly posted in [[Google]] search results for films so reviewed. Furthermore, the scores are prominently featured in Fandango's popular ticket purchasing website and its mobile app, [[Flixster]], which led to complaints that "rotten" scores damaged films' performances.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Brooks|title=Rotten Tomatoes won't be getting fresh ratings from Hollywood|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/09/08/rotten-tomatoes-wont-be-getting-any-fresh-ratings-from-hollywood.html|access-date=September 9, 2017|agency=New York Times|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]]|date=September 8, 2017}}</ref>

Others have argued that filmmakers and studios have only themselves to blame if Rotten Tomatoes produces a bad score, as this only reflects a poor reception among film critics. As one [[independent film]] distributor marketing executive noted, "To me, it's a ridiculous argument that Rotten Tomatoes is the problem ... make a good movie!".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/how-hollywood-came-to-fear-and-loathe-rotten-tomatoes|title=How Hollywood Came to Fear and Loathe Rotten Tomatoes|last1=Lee|first1=Chris|date=June 9, 2017|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> [[ComScore]]'s Paul Dergarabedian had similar comments, saying: "The best way for studios to combat the 'Rotten Tomatoes Effect' is to make better movies, plain and simple".<ref name="THR" />

Some studios have suggested embargoing or cancelling early critic screenings in a response to poor reviews prior to a film's release affecting pre-sales and opening weekend numbers.<ref name="DEAD" /> In July 2017, Sony embargoed critic reviews for ''[[The Emoji Movie]]'' until mid-day the Thursday before its release. The film ended up with a 9% rating (including 0% after the first 25 reviews), but still opened to $24 million, on par with projections. Josh Greenstein, [[Sony Pictures]] President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, said: "''The Emoji Movie'' was built for people under 18 ... so we wanted to give the movie its best chance. What other wide release with a score under 8 percent has opened north of $20 million? I don't think there is one". Conversely, [[Warner Bros.]] also did not do critic pre-screenings for ''[[The House (2017 film)|The House]]'', which ended up with a 16% rating, until the day of its release, but it still opened to just $8.7 million, the lowest of star [[Will Ferrell]]'s career.<ref name="THR">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/studios-fight-back-withering-rotten-tomatoes-scores-1025575|title=Studios Fight Back Against Withering Rotten Tomatoes Scores|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 2, 2017}}</ref>

That marketing tactic can backfire, and drew the vocal disgust of influential critics such as [[Roger Ebert]], who was prone to derisively condemn such moves, with gestures such as "The Wagging Finger of Shame", on ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Chris|title=Why Hollywood doesn't want you to see Tulip Fever, which has been buried deep for three long years|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/why-hollywood-doesnt-want-you-to-see-tulip-fever-which-has-been-buried-deep-for-three-long-years|access-date=October 5, 2017|publisher=National Post|date=August 31, 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, the very nature of withholding reviews can draw early conclusions from the public that the film is of poor quality because of that marketing tactic.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dickey|first1=Josh|title=There's a secret way to predict a movie's Rotten Tomatoes score|url=http://mashable.com/2017/09/05/movies-rotten-tomatoes-scores-embargo-times/|publisher=Mashable.com|access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref>

On February 26, 2019, in response to issues surrounding coordinated "[[review bomb|bombing]]" of user reviews for several films, most notably [[Captain Marvel (film)|''Captain Marvel'']] and ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', prior to their release, the site announced that user reviews would no longer be accepted until a film is publicly released. The site also announced plans to introduce a system for "verified" reviews, and that the "Want to See" statistic would now be expressed as a number so that it is not confused with the audience score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/26/18241312/rotten-tomatoes-movie-review-changes|title=Rotten Tomatoes will no longer allow audiences to review movies before release|last=Polo|first=Susana|date=2019-02-26|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/26/rotten-tomatoes-trolls-audience-scores/|title=Rotten Tomatoes takes on trolls by removing 'want to see' scores|website=Engadget |access-date=2019-02-26 }}</ref>

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes won the [[2020 Webby Award|2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Entertainment]] in the category Web.<ref name="Kastrenakes">{{cite web |last= Kastrenakes |first= Jacob |title= Here are all the winners of the 2020 Webby Awards |url= https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263445/2020-webby-awards-winners-lil-nas-x-nasa-jon-krasinski |website= The Verge |access-date= 22 May 2020 |date= 20 May 2020 }}</ref>

===Oversimplification===
In January 2010, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], its [[chairman]] [[Armond White]] cited Rotten Tomatoes in particular and film [[review aggregator]]s in general as examples of how "the Internet takes revenge on individual expression". He said they work by "dumping reviewers onto one website and assigning spurious percentage-enthusiasm points to the discrete reviews". According to White, such websites "offer consensus as a substitute for assessment".<ref name="critics">{{cite web|url=https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2010/03/do-movie-critics-matter|title=Do Movie Critics Matter?|last=White|first=Armond|author-link=Armond White|date=April 3, 2010|website=[[First Things]]|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref>

Director and producer [[Brett Ratner]] has criticized the website for "reducing hundreds of reviews culled from print and online sources into a popularized aggregate score", and feels it is the "worst thing that we have in today's movie culture".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/03/23/ratner-tomatoes-scores/|title=Rotten Tomatoes Is 'the Destruction of Our Business,' Says Director|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=March 23, 2017|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref> Writer [[Max Landis]], following his film ''[[Victor Frankenstein (film)|Victor Frankenstein]]'' receiving an approval rating of 24% on the site, wrote that the site "breaks down entire reviews into just the word 'yes' or 'no', making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cinemajam.com/mag/features/critical-mass-rotten-tomatoes-death-of-individuality |title=Critical Mass: Rotten Tomatoes and the death of individuality |last=Birrell |first=Mark |date=April 16, 2017 |website=The Spread |access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref>

===Criticism===
American director [[Martin Scorsese]] wrote a column in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticizing both Rotten Tomatoes and [[CinemaScore]] for promoting the idea that films like ''[[Mother!]]'' had to be "instantly liked" to be successful.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/martin-scorsese-rotten-tomatoes-box-office-obsession-why-mother-was-misjudged-guest-column-1047286 |title=Martin Scorsese on Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Obsession and Why 'Mother!'

In 2015, while promoting the film ''[[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]]'' (which has a 73% approval rating)<ref name=rotSF>{{cite web  |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/suffragette/ |title= Suffragette (2015) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> actress [[Meryl Streep]] accused Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. "I submit to you that men and women are not the same, they like different things", she said. "Sometimes they like the same thing, but sometimes their tastes diverge. If the Tomatometer is slighted so completely to one set of tastes that drives box office in the United States, absolutely."<ref>{{cite web |date=7 October 2015 |title=Meryl Streep Rips Rotten Tomatoes for 'Infuriating' Lack of Female Critics |url=https://www.thewrap.com/meryl-streep-rips-rotten-tomatoes-for-infuriating-lack-of-female-critics/ |website=TheWrap |access-date=27 April 2020 }}</ref> Critics took issue with the sentiment that someone's gender or ethnic background would dictate their response to art.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|date=June 15, 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/oceans-8-dominance-men-film-reviews|title=Ocean's 8 stars blame dominance of male critics for film's mixed reviews|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>

Rotten Tomatoes deliberately withheld the critic score for ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' based on early reviews until the premiere of its ''See It/Skip It'' episode on the Thursday before its release. Some critics viewed the move as a ploy to promote the web series, but some argued that the move was a deliberate [[conflict of interest]] on account of Warner Bros.' ownership of the film and Rotten Tomatoes, and the tepid critical reception to the [[DC Extended Universe]] films at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/justice-league-rotten-tomatoes-fans/|title='Justice League', Rotten Tomatoes, and DC Fans' Persecution Complex|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=2017-11-20|work=Wired|access-date=2019-05-15|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>
