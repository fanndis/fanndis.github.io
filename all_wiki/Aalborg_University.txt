'''Aalborg University''' ('''AAU''') is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[public university]] with campuses in [[Aalborg]], [[Esbjerg]], and [[Copenhagen]] founded in 1974. The university awards [[bachelor's degree]]s, [[master's degree]]s, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD degrees]] in a wide variety of subjects within humanities, social sciences, information technology, design, engineering, exact sciences, and medicine.

== History ==
The idea of a university in the [[North Jutland Region]] started in 1961 when the North Jutland Committee for higher education institutions was established. On 19 August 1969 the Aalborg University Association was founded and a planning group was established with Eigil Hastrup as chairman. The same year in December, about 1,000 people from North Jutland demonstrated in front of the [[Folketing]]et (the Danish Parliament) for their cause.

In 1970, a law about the establishment of a university centre in Aalborg was passed in the Danish Parliament. In 1972, it was decided that the first rector of the new university center should be the Swedish historian and professor Jörgen Weibull. On 1 September 1974, Aalborg University Center (AUC) was inaugurated by Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]]. Jørgen Weibull was replaced by Sven Caspersen as rector of Aalborg University Center (AUC) in 1976. At the same time, a new management organization was established under a consistory. The first formal cooperation agreement was signed with the [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] in 1980. The North Jutland knowledge park was established in 1989 as a neighbor to Aalborg University Center (AUC).

In 1993, external representatives joined the consistory. In 1994, Aalborg University Center (AUC) changed its name to Aalborg University (AAU). [[Aalborg University - Esbjerg]] was established through a merger between the engineering college in Esbjerg and Aalborg University in 1995. In 1998, the NOVI science park was connected to Aalborg University. [[Aalborg University Copenhagen]] was formed in collaboration with the engineering college in Copenhagen in 2003. A new university board was formed and joined by its members on 1 February 2004, with Jørgen Østergaard appointed as rector. In 2005, [[Finn Kjærsdam]] was hired by the university board as rector. Aalborg University and the Danish Building Research Institute merged in 2007. In 2010, Aalborg University established a faculty of Medicine and created a medical education. [[Per Michael Johansen]] was hired as rector by the university board in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aau.dk/om-aau/historie-priser/historie/|title=Aalborg Universitets historie|website=www.aau.dk|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>

== Profile ==
Aalborg University differentiates itself from the older and more traditional Danish universities with its focus on interdisciplinary, inter-faculty studies; an experimental curriculum based on an interdisciplinary basic course with subsequent specialisation; a pedagogical structure based on problem-centred, real-life projects of educational and research relevance – which internationally has become known and recognised as ''The Aalborg Model''. With the problem-based, project-organised model, semesters at AAU are centred around complex real-life problems which students attempt to find answers to in a scientific manner while working together in groups. In February 2007, the foundation of the UICEE Centre for Problem Based Learning (UCPBL) paid recognition to Aalborg University, which subsequently led to the appointment of AAU as [[UNESCO Chairs|UNESCO Chair]] in [[problem-based learning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.aau.dk/about-aau/aalborg-model-problem-based-learning/|title=The Aalborg model for problem based learning|website=www.en.aau.dk|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/listchairs20122013.pdf/|title=UNESCO CHAIRS|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>

== University rankings ==
{{Infobox UK university rankings
| ARWU_W = 301−400
| QS_W = 305
| THE_W = 201−250
|-
}}

For the current academic year (i.e. 2020-21), Aalborg University (AAU) is currently moderately well ranked worldwide (including, most notably, by ARWU, QS, and THE) and very high ranked nationally in Denmark, where it often is placed on the 4th position in most academic charts.

== Administration and organisation ==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 11 members as follows:

* Six members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board
* Two members are appointed by the scientific staff
* One member is appointed by the administrative staff
* Two members are appointed by the university students

The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans, and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty are not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.aau.dk/about-aau/organisation-management/board/|title=The Aalborg University Board|website=www.en.aau.dk|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>

== Special action areas and cross-disciplinary research ==
AAU conducts research within all faculties. Aalborg University is among the leading universities in the world within health technology research, wireless communication, energy, computer science, innovation economics and comparative welfare studies. AAU has established centres for telecommunication at [[Birla Institute of Technology]] in India, at [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] in Indonesia, and at [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|the University of Rome]]. Furthermore, AAU has established a research centre for health technology at [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]] in China.

AAU has conducted several experiments in the field of [[CubeSat]] technology. The first [[AAU CubeSat]] was launched on 30 June 2003, the second (called [[AAUSAT-II]]) on 28 April 2008 and the third will be launched in Q1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.aau.dk/aausat3/ |title=AAUSAT 3 |work=AAUSATLAB |year=2015 |accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> After launching AAUSAT3 the fourth will begin development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.aau.dk/aausat4/ |title=AAUSAT 4 |work=AAUSATLAB |year=2015 |accessdate=20 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712124701/http://www.space.aau.dk/aausat4/ |archive-date=12 July 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

* Information technology
* Nanotechnology and nanoproduction
* Experience technology and design

== Cooperative agreements with other universities and colleges ==
Aalborg University is a member of the [[European Consortium of Innovative Universities]] (ECIU), which was founded in 1997 by 10 European universities. The other 9 European universities are: [[Dublin City University]], Ireland; [[Linköping University]], Sweden; [[Aveiro University]], Portugal; [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]], Spain; [[Hamburg University of Technology]], Germany; [[University of Stavanger]], Norway; [[Kaunas University of Technology]], Lithuania; [[Tampere University of Technology]], Finland; [[University of Twente]], The Netherlands.

The aim of the ECIU is to create a European network where participating universities can exchange experiences and practices in projects in education, research, and regional development. In 2010, the ECIU consisted of eleven members and three foreign affiliates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eciu.web.ua.pt/page.asp?pg=7 |title=European Consortium of Innovative Universities |accessdate=21 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725014930/http://eciu.web.ua.pt/page.asp?pg=7 |archivedate=25 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>
