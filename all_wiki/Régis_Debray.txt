== Life==

===1960 to 1973 ===

Born in [[Paris]], Régis Debray studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] as taught by [[Louis Althusser]]. He appeared as himself in the [[cinema verité]] movie ''[[Chronique d'un été]]'' by [[Jean Rouch]] and [[Edgar Morin]] in 1960. He became an "[[Agrégation|agrégé de philosophie]]" in 1965.

During the late 1960s he was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Havana]] in [[Cuba]], and became an associate of [[Che Guevara]] in [[Bolivia]].  He wrote the book ''Revolution in the Revolution?'', which analysed the tactical and strategic doctrines then prevailing among militant socialist movements in Latin America, and acted as a handbook for [[guerrilla warfare]] that supplemented Guevara's own manual concerning the topic. It was published in Cuba in the "Cuadernos" collection by [[Casa de las Americas]] in 1967, by Maspero in Paris, in New York (Monthly Review Press and [[Grove Press]]), Montevideo (Sandino), Milan (Feltrinelli) and Munich (Trikont).

Guevara was captured in Bolivia in October 1967; on 20 April 1967 Debray had been arrested in the small town of [[Luis Calvo|Muyupampa]], also in Bolivia. Convicted of having been part of Guevara's guerrilla group, Debray was sentenced on 17 November to 30 years in prison. He was released in 1970 after an international campaign for his release which included appeals by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[André Malraux]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Pope Paul VI]]. He sought refuge in Chile, where he wrote ''The Chilean Revolution'' (1972) after interviews with [[Salvador Allende]]. Debray returned to France in 1973 following the coup by [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile.

=== 1981 to 1996 ===

After the election in France of President [[François Mitterrand]] in 1981, he became an official adviser to the Président on Foreign Affairs. In this capacity he developed a policy that sought to increase France's freedom of action in the world, decrease dependence on the United States, and promote closeness with the former colonies. He was also involved in the development of the government's official ceremonies and recognition of the bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]]. He resigned in 1988. Until the mid-1990s he held a number of official positions in France, including an honorary counselorship at France's supreme administrative court, [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'État]].

In 1996 he published a memoir of his life, translated into English as ''Régis Debray, Praised Be Our Lords'' (Verso, 2007).

=== 2003 onwards ===

Debray was a member of the 2003 [[Stasi Commission]], named for [[Bernard Stasi]], which examined the origins of the 2003 [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Debray endorsed the 2003 law. This was in defense of French ''[[laïcité]]'' (separation of church and state) which intends to maintain citizens' equality by the prohibition of religious [[proselytism]] in the school system. Debray, however, seems to have encouraged a more subtle treatment of religious issues with regard to school history teaching in France.

Debray is preoccupied with the situation of Christian minorities in the Near East (and with the status of the Holy Places in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and elsewhere), a traditional interest of the French state, and has established an observatory to monitor the situation. His recent work investigates the religious paradigm as a social [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] able to assist collective orientation on a wide, centuries-long scale. This caused him to propose the project of an ''Institut Européen en Sciences des Religions'', a French institute founded in 2005 for monitoring of sociological religious dynamics, and informing the public about religious issues through conferences and publications.

== Work: mediology ==

Debray is the initiator and chief exponent of the discipline of ''médiologie'' or "[[mediology]]", which attempts to scientifically study the transmission of cultural meaning in society, whether through language or images.  Mediology is characterized by its multi-disciplinary approach.  It is expounded best in the English-language book ''Transmitting Culture'' (Columbia University Press, 2004). In ''Vie et mort de l'image'' (Life and Death of Image, 1995), an attempted history of the gaze, he distinguished three regimes of the images ([[icon]], idol and vision). He also strove explicitly to prevent misunderstandings by differentiating mediology from a simple [[sociology]] of [[mass media]]. He also criticized the basic assumptions of the [[history of art]] which present art as an atemporal and universal phenomenon. According to Debray, art is a product of the [[Renaissance]] with the invention of the artist as producer of images, in contrast with previous [[acheiropoieta]] icons or other types of so-called "art," which did not primarily fulfill an artistic function but rather a religious one.

== Current political views ==

In a February 2007 opinion-editorial in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', Debray criticized the tendency of the entire French political class towards conservatism. He also deplored the influence of the "videosphere" on modern politics, which he claimed has a tendency to individualize everything, forgetting both past and future (although he praised the loss of 1960s "[[messianism]]"), and rejecting any common national project. He criticized the new generation in politics as competent but without character, and lacking ideas: "So they [think they] recruit philosophy with [[André Glucksmann]] or [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] and literature with [[Christine Angot]] or [[Jean d'Ormesson]]". He asked voters to endorse the "left of the left," in an attempt to end a modern "anti-politics" which has become political [[marketing]].<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-875093,0.html La Coupe de l'Elysée 2007, par Régis Debray], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 27 February 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>
