Blackstone was originally formed as a mergers and acquisitions advisory boutique. Blackstone advised on the 1987 merger of investment banks [[E. F. Hutton & Co.]] and Lehman Brothers, collecting a $3.5 million fee.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1239F937A35751C1A961948260 Hutton-Shearson Deal Announced]".

From the outset in 1985, Schwarzman and Peterson planned to enter the private equity business, but had difficulty in raising their first fund because neither had ever led a leveraged buyout.<ref name="Carey-2010" />{{RP|45-56}} Blackstone finalized fundraising for its first private equity fund in the aftermath of the [[Black Monday (1987)|October 1987 stock market crash]]. After two years of providing strictly advisory services, Blackstone decided to pursue a merchant banking model after its founders determined that many situations required an investment partner rather than just an advisor. The largest investors in the first fund included [[Prudential Insurance Company]], [[Nikko Securities]] and the General Motors pension fund.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1638F930A25752C1A961948260 A Big Fund Ready to Capitalize on Hard Times].

Blackstone also ventured into other businesses, most notably investment management. In 1987 Blackstone entered into a 50–50 partnership with the founders of [[BlackRock]], [[Laurence D. Fink|Larry Fink]] and Ralph Schlosstein. The two founders, who had previously run the mortgage-backed securities divisions at [[First Boston]] and Lehman Brothers, respectively, initially joined Blackstone to manage an investment fund and provide advice to financial institutions. They also planned to use a Blackstone fund to invest in financial institutions and help build an asset management business specializing in fixed income investments.<ref name="BXS1">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393818/000104746907002068/0001047469-07-002068-index.htm The Blackstone Group L.P., Form S-1], Securities And Exchange Commission, March 22, 2007</ref><ref>"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DE153FF937A35750C0A96E948260 Mortgage Unit Leaders To Join Blackstone]".

As the business grew, Japanese bank Nikko Securities acquired a 20% interest in Blackstone for a $100 million investment in 1988 (valuing the firm at $500 million). Nikko's investment allowed for a major expansion of the firm and its investment activities.<ref>"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DD1F3AF930A25751C1A96E948260 Nikko Acquires 20% of Blackstone Group]".

In 1995, Blackstone sold its stake in BlackRock to [[PNC Financial Services]] for $250 million.

With a significant amount of capital in its new fund, Blackstone was one of a handful of private equity investors capable of completing large transactions in the adverse conditions of the [[early 2000s recession]]. At the end of 2002, Blackstone, together with [[Thomas H. Lee Partners]] and [[Bain Capital]], acquired [[Houghton Mifflin Company]] for $1.28 billion. The transaction represented one of the first large [[club deal]]s completed since the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E2DC133FF932A35752C0A9659C8B63 Vivendi Finishes Sale of Houghton Mifflin To Investors].

Blackstone made a significant investment in [[Financial Guaranty Insurance Company]] (FGIC), a [[Monoline insurance|monoline bond insurer]] alongside [[PMI Group]], [[The Cypress Group]] and [[CIVC Partners]].

Two years later, in 2005, Blackstone was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of [[SunGard]] in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. Blackstone's partners in the acquisition were [[Silver Lake Partners]], Bain Capital, [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], [[Providence Equity Partners]], and [[TPG Capital]]. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of [[RJR Nabisco]] at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point.<ref name="Carey-2010" />{{RP|225}} The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/29/business/29sungard.html Capital Firms Agree to Buy SunGard Data in Cash Deal]."

=== Buyouts (2005{{endash}}2007) ===
During the buyout boom of 2006 and 2007, Blackstone completed some of the largest leveraged buyouts. Blackstone's most notable transactions during this period included the following:

| style="text-align:center;" |[[Freescale Semiconductor]]
| A consortium led by Blackstone and including the [[Carlyle Group]], Permira and the [[TPG Capital]] completed the $17.6 billion takeover of the semiconductor company. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.|| style="text-align:center;" |<ref name="Carey-2010" />{{RP|231-235}}<ref>Sorkin, Andrew Ross and Flynn, Laurie J.

The purchase and subsequent IPO of Southern Cross led to controversy in the UK. Part of the purchase involved splitting the business into a property company, NHP, and a nursing home business, which Blackstone claimed would become "the leading company in the elderly care market". In May 2011, Southern Cross, now independent, was almost bankrupt, jeopardising 31,000 elderly residents in 750 care homes. It denied blame, although Blackstone was widely accused in the media for selling on the company with an unsustainable business model and crippled with an impossible sale and leaseback strategy.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/02/blackstone-denies-blame-for-southern-cross?INTCMP=SRCH Alex Hawkes] "Blackstone denies blame for Southern Cross's plight" ''The Guardian'', Thursday 2 June 2011{{full|date=September 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/02/was-southern-cross-always-sickly?INTCMP=SRCH Nils Pratley] "Was Southern Cross always sickly underneath?"

===United Nations condemnation of the Invitation Homes project and lobbying efforts===

In 2019, a United Nations report found that Blackstone’s massive purchasing of single-family homes after the financial collapse had "devastating consequences."<ref>{{Cite web|last=United Nations Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations|date=22 March 2019|title=Mandates of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Housing/Financialization/OL_OTH_17_2019.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=7 July 2020|archive-date=25 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925005736/https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Housing/Financialization/OL_OTH_17_2019.pdf}}</ref> In addition to reshaping the housing market to benefit Wall Street over working people, Blackstone abused tenants with exorbitant fees, rent hikes, and aggressive eviction practices. Blackstone’s real estate practice had a disproportionate impact on communities of color, in part because the company targeted foreclosures resulting from subprime loans. Blackstone also contributed to widespread displacement from gentrification; the firm bought property in low-income neighborhoods, refurbished units, and exorbitantly increased rent. 

The report also condemed Blackstone for "using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate Housing." Blackstone spent at least $6.2 million to defeat California’s Proposition 10, which would have allowed cities to enact rent control. Blackstone is a member of the Real Estate Roundtable, a special interest group which spends millions on lobbying and political donations every year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=NW|first=The Center for Responsive Politics 1300 L.

United Nations housing [[United Nations special rapporteur|rapporteur]] [[Leilani Farha]] and Surya Deva, chair of the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights, criticised Blackstone's business practices, including frequent rent increases and "aggressive" evictions, for contributing to the global housing crisis.
