A '''sex symbol''' is a [[celebrity]] or [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] widely considered to be [[Sexual attraction|sexually attractive]].<ref name=pam>[[Pam Cook]], "The trouble with sex: Diana Dors and the Blonde bombshell phenomenon", In: Bruce Babinigton (ed.), ''British Stars and Stardom: From Alma Taylor to Sean Connery'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmQJRr0vL8C&pg=PA169 pp. 169–171]. Quote: "– the sex symbol is usually defined in terms of her excessive sexuality"</ref>

==History==
The term ''sex symbol'' was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars and [[pin-up model]]s, including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], and [[Raquel Welch]].<ref name=Flexner>{{cite book |title=Speaking freely: a guided tour of American English from Plymouth Rock to Silicon Valley |first=Stuart Berg |last=Flexner |authorlink=Stuart Berg Flexner |first2=Anne H. |last2=Soukhanov |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlANAQAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22sex+symbol%22 373] |isbn=978-0-19-510692-3 }}</ref> This concept was a reflection of the post-[[World War II]] increase of sexual and economic emancipation of women.<ref name=pam/>

In the 20th century, sex symbols could be male as well as female: actors such as the romantic [[Sessue Hayakawa]] and the athletic [[Douglas Fairbanks]] were popular in the 1910s and 1920s. Archetypal screen lover [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s death in 1926 caused mass hysteria among his female fans.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Pamela |title=Last of the red-hot myths: what gossip over Rudolph Valentino's sex life says about the silents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/silent-but-deadly-rudolph-valentino-ken-russell-film-blu-ray |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--staff writers, no byline--> |title=The Queen at 90: The key events of 1926, in pictures |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/21/the-queen-at-90-the-key-events-of-1926-in-pictures/hollywood-heart-throb-rudolph-valentino-died-unexpectedly-at-the/ |newspaper=The DailyTelegraph |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}</ref> In Hollywood, many film stars were seen as sex symbols, such as [[Errol Flynn]], [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Clark Gable]]. The "bad boy" image of the 1950s was epitomized by sex symbols such as [[James Dean]] and [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Weinberg, Thomas S. |editor2=Newmahr, Staci|year=2014|title=Selves, Symbols, and Sexualities: An Interactionist Anthology: An Interactionist Anthology|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1483323893}}</ref>

In his [[Elvis Presley]] obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America,"<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodman|first=Gilbert B.|year=1996|title=Elvis After Elvis, The Posthumous Career of a Living Legend|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-11002-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/elvisafterelvisp0000rodm|pages=58–59}}</ref> in the 1950s and 1960s, through his overtly suggestive dance moves.

==Fictional sex symbols==
With regard to fiction, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] states that the 1930s cartoon character [[Betty Boop]] is "the first and most famous sex symbol on animated screen".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/betty_boop_boop_oop_a_doop/|title=Betty Boop: Boop Oop a Doop|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> [[Jessica Rabbit]] (voiced by [[Kathleen Turner]]) from the 1988 live-action/animation crossover film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' has been described as a sex symbol as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/amanda-knox-is-like-jessica-rabbit-10485528|title=Amanda Knox Is Like Jessica Rabbit|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>
