The automotive industry began in the [[1860s]] with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the [[Brass Era car|horseless carriage]]. For many decades, the [[United States]] led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the [[Great Depression]], the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&q=U.S.+makes+ninety+percent+of+world's+automobiles&pg=PA84 |title=U.S. Makes Ninety Percent of World's Automobiles |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1929 |page=84 |volume=115 |issue=5 |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> After 1945, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production of 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.<ref name="Production Statistics">{{cite web|publisher=OICA |url= http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=2012 Production Statistics |accessdate=6 August 2013 }}</ref> From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aichner|first1=T.|last2=Coletti|first2= P|date=2013|title=Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization|journal=Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice|volume=15|issue=1|pages=20–35|doi=10.1057/dddmp.2013.34|s2cid=167801827}}</ref>

==Safety==
{{Main|Automobile safety}}
{{See also|2009–11 Toyota vehicle recalls|General Motors ignition switch recalls|Firestone and Ford tire controversy}}
Safety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or [[manufacturers]] do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves, implies that there is no risk of damage.

Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. [[Automobiles]] and other [[motor vehicles]] have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard [[ISO 26262]], is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive [[functional safety]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54591 |title= ISO 26262-10:2012 Road vehicles -- Functional safety -- Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>

In case of safety issues, danger, [[product defect]] or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called [[product recall]]. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.

Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the [[value chain]] are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.
