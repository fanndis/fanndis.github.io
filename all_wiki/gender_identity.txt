There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.<ref name="Boles101102" /> [[John Money]] suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years; Lawrence Kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3.<ref name="Boles101102"/> It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3.<ref name="Boles101102"/><ref>A few authorities say it forms between ages 3–4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J.

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=C.|last2=Ruble|first2=D.|year=2004|title=Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|issue=2|pages=67–70|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x|s2cid=33579865}}</ref> Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.<ref name="Newmann" />

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|page=18}}</ref>

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.<ref name="ZhongNan">''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149–61</ref> While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Money|first1=John|author-link=John Money|year=1994|title=The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years|journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy|volume=20|issue=3|pages=163–77|doi=10.1080/00926239408403428|pmid=7996589}}</ref> it does not inflexibly determine it.<ref>Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), p. 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."</ref>

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.<ref name="Henslin">{{cite book|last=Henslin|first=James M.|title=Essentials of Sociology|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5|pages=65–67, 240}}</ref> When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/}}</ref> Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.<ref>Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011</ref> The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,<ref name="myers">Myers, David G.

John Money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity, though he used the term ''gender role''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zucker|first1=Kenneth J.|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402043130|title=Ethics and Intersex|date=2006|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-4313-0|editor1-last=Sytsma|editor1-first=Sharon E.|page=167|language=en}}</ref> He disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology.

A well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-1308211503|edition=6|page=368}}<!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--></ref> This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol|author2=Diane Ruble|author3=Joel Szkrybalo|year=2002|title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=128|issue=6|pages=903–13|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903|pmid=12405137}}</ref>

Most did not dare to argue against Money's theory. [[Milton Diamond]] was a scientist who was one of the few to openly disagree with him and oppose his argument. Diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes.<ref name=":0" /> The researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone, which would then find its way to the baby's bloodstream.<ref name=":1" /> The females that were born had genitalia that looked like male genitalia. The females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats, proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior.<ref name=":0" />

One criticism of the Reimer case is that Reimer lost his penis at the age of eight months and underwent [[sex reassignment surgery]] at seventeen months, which possibly meant that Reimer had already been influenced by his socialization as a boy. Bradley et al. (1998) report the contrasting case of a 26-year-old woman with XY chromosomes whose penis was lost and who underwent sex reassignment surgery between two and seven months of age (substantially earlier than Reimer), whose parents were also more committed to raising their child as a girl than Reimer's, and who remained a woman into adulthood. She reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood, enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests, although her childhood friends were girls. While she was [[bisexual]], having had relationships with both men and women, she found women more sexually attractive and they featured more in her fantasies. Her job at the time of the study was a blue-collar occupation that was practiced almost exclusively by men.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=Susan J.|last2=Oliver|first2=Gillian D.|last3=Chernick|first3=Avinoam B.|last4=Zucker|first4=Kenneth J.|date=1 July 1998|title=Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 Months, Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in Young Adulthood|journal=Pediatrics|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e9|doi=10.1542/peds.102.1.e9|pmid=9651461|quote=The present case report is a long-term psychosexual follow-up on a second case of ablatio penis in a 46 XY male.|doi-access=free}}</ref>  Griet Vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature, this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity, particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions. However, Vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted, as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex.<ref>Vandermassen, Griet.

One study by Reiner et al. looked at fourteen genetic males who had suffered [[cloacal exstrophy]] and were thus raised as girls. Six of them changed their gender identity to male, five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities (though two of them had declared they were male). All the subjects had moderate to marked interests and attitudes consistent with that of biological males.<ref>Reiner, William G., and John P. Gearhart. "Discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth." New England Journal of Medicine 350, no. 4 (2004): 333-341.</ref> Another study,<ref>Meyer-Bahlburg, Heino FL. "Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46, XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation." Archives of sexual behavior 34, no. 4 (2005): 423-438.</ref> using data from a variety of cases from the 1970s to the early 2000s (including Reiner et al.), looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders (penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation). It found that 78% of those males raised as females were living as females.<ref>Saraswat, A., Weinand, J. and Safer, J., 2015. Evidence supporting the biologic nature of gender identity. Endocrine Practice, 21(2), pp.199-204.</ref> A minority of those raised as female later switched to male. However, none of the males raised as male switched their gender identity. Those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women. The study's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature. Rebelo et al. argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors.<ref>Rebelo, Ethelwyn, Christopher P. Szabo, and Graeme Pitcher. "Gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development: A case report and discussion from South Africa."

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote the differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity.

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.<ref name="Oswalt"/> Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.<ref name="Kane">{{cite book|last=Spade|first=Joan|url=https://archive.org/details/kaleidoscopeofge0000unse_c1n2/page/177|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|date=2010|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/kaleidoscopeofge0000unse_c1n2/page/177 177–84]}}</ref> However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.<ref name=Kane /> Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,<ref name=Kane /> with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."<ref name=Kane />

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus is born to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.<ref name="Ghosh"/> Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.<ref name="Halpern">{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|year=2015|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–42|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmc=4945126|pmid=27445431}}</ref>

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern<ref name="Halpern" /> it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning—one's personal experience of one's own gender<ref name="MorrowMessinger"/><ref name="Boles101">Boles, 2013. p. 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."</ref>—sometime in the 1960s.<ref name="GID">"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid-1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.<ref name="Padawer">{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.<ref name=myers/> In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freud|first1=Sigmund|year=1931|title=Female Sexuality|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud|volume=21|page=229}}</ref>

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna|title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature|publisher=[[Free Association Books]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0-415-90386-8|location=London|page=133|author-link=Donna Haraway}}</ref><ref>[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008</ref>

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|isbn=978-0415389556|location=London|pages=front/backmatter|author-link=Judith Butler}}</ref>

==Present views==
===Medical field===

[[Transgender]] people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|year=2002|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html|journal=Clinical Child Psychology & Psychiatry|volume=7|issue=3|pages=320–34|doi=10.1177/1359104502007003002}}</ref>

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:<ref>"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today."

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.<ref name="Historical Note">{{cite journal|last1=Zucker|first1=KJ|last2=Spitzer|first2=RL|date=Jan–Feb 2005|title=Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,<ref name="Historical Note"/> although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."<ref>[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''</ref> and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."<ref>The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''</ref> Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]].

{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}

[[Kathleen Stock]] has written that because gender identity is based on a person's feelings, it is detached from both a person's sex and their gender (in the socially constructed sense). Stock also argues that because the concept of gender identity rarely comes up outside the context of [[gender dysphoria]], "it would seem false to say that everyone has one".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stock|first1=Kathleen|date=1 July 2019|title=Can you Change Your Gender?|url=https://medium.com/@kathleenstock/can-you-change-your-gender-7b0c469e0b4b|journal=The Philosopher|issn=0967-6074|accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref>

==Measurement==
No objective measurement or imaging of the human body exists for gender identity, as gender identity is part of one's subjective experience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dahlen |first1=Sara |title=De-sexing the Medical Record? An Examination of Sex Versus Gender Identity in the General Medical Council’s Trans Healthcare Ethical Advice |journal=The New Bioethics |date=2 January 2020 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=38–52 |doi=10.1080/20502877.2020.1720429 |quote=No genetic marker, biochemical test, brain imaging, or objective measurement exists in medical practice for gender identity, which is itself of an unknown aetiology (NHS 2016, Bizic et al. 2018, Gerritse et al. 2018, Bewley et al. 2019). The central claim rests on a consistent declarative statement of the trans patient’s subjective experience of self-hood. Therefore, we cannot prove or disprove a gender identity. Gender identity is a deeply held, spiritually significant, personal belief that can neither be confirmed nor rebutted by external evidence and biological data.}}</ref> However, numerous methods for assessing gender identity exist, including questionnaire-based, interview-based and task-based assessments. These have varying effect sizes among a number of specific sub-populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zucker |first1=Kenneth J. |title=Measurement of Psychosexual Differentiation |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |date=August 2005 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=375–388 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4336-7}}</ref> Gender identity measures have been applied in clinical assessment studies of people with [[gender dysphoria]] or [[intersex]] conditions.

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Non-binary gender|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''[[non-binary gender|non-binary]]'' or ''genderqueer''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In [[Samoan culture]], or [[Fa'asamoa|Faʻa Samoa]], [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.<ref>Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa|Samoans]] and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}</ref> Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|date=May 2003|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=417–32|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014}}</ref>

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}

''Hijras'' are officially recognized as [[third gender]] in the Indian subcontinent,<ref>{{harvnb|Shaw|Barbour|Duncan|Freehling-Burton|2017}}, {{harvnb|Bevan|2016|p=70}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/87149/7-countries-giving-transgender-people-fundamental-rights-the-u-s-still-won-t|title=7 Countries Giving Transgender People Fundamental Rights the U.S. Still Won't|work=mic.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}<br>{{cite web|url=http://pandeia.eu/region/inter/hijras-and-bangladesh-the-creation-of-a-third-gender/|title=Hijras and Bangladesh: The creation of a third gender|date=2 December 2013|work=pandeia.eu|accessdate=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705033013/http://pandeia.eu/region/inter/hijras-and-bangladesh-the-creation-of-a-third-gender/|archive-date=5 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras have a recorded history in the Indian subcontinent since antiquity, as suggested by the [[Kama Sutra]]. Many ''hijras'' live in well-defined and organised all-''hijra'' communities, led by a [[guru]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nanda|1985|loc=pp. 35–54 "The most significant relationship in the hijra community is that of the ''guru'' (master, teacher) and ''chela'' (disciple)."}}<br>{{harvnb|Cohen|1995|loc="Hijras are organized into households with a hijra guru as head, into territories delimiting where each household can dance and demand money from merchants"}}</ref> These communities have consisted over generations of those who are in abject poverty or who have been rejected by or fled their family of origin.{{sfn|Nanda|1999|loc=p. 116 "None of the hijra narratives I recorded supports the widespread belief in India that hijras recruit their membership by making successful claims on intersex infants. Instead, it appears that most hijras join the community in their youth, either out of a desire to more fully express their feminine gender identity, under the pressure of poverty, because of ill-treatment by parents and peers for feminine behavior, after a period of homosexual prostitution or for a combination of these reasons."}} Many work as [[prostitution|sex workers]] for survival.<ref name="Nanda2">{{harvnb|Nanda|1996}}</ref>

The word "''hijra''" is a [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word.<ref>{{harvnb|Reddy|2010|loc=p. 243 "By and large, the Hindi/Urdu term ''hijra'' is used more often in the north of the country, whereas the Telugu term ''kojja'' is more specific to the state of Andhra Pradesh, of which Hyderabad is the capital."}}<br>{{harvnb|Chettiar|2015|loc="The Urdu and Hindi word "hijra" may alternately be romanized as hijira, hijda, hijada, hijara, hijrah and is pronounced "heejra" or "heejda";}}</ref> It has traditionally been translated into English as "eunuch" or "[[hermaphrodite]]", where "the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition".{{sfn|Nanda|1999}} However, in general hijras are born male, only a few having been born with intersex variations.{{sfn|Nanda|1991|loc="Among thirty of my informants, only one appeared to have been born intersexed."}} Some Hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirvaan, which involves the [[Emasculation|removal of the penis, scrotum, and testicles]].<ref name="Nanda2" />

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.<ref>Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.</ref>

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
<!--section needs slight expansion-->
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archive-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>
