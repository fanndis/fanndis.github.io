==History==
===Launch===
'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s Arabic language television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web

The [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million (US$137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.

[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]
Al Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.

At the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch, [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news

Al Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.

In presenting "The opinion and the other opinion" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.

Al Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.

}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.

However controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].

===War in Afghanistan===
Al Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]], deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web

Al Jazeera's prominence rose during the war in Afghanistan because it had opened a bureau in [[Kabul]] before the war began. This gave it better access for videotaping events than other networks, which bought Al Jazeera's footage, sometimes for as much as $250,000.<ref name="books.google.com">Mohammed El-Nawawy, 2003.

The network remained dependent on government support in 2002, with a budget of $40&nbsp;million and ad revenues of about $8&nbsp;million. It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news

On 21 May 2003, Al Jazeera broadcast a three-minute clip from a tape that was obtained from Al Qaeda. The tape about Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian physician and the intellectual supporter of Al Qaeda. In the tape,&nbsp; Zawahiri mentioned the 11 September attack and more terrorism against the Western countries saying that "The Crusaders and Jews understand only the language of killing and blood. They can only be persuaded through returning coffins, devastated interests, burning towers and collapsed economies."

In September 2003, [[Tayseer Allouni]], the Al Jazeera journalist who handled to interview Osama bin Ladin several weeks later the 11 September attack was arrested by Spanish government agency. Allouni was accused of being close to [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]], eventually was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years of house arrest.

In October 2003, the managing editor of the Saudi newspaper [[Arab News]], [[John R. Bradley]] accounted that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] had told the Qatari government that "If Al Jazeera failed to reconsider its news context, the US would, in turn, have to consider its relation with Qatar."<ref>{{Cite book

===2003 Iraq War===
Before and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.

Al Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel. An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]]. There were 23 bureaux around the world and 70 foreign correspondents, with 450 journalists in all.

On 1 April 2003, a United States plane fired on Al Jazeera's [[Baghdad]] bureau, killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub.<ref>{{cite news

Increasingly, Al Jazeera Media Network's exclusive interviews and other footage are being rebroadcast in American, British, and other [[western media outlets]] such as CNN and the BBC. In January 2003, the BBC announced that it had signed an agreement with Al Jazeera for sharing facilities and information, including news footage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2668007.stm BBC in news deal with Arabic TV] ''BBC News'', published 17 January 2003</ref>

Al Jazeera's availability (via satellite) throughout the Middle East changed the television landscape of the region. Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' ("The Opposite Direction"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name="boot">{{cite web

Some observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[https://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>

<blockquote>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.

In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.</blockquote>

Al Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world "operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated in January 2011: "The protests rocking the Arab world this week have one thread uniting them: Al Jazeera,&nbsp;... whose aggressive coverage has helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next." The newspaper quoted Marc Lynch, a professor of Middle East Studies at [[George Washington University]]: "They did not cause these events, but it's almost impossible to imagine all this happening without Al Jazeera."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28jazeera.html "Seizing a Moment, Al Jazeera Galvanizes Arab Frustration"], ''The New York Times'', 27 January 2011</ref>

With Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including [[Adel Iskandar]] have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of "[[alternative media]]."<ref>{{cite web

==Expansion==
In 2011, Al Jazeera Media Network launched [[Al Jazeera Balkans]], which is based in [[Sarajevo]] and serves the ex-[[Yugoslavia]] region in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The look and feel of the network is similar to Al Jazeera English.

Al Jazeera launched a [[Al Jazeera Türk|Turkish-language news website]] in 2014; it was shut down on 3 May 2017.<ref>{{cite web

The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C.

Al Jazeera launched an English language channel, originally called '''Al Jazeera International''', in 2006. Among its staff were journalists hired from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Nightline]] and other top news outfits. [[Josh Rushing]],<ref>{{cite web

There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007. Today, evidence of U.S. antipathy at the Arabic network has dissipated significantly, though not entirely, several analysts say.<ref>{{cite web

==Controversies ==
{{Main|Al Jazeera controversies and criticism}}
While Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have been criticised and involved in a number of controversies.

===Bahrain===
In May 2000, Bahrain banned Al Jazeera's broadcasts due to the channel's comments about Bahrain's municipal elections, labelling it as "serving Zionism".<ref name=der29july>{{cite news

''[[Shariah]] and Life'' (''al-Sharīʿa wa al-Ḥayāh'') is an Al Jazeera Arabic show with an estimated audience of 60 million worldwide and stars Muslim preacher [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], who is described as "Islam's Spiritual '[[Dear Abby]]'".<ref name="Influential 500">No.9 Sheikh Dr Yusuf al Qaradawi, Head of the International Union of Muslim Scholars – "The 500 most influential Muslims in the world 2009", Prof John Esposito and Prof Ibrahim Kalin – Edmund A.

In September 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Al Jazeera's editorial independence came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped in at the last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the [[Syrian civil war]] include a speech by the leader of Qatar, [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]]. Although the order came from internal editorial staff, staff members protested that the speech was not the most important aspect of the debate, and that it was a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention.<ref name="guardianindep">{{cite news

* On the 4th of April 2010 [[TRT Arabi]], the Arabic speaking channel of the Turkish national public broadcaster, was launched leading to a more consolidated role of Turkey in the Arab world.
* When [[Euronews]] started broadcasting its programs in Arabic on 12 July 2008, it entered into competition with Al Jazeera. Arabic is the eighth language in which Euronews is broadcast, after English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.
* Since the launch of [[Al Jazeera English]], Al Jazeera directly competes with [[BBC World]] and [[CNN International]], as do a growing number of other [[international broadcasting|international broadcasters]] such as [[Deutsche Welle]], [[France 24]], [[NHK World]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[Press TV]], [[CGTN]], [[TRT World]] and [[PTV World]].
