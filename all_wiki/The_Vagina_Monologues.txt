'''''The Vagina Monologues''''' is an episodic play written by [[Eve Ensler]] which developed and premiered at [[HERE Arts Center]], [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in New York and was followed by an [[Off-Broadway]] run in 1996 at  [[Westside Theatre]].  The play explores consensual and nonconsensual sexual experiences, body image, genital mutilation, direct and indirect encounters with reproduction, vaginal care, menstrual periods, [[sex work]], and several other topics through the eyes of women with various ages, races, sexualities, and other differences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eveensler.org/plays/the-vagina-monologues/|title=THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES|website=EVE ENSLER|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref>

Charles Isherwood of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the play "probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/theater/03ishe.html|title=The Culture Project and Plays That Make a Difference|date=3 September 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

In 2018, [[The New York Times]] stated "No recent hour of theater has had a greater impact worldwide" in an article "The Great Work Continues: The 25 Best American Plays Since ‘Angels in America'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/31/theater/best-25-plays.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/31/theater/best-25-plays.html|title=The Great Work Continues: The 25 Best American Plays Since 'Angels in America'|date=31 May 2018|access-date=2 May 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Ensler originally starred in both the HERE premiere and in the first off-Broadway production, which was produced by [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], Nina Essman, Dan Markley, [[The Araca Group]], [[Willa Shalit]] and the West Side Theater.  When she left the play, it was recast with three celebrity monologists. The play has been staged internationally, and a television version featuring Ensler was produced by cable TV channel [[HBO]]. In 1998, Ensler and others, including Willa Shalit, a producer of the Westside Theatre production, launched V-Day, a global non-profit movement that has raised over {{US$|100{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} for groups working to end [[violence against women]] and girls [[sexual violence|anti-violence]] through benefits of ''The Vagina Monologues''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2014/02/one-billion-rising-for-v-day|title=We found it: The absolute best thing to do on Valentine's Day.|author=Glamour Magazine|work=Glamour|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, Ensler was awarded the [[Isabelle Stevenson Award]] at the 65th Tony Awards, which recognizes an individual from the theater community who has made a substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of humanitarian, social service, or charitable organizations. Ensler was given this award for her creation of the non-profit, V-Day movement which raises money and educates the public about violence against all women and girls and efforts to stop it.

== History ==
{{See also|Performances of The Vagina Monologues}}

Eve Ensler wrote the first draft of the monologues in 1996 (there have been several revisions since) following interviews she conducted with 200 women about their views on sex, relationships, and violence against women. The interviews began as casual conversations with her friends, who then brought up anecdotes they themselves had been told by other friends; this began a continuing chain of referrals. In an interview with Women.com, Ensler said that her fascination with vaginas began because of "growing up in a violent society".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/ensler/vm/qna.html |title=Random House |work=randomhouse.com |access-date=9 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415065935/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/ensler/vm/qna.html |archive-date=15 April 2015 }}</ref> "Women's empowerment is deeply connected to their sexuality." She also stated, "I'm obsessed with women being violated and raped, and with [[incest]]. All of these things are deeply connected to our vaginas."

Ensler wrote the piece to "celebrate the vagina". Ensler states that in 1998, the purpose of the piece changed from a celebration of vaginas and femininity to a movement to stop violence against women. This was the start of the V-Day movement<ref name="vday.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/about.html#.WPozHWkrJaQ|title=About V-Day|website=V-Day|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> which has continued strong every year since, has turned into a worldwide phenomenon, and a very successful non-profit organization.<ref name="vday.org"/>

The play opened at [[HERE Arts Center]] in [[New York City]] on October 3, 1996, with a limited run that was scheduled to end November 15 but was extended to December 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/vagina-monologues-extended-at-here-com-69010|title=Vagina Monologues Extended at HERE|date=10 December 1996|website=Playbill|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/HERE-Honors-Tony-Winner-Eve-Ensler-and-Star-Attorney-Bethany-Haynes-At-25th-Anniversary-Gala-20180524|title=HERE Honors Tony-Winner Eve Ensler and Star Attorney Bethany Haynes At 25th Anniversary Gala|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> The play gained popularity through a sold-out performances, media coverage and word of mouth. "In 2001, V-Day sold out New York’s Madison Square Garden with more than seventy actors performing. The evening raised $1 million raised for groups working to end violence against women and girls." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://womenintheworld.com/2015/05/25/happy-birthday-eve-ensler/|title=Happy Birthday, Eve Ensler|date=25 May 2015|website=womenintheworld.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

"After "The Vagina Monologues" debuted in 1996, it quickly became a hit. Soon, Eve Ensler's episodic play had graduated from off-off Broadway to Madison Square Garden to college stages the world over."<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-play-that-hopes-to-smash-the-stigma-surrounding-mental-illness/2019/04/26/dcd13a46-65ee-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html</ref>

In 2004, the first all-transgender performance of ''The Vagina Monologues'' was held, resulting in the creation of the documentary [[Beautiful Daughters (2006 Documentary)|''Beautiful Daughters'' (2006)]]'','' which displays the hardships the all-transgender cast faced with the production. The monologues were read by eighteen notable transgender women, and a new monologue revolving around the experiences and struggles of transgender women was included.<ref>[http://www.baltimoregaylife.com/item/451-vagina-monologues Baltimoregaylife.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806183929/http://www.baltimoregaylife.com/item/451-vagina-monologues |date=6 August 2012 }}</ref>

The play was also adapted into a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] play called ''Yonichya Maneechya Gujagoshti'' by feminist writer-activist Vandana Khare in the year 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/apr/230409-Mumbai-News-Vagina-Monologues-Marathi-version-vagina-Marathi-langauge-Mumbai-stage.htm|title=What's vagina in Marathi?|work=mid-day.com|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

Gabriela Youth, the one and only national democratic mass organization for young women in the Philippines also adapted the play into a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] theatrical show called "Ang Usapang Puke" with its student members from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in the year 2018.

== Plot summary ==
''The Vagina Monologues'' is made up of various personal monologues read by a diverse group of women. Originally, [[Eve Ensler]] performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses, and more recent versions featuring a different actress for every role.  Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as [[Human sexual activity|sex]], [[sex work]], [[body image]], [[love]], [[rape]], [[menstruation]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[masturbation]], [[childbirth|birth]], [[orgasm]], the various common names for the [[vagina]] or simply as a physical aspect of the body.  A recurring theme throughout the piece is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.

'''Some monologues include''':

* ''I Was Twelve, My Mother Slapped Me'': a chorus describing many young women's and girls' first menstrual period.
* ''Hair,'' a piece in which a woman discusses how her husband had cheated on her because she had refused to shave her pubic hair, ultimately allowing her to see that it should not matter whether or not she chooses to shave, and that "hair is there for a reason".
* ''My Angry Vagina'', in which a woman humorously rants about injustices wrought against the vagina, such as [[tampons]], [[douche]]s, and the tools used by [[Obstetrics and gynecology|OB/GYNs]].
* ''My Vagina Was My Village'', a monologue compiled from the testimonies of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] women subjected to [[rape camps]].
* ''The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could'', in which a woman recalls memories of traumatic sexual experiences in her childhood and a self-described "positive healing" sexual experience in her adolescent years with an older woman. This particular skit has sparked outrage, numerous controversies and criticisms due to its content, among which the most famous is the Robert Swope controversy (see below). In the original version she is 13, but later versions changed her age to 16. It also originally included the line, "If it was rape, it was a good rape", which was removed from later versions.
* ''Reclaiming Cunt'', a piece narrated by a woman who illustrates that the word "[[cunt]]" itself is an empowering word when reclaimed, despite its history of disconcerting connotations.
* ''The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy'', in which a sex worker for women discusses the intriguing details of her career and her love of giving women pleasure. In several performances it often comes at the end of the play, literally climaxing with a vocal demonstration of a "triple orgasm".
* ''Because He Liked to Look At It'', in which a woman describes how she had thought her vagina was ugly and had been embarrassed to even think about it, but changed her mind because of a sexual experience with a man named Bob who liked to spend hours looking at it.
* ''I Was There in the Room'', a monologue in which Eve Ensler describes the birth of her granddaughter in graphic detail and positive wonder.

Every year a new monologue is added to highlight a current issue affecting women around the world. In 2003, for example, Ensler wrote a new monologue, called ''Under the [[Burqa]]'', about the plight of women in [[Afghanistan]] under [[Taliban]] rule. In 2004, Ensler also wrote a monologue called ''They Beat the Girl Out of My Boy. . .Or So They Tried'' after interviewing a group of women whose gender identity differed from their assigned gender at birth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pflagcda.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/they-beat-the-girl-out-of-my-boy-or-so-they-tried/|title=They Beat the Girl Out of My Boy… Or So They Tried|last=S|first=Jamie|date=2014-04-10|website=PFLAG Coeur d'Alene|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> Every [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]] thousands of local benefit productions are staged to raise funds for local groups, shelters, and crisis centers working to end violence against women.

V-Day is a non-profit [[501(c)(3) organization]]<ref name="vday.org" /> that distributes funds to national and international grassroot organizations and programs that work to stop violence against girls and women.<ref name="vday.org" /> ''The Vagina Monologues'' is the [[cornerstone]] of the V-Day movement, whose participants stage benefit performances of the show and/or host other related events in their communities. Such events take place worldwide each year between 1 February and 30 April, many on college campuses as well.

An article in ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'' by Christine M. Cooper begins by applauding ''The Vagina Monologues'' for benefit performances done within the first six years (1998–2004). These performances raised over $20 million, 85 percent of which was donated to grassroots organizations that fight against violence towards women.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Christine M. |year=2007|title=Worrying about Vaginas: Feminism and Eve Ensler's ''The Vagina Monologues'' |journal=Signs |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=727–758 |doi=10.1086/499084 |doi-access=free |issn=1545-6943 |jstor=10.1086/499084 |jstor-access=free}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

=== Criticism from feminists ===

''The Vagina Monologues'' has been criticized by some within the feminist movement, including [[Sex-positive feminism|pro-sex feminists]] and [[Individualist feminism|individualist feminists]].<ref>Sommers, Christina Hoff. (2008), [http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf What’s Wrong and What’s Right with Contemporary Feminism?, Hamilton College. Retrieved 2014-01-27.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302081135/http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf |date=2 March 2012 }}.</ref> Sex-positive feminist [[Betty Dodson]], author of several books about female sexuality, saw the play as having a narrow and restrictive view of sexuality. Dodson's main concern seemed to be the lack of the term "clitoris" throughout the play. She believes that the play sends a message that the vagina is the main sex organ, not the clitoris. There is also criticism of ''The Vagina Monologues'' about its conflation of vaginas as women, more specifically for the message of the play that women are their vaginas, as Susan E. Bell and Susan M. Reverby argue, "Generations of feminists have argued that we are more than our bodies, more than a vagina or 'the sex'. Yet, TVM re-inscribes women's politics in our bodies, indeed in our vaginas alone".<ref name="sciencedirect.com">{{Cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Susan E. |last2=Reverby |first2=Susan M. |year=2005 |title=Vaginal Politics: Tensions and Possibilities in ''The Vagina Monologues'' |journal=Women's Studies International Forum |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=430–444 |doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.005 |issn=0277-5395}}</ref> The focus on women finding themselves through their vaginas, many say, seems more like a Second Wave consciousness-raising group rather than a ground-breaking, inter-sectional, Third Wave cornerstone.<ref name="sciencedirect.com" />

=== Criticism for being anti-transgender ===
Because of the title and content of ''The Vagina Monologues'' being body-centric, American University chose to change their production of it to a new show including all-original pieces, giving the production the name of ''Breaking Ground Monologues.''<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8290%7Ctitle=AU|title=Campus Reform|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}</ref> Although members of American University's Women's Initiative believe that the show ''was'' revolutionary in the 1990s, they concluded that equating having a vagina with being a woman is not an accurate display of womanhood today, suggesting that ''The Vagina Monologues'' continues to perpetuate the [[gender binary]] and erase the identity of those who are [[genderqueer]].<ref name=":0" />

In 2015 a student organization at [[Mount Holyoke College]] canceled its annual performance of the play for being, in its opinion, insufficiently inclusive of transgender people. "At its core", Erin Murphy, the president of the school's theater group, said, "the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman. … Gender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions, and many of us who have participated in the show have grown increasingly uncomfortable presenting material that is inherently reductionist and exclusive." The traditionally all-female college had begun admitting students designated male at birth who identified as female the previous year, but the college denied that had anything to do with the decision to discontinue the annual performances of the play.<ref name="HuffPost MHC piece">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/16/vagina-monologues-mount-holyoke_n_6487302.html|title=Mount Holyoke Cancels 'Vagina Monologues' For Not Being Inclusive Enough|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=6 January 2015|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Criticism for being colonial ===

Kim Hall, a professor of Philosophy at Appalachian State University, further criticizes the play, particularly the sections dealing with women in [[Developing country|developing countries]], for contributing to "colonialist conceptions of non-Western women,"<ref name="hall">Kim Q. Hall, "Queerness, Disability and ''The Vagina Monologues''," Hypatia – Volume 20, Number 1, Winter 2005, pp. 99-119</ref> such as the piece "My Vagina Was My Village." Although she supports frank discussions about sex, Hall rescales many of the same critiques leveled by feminists of color at [[white privilege]] among [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]]: "premature white feminist assumptions and celebrations of a global 'sisterhood.'"<ref name="hall" />

In ''The Vagina Monologues,'' depictions of sexual violence are told through mostly non-white and non-US centered stories, as Srimati Basu states, "While a few of these forms of violence, such as sexual assault and denigration of genitalia, are depicted in U.S. locations, violence is the primary register through which 'the global' is evoked, the main lens for looking outside the United States. These global locations serve to signify the terror that is used to hold the laughter in balance, to validate the seriousness of the enterprise, while the 'vagina' pieces are more directly associated with pleasure and sexuality and set in the United States".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Basu|first=Srimati|date=2010|title=V Is for Veil, V Is for Ventriloquism: Global Feminisms in The Vagina Monologues|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.31.1.31|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=31–62|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.31.1.31}}</ref>

In 2013, [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] V-Day decided to stage the play with a cast entirely of non-white women because of the misrepresentation. That decision, too, was controversial.<ref name="2013 Columbia production">{{cite news|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2013/10/04/dialogue-about-vagina-monologues|title=Dialogue about ''The Vagina Monologues''|date=4 October 2013|newspaper=[[Columbia Spectator]]|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Social conservative criticism ===

The play has also been criticized by [[social conservatives]], such as the [[American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property]] (TFP) and the [[Network of Enlightened Women]]. The TFP denounced it as "a piece replete with sexual encounters, lust, graphic descriptions of masturbation and [[lesbian]] behavior",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tfp.org/student_action/activities/protests/monologues_protest_2004.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218042350/http://tfp.org/student_action/activities/protests/monologues_protest_2004.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=18 December 2004 | title=Tradition, Family, and Property | author=Editor | work=tfp.org | access-date=9 March 2016 }}</ref> urging students and parents to protest. Following TFP and other protests, performances were cancelled at sixteen [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[college]]s. [[Saint Louis University]] made the decision not to endorse the 2007 production, claiming the yearly event was getting to be "redundant." The response of the university's student-led feminist organization was to continue the production at an off-campus location.

=== Robert Swope critique ===

In 2000, Robert Swope, a conservative contributor to a [[Georgetown University]] newspaper, ''[[The Hoya]]'', wrote an article critical of the play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.org/campus_reports/2000/may_2000_4.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716122336/http://www.academia.org/campus_reports/2000/may_2000_4.html|title=Applauding Rape at Georgetown|archive-date=16 July 2006|work=academia.org|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref> He suggested there was a contradiction between the promotion of rape awareness on V-Day and the monologue "The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could", in which an adult woman recalls being given alcohol and [[Statutory rape|statutorily raped]] at 13 by a 24-year-old woman<ref>http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/blog/TVMscript2006.pdf</ref> as a positive, healing experience, ending the segment with the proclamation "It was a good rape." Outcry from the play's supporters resulted in Swope's being fired from the staff of ''The Hoya'', before the piece was even run. Swope had previously criticized the play in an article he wrote entitled "Georgetown Women's Center: Indispensable Asset or Improper Expenditure?" His termination received critical [[editorial]] coverage in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefire.org/public/pdfs/d75d5567a31e160aaa92797a3259fb06.pdf?direct|title=Georgetown Exorcised by Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition |website=thefire.org|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/people/col/pagl/2000/04/05/mcmedia/index1.html Imagination unleashed in all its perverse glory – Camille Paglia – Salon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709035204/http://archive.salon.com/people/col/pagl/2000/04/05/mcmedia/index1.html |date=9 July 2008 }}</ref> ''[[National Review]]'',<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment033100c.html NR Comment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723234700/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment033100c.html |date=23 July 2008 }}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The Washington Times]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', and by Wendy McElroy of [[iFeminists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2002/0212.html|title=ifeminists.com > editorial > Take Back Valentine's Day!|work=ifeminists.net|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

Inspired by ''The Vagina Monologues'', many colleges have gone on to develop their own plays. Performances at colleges are always different, not always pre-written, and sometimes feature actors writing their own monologue.
