"'''Famous'''" is a song by American rapper [[Kanye West]], produced and co-written by fellow American hip hop artist/producer [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]]. It serves as the lead single from his seventh studio album ''[[The Life of Pablo]]'' (2016). The song features vocals from Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] and ad-libs from American hip hop artist [[Swizz Beatz]], and enlists [[music sample|samples]] of Jamaican singer [[Sister Nancy]]'s song "[[Bam Bam (song)|Bam]]" and "[[Do What You Gotta Do (Jimmy Webb song)#Nina Simone version|Do What You Gotta Do]]" by American singer [[Nina Simone]]. The single was serviced to US [[Urban contemporary|Urban]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary]] radio stations on March 28, 2016, and was confirmed for release three days before.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.idolator.com/7627869/kanye-west-rihanna-famous-life-of-pablo-tlop-single |title=Kanye West & Rihanna's "Famous" Will Be the First Single Off 'The Life of Pablo'|publisher= Idolater |accessdate= March 25, 2016 |date= March 27, 2016}}</ref> It was sent to Italian [[Contemporary hit radio]] stations on April 15 by [[Universal Music Group|Universal]].

Upon its release, "Famous" was met with both critical acclaim and scrutiny for a controversial lyrical reference to American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], partially in relation to West's [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards controversy|interruption]] of her [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards|2009 VMA]] acceptance speech. After West claimed to have obtained Swift's approval over the criticized lyric, Swift denied the claim, criticizing West and denouncing the lyric as "misogynistic" in a statement. Several months later, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] released a video capturing a conversation between Swift and West in which Swift appears to approve a portion of the lyric.<ref name="vox">{{cite web|last1=Abad-Santos|first1=Alex|title=Kim Kardashian's Taylor Swift-Kanye West Snapchat story, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210858/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-snapchat-kanye-west|website=[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]|accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="verge">{{cite web|last1=Jamieson Cox and Matthew Davis|title=Kim Kardashian used Snapchat to prove Taylor Swift was lying about Kanye West's Famous|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/17/12210852/kim-kardashian-snapchat-taylor-swift-kanye-west-famous|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> In 2020, a longer video surfaced, appearing to show West did not tell Swift a lyric that she subsequently objected to.<ref name="VarietyTranscript">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-kanye-west-phone-call-leaks-read-full-transcript-1203541363/|title=Taylor Swift and Kanye West's 2016 Phone Call Leaks: Read the Full Transcript|last=Willman|first=Chris|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 21, 2020|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2016, West released a music video for "Famous" depicting wax figures of West, [[Taylor Swift|Swift]], [[Kim Kardashian|Kardashian]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Anna Wintour]], [[Rihanna]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Ray J]], [[Amber Rose]], [[Caitlyn Jenner]] and [[Bill Cosby]] all sleeping nude in a shared bed. It was released to a polarized response. The wax figures used in the video were later exhibited as a sculpture. The song was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
"Famous" was universally acclaimed by music critics. For the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', [[Greg Kot]] called the song "an example of just how brilliant and infuriating West can be at the same time", noting its controversial Swift-referencing lyric while going on to praise the production and [[Rihanna]]'s guest vocals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|author-link=Greg Kot|year=2016|issue=February 16|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/kot/ct-kanye-west-pablo-review-ent-0217-20160215-column.html|title=Kanye West's bewildering, frustrating 'Pablo'|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Jayson Greene of [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] wrote that the controversial lyric "feels like a piece of bathroom graffiti made to purposefully reignite the most racially-charged rivalry in 21st-century pop".<ref name="Greene">{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Jayson|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/|title=Kanye West: The Life of Pablo|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215235527/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/|archive-date=February 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Alexis Petridis]] described the song's position on ''The Life of Pablo'' as being "a flatly fantastic piece of music that may be the best thing on the album".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=Kanye West: The Life of Pablo review – 'You can see why his immodesty rubs people up the wrong way'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-review-you-can-see-why-his-immodesty-rubs-people-up-the-wrong-way|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref>

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' staff named "Famous" one of the best songs of the year 2016 and wrote of it that:

<blockquote>
Kanye West is a genius musician and a world-class provocateur, and "Famous" is yet another piece of proof those two qualities are inextricably intertwined. He weaves ''The Life of Pablo''{{'}}s hardest-knocking beat, chords cribbed from [[Nina Simone]], and [[Sister Nancy]]'s reggae classic "Bam Bam" into a vibrant tapestry, and he uses all of that beauty to crack open his long-simmering spat with the biggest pop star on the planet. The court of public opinion won't ever reach a verdict on Taylor [Swift] v. Kanye — did she consent to being mentioned? Did she double-cross Kanye? At least we can all agree that "Famous" captures West in all of his complicated, vital glory.<ref name="time">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Jamieson|title=The Top 10 Best Songs|url=http://time.com/4575319/top-10-best-songs-2016/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}</ref>

The song includes a controversial lyric in reference to West's [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards|2009 VMA]] acceptance speech and its aftermath: <blockquote>
"For all my [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] niggas that know me best<br>I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex<br>Why?

In a June 2016 interview with ''[[GQ]]'', West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] claimed the couple possessed a video recording of West's phone call with Swift, in which Swift could be heard amiably discussing and approving the lyrics.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> She clarified that Swift's camp had threatened legal action should the video be released, and argued that "I swear, my husband gets so much shit for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved."<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Matthew|title=Kim Kardashian Says Taylor Swift "Totally Approved" Kanye's "Famous" (And They Have It on Video)|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/66148-kim-kardashian-says-taylor-swift-totally-approved-kanyes-famous-and-they-have-it-on-video/|website=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> In July 2016, Kardashian posted a recording of the phone conversation online, in which Swift can allegedly be heard approving West's lyric, describing it as a "compliment" and a show of friendship.<ref>https://pitchfork.com/news/66880-kim-kardashian-reveals-taylor-swift-signed-off-on-kanyes-infamous-famous-line/</ref><ref>https://www.gq.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-gq-cover-story</ref> Due to the release of this video, Swift has been accused of lying about approving the lyric. In the edited video, Swift appears to say: <blockquote>Yeah, go with whatever line makes you feel better, it's obviously very [[tongue-in-cheek]] either way. And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice [...] I don't think anyone would listen to that and be like 'that's a real [[Diss track|diss]], she must be crying.' You've gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you experienced it. You honestly didn't know who I was before that.

[...] If people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘Look, he called me and told me about the line.'<ref name="p4k"/></blockquote>
West can be heard telling Swift, "I just had a responsibility to you as a friend, you know, and thanks for being so cool about it."<ref name="p4k"/> The recording of the call without Swift's consent was illegal and broke Californian [[telephone call recording laws|telephone call recording law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/18/was-that-recording-of-kanye-west-and-taylor-swift-illegal/|title=Was that recording of Kanye West and Taylor Swift illegal?|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=March 23, 2020|website=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Andrea Peterson}}</ref> Following the video's release, Swift released a statement stating "being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination", claiming West did not tell her she would be referred to as "that bitch".<ref name="p4k"/>

On the same day as the video's release, Kardashian tweeted about National Snake Day, saying "They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍". This tweet was interpreted as being aimed at Swift, and the [[hashtag]] #TaylorSwiftIsASnake became trending. In September 2016, Swift started using a filter created by [[Instagram]] CEO [[Kevin Systrom]] to automatically delete comments using the snake emoji on her profile. By August 2017, Swift was using snakes in promotional material for her 2017 album ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]''. They were worked into merchandise, the music video for its lead single "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]", and her 2018 [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]].<ref name="CNN">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/taylor-swift-snakes/index.html|title=Taylor Swift and snakes: The backstory|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=22 August 2017|accessdate=1 March 2018|author=Lisa Respers France}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7934297/taylor-swift-the-snake-history-kim-kanye-instagram|title=The History of Taylor Swift & the Snake|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=1 March 2018|author=Alexandra Holterman}}</ref>

In March 2020, a leaked video of a telephone conversation between West and Swift surfaced, in which West told Swift about the lines "I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex" and "made her famous", which Swift objected to, telling West she "pulled 7 million off ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''" before the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards|2009 VMA]] incident.
