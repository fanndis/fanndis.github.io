'''Eduardo Cosentino da Cunha''' (born 29 September 1958), is a Brazilian politician and radio host, born in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

== Personal life ==
Born in Rio de Janeiro on 29 September 1958, Eduardo Cunha is the son of Elcy Teixeira da Cunha and Elza Cosentino. As his mother descended from Italian immigrants from the town of [[Castelluccio Inferiore]] in the region of [[Basilicata]], he also holds Italian citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/pf-apreende-copia-de-passaporte-italiano-de-eduardo-cunha/ |title=PF apreende cópia de 'passaporte italiano' de Eduardo Cunha |date=16 December 2015 |website=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|publisher=Grupo Abril |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> When he was 14 years old, he began working part-time as an insurance broker. Later, he worked as an auditor at the firm [[Arthur Andersen]], from 1978 to 1980.

Cunha has four children. He is currently married to journalist [[Cláudia Cruz]].

== Political views ==
Eduardo Cunha is a conservative [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]]. He seeks to ban abortion, increase marijuana penalties, and further restrict homosexual activity. As an evangelist, Cunha has proposed legislation titled The Law of [[Heterophobia]] (in response to the Law of [[Homophobia]]). The law demands a prison sentence of one to three years for anyone who forbids entry to a heterosexual to any public or private property, levies special rates at hotels or restricts the public display of affection.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Salvador|first1=Susana|title=The Defender of Heterosexuals|publisher=DN Gente|date= 9 April 2010}}</ref>{{update|date=January 2017}}

== Political career ==
=== Elections with PDS and PMDB ===
His first contact with politics was working on the campaigns of {{ILL|Eliseu Resende|pt}}, a candidate for state government{{clarify|date=April 2017}} with the Social Democratic Party (PDS) in the 1982 election, and [[Moreira Franco]], a PMDB candidate for Rio de Janeiro government{{clarify|date=April 2017}}, in the 1986 election.<ref name="Biography of Representatives" />  When [[Anthony Garotinho]] was elected Governor of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1999, he appointed Francisco Silva as Secretary of Housing with Cunha as his deputy. However, Cunha was in office for just over six months, when he was forced to resign due to allegations of irregularities in no-bid contracts and favoring shell companies.<ref name="folha01">{{cite web|title=Garotinho afasta presidente da Cehab|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/brasil/fc1104200024.htm|website=Folha de S.Paulo
|publisher=Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> Then in 2001, the [[Court of Audit]] confirmed that there were indeed various irregularities in the bids of these [[shell company|shell companies]], including the adulteration of the clearance certificate from state taxes.<ref name="folha01"/>

=== State Representative (2001–2002) ===
With Garotinho's support, in 2001 Cunha assumed a vacant state representative's seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro]] (ALERJ), which guaranteed him immunity against the public prosecutor's investigations. He was then elected with 101,495 votes in the follow-up campaign.<ref name="Election Results">{{cite web|title=Election Results|url=http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/eleicoes/2002/result_blank.htm|publisher=Federal Election Commission|access-date=9 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184417/http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/eleicoes/2002/result_blank.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Federal Representative (2003–2016) ===
[[File:Presidência do Senado (17316399604).jpg|thumb|Cunha holds a joint press conference with the President of the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]], [[Renan Calheiros]], and other Congress members, 21 May 2015.]]

Cunha joined the Brazilian [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] on 1 February 2003, representing [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. He was elected in the 2006 elections to the House with 130,773 votes. He was re-elected in 2010 through the PMDB with 150,616 votes.<ref name="Election Results"/> To the [[superior Electoral Court|TSE]] (Brazilian Election Commission), Cunha reported receiving R$4.76 million in donations for the 2010 campaign, of which R$500,000 came from the construction company [[Camargo Corrêa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaign Financial Disclosures|url=http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/eleicoes/2002/result_blank.htm|publisher=Federal Election Commission|access-date=9 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184417/http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/eleicoes/2002/result_blank.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2013, Cunha was elected leader of the [[PMDB]] in the House. The following year, he filed a complaint with the [[Supreme Federal Court]] against now-Congressman [[Anthony Garotinho]] (PR-RJ) for libel and defamation. On his blog Garotinho had referred to Cunha as a "deputy lobbyist".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} House aides and lobbyists with access to PMDB parliamentarians reported that Eduardo Cunha recorded on an agenda{{clarify|date=April 2017}} a list of companies - mainly linked to energy, telecommunications and construction - who benefited from parliamentary action. Still, later that year, he was re-elected for another term, obtaining 232,708 votes (the third-most votes received in the [[State of Rio de Janeiro]]).<ref name="Election Results"/>

Cunha was indicted in [[Operation Car Wash]] (''Operação Lava Jato''), the [[scandal]] involving state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]]. Prosecutors say he "took as much as US$40 million in bribes for himself and his allies, plundering Petrobras, the government-controlled oil company, while laundering money through an evangelical megachurch."<ref name="nytimes01" /> On these charges, prosecutors requested "a potential sentence of 184 years in prison".<ref name="nytimes01" /> During this period, Cunha led the movement to impeach President [[Dilma Rousseff]] for  manipulating figures in government accounts. He was suspended as speaker of the lower house by Brazil's supreme court on 5 May 2016, because of allegations he had attempted to intimidate members of congress, and obstructed the ongoing Car Wash investigation into alleged bribe-taking.<ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br" /><ref name="theguardian.com"/> In September 2016 the lower house voted with a large majority to strip Cunha of his seat in the lower house and to ban him from politics for eight years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/brazils-former-speaker-cunha-banned-from-politics-for-eight-years-over-swiss-accounts/a-19546547|title=Brazil's former speaker Cunha banned from politics for eight years over Swiss accounts|work=Deutsche Welle|date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Once removed from office Cunha was no longer immune to criminal prosecution.

=== Arrest, sentencing, and pending litigation (2016–present)===
