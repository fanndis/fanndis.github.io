'''Squatting''' is the action of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied area of land or a [[building]], usually residential, that the '''squatter''' does not [[Land ownership and tenure|own, rent or otherwise have lawful permission to use]]. Author [[Robert Neuwirth]] suggested in 2004 that there were one billion squatters globally.

Squatting occurs worldwide and tends to occur when people who are poor and homeless find empty buildings or land to occupy for housing. It has a long history, broken down by country below. In [[developing countries]] and [[least developed countries]], [[shanty towns]] often begin as squatted settlements. There are [[pavement dwellers]] and [[slums]] in India and South Africa, represented by groups such as [[Slum Dwellers International]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. In Hong Kong there are [[rooftop slum]]s. In Brazil, there are [[favelas]] and large social movements of thousands of people such as the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (MTST) and the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST). Squatted settlements are known in Spanish-speaking countries under terms such as [[villa miseria]] (Argentina), [[pueblos jóvenes]] (Peru), okupas (Chile, Spain) and [[asentamiento|asentamientos irregulares]] (Guatemala, Uruguay). In Turkey the term used is [[gecekondu]].

In [[industrialized countries]], there are often squats and also political squatting movements, which can be [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]] or [[socialist]] in nature, for example in the [[Self-managed social centers in Italy|self-managed social centres of Italy]] or squats in the [[Squatting in the United States|United States]]. Oppositional movements from the 1960s and 1970s created freespaces such as [[Freetown Christiania]] in Denmark or [[Ruigoord]] in the Netherlands, and in [[Squatting in England and Wales|England and Wales]], there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters in the late 1970s. Each local situation determines the context: in Athens, Greece, there are [[Athens refugee squats|refugee squats]]; Germany has centres such as [[Rote Flora]] and [[Køpi]]; in [[Squatting in Spain|Spain]] there are many squats. Squatting has recently been [[Dutch squatting ban|criminalised in the Netherlands]] completely and in residential buildings in England and Wales.

The majority of squatting is residential in nature. As a phenomenon it tends to occur when a poor and homeless population makes use of derelict property or land through [[urban homesteading]].<ref name="Homesteaders in the Hood">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2214544/ |last=Peñalver |first=Eduardo M. |title=Homesteaders in the Hood |magazine=Slate Magazine |date=March 25, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111231/http://www.slate.com/id/2214544 |archive-date=April 9, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to author [[Robert Neuwirth]], there were over 1 billion (one in seven) squatters worldwide in 2004.

In many of the world's poorer countries, there are extensive [[slums]] or [[shanty towns]], typically built on the edges of major cities and consisting almost entirely of self-constructed housing built without the landowner's permission.<ref>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3557571 Encroachments and the Mystery of Capital.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808205056/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3557571 |date=2020-08-08 }} ''Political Economy – Development: Domestic Development Strategies eJournal.''

Squatting can be related to political movements, such as [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]], or [[socialist]]. It can be a means to [[Architectural conservation|conserve buildings]] or a [[Occupation (protest)|protest]] action. Squats can be used by local communities as [[free shops]], cafés, venues, [[pirate radio]] stations or as multi-purpose [[autonomous social centre]]s.<ref name="pruijt">{{cite journal |url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |last=Pruijt |first=Hans |title=Logic of Urban Squatting |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |pages=1–8 |date=2011 |access-date=2015-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025411/http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dutch sociologist Hans Pruijt separates types of squatters into five distinct categories:<ref name="pruijt" />

# Deprivation-based – homeless people squatting for housing need
# An alternative housing strategy – people unprepared to wait on municipal lists to be housed take direct action 
# Entrepreneurial – people breaking into buildings to service the need of a community for cheap bars, clubs etc.
# Conservational – preserving monuments because the authorities have let them decay
# Political – activists squatting buildings as protests or to make social centres

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], squatters tend to live in informal settlements or squatter camps on the outskirts of the larger cities, often but not always near [[township (South Africa)|townships]]. In the mid-1990s, an estimated 7.7 million South Africans lived in informal settlements: a fifth of the country's population.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Saff |first1=Grant |title=Claiming a Space in a Changing South Africa: The 'Squatters' of Marconi Beam, Cape Town |journal=[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=235–255 |date=1996 |issn=0004-5608 |jstor=2564004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1996.tb01752.x }}</ref> In [[Durban]], there has been sustained conflict between the city council and a shack dwellers' movement known as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]].

In [[Thailand]], although evictions have reduced their visibility or numbers in urban areas, many squatters still occupy land near railroad tracks, under overpasses, and waterways.  Commercial squatting is common in Thailand, where businesses temporarily seize nearby public real estate (such as sidewalks, roadsides, beaches, etc.) and roll out their enterprise, and at closing time they fold it in and lock it up, thus avoiding the extra cost of having to rent more property.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yasmeen |first1=Gisèle |last2=Narumol |first2=Nirathron |title=Vending in Public Space: The Case of Bangkok |journal=WIEGO Policy Brief |date=2014 |issue=16 |pages=13–15 |url=http://www.wiego.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Yasmeen-Vending-Public-Space-Bangkok-WIEGO-PB16.pdf |access-date=19 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420143528/http://www.wiego.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Yasmeen-Vending-Public-Space-Bangkok-WIEGO-PB16.pdf |archive-date=20 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{See also|Illegal housing in India}}

In [[Mumbai]], there are an estimated 10 to 12 million inhabitants, and six million of them are squatters. The squatters live in a variety of ways. Some possess two- or three-story homes built out of brick and concrete which they have inhabited for years. Geeta Nagar is a squatter village based beside the [[Indian Navy]] compound at [[Colaba]]. Squatter Colony in [[Malad|Malad East]] has existed since 1962, and now, people living there pay a rent to the city council of 100 rupees a month. [[Dharavi]] is a community of one million squatters. The stores and factories situated there are mainly illegal and so are unregulated, but it is suggested that they do over $1 million in business every day.<ref>Neuwirth, R (2004) ''Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters, A New Urban World'', pp. 110–14.

Other squatters are [[pavement dwellers]], with very few possessions.

===Philippines===
Squatting is a major issue in the Philippines especially but not exclusively in urban areas of the Philippines. Squatting gained notice right after [[World War II]], when people whose homes were destroyed by war were left homeless.

In the late 20th century, the squatter population largely grew but the Philippine government has made separate attempts over the years to transfer some squatters to low-cost housing projects, such as projects in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] (in the former [[Smokey Mountain]] [[landfill]]), [[Taguig]] (BLISS Housing Project), and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]], [[Rizal]].

[[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] is an independent community of almost 900 people founded in 1971 on the site of an abandoned military zone. In Copenhagen, as in other European cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam, the squatter movement was large in the 1980s. It was a [[social movement]], providing housing and alternative culture. A flashpoint came in 1986 with the [[Battle of Ryesgade]]. Another flashpoint came in 2007 when [[Ungdomshuset]] was evicted. While not technically a squat until 14 December 2006, it was a social centre used by squatters and people involved in alternative culture more generally. After a year of protests, the city council donated a new building.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=da |date=2008-06-30 |access-date=2008-06-30 |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article532135.ece |title=Aktivister har overtaget nyt ungdomshus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803045131/http://politiken.dk/indland/article532135.ece |archive-date=2008-08-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In early twentieth century [[France]], several artists who would later become world-famous, such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] squatted at the [[Bateau-Lavoir]], in [[Montmartre]], [[Paris]].

In the 1970s, squatting in West German cities led to "a self-confident urban counterculture with its own infrastructure of newspapers, self-managed collectives and housing cooperatives, feminist groups, and so on, which was prepared to intervene in local and broader politics".<ref>Mayer M ''The Career of Urban Social Movements in West Germany'' in eds Fisher R and Kling J ''Urban Affairs Annual Review'' volume 41 London (1993)</ref> The [[Autonomen]] movement protected squats against eviction and participated in radical direct action. After the [[German reunification]], many buildings were vacated due to the demise of former state-run enterprises and migration to the western parts of [[Germany]], some of which were then occupied by squatters. In [[Berlin]], the now-legalised squats are in desirable areas such as [[Mitte]] and [[Prenzlauer Berg]]. Before the reunification, squats in Berlin were mostly located in former [[West Berlin]]'s borough of [[Kreuzberg]]. The squats were mainly for residential and social use. Squatting became known by the term ''instandbesetzen'', from ''instandsetzen'' ("renovating") and ''besetzen'' ("occupying").<ref name="pruijt" />

When the Reykjavíkur Akademían (the Reykjavík Academy) was evicted at short notice from Hringbraut 121 in November 2011, it was occupied in protest. The space, which had hosted lectures and also Iceland's trade union and anarchist libraries, was moved to another location but the occupiers were unhappy that the new use of the building would be a guest house for tourists. An art exhibition was organised, with a camera obscura, live music and shadow theatre.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Benjamin |first1=Gabríel |title=The New Political Squat In Town |url=https://grapevine.is/news/2014/11/03/the-new-political-squat-in-town/ |access-date=13 April 2019 |work=Reykjavík Grapevine |date=3 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413002045/https://grapevine.is/news/2014/11/03/the-new-political-squat-in-town/ |archive-date=13 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Ireland===
The exact legal position of squatting in Ireland is ambiguous and the mechanisms for removing squatters from properties varies from case to case, sometimes going through the judicial process, other times not. Trespass and occupation of a property is not illegal, but as a definitive process for dealing with squatters does not exist, unlawful evictions do occur,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/circuit-court/three-men-sentenced-over-forced-eviction-for-landlord-1.2129388 |title=Three men sentenced over forced eviction for landlord |newspaper=Irish Times |access-date=2015-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211949/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/circuit-court/three-men-sentenced-over-forced-eviction-for-landlord-1.2129388 |archive-date=2015-07-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> sometimes with the support of the [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish Police).<ref>{{cite news |author=Fedayn |url=http://www.rabble.ie/2015/03/24/grangegorman-resists-eviction/ |title=Grangegorman resists eviction |publisher=Rabble |access-date=2015-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328020659/http://www.rabble.ie/2015/03/24/grangegorman-resists-eviction/ |archive-date=2015-03-28 |url-status=live }}</ref> However certain 'squatters rights' do exist and can be invoked in the form of adverse possession.

Squatting has no major tradition in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], arguably in part due to the perceived strong position of the title holder.

[[File:Squatting Graffiti in Rome.jpg|thumb|''Rome gets barricade''. Squatting symbol appearing as graffiti in Rome]]
In [[Italy]], despite the lack of official data, it appears that about 50,000 buildings all over the country are unused or abandoned and thus subject to squatting.<ref>{{cite news|author=Giuseppe Portonera|title=The Problem of Squatting in Italy: A New Approach by the Courts|newspaper=IPRI 2019|editor=International Property Rights Alliance|page=1|ssrn=3472293}}</ref> Squatting has no legal basis, but there are many squats used as [[social centre]]s. The first occupations of abandoned buildings began in 1968 with the left-wing movements [[Lotta Continua]] and [[Potere Operaio]]. Out of the breakup of these two movements was born [[Autonomia Operaia]], which was composed of a Marxist–Leninist and Maoist wing and also an anarchist and more libertarian one. These squats had [[Marxist-Leninist]] (but also [[Stalinist]] and [[Maoist]]) ideals and came from the left wing of Autonomia. The militants of the Italian armed struggle (the New [[Red Brigades]]) were connected to these squats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Steve |title=Storming Heaven: Class Composition and Struggle in Italian Autonomous Marxism |publisher=Pluto |isbn=978-0745316062 |url=https://libcom.org/library/storming-heaven-class-composition-struggle-italian-autonomist-marxism-steve-wright |date=2002-02-20 |access-date=2015-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012093139/http://libcom.org/library/storming-heaven-class-composition-struggle-italian-autonomist-marxism-steve-wright |archive-date=2015-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are many left-wing self-organised occupied projects across Italy such as [[Cascina Torchiera]] and [[Centro Sociale Leoncavallo]] in Milan and [[CSOA Forte Prenestino|Forte Prenestino]] in Rome.

This situation has so far received the approval of Italian courts, which have been reluctant to defend the owners' good reasons. In contrast with the dominant jurisprudence, new case-law (from the [[Rome]] Tribunal and the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]]) instructs the government to pay damages in case of squatting if the institutions have failed to prevent it.<ref>{{cite news|author=Giuseppe Portonera|title=The Problem of Squatting in Italy: A New Approach by the Courts|newspaper=IPRI 2019|editor=International Property Rights Alliance|pages=5–11|ssrn=3472293}}</ref>

Several days after the woman had moved in, the Catholic squatters in the house next door were evicted. [[Austin Currie]], then a young politician, complained both at the local council and at Stormont about the situation. He then symbolically occupied the woman's house for a few hours, before being evicted by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). One of the policeman was the woman's brother who himself moved into the house later on.<ref name="Sense" /> The incident quickly became a media sensation and in August the civil rights movement arranged one of its first marches, from Coalisland to Dungannon. This was followed in October by a civil rights march in [[Derry]] which was organised by the [[Derry Housing Action Committee]] and the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. The march was brutally repressed by the RUC.<ref name="Sense" />

Squatting is a criminal offence in [[Scotland]], punishable by a fine or even imprisonment, under the [[Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865]].

In [[Canada]], there are two systems to register the ownership of land. Under the land title system, squatter rights, formally known as [[adverse possession]], were abolished. However, under the registry system, these rights have been preserved. If a person occupies land for the required period of time as set out in provincial limitation acts and during that time no legal action is taken to evict them, then the ownership of the land transfers from the legal owner to the squatter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/RealEstateTenancy/LawArticle-69/Adverse-Possession.aspx |title=Adverse Possession – The Law Behind Land Squatters |access-date=2012-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106042332/http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/RealEstateTenancy/LawArticle-69/Adverse-Possession.aspx |archive-date=2012-01-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Favela}}
[[File:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|A favela in Rio de Janeiro]]
In [[Brazil]], squatter communities are called [[favela]]s, and a famous example is [[Rocinha]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], home to up to 180,000 people.<ref name="BBC-Rio">{{cite news |title=Favela life: Rio's city within a city |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27635554 |access-date=7 November 2020 |work=BBC News |date=9 June 2014}}</ref> Favelas are mostly inhabited by the poorest strata, and usually lack much infrastructure and public services, but in some cases, already have reached the structure needed for a city. They are equivalent to slums or shanty towns, and typically occupy unused land (instead of unused or abandoned buildings). There were 25 million people living in favelas across Brazil, as of 2004.<ref name="neuwirth" />

In [[São Paulo]] the largest favela is [[Heliópolis]], with over 200,000 inhabitants as of 2018.<ref name="Heliópolis">{{cite book |last1=Petrillo |first1=Agostino |last2=Bellaviti |first2=Paola |title=Sustainable Urban Development and Globalization New strategies for new challenges—with a focus on the Global South |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-61988-0 |page=103}}</ref> However, its occupied area has been officially recognized as a regular neighborhood of the city. There are also a number of squatter buildings in the inner city, the most famous of which was a 22-storey building called [[Prestes Maia (building)|Prestes Maia]], whose inhabitants were ordered to leave in 2006.<ref name="GPM">{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=Guardian |title=Windows on a fragile world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/07/prestes-maia-bittencourt-squat-brazil |access-date=3 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=7 February 2009 |archive-date=6 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906031219/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/07/prestes-maia-bittencourt-squat-brazil |url-status=live }}</ref> Inspired both by this movement and increasing property speculation and gentrification, various occupations in buildings and unoccupied areas in big cities, led by groups such as the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (MTST) or Downtown Roofless Movement (MSTC).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Tom |title=Brazil's roofless reclaim the cities |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/23/brazil.uknews1 |access-date=14 April 2019 |work=Guardian |date=23 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414231000/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/23/brazil.uknews1 |archive-date=14 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The former Hotel Santos Dumont on Mauá Street in the Luz neighbourhood was occupied in 2007 after being derelict for 17 years. An estimated 1,000 people were living in the building, paying a small amount every month to cover maintenance. The community expels people who fight, use drugs or abuse alcohol.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Dom |title=Driven by poverty, squatters occupied a derelict São Paulo hotel.

There are also rural squatter movements in Brazil, such as the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST), which has an estimated 1.5 million members.

===Australia===
{{Main|Squatting in Australia}}
In the 19th century, the British government claimed to own all of Australia and tried to control land ownership. Wealthy farmers of livestock claimed land for themselves and thus were known as squatters.<ref name="StateLibrary">{{cite web |title=The squattocracy |url=http://ergo.slv.vic.gov.au/explore-history/land-exploration/pastoral-practices/squattocracy |website=State Library of Victoria |access-date=14 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514150816/http://ergo.slv.vic.gov.au/explore-history/land-exploration/pastoral-practices/squattocracy |archive-date=14 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> This type of squatting is covered in greater detail at [[Squatting (Australian history)]].

In more recent times, Australia has seen [[Squatting in Australia|occupations]] in [[Canberra]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. The [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was set up in 1972 and is a permanent [[Occupation (protest)|protest occupation]]. The [[2016 Bendigo Street housing dispute]] saw squatters successfully contesting road-building plans. The Midnight Star squat was used as an self-managed social centre in a former cinema, before being evicted after being used as a convergence space during the 2002 [[World Trade Organization]] meeting.<ref name="Berry">{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=Vanessa |title=The Excess and Potential of the Movie Theatre Ruin: The Midnight Star |journal=Transformations |date=2016 |issue=28 |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Berry_Transformations28.pdf |access-date=14 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421143026/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Berry_Transformations28.pdf |archive-date=21 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
