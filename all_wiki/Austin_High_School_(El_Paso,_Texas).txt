'''Stephen F. Austin High School''' is a high school in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]]. Austin opened in 1930.  It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].  The school's mascot is a [[Golden Panther]] named "Henry." Austin High School is located in the heart of historic Central El Paso and serves the Central community.

The school was designed by Texas contractor and architect Robert E. McKee.<ref name=MCKEE>{{cite web|url=http://0-www.tshaonline.org.sapl.sat.lib.tx.us/handbook/online/articles/MM/fmcnv.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225134453/http://0-www.tshaonline.org.sapl.sat.lib.tx.us/handbook/online/articles/MM/fmcnv.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 December 2012 |title=MCKEE, ROBERT EUGENE, SR. |work=Handbook of Texas Online |author=Stanley, Irene and Duffy Stanley |accessdate=19 April 2010 }}</ref>  When the local school district ran out of money during the construction, McKee donated the remainder owed.<ref name=AUSTHIST>{{cite web |url=http://austin.episd.org/alumni/history.html |title=Austin High School History |publisher=Austin High School Alumni Association |accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref>  Consequently, the school's football stadium is named in McKee's honor.  The R.E. McKee Construction Company built the school and used a classic Spanish architecture.<ref name=AUSTHIST /> The structure is surmounted by a 103-foot tower. The classrooms had marble floors and the hallways are floored with terrazzo.<ref name=AUSTHIST />

==The "A"==
The school, located minutes from the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], faces a large, white, block "A" letter painted on the mountain.  AHS students traditionally "light" the "A" on Homecoming night's football game which is played at R.E. McKee Stadium.  The "A" is lit by placing small cans, full of kerosene and sawdust, around the "A" and lighting them before kickoff.<ref name=HEYA>{{cite web |url=http://ahs1956.com/AHSA.htm |title=Panther Association, 1955/56 — How We Lit The "A" |author=Laughman, Dick |publisher=Stephen F. Austin High School Class of 1956 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref>  The burning "A" is visible from the home bleachers and AHS supporters chant "Hey, Hey, Look at the A" to signify its lighting.<ref name=HEYA />

=="Elroy"==
The school has an actual, stuffed Golden Panther in the main lobby.  The Panther is named "Elroy" after Austin High English and Creative Writing teacher and author Elroy Bode.  Bode is a famed West Texas author and has published several books, including ''Home Country: An Elroy Bode Reader'', ''Commonplace Mysteries'', and ''This Favored Place: The Texas Hill Country''.

In 1998, Mr. Gary Mowad, a special agent for the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and former Austin teacher, approached the  Austin High School about donating a stuffed panther to display on campus.  Elroy was hunted illegally in [[Colorado]] by a hunter who unlawfully used a spotlight in pursuit of the panther.  Consequently, Elroy was seized by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the hunter was sentenced to four years of prison time.

At the conclusion of the litigation in September 2002, the Panther was transported to El Paso and donated to the school through the Austin High School Alumni Association, who then presented this spectacular animal to Austin High School. On January 7, 2004, the Panther was placed in the lobby where it can be viewed today.<ref name=PANTHER>{{cite web |url=http://ahs1956.com/Panther.htm |title=Our Panther Mascot |publisher=Stephen F. Austin High School Class of 1956 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref>

==Austin Alumni Association==
The Austin High School Alumni Association (AAA) was formed in 1991 to serve and support Austin High School and its students. The first Board of Directors was elected on May 16, 1991. The AAA is a 501c3 non-profit organization.
