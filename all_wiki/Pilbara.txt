The '''Pilbara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|l|b|ər|ə}}) is a large, dry, thinly populated [[regions of Western Australia|region]] in the north of [[Western Australia]]. It is known for its [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]; its ancient landscapes; the red earth; and its vast mineral deposits, in particular iron ore. It is also a global biodiversity hotspot for [[subterranean fauna]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/WAM_Supp78(B)_HALSEetal%20pp443-483.pdf |title=Pilbara stygofauna: deep groundwater of an arid landscape contains globally significant radiation of biodiversity |journal=Records of the Western Australian Museum |volume=Supplement 78 |year=2014 |pages=443–483 |author1=S.A.

==Definitions of the Pilbara region==
[[File:Pilbara 1.jpg|thumb|North of the Pilbara looking south at the range]]
At least two important but differing definitions of "the Pilbara" region exist. Administratively it is one of the nine regions of Western Australia defined by the ''[[Regional Development Commissions Act 1993]]''; the term also refers to the Pilbara shrublands [[bioregion]] (which differs in extent) under the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA).<ref name="IBRA 5.1">{{cite journal | author = [[Environment Australia]] | title = Revision of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) and Development of Version 5.1 – Summary Report | publisher = [[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]], [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] | url = http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html | accessdate = 31 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060905215218/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 September 2006}}</ref><ref name="IBRA 6.1">[http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html IBRA Version 6.1] data</ref>

==General==
The Pilbara region, as defined by the [[Regional Development Commissions Act 1993]] and administered for economic development purposes by the Pilbara Development Commission,<ref>[https://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/ Pilbara Development Commission] Retrieved 2 November 2020.</ref> has an estimated population of 61,688 {{As of|2018|06|lc=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/3218.0~2009-10~Main+Features~Western+Australia?OpenDocument|title=Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2009–10 – Western Australia|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="anrapil">{{cite web |url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/rangelands/overview/wa/ibra-pil.html |title=Rangelands – Overview – Pilbara |date=27 June 2009 |work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas |publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities |accessdate=28 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822050139/http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/rangelands/overview/wa/ibra-pil.html |archivedate=22 August 2011  }}</ref> and covers an area of {{convert|507,896|sqkm|sqmi}}.<ref name="rdap">{{cite web |url=http://www.rdapilbara.org.au/the-pilbara.aspx |title=Regional Development Australia Pilbara |accessdate=2 November 2020 }}</ref> It contains some of Earth's oldest rock formations, and includes landscapes of coastal plains and mountain ranges with cliffs and gorges.

The area is known for its petroleum, natural gas and iron ore deposits, which contribute significantly to [[Economy of Australia|Australia]]'s economy. Other than mining, pastoral activities as well as fishing and tourism are the main industries.<ref name="deph">{{cite web |url=http://www.health.wa.gov.au/services/detail.cfm?Unit_ID=52 |title=Department of Health: Pilbara |date=19 January 2011 |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref>

== Local government ==
The Pilbara region, under the Pilbara Development Commission, contains four [[Local government areas of Western Australia|local government areas]]:

:Ashburton – [[Shire of Ashburton]]
:East Pilbara – [[Shire of East Pilbara]]
:Karratha – [[City of Karratha]]
:Port Hedland – [[Town of Port Hedland]]

==Etymology==
The Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre ''Wangka Maya'' says that the name for the Pilbara region derives from the Aboriginal word ''bilybara'', meaning "dry" in the [[Nyamal]] and [[Panyjima language|Banyjima]] languages.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Bilybara.html?id=6YdkAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y] Book ''Bilybara'' (p. ii)</ref>

Alternatively, the Western Australia Gas Industry claims that the region takes its name from ''pilbarra'', an Aboriginal word for the [[mullet (fish)|mullet]] that is available in local waters.<ref name="gas-industry"/> The Pilbara Creek (originally spelt "Pilbarra") is a tributary of the [[Yule River]], a significant river in the region. [[Sea mullet]] and [[barramundi]] can still be caught in the Yule River today.<ref>[http://www.water.wa.gov.au/PublicationStore/first/90031.pdf] "Fishes in groundwater dependent pools of the Fortescue and Yule rivers, Pilbara, Western Australia," Gov't of Australia</ref> Pilbara Goldfield, discovered in 1885, was named after the creek, and the name later became associated with the region.<ref name="gas-industry">{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsg.com.au/industry/pilbaraplaces.html|title=WA Gas Industry: Interesting Facts<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=nwsg.com.au|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Op hurricane.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Nuclear test mushroom cloud|The [[mushroom cloud]] resulting from the Operation Hurricane detonation]]

The first European to explore the area was [[Francis Thomas Gregory]] in 1861. Settlements along the coast at [[Cossack, Western Australia|Cossack]], [[Roebourne, Western Australia|Roebourne]] and [[Shellborough, Western Australia|Shellborough]] were established over ensuing decades as agricultural and pastoral centres. However, after {{circa|1900}}, these largely went into decline with the growth of other, more productive agricultural areas of the state. Mining in the area started in 1937 in [[Wittenoom Gorge]], and following the discovery of iron ore in the [[Hamersley Range]]s in the 1960s, the area became pivotal to the state's economy, and towns built to accommodate mining and allied services boomed.<ref name="discover">{{cite book |title=Discover Australia's National Parks |last=Hema Maps |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] Australia |location=Milsons Point, New South Wales |isbn=1-875-99247-2 |page=274}}</ref> On 3 October 1952, the British conducted their first atomic bomb tests on the [[Montebello Islands]] as part of [[Operation Hurricane]].

==Aboriginal people==
{{also|Aboriginal Western Australians}}
===Prehistory===
The [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] population of the Pilbara considerably predates, by 30–40,000 years, the European colonisation of the region. [[Archaeological]] evidence indicates that people were living in the Pilbara even during the harsh climatic conditions of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name="marwick2002">{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=Milly's Cave: Evidence for Human Occupation of the Inland Pilbara during the Last Glacial Maximum|journal=Tempus|date=2002|volume=7|pages=21–33|url=http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/millys-cave-evidence-for-human-occupation-of-the-inland-pilbara-during-the-last-glacial-maximum(886b6c03-39c1-4f44-9961-094e4381b86a).html|language=English|issn=1323-6040}}</ref> The early history of the first peoples is held within an [[oral tradition]], [[archeological]] evidence and [[petroglyph]]s. Near the town of Dampier is a peninsula known as [[Murujuga]], which contains a large collection of world heritage listed petroglyphs, dating back thousands of years. [[Rock art]] in the Pilbara appears to have been primarily etched into the hard rock surfaces, compared to predominantly paintings on the softer sandstone in the Kimberley. This does not preclude that painting was and is not performed in the Pilbara.
[[File:Burrup rock art.JPG|thumb|left|Burrup rock art]]
===20th century===
Working conditions in the pearling and pastoral industries for Aboriginal people in the Pilbara region around 1900 have been described as [[slavery in Australia|slavery]], with no wages paid, kidnapping as well as severe and cruel punishments for misbehaviour and absconding all common practices.<ref name="eie">{{cite book |title=Enough is Enough: A History of the Pilbara Mob |last=Olive |first=Noel |year=2007 |publisher=Fremantle Press |isbn=1-921-06445-5 |pages=57–59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1zeMUAPoM4C |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> Some incidents, such as the [[Bendu case|Bendu Atrocity]] of 1897, attracted international condemnation. The first strike by Indigenous people in Australia took place in 1946 in the Pilbara, known as the [[Pilbara strike]] or Pilbara Aboriginal strike, when Aboriginal pastoral workers walked off the stations in protest at low pay and bad working conditions, a strike that lasted for over three years.<ref>[http://www.wangkamaya.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=164&Itemid=386 Historical Events Timeline] Wangka Maya website, accessed: 1 December 2011</ref>

===Today===
In 2006, it was estimated that 15% of the population of the Pilbara identify as [[Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people]], approximately 6,000 people.<ref>[http://www.csiro.au/en/Organisation-Structure/Flagships/Water-for-a-Healthy-Country-Flagship/~/media/CSIROau/Files/PDF/p12ei.pdf Water and Indigenous People in the Pilbara] ''[[CSIRO]]'' study, published: September 2011, accessed: 1 December 2011</ref>

==Location and description==
[[File:Hamersley Range, Pilbara Region, Western Australia.JPG|thumb|[[Hamersley Range]]]]
Under the ''Regional Development Commissions Act'' Pilbara is situated south of the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]], and is made up of the [[Local Government Areas of Western Australia|local government areas]] of Shire of Ashburton, Shire of East Pilbara, City of Karratha and Town of Port Hedland.

The Pilbara region covers an area of 507,896&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (193,826&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>) (including offshore islands), roughly the combined land area of the [[United States|US]] States of [[California]] and [[Indiana]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}  It has a population of more than 45,000,<ref>[http://www.cmewa.com/UserDir/CMEResources/100517-MPR-Pilbara%20demographic%20projections-April2010-v121.pdf]</ref> most of whom live in the western third of the region, in towns such as [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]], [[Karratha, Western Australia|Karratha]], [[Wickham, Western Australia|Wickham]], [[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]] and [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]].  A substantial number of people also work in the region on a [[fly-in fly-out|fly-in/fly-out]] basis.
There are approximately 10 major/medium population centres and more than 25 smaller ones

[[File:Karijini8.jpg|thumb|left|Weano Gorge in Karijini National Park]]
The Pilbara consists of three distinct geographic areas.  The western third is the Roebourne coastal sandplain, which supports most of the region's population in towns and much of its industry and commerce.  The eastern third is almost entirely desert, and is sparsely populated by a small number of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples. These are separated by the inland uplands of the [[Pilbara Craton]], including the predominant [[Hamersley Range]] which has a considerable number of mining towns, the [[Chichester Range]] and others. These uplands have a number of gorges and other natural attractions.

The Pilbara contains some of the world's oldest surface rocks, including the ancient fossilised remains known as [[stromatolites]] and rocks such as [[granite]]s that are more than three billion years old. In 2007, some of the oldest evidence of life on Earth was found in 3.4 billion-year-old sandstones at [[Strelley Pool]], which preserve fossils of sulfur-processing bacteria.<ref name=sulphurbacteria>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14614832 | title = Fossil microbes give sulphur insight on ancient Earth | last = Amos | first = Jonathan |date = 22 August 2011 | work = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 22 August 2011}}</ref> The mineralized spheres, which were found on an ancient beach and have a cell-like [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], were chemically analysed, revealing that they used [[sulfur]] for fuel.<ref name="woff">{{Cite news |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/worlds-oldest-fossils-found-in-a.html?ref=hp |title=World's Oldest Fossils Found in Ancient Australian Beach |author=Elizabeth Pennisi |accessdate=5 September 2011 |date=21 August 2011 |work=[[ScienceNOW]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107123219/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/worlds-oldest-fossils-found-in-a.html?ref=hp |archivedate=7 November 2011  }}</ref>

==Climate==
[[File:Tropical Cyclone Fay 27 mar 2004 0220Z.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Terra satellite]] captured this image of [[Cyclone Fay]], over the Western Australian coast on 27 March 2004.]]
[[File:Maitland River bridge Western Australia 2004-04-14.jpg|thumb|300m of [[North West Coastal Highway]] approaches to the [[Maitland River (Western Australia)|Maitland River]] bridge were destroyed during [[Cyclone Monty]] in 2004]]
The climate of the Pilbara is [[arid]] and [[tropical]].<ref name="anrapil"/> It experiences high temperatures and low irregular rainfall that follows the summer [[cyclone]]s. During the summer months, maximum temperatures exceed {{Convert|32|C|F}} almost every day, and temperatures in excess of {{Convert|45|C|F}} are not uncommon. Winter temperatures rarely drop below {{Convert|10|C|F}} on the coast; however, inland temperatures as low as {{Convert|0|C|F}} are occasionally recorded.

The Pilbara town of [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]] set a world record of most consecutive days of maximum [[temperature]]s of 100 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (37.8 degrees [[Celsius]]) or more, during a period of 160 such days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924.<ref name="climateextremes">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm|title=Marble Bar heatwave, 1923–1924|work=Australian Climate Extremes|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=21 September 2008|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}</ref>

The average annual rainfall in the region is between {{Convert|200|and|350|mm|in}}.<ref name="anrapil"/> Almost all of the Pilbara's rainfall occurs between December and May, usually with occasional heavy downpours in [[thunderstorm]]s or tropical cyclones. The period from June to November is usually completely rainless, with warm to very hot and sunny conditions. Like most of the north coast of Australia, the coastal areas of the Pilbara experience occasional tropical cyclones.  The frequency of cyclones crossing the Pilbara coast is about 7 every 10 years.<ref name="anrapil"/><ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/tropical-cyclones/index.jsp]</ref> Due to the low population density in the Pilbara region, cyclones rarely cause large scale destruction or loss of life.

==Economy==
The Pilbara's economy is dominated by [[mining]] exports and [[petroleum]] export industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/industry/types-of-industries/oil-and-gas.aspx|title=The Pilbara’s oil and gas industry is the region’s largest export industry earning $5.0 billion in 2004/05 accounting for over 96% of the State's production|website=www.pdc.wa.gov.au}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719184734/http://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/industry/types-of-industries/oil-and-gas.aspx |date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>

===Iron ore===

Most of [[Australia]]'s [[iron ore]] is mined in the Pilbara, with mines mostly centred around [[Tom Price, Western Australia|Tom Price]] and [[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]]. The iron ore industry employs 9,000 people from the Pilbara area. The Pilbara also has one of the world's major [[manganese]] mines, Woodie Woodie, situated {{convert|400|km}} southeast of Port Hedland.

Iron ore deposits were first discovered by prospector Stan Hilditch, who in 1957 found a large iron ore deposit in the southern [[Ophthalmia Range]], at what was to become the [[Mount Whaleback mine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stan Hilditch |url=http://exhibitions.slwa.wa.gov.au/s/mewa/page/StanHilditch |website=Mining & Energy WA |publisher=State Library of Western Australia |accessdate=11 April 2019 |location=Perth, WA}}</ref>

In the 1960s, it was reportedly called "one of the most massive ore bodies in the world" by Thomas Price, then vice president of US-based steel company Kaiser Steel. [[Geoscience Australia]] calculated that the country's "[[economic demonstrated resources]]" of iron amounted to 24 gigatonnes, or 24 billion tonnes. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics]], {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, that resource is being used up at a rate of 324 million tonnes a year, with rates expected to increase over coming years. Experts [[Gavin Mudd]] ([[Monash University]]) and Jonathon Law ([[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]) expect it to be gone within 30 to 50 years (Mudd) and 56 years (Law).<ref name="Pincock">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/07/14/2953402.htm|title=Iron ore country|last=Pincock|first=Stephen|date=14 July 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>

===Liquified natural gas===
A significant part of Pilbara's economy is based on [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG) through the [[North West Shelf Venture]] and Pluto LNG plant, both operated by Woodside.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Millstream-Chichester National Park DSC04096.JPG|thumb|Millstream Homestead in [[Millstream-Chichester National Park]]]]
The region also has a number of cattle-grazing stations, and a substantial tourist sector, with popular natural attractions including the [[Karijini National Park|Karijini]] and [[Millstream-Chichester National Park|Millstream-Chichester]] national parks and the [[Dampier Archipelago]].

===Transport===
[[File:Port Hedland, Western Australia.jpg|thumb|BHP iron ore train arriving at Port Hedland]]

The first railway in the Pilbara region was the [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[Marble Bar Railway]] between [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]]. The Marble Bar Railway opened in July 1911 and closed in October 1951. The Roebourne-Cossack Tramway opened in 1897 and many industrial railways have been built to serve the mines.<ref>Joyce, J. and Tilley, Allan, "Railways in the Pilbara," (1979). {{ISBN|0959969926}}.</ref>

Currently four heavy-duty railways are associated with the various iron-ore mines, with a fifth line proposed to serve the [[Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.]] mines.  The railways are all [[standard gauge]] and are built to the heaviest North American standards. Between 2008 and 2012, Rio Tinto proposes to convert to [[Automatic train operation|driverless trains]] on its railways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mineprocessing.com/News/detail-a135-b2-c0-d0-e0-f.html |title=Iron-ore railway automation project, Western Australia |publisher=Mineprocessing.com |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714095648/http://www.mineprocessing.com/News/detail-a135-b2-c0-d0-e0-f.html |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> An additional 300&nbsp;km line is planned from the Roy Hill mine to a port at Boodarie, near Port Hedland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/pilbara-iron-ore-line-approved/browse/4.html|accessdate=21 July 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Pilbara iron ore line approved}}</ref>

===Ports===
The ports of the Pilbara are:

* [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]]
** Nelson Point and Finucane Island (operated by [[BHP Billiton|BHP]])
** Herb Elliott Port (operated by the [[Fortescue Metals Group]])
* [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]] (operated by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]])
* [[Cape Lambert]] (operated by Rio Tinto)
* [[Anketell Port]] (under development)

==Ecology==
[[File:Karijini1.jpg|thumb|The vibrant colours of the outback in [[Karijini National Park]]]]

The dominant flora of the Pilbara is [[acacia]] trees and shrubs and drought-resistant [[Triodia (plant genus)|Triodia]] ''spinifex'' grasses. Several species of acacia (wattle) trees are endemic to the Pilbara and are the focus of conservation programs, along with wildflowers and other local specialities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The Pilbara is home to a wide variety of endemic species adapted to this tough environment. There is a high diversity of invertebrates, including hundreds of species of [[subterranean fauna]] (both [[stygofauna]] and [[troglofauna]]), which are microscopic invertebrates that live in caves, vugs or groundwater [[aquifers]] of the region, and terrestrial fauna (see [[short-range endemic invertebrates]]). The Pilbara olive python, the [[western pebble-mound mouse]], and the [[Pilbara ningaui]] of the Hamersley Range are among the many species of animals within the fragile ecosystems of this desert ecoregion. Birds include the [[Australian hobby]], [[nankeen kestrel]], [[spotted harrier]], [[mulga parrot]] and [[budgerigar]]s.

Wildlife has been damaged by the extraction of iron, natural gas and asbestos, but the protection of culturally and environmentally sensitive areas of the Pilbara is now enhanced by the delineation of several protected areas, including the [[Millstream-Chichester National Park|Millstream-Chichester]] and the [[Karijini National Park]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
