[[File:RPI Engraving 1879.jpg|thumb|right|202px|Engraving of RPI in 1876]]

[[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen Van Rensselaer]] established the Rensselaer School on 5 November 1824 with a letter to the Reverend Dr. [[Samuel Blatchford (university president)|Samuel Blatchford]], in which Van Rensselaer asked Blatchford to serve as the first president. Within the letter he set down several orders of business. He appointed [[Amos Eaton]] as the school's first senior professor and appointed the first board of trustees.<ref name="historybook">{{Cite book |last=Ricketts |first=Palmer C. |title=History of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 1824-1934, Third Edition |year=1934 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |location=New York, NY |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR9DAAAAIAAJ&q=Outline+of+the+Method+of+Instruction+at+the+Rensselaer+School&pg=PA29 |page=34}}</ref> The school opened on Monday, 3 January 1825 at the Old Bank Place, a building at the north end of Troy.<ref name="buildings">{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives/buildings/index.html |title=RPI Building Histories |access-date=21 January 2007 |author=Institute Archives and Special Collections}}</ref> Tuition was around $40 per semester (equivalent to $800 in 2012<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi|title =The Inflation Calculator|website = Westegg.com|access-date =15 February 2014}}</ref>).<ref name="historybook"/> The fact that the school attracted students from as far as [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]] is attributed to the reputation of Eaton. Fourteen months of successful trial led to the incorporation of the school on 21 March 1826 by the state of [[New York State|New York]]. In its early years, the Rensselaer School strongly resembled a graduate school more than it did a college, drawing graduates from many older institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|title=CIRCULAR—To the County Clerks of the State of New-York |issue=1829/01/21|pages=3|url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84035849/1829-01-21/ed-1/seq-3/|journal=The Geneva Gazette, and General Advertiser|publisher=James Bogert|access-date=17 March 2014|date=21 January 1829}}</ref>

Under Eaton, the Rensselaer School, renamed the Rensselaer Institute in 1832, was a small but vibrant center for technological research. The first civil engineering degrees in the [[United States of America|United States]] were granted by the school in 1835, and many of the best remembered civil engineers of that time graduated from the school. Important visiting scholars included [[Joseph Henry]], who had previously studied under Amos Eaton, and [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], who sold the world's first working [[electric motor]] to the institute.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/july99/features/blacksmith/blacksmith.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205211500/http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/july99/features/blacksmith/blacksmith.html |archive-date=5 February 2007 |title=The blacksmith's motor |last=Wicks |first=Frank |date=July 1999 |work=Mechanical Engineering Magazine |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |url-status=dead |access-date=28 February 2009  }}</ref>

In 1847 alumnus [[Benjamin Franklin Greene]] became the new senior professor. Earlier he had done a thorough study of European technical schools to see how Rensselaer could be improved. In 1850 he reorganized the school into a three-year polytechnic institute with six technical schools.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/archives/timeline/1829.html |title=Timeline of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute History 1999 |access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref> In 1861 the name was changed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.<ref>{{cite book|title=Laws of the State of New York, Volume 1|date=1 May 1861|publisher=State of New York|location=Albany, NY|page=428}}</ref> A severe conflagration of 10 May 1862, known as "[[History of Troy, New York#The great fire of Troyibald 1862|The Great Fire]]", destroyed more than 507&nbsp;buildings in Troy and gutted {{convert|75|acre|m2}} in the heart of the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/12/news/great-fire-troy-between-five-six-hundred-buildings-destroyed-number-persons.html|title=THE GREAT FIRE IN TROY.; Between Five and Six Hundred Buildings Destroyed.

[[Columbia University]] proposed that Rensselaer leave Troy altogether and merge with its New York City campus. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected and the campus left the crowded downtown for the hillside. Classes were temporarily held at the Vail House and in the [[Troy University (New York)|Troy University]] building until 1864,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives/buildings/infant_school.html|title=The Infant School Property|publisher=RPI Building Histories|access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref> when the Institute moved to a building on Broadway on 8th Street, now the site of the Approach.<ref name="great fire"/>

One of the first Latino student organizations in the United States was founded at RPI in 1890. The [[Club Hispano Americano]] was established by the international Latin American students that attended the institute at this time.

In 1904 the Institute was for the fourth time devastated by fire, when its main building was completely destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|title=FOURTH FIRE AT R.P.I.; Troy's History Technical School Destroyed in $50,000 Blaze.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/06/10/120269228.pdf|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref> However, RPI underwent a period of academic and resource expansion under the leadership of President [[Palmer C. Ricketts|Palmer Ricketts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives/history/presidents/ricketts,pc.html|title=RPI Biography of Palmer Ricketts|access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref> Named President in 1901, Ricketts liberalized the curriculum by adding the Department of Arts, Science, and Business Administration, in addition to the Graduate School. He also expanded the university's resources and developed RPI into a true polytechnic institute by increasing the number of degrees offered from two to twelve; these included electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, chemistry, and physics. During Rickett's tenure, enrollment increased from approximately 200 in 1900 to a high of 1,700 in 1930.<ref name="railroad guide"/>

Another period of expansion occurred following [[World War II]] as returning veterans used their GI Bill education benefits to attend college. The "Freshman Hill" residence complex was opened in 1953 followed by the completion of the Commons Dining Hall in 1954, two more halls in 1958, and three more in 1968. In this same time frame (1966) [[Herta Regina Leng]] was appointed as RPI's first female full professor. She is now honored there with an annual lecture series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/phys/calendar/hertalenglecture.html|title=RPI Physics, Applied Physics, & Astronomy: Herta Leng Lecture Series|date=2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910124031/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/phys/calendar/hertalenglecture.html|access-date=2020-02-29|archive-date=10 September 2015}}</ref>  In 1961, there was major progress in academics at the institute with the construction of the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator, then the most powerful in the world,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of RPI's Gaerttner Linear Accelerator |url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives//buildings/linac.html |access-date=28 February 2009}}</ref> and the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center. The current Student Union building was opened in 1967.

The next three decades brought continued growth with many new buildings (see '[[#Campus|Campus']] below), and growing ties to industry. The "H-building", previously used for storage, became the home for the RPI incubator program, the first such program sponsored solely by a university.<ref name="first incubator">{{cite web |title= RPI's Incubator Program History |url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/incubator/homepage/about_missin_history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819004446/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/incubator/homepage/about_missin_history.html |archive-date=19 August 2010 |access-date=5 September 2011}}</ref> Shortly after this, RPI decided to invest $3&nbsp;million in pavement, water and power on around {{convert|1200|acre|ha}} of land it owned {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of campus to create the [[Rensselaer Technology Park]].<ref name="techpark">{{cite book |title=Academia Linking With Industry: the RPI model |chapter=Academia linking with industry-the RPI model |year=1989 |doi=10.1109/EMTS.1989.68976 |last1=Le Maistre |first1=C.W. |pages=207–208 |s2cid=195837916 }}</ref> In 1982 the New York State legislature granted RPI $30&nbsp;million to build the [[George M.

In 1999, RPI gained attention when it was one of the first universities to implement a mandatory [[laptop computer]] program.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Monahan |first1=Torin |year=2003 |title=Hot Technologies on Every Pillow |journal=Radical Pedagogy |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=http://www.radicalpedagogy.org/radicalpedagogy94/Hot_Technologies_on_Every_Pillow__The_Discursive_Development_of_Institutional_Change.html }}</ref> This was also the year of the arrival of President [[Shirley Ann Jackson]], a former chairperson of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] under [[President Bill Clinton]]. She instituted "[[Rensselaer Plan|The Rensselaer Plan]]" (discussed below), an ambitious plan to revitalize the institute.

The surrounding area is mostly residential neighborhoods, with the city of Troy lying at the base of the hill. The campus is bisected by 15th Street, with most of the athletic and housing facilities to the east, and the academic buildings to the west. A footbridge spans the street, linking the two halves. Much of the campus features a series of [[Colonial Revival style]] structures built in the first three decades of the 20th century. Overall, the campus has enjoyed four periods of expansion.<ref name="buildings"/>

===1824–1905===
RPI was originally located in downtown Troy, but gradually moved to the hilltop that overlooks the city. Buildings that remain from this time include [[Winslow Chemical Laboratory]], a building on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Located at the base of the hill on the western edge of campus, it currently houses the Social and Behavioral Research Laboratory.<ref name="buildings"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbrl.rpi.edu/ |title=Social and Behavioral Research Laboratory |access-date=3 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311022920/http://www.sbrl.rpi.edu/ |archive-date=11 March 2009  }}</ref>

===Ricketts Campus, 1906–1935===
[[File:RusselSageLabs.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Russell Sage Laboratory]]
President Palmer Ricketts supervised the construction of the school's "Green Rooftop" Colonial Revival buildings that give much of the campus a distinct architectural style. Buildings constructed during this period include the [[Carnegie Building (Troy, New York)|Carnegie Building]] (1906), Walker Laboratory (1907), Russell Sage Laboratory (1909),<ref name="Russell_Sage_Laboratory_history">{{cite web |url=https://archives.rpi.edu/blog/2019/06/26/continuing-up-the-hill-russell-sage-laboratory/ |title=Continuing Up the Hill: Russell Sage Laboratory |author=John F.

Also built during this period was "The Approach" (1907), a massive ornate granite staircase found on the west end of campus. Originally linking RPI to the Troy Union Railroad station, it again serves as an important link between the city and the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives/gallery/approach/apphome.html|title=History of The Approach|access-date=21 February 2008|author=Institute Archives and Special Collections|year=2003}}</ref> In 1906 the '86 Field, home field of the football team until 2008, was completed with support of the Class of 1886.

===Post-war expansion, 1946–1960===

[[File:VorheesComputingCenter.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Alan M. Voorhees|Voorhees]] Computing Center]]
After [[World War&nbsp;II]], the campus again underwent major expansion. Nine dormitories were built at the east edge of campus bordering Burdett Avenue, a location that came to be called "Freshman Hill". The [[Houston Field House]] (1949) was reassembled, after being moved in pieces from its original [[Rhode Island]] location. [[West Hall (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)|West Hall]], which was originally built in 1869 as a hospital, was acquired by the Institute in 1953. The ornate building is an example of [[Second Empire (architecture)|French Second Empire]] architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/dept/library/html/Archives/buildings/west_hall.html |title=RPI Building Histories : West Hall|access-date=28 February 2009|author=Institute Archives and Special Collections}}</ref> It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.

Another unique building is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC). Originally the St.&nbsp;Joseph's Seminary chapel, it was built in 1933 and acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute's library from 1960 until the completion of the new [[Folsom Library]], in 1976.<ref>{{cite web

===Rensselaer Plan===
With the arrival of the president, [[Shirley Ann Jackson]], came the "Rensselaer Plan" announced in 1999. Its goal is to achieve greater prominence for Rensselaer as a technological research university.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rensselaer Plan|year=1999 |url=http://www.rpi.edu/president/plan/index.html|access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref> Various aspects of the plan include bringing in a larger [[graduate student]] population and new research faculty, and increasing participation in undergraduate research, international exchange programs, and "living and learning communities". So far, there have been a number of changes under the plan: new infrastructure such as the [[Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies]], [[Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center]], and [[Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations]] (CCNI) have been built to support new programs, and application numbers have increased.<ref name="accomplished">{{cite web|title=Accomplishments of Rensselaer Plan|year=2006|url=http://www.rpi.edu/president/accomplished.html|access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref> In 2018, Rensselaer received a record number of applications: 20,337.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.rpi.edu/content/2018/03/28/freshman-applications-class-2022-surge-past-20000|title=Freshman Applications for Class of 2022 Surge Past 20,000 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|date=28 March 2018|work=RPI News|access-date=6 May 2018|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute}}</ref> According to [[Jared Cohon]] in 2006, then president of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], "Change at Rensselaer in the last five years has occurred with a scope and swiftness that may be without precedent in the recent history of American higher education."<ref>{{cite web |title=Board of Trustees Enthusiastically Endorses Leadership and Presidency of Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson|year=2006|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=1520&setappvar=page(1)}}</ref>

The ability to attract greater research funds is needed to meet the goals of the plan, and the university has set a goal of $100&nbsp;million annually. Fourteen years later, in FY2013, research expenditures reached this goal. To help raise money the university mounted a $1&nbsp;billion capital campaign, of which the public phase began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008. In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360&nbsp;million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S.&nbsp;university at the time. The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title= For Rensselaer Polytechnic, a Record-Setting Gift With No Strings Attached|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/nyregion/for-rensselaer-polytechnic-a-record-setting-gift-with-no-strings-attached.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|access-date=8 March 2007

The new goal was met by 1 October 2008.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Historic Rensselaer Capital Campaign Reaches Goal Nine Months Ahead of Schedule |url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=2501 |publisher=RPI |date=1 October 2008 |access-date=3 March 2010}}</ref>

In 2016, President Jackson announced during the Fall Town Hall Meeting that the institute was in the final stages of organizing a new capital campaign which it intends to launch in 2017 to meet the goals of the Rensselaer Plan 2024. The goal of the campaign was cited as being primarily for the support of financial aid for undergraduate students and the expansion of on-campus research facilities to accommodate planned increases in doctoral and graduate enrollment. The fundraising goal of the capital campaign is $1 billion, with over $400 million raised prior to the campaign going public.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://poly.rpi.edu/2016/11/02/new_capital_campaign_coming_in_2017/ |title=New capital campaign coming in 2017 |access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

Ambitious spending on the Rensselaer Plan has led the University into financial difficulties, with its credit rating lowered by several agencies.<ref name="Brunelle"/><ref name="Renew_Rensselaer">{{cite web |title=The Untold Story |url=https://renewrensselaer.org/findings/ |website=Renew Rensselaer |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

===Gender ratio===
RPI became coeducational in 1942. In 1966, the male-to-female ratio was 19:1, in the 1980s it reached as low as 8:1, and in the early 1990s the ratio was around 5:1. In 2009, RPI had a ratio of 2.5:1 (72% male / 28% female),<ref name="Common Data Set">{{cite web|url = http://www.rpi.edu/about/cds/CDS2008_2009.pdf|title = Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Common Data Set 2006-2007 |access-date = 17 July 2007|year = 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegeapps.about.com/od/rankings/a/u_mf.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323031002/http://collegeapps.about.com/od/rankings/a/u_mf.htm |archive-date=23 March 2006 |title=Ranking of American Universities by Their Male/Female Ratios |access-date=26 January 2008 |year=2006 |author=About.com|author-link=About.com }}</ref> In 2016, the ratio for the incoming freshman class had fallen to 2.1:1 (68% male / 32% female), the lowest in the history of the Institute.<ref name="Inside Rensselaer Magazine">{{cite web|url = http://www.insiderensselaer.com/ready-to-change-the-world-2/|title = RPI Class of 2020 - Ready To Change the World |access-date = 21 October 2016|year = 2016}}</ref>
In the fall of 2016, more than 1,000 women enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's undergraduate engineering programs for the first time in its history. These women represented 30 percent of the student body in engineering at the university, and 32 percent of the university's total gender composition. Shekhar Garde, Rensselaer's dean of engineering, claims he wants to increase the female composition of the Institute to 50 percent before 2030.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://emma.msrb.org/ER1164523-ER910317-ER1310783.pdf |title=RPI Annual Report FY2018 |website=renewrensselaer.org|access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref>

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has an extensive history of Greek community involvement on campus, including past presidents, honorary academic building dedications, and philanthropic achievements. The overall Greek system at Rensselaer stresses Leadership, Fortitude, Innovation, and Evolution. RPI currently has 29 active fraternities as well as 6 sororities, with 32 percent involvement of all males and 18 percent involvement of all females, organized under the [[North American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternal Council]] and [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reslife.rpi.edu/update.do?catcenterkey=69|title=Greek Organizations, Residence Life, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|website=Reslife.rpi.edu|access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref> Of those Greek organizations, three were founded at Rensselaer including the [[Theta Xi]] national engineering fraternity, the [[Sigma Delta]] Hispanic-interest local sorority, and the [[Rensselaer Society of Engineers]] local engineering fraternity. Theta Xi fraternity was established by RPI students on 29 April 1864, the only national fraternity founded during the Civil War. The [[Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House]] is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, Rensselaer is home to the Epsilon Zeta chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]], or "APO," national service fraternity, which operates a test-bank and office at the top floor of the Student Union. The organization also hosts a campus lost & found, universal can tab collection, and a public 3D printing service.

In 2017, [[Chi Phi]] and [[Theta Chi]] at Rensselaer co-hosted an event called "Brave A Shave For Kids With Cancer," along with several other Greek organizations - raising over $22,000 for pediatric cancer research with dozens of participants shaving their heads to spread awareness of pediatric cancers. Many fraternities and sororities also engage in [[Adopt-a-Highway]] and host events in the local community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stbaldricks.org/events/RPI2017#content|title=RPI 2017 - Theta Chi and Chi Phi - A St. Baldrick's Event|website=Stbaldricks.org|access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref> Since its inception, all members of Greek Life have also participated in Navigating Rensselaer & Beyond - RPI's official continuation of student orientation through hosting annual events open to all students such as Beach Day/Hike with Greek Life, a day of hiking and team building activities for incoming freshmen, and Saratoga Therapeutic Equine Program, a day of service focused on horse rehabilitation programs.

Greek Life organizations also operate Greek-affiliated groups including the Alumni Inter-Greek Council, Greek Greeks - a student-run venture which aims to promote sustainability and safe environmental practices in Greek chapter houses, Greek Spectrum - an LGBTQIA support and advocacy group, and the undergraduate Greek leadership society [[Order of Omega]].

==Athletics==
{{Main|RPI Engineers|RPI Engineers men's ice hockey|RPI Engineers women's ice hockey}}
[[File:RPI Engineers.svg|thumb|150px|Official athletics logo]]
The '''RPI Engineers''' are the athletic teams for the university. RPI currently sponsors 23&nbsp;sports, 21 of which compete at the [[NCAA Division III]] level in the [[Liberty League]]; men's and women's ice hockey compete at the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level in [[ECAC Hockey]]. The official nickname of some of the school's Division III teams was changed in 1995 from the Engineers to the Red Hawks. However, the hockey, football, cross-country, tennis and track and field teams all chose to retain the Engineers name. The Red Hawks name was, at the time, very unpopular among the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted with thrown concessions and chants of "kill the chicken!". In 2009 the nickname for all teams has since been changed back to Engineers. In contrast, the official ice hockey mascot, known as Puckman, has always been very popular. Puckman is an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer's helmet.

During the 1970s and 1980s, one RPI cheer was:
:''E to the x, dy/dx, E to the x, dx''
:''Cosine, secant, tangent, sine''
:''3.14159''
:''Square root, cube root, log of pi''
:''Disintegrate them, RPI!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stutt.net/rensselaer/doku.php?id=cheers:e_to_the_x|title=E to the X|publisher=RPI Information|access-date=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001016.php|title=Witness's recollection of the cheer originating at RPI|website=Lanuguagehat.com|access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref>

===Ice hockey (men's)===
{{main|RPI Engineers men's ice hockey}}
RPI has a competitive Division&nbsp;I [[RPI Engineers men's ice hockey|hockey team]] who won [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] national titles in 1954 and 1985. Depending on how the rules are interpreted, the RPI men's ice hockey team may have the longest winning streak on record for a Division&nbsp;I team; in the 1984–85 season it was undefeated for 30&nbsp;games, but one game was against the [[University of Toronto]], a non-NCAA team. Continuing into the 1985–86 season, RPI continued undefeated over 38&nbsp;games, including two wins over Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augenblick.org/rpi/h_faq.html |title=RPI Hockey FAQ |access-date=3 March 2010}}</ref> The streak ended at Boston University against the Terriers. [[Adam Oates]] and [[Daren Puppa]], two players during that time, both went on to become stars in the NHL. [[Joé Juneau]], who played from 1987 to 1991, and [[Brian Pothier]], who played from 1996 to 2000, also spent many years in the NHL. [[Graeme Townshend]], who also played in the late 1980s, had a brief NHL career. He is the first man of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] ancestry to play in the [[National Hockey League]].

The ice hockey team plays a significant role in the campus's culture, drawing thousands of fans each week to the [[Houston Field House]] during the season. The team's popularity even sparked the tradition of the hockey line, where students lined up for season tickets months in advance of the on-sale date. Today, the line generally begins a week or more before ticket sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpiarchives.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/at-the-beginning-of-the-hockey-line/|title=At the beginning of the Hockey Line|date=8 September 2009|publisher=RPI History Revealed|access-date=8 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718000845/http://rpiarchives.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/at-the-beginning-of-the-hockey-line/|archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> Another tradition since 1978 has been the "Big Red Freakout!" game held close to the first weekend of February. Fans usually dress in the schools colors red and white, and gifts such as T-shirts are distributed en masse. In ice hockey, the RPI's biggest rival has always been the upstate engineering school [[Clarkson University]]. In recent years RPI has also developed a spirited rivalry with their conference travel partner [[Union College]], with whom they annually play a nonconference game in Albany for the Mayor's Cup.

===Ice hockey (women's)===

{{main|RPI Engineers women's ice hockey}}

The women's ice hockey team moved to the NCAA Division I level in 2005. During the 2008–09 season the team set the record for most wins in one season (19-14-4). On 28 February 2010, Rensselaer made NCAA history. The Engineers beat Quinnipiac, 2–1, but it took five overtimes. It is now the longest game in NCAA Women's Ice Hockey history. Senior defenseman Laura Gersten had the game-winning goal. She registered it at 4:32 of the fifth overtime session to not only clinch the win, but the series victory.<ref>[http://www.rpiathletics.com/news/2010/3/1/WICE_0301103857.aspx Women's Hockey Headed to ECAC Hockey Semifinals].

===Baseball===
The Engineers baseball squad is perennially atop the Liberty League standings, and has seen 8 players move on to the professional ranks, including 4 players selected in the MLB draft. The team is coached by Karl Steffen (Ithaca '78). The Engineers play their home games at the historic Robison Field.

===American football===
American rugby was played on campus in the late 1870s. Intercollegiate football begin as late as 1886 when an RPI team first played a Union College team on a leased field in West Troy (Watervliet). Since 1903, RPI and nearby Union have been rivals in football, making it the oldest such rivalry in the state. The teams have played for the [[Dutchman's Shoes]] since 1950. RPI Football had their most successful season in 2003, when they finished 11-2 and lost to St. Johns (Minn.) in the NCAA Division III semi final game.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiTursi|first=Dan|title=Football 2003: A season to remember|date = 14 January 2004|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/old/article_view.php3?view=2739&part=1|access-date=18 February 2009}}</ref>

{{see also|Houston Field House}}
The Houston Field House is a 4,780‑seat multi-purpose arena located on the RPI campus. It opened in 1949 and is home to the RPI Engineers men's and women's ice hockey teams. The Field House was renovated starting in 2007 as part of the major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village. The renovations included locker rooms upgrades, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/campaign/newsletter/houstonfield%20house.pdf|title=Houston Field House Renovation|access-date=10 September 2008}}</ref> Additionally, as part of the renovations through a government grant, solar panels were installed on the roof to supply power to the building.

As part of the Rensselaer Plan, the Institute recently completed a major project to improve its athletic facilities with the East Campus Athletic Village. The plan included construction of a new and much larger 4,842‑seat football stadium, a basketball arena with seating for 1,200, a new 50-meter pool, an indoor track and field complex, new tennis courts, new weight rooms and a new sports medicine center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/giving/athletics.html |title=Giving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Athletics |access-date=5 September 2011}}</ref> The Institute broke ground on 26 August 2007, and construction of the first phase is expected to last two years.<ref>{{cite press release |title= Rensselaer Breaks Ground for East Campus Athletic Village; First Phase to be Completed by Fall 2009 |url= http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=2289 |publisher=RPI |date= 4 September 2007 |access-date=3 March 2010}}</ref> The estimated cost of the project is $78&nbsp;million for phase one and $35–$45&nbsp;million for phase two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/about/inside/issue/v2n16/ecav-schedule.html|title=East Campus Athletic Village on Schedule for Fall 2009|access-date=20 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111003349/http://www.rpi.edu/about/inside/issue/v2n16/ecav-schedule.html|archive-date=11 January 2009}}</ref> Since the completion of the new stadium, the bleachers on the Class of '86 football field on the central campus have been removed and the field has become an open space. In the future the new space could be used for expansions of the academic buildings, but for now members of the campus planning team foresee a "historic landscape with different paths and access ways for students and vehicles alike".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.rpi.edu/old/article_view.php3?view=5262&part=1|author=The Polytechnic|title=Master Plan Undergoes Public Review|date=2 August 2007|access-date=2 December 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716101228/http://www.poly.rpi.edu/old/article_view.php3?view=5262&part=1|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref>

==Student Life==
[[File:RPIStudentUnion.jpg|thumb|400px|Student Union]]
The students of RPI have created and participate in a variety of clubs and organizations funded by the Student Union. About 170 of these organizations are funded by the Student Union, while another thirty, which consist mostly of political and religious organizations, are self-supporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.union.rpi.edu/landings/view/1|title=Rensselaer Union: Clubs and Organizations|publisher=Rensselaer Student Union|access-date=27 February 2010}}</ref> In 2006 the ''Princeton Review'' ranked RPI second for "more to do on campus."<ref>{{cite web|author=RPI press release|title="Princeton Review ranks RPI 2nd for "Most to do on Campus" |year=2006|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=1698|access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref> The Union was the last entirely student-run union at a private university in the United States until September 2017.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| title=Our Union no longer student-run |url=https://poly.rpi.edu/2018/09/05/our-union-no-longer-student-run/ |work=The Polytechnic |location=Troy, NY |date=5 September 2018 |access-date=18 September 2018}}</ref>

Phalanx is RPI's Senior Honor Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phalanx.union.rpi.edu/|title=Phalanx|access-date=9 October 2007}}</ref> It was founded in 1912, when Edward Dion and the Student Council organized a society to recognize those RPI students who had distinguished themselves among their peers in the areas of leadership, service and devotion to the ''alma mater''. It is a fellowship of the most active in student activities and has inducted more than 1,500 members since its founding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phalanx.union.rpi.edu/alumni |title=Phalanx Honor Society |access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

RPI has around twenty intramural sports organizations, many of which are broken down into different divisions based on level of play. Greek organizations compete in them as well as independent athletes. There are also thirty-nine club sports.

Given the university's proximity to the Berkshires, Green Mountains and Adirondacks, the Ski Club and the Outing Club are some of the largest groups on campus. The Ski Club offers weekly trips to local ski areas during the winter months,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skiclub.union.rpi.edu/|title=Ski Club website}}</ref> while the Outing Club offers trips on a weekly basis for a variety of activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outingclub-alpha.union.rpi.edu/|title=Rensselaer Outing Club website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430183141/http://outingclub-alpha.union.rpi.edu/|archive-date=30 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[The Rensselaer Polytechnic]]'' is the student-run weekly newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poly.union.rpi.edu/|title=''The Polytechnic'' Homepage|access-date=21 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121090409/http://poly.union.rpi.edu/|archive-date=21 January 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Poly'' printed about 7,000 copies each week and distributed them around campus until 2018 when the newspaper switched to online-only distribution due to budget concerns. Although it is the Union club with the largest budget, ''The Poly'' receives no subsidy from the Union, and obtains all funding through the sale of advertisements. There is also a popular student-run magazine called ''Statler & Waldorf'' which prints on a semesterly basis.<ref name="SW">{{cite web |url=http://sw.union.rpi.edu/|title=Statler & Waldorf|access-date=26 May 2008}}</ref>

RPI has an improvisational comedy group, Sheer Idiocy, which performs several shows a semester.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://sheeridiocy.union.rpi.edu/|title = Sheer Idiocy Homepage|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref> There are also several music groups ranging from ''[[a cappella]]'' groups such as the Rusty Pipes, Partial Credit, the Rensselyrics and Duly Noted,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dulynoted.union.rpi.edu/|title=Duly Noted A Cappella|access-date=2 February 2009}}</ref> to several instrumental groups such as the Orchestra, the Jazz Band and a classical choral group, the Rensselaer Concert Choir.

Another notable organization on campus is [[WRPI]], the campus radio station. WRPI differs from most [[college radio]] in that it serves a {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} radius<ref>[http://www.wrpi.org/ 91.5 WRPI - The Upstate Underground - RPI College Radio - Troy, NY]. Wrpi.org. Retrieved 21 November 2013.</ref> including the greater [[Albany, New York|Albany]] area. With 10&nbsp;kW of broadcasting power, WRPI maintains a stronger signal than nearly all college radio stations and some commercial stations. WRPI currently broadcasts on 91.5&nbsp;FM in the Albany area.

[[File:RPIPlayhouse2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The RPI Playhouse]]
The RPI Players is an on‑campus theater group that was formed in 1929. The Players resided in the Old Gym until 1965 when they moved to their present location at the 15th&nbsp;Street Lounge. This distinctive red shingled building had been a USO hall for the U.S.&nbsp;Army before being purchased by RPI. The Players have staged over 275 productions in its history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.players.rpi.edu/About/productions.php|title=RPI Players History|access-date=18 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061511/http://www.players.rpi.edu/About/productions.php|archive-date=25 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===RPI songs===
{{Main|RPI songs}}
There are a number of songs commonly played and sung at RPI events.<ref name="songs">{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rpi.edu/Archives/traditions/songs/songs.html|title=RPI Songs|publisher=RPI Archives and Collections|access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="stutt songs">{{cite web |url=http://stutt.net/rensselaer/index.php/songs |title=Songs |publisher=Stutt.net RPI Information |access-date=5 September 2011}}</ref> Notable among them are:
* "The Alma Mater (Here's to Old RPI)" – sung at formal events such as [[graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], also played and sung by the [[pep band|Pep Band]] at hockey and football games, and played daily at noon by the quadrangle bell tower. It was published in the first book of ''Songs of Rensselaer'' printed in 1913.
* "Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer" – used to be the [[fight song]] during the 1960s. It is still played today by the Pep Band at athletic events.
* "All We've Learned at Rensselaer" – sung at the RPI commencement ceremonies by the Rensselyrics. Although the Rensselyrics are an ''[[a cappella]]'' group, this song is accompanied by piano. Each verse or section has a different musical style, several of which are closely based on [[Billy Joel]] songs or other popular songs.

===First Year Experience and CLASS programs===
Another notable aspect of student life at RPI is the "[[First-Year Experience]]" (FYE) program. Freshman begin their stay at RPI with a week called "Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond" or NRB week. The Office of the First-Year Experience provides several programs that extend to not only freshman, but to all students. These include family weekend, community service days, the Information and Personal Assistance Center (IPAC), and the Community Advocate Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fye.rpi.edu/update.do?catcenterkey=8|title=About FYE|access-date=23 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218120720/http://www.fye.rpi.edu/update.do?catcenterkey=8|archive-date=18 February 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FYE program was awarded the 2006 NASPA Excellence Gold Award, in the category of "Enrollment Management, Orientation, Parents, First-Year, Other-Year and related".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/campusnews/update.do?artcenterkey=1943|title=Rensselaer's First-Year Experience Program recognized Among the Best in the Country|access-date=23 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304185131/http://news.rpi.edu/campusnews/update.do?artcenterkey=1943|archive-date=4 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 2008, Jackson's administration has led an effort to form the CLASS Initiative ("Clustered Learning Advocacy and Support for Students"), which requires all sophomores to [[Dormitory|live on campus]] and to live with special "residence cluster deans".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rpi.edu/about/inside/issue/v2n20/class.html|title=Rensselaer's CLASS Program: a Transformation in the Making|date=5 December 2008|publisher=Inside Rensselaer|access-date=25 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191415/http://www.rpi.edu/about/inside/issue/v2n20/class.html|archive-date=27 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>
The transition to this program began in early 2010 among some resistance from some fraternities and students who had planned to live off campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/?p=1268 |title=Housing grant policy changes announced|access-date=19 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/?p=1253|title=Housing policy not quite there |last=Lottman |first=Kelley |date=17 February 2010|newspaper=The Rensselaer Polytechnic|access-date=25 February 2010}}</ref>
