The '''Suez Canal''' ({{lang-ar|قناة السويس}} ''{{transl|arz|ALA|qanāt as-suwēs}}'') is an artificial [[sea-level]] [[waterway]] in [[Egypt]], connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Red Sea]] through the [[Isthmus of Suez]]. It is often considered to define the border between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Constructed by the [[Suez Canal Company]] between 1859 and 1869, it officially opened on 17 November that year. The [[canal]], which is part of the Maritime [[Silk Road]], offers [[watercraft]] a more direct route between the [[Atlantic Ocean#NORTH ATLANTIC|North Atlantic]] and northern [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London, for example, by approximately {{convert|8900|km||abbr=}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.worldshipping.org/pdf/suez-canal-presentation.pdf| title= The Suez Canal - A vital shortcut for global commerce|publisher= [[World Shipping Council]] }}</ref> It extends from the northern terminus of [[Port Said]] to the southern terminus of [[Port Tewfik]] at the city of [[Suez]]. Its length is {{convert|193.30|km|mi|abbr= on}} including its northern and southern access-channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (an average of 47 per day).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/TRstat.aspx?reportId=3 | title= Yearly Number & Net Tone by Ship Type,Direction & Ship Status | publisher = Suez Canal | access-date = 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100215214021/http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/TRstat.aspx?reportId=3| archive-date= 2010-02-15|url-status= dead}}</ref>

The original canal featured a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the [[Great Bitter Lake]].<ref>[http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg Suez Canal Authority]</ref> It contained no [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] systems, with seawater flowing freely through it. In general, the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. South of the lakes, the current changes with the [[tide]] at Suez.<ref name = rsp>{{cite book|title= The Red Sea Pilot|publisher= Imray Laurie Norie & Wilson|year= 1995|page= 266}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}</ref>

The [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] owned the canal until July 1956, when the [[President of Egypt]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[nationalisation|nationalized]] it—an event which led to the [[Suez Crisis]] of October–November 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|date= 2009-11-09|url= https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/suez-crisis|title= Suez Crisis|author= ((History.com Editors))|website= HISTORY|publisher=A&E Television Networks|access-date= 2019-04-17}}</ref> The canal is owned and maintained by the [[Suez Canal Authority]]<ref>{{cite web |title= SCA Overview |url= https://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/English/About/SuezCanalAuthority/Pages/SCAOverview.aspx |publisher= [[Suez Canal Authority]] |access-date= 25 July 2019}}</ref> (SCA) of Egypt.

Navies with coastlines and bases on both the Mediterranean and Red Seas ([[Egyptian Navy|Egypt]] and [[Israeli Navy|Israel]]) have a particular interest in the Suez Canal.

In August 2014, the Egyptian government launched construction to expand and widen the Ballah Bypass for {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr= on}} to speed the canal's transit-time. The expansion intended to nearly double the capacity of the Suez Canal, from 49 to 97 ships per day.<ref name="SuezExpansion">{{cite news|title= New Suez Canal project proposed by Egypt to boost trade|url= http://www.caironews.net/index.php/sid/224460353|access-date= 7 August 2014|publisher= caironews.net}}</ref> At a cost of 59.4 billion Egyptian pounds (US${{To USD|59.451911912|EGY|year=2014|round=yes}}bn), this project was funded with [[Sukuk|interest-bearing investment certificates]] issued exclusively to Egyptian entities and individuals. The "[[New Suez Canal]]", as the expansion was dubbed, was opened with great fanfare in a ceremony on 6 August 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.sky.com/story/1531052/egypt-opens-new-6bn-suez-canal|title= Egypt Opens New £6bn Suez Canal|first= Sherine|last= Tadros|agency= Sky News|date= 6 August 2015|access-date= 6 August 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160419020538/http://news.sky.com/story/1531052/egypt-opens-new-6bn-suez-canal|archive-date= 19 April 2016|url-status= dead}}</ref>

On 24 February 2016, the Suez Canal Authority officially opened the new side channel. This side channel, located at the northern side of the east extension of the Suez Canal, serves the East Terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal.  As the East Container Terminal is located on the Canal itself, before the construction of the new side channel it was not possible to berth or unberth vessels at the terminal while a convoy was running.<ref name="MyUser_News.xinhuanet.com_March_12_2016c">

In his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', [[Aristotle]] wrote:
<blockquote>One of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land.

[[Strabo]] wrote that Sesostris started to build a canal, and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote:

<blockquote>165. Next comes the [[Tyro]] tribe and, the harbour of the [[Daneoi]], from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as [[Nile Delta|the Delta]]; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again [[Ptolemy II]], who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.<ref>The Elder Pliny and John Healey ''Natural History'' (6.33.165) Penguin Classics; Reprint edition (5 February 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-14-044413-1}} p.&nbsp;70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvyF-8NXFbIC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=Pliny+the+elder+sesostris+canal&source=bl&ots=t1np0DY4S3&sig=i0wzXRGizdz6DK8e6CTGA1wFcoI&hl=en&ei=BieVSv3GE-PKjAfU-OnnDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=&f=false books.google.com]</ref></blockquote>

=== Canals dug by Necho, Darius I and Ptolemy ===
Remnants of an ancient west–east canal through the [[ancient Egypt]]ian cities of [[Bubastis]], [[Avaris|Pi-Ramesses]], and [[Pithom]] were discovered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his engineers and cartographers in 1799.<ref name="Rappoport" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0GAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA2-PA351&lpg=RA2-PA351&dq=Gratien+Le+P%C3%A8re&source=bl&ots=h-ZAEgY_yZ&sig=2vmD6bS3Cj-XwCRdc_uLueFseXQ&hl=en&ei=6blFStHdO8PdsgaKxaQs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9  ''Descriptions de l'Égypte'', Volume 11 (État Moderne)], containing ''Mémoire sur la communication de la mer des Indes à la Méditerranée par la mer Rouge et l'Isthme de Sueys'', par M.

According to the ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]'' of the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]],<ref>Herodotus ii.158.</ref> about 600&nbsp;BCE, [[Necho II]] undertook to dig a west–east canal through the Wadi Tumilat between Bubastis and [[Pithom|Heroopolis]],<ref name="Rappoport" /> and perhaps continued it to the [[Heroopolite Gulf]] and the Red Sea.<ref name="Britannica" /> Regardless, Necho is reported as having never completed his project.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" />

Herodotus was told that 120,000 men perished in this undertaking, but this figure is doubtless exaggerated.<ref>"The figure '120,000' is doubtless exaggerated. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehemet Ali]] lost only 10,000 in making the Mahmûdieh Canal (from the Nile to Alexandria)." remarked W. W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus''.</ref> According to [[Pliny the Elder]], Necho's extension to the canal was about 57 English miles,<ref name="Rappoport" /> equal to the total distance between Bubastis and the Great Bitter Lake, allowing for winding through [[valley]]s.<ref name="Rappoport" /> The length that Herodotus tells, of over 1000 [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] (i.e., over {{convert|114|mi|km}}), must be understood to include the entire distance between the Nile and the Red Sea<ref name="Rappoport" /> at that time.

With Necho's death, work was discontinued. Herodotus tells that the reason the project was abandoned was because of a warning received from an [[oracle]] that others would benefit from its successful completion.<ref name="Rappoport" /><ref>According to Herodotus, work on the project was "stayed by a prophetic utterance that he [Necho] was toiling beforehand for the barbarian. The Egyptians call all men of other languages [[barbarian]]s." (Herodotus, ''eo. loc.''.)</ref> Necho's war with [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] most probably prevented the canal's continuation.

Necho's project was completed by [[Darius I of Persia]], who ruled over [[Ancient Egypt]] after it had been conquered by his predecessor [[Cambyses II]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90718/Cambyses-II|title=Cambyses II - king of Persia |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> It may be that by Darius's time a natural<ref name="Rappoport" /> waterway passage which had existed<ref name="Britannica" /> between the Heroopolite Gulf and the Red Sea<ref name="location">Apparently, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]] considered the Great Bitter Lake as a northern extension of the Red Sea, whereas Darius had not, because [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]] is located north of Shaluf. (See Naville, "Map of the Wadi Tumilat", referenced above.)</ref> in the vicinity of the Egyptian town of Shaluf<ref name="Rappoport" /> (alt. ''Chalouf''<ref>Please refer to [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions]].</ref> or ''Shaloof''<ref name="Naville"/>), located just south of the Great Bitter Lake,<ref name="Rappoport" /><ref name="Naville" /> had become so blocked<ref name="Britannica" /> with [[silt]]<ref name="Rappoport" /> that Darius needed to clear it out so as to allow [[navigation]]<ref name="Rappoport" /> once again. According to Herodotus, Darius's canal was wide enough that two [[trireme]]s could pass each other with oars extended, and required four days to traverse. Darius commemorated his achievement with a number of [[granite]] [[stela]]e that he set up on the Nile bank, including one near Kabret, and a further one a few miles north of [[Suez]]. The [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions|Darius Inscriptions]] read:<ref>{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=https://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dz/ |title=Darius' Suez Inscriptions |publisher=Livius.org |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>

{{quote|Saith King Darius: I am a Persian. Setting out from Persia, I conquered Egypt. I ordered this canal dug from the river called the Nile that flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia. When the canal had been dug as I ordered, ships went from Egypt through this canal to Persia, even as I intended.|Darius Inscription}}

The canal left the Nile at Bubastis. An inscription<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_16.html|title=Pithom Stele - translation of inscription|website=www.attalus.org}}</ref> on a pillar at [[Pithom]] records that in 270 or 269&nbsp;BCE, it was again reopened, by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. In [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]],<ref name="Rappoport" /> Ptolemy constructed a [[Lock (water transport)|navigable lock]], with [[sluice]]s, at the Heroopolite Gulf of the Red Sea,<ref name="location" /> which allowed the passage of vessels but prevented salt water from the Red Sea from mingling with the fresh water in the canal.<ref>R. E. Gmirkin, "Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic Histories and the Date of the Pentateuch", p.&nbsp;236</ref>

=== Receding Red Sea and the dwindling Nile ===
The Red Sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries, its coastline slowly moving southward away from [[Lake Timsah]]<ref name="Columbia"/><ref name="Naville" /> and the Great Bitter Lake.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> Coupled with persistent accumulations of Nile [[silt]], maintenance and repair of Ptolemy's canal became increasingly cumbersome over each passing century.

Two hundred years after the construction of Ptolemy's canal, [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] seems to have had no west–east waterway passage,<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> because the [[Pelusiac branch]] of the Nile, which fed Ptolemy's west–east canal, had by that time dwindled, being choked with silt.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" />

=== Old Cairo to the Red Sea ===
By the 8th century, a navigable canal existed between [[Old Cairo]] and the Red Sea,<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> but accounts vary as to who ordered its construction—either [[Trajan]] or [['Amr ibn al-'As]], or [[Umar|Omar the Great]].<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> This canal was reportedly linked to the River Nile at Old Cairo<ref name="Rappoport" /> and ended near modern [[Suez]].<ref name="Britannica" /><ref>[[August Heinrich Petermann|Petermann, A.]] ''Karte Der Bai Von Súes'' (1856). Nach der Engl. Aufnahme v. Comm. Mansell.</ref> A geography [[treatise]] "Liber De Mensura Orbis Terrae" written by the Irish monk Dicuil (born late 8th century) reports a conversation with another monk, Fidelis, who had sailed on the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the first half of the 8th century<ref>[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] ''Bible and Sword: How the British came to Palestine'' MacMillan, London (1987) {{ISBN|0-333-33414-0}}</ref>

The [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] is said to have ordered this canal closed in 767 to prevent supplies from reaching [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] detractors.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" />

=== Repair by al-Ḥākim ===
[[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] is claimed to have repaired the Cairo to Red Sea passageway,<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> but only briefly, circa 1000 CE,<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" /> as it soon "became choked with sand".<ref name="Rappoport" /> However, we are told that parts of this canal still continued to fill in during the Nile's annual inundations.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Rappoport" />

=== Conception by Venice ===
The successful 1488 navigation of southern Africa by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] opened a direct maritime [[trading route to India]] and the spice islands, and forever changed the balance of Mediterranean trade. One of the most prominent losers in the new order, as former middlemen, was the former spice trading center of [[Venice]].

{{Quotation|Venetian leaders, driven to desperation, contemplated digging a waterway between the Red Sea and the Nile—anticipating the Suez Canal by almost 400 years—to bring the luxury trade flooding to their doors again. But this remained a dream.|Colin Thubron, ''Seafarers: The Venetians'' (1980), p. 102}}

Despite entering negotiations with Egypt's ruling Mamelukes, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] plan to build the canal was quickly put to rest by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt in 1517]], led by Sultan [[Selim I]].<ref>Starthern, P (2013) "The Venetians" p. 175</ref>

=== Ottoman attempts ===
During the 16th century, the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu_Mehmed_Pasha|Sokollu Pasha]] attempted to construct a canal connecting the [[Red Sea]] and the Mediterranean. This was motivated by a desire to connect [[Constantinople]] to the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] and [[trade routes]] of the [[Indian Ocean]], as well as by strategic concerns—as the European presence in the Indian Ocean was growing, Ottoman mercantile and strategic interests were [[Ottoman-Portuguese confrontations|increasingly challenged]], and the [[Sublime Porte]] was increasingly pressed to [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|assert its position]]. A navigable canal would allow the [[Ottoman Navy]] to connect its [[Red Sea]], [[Black Sea]], and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] fleets. However, this project was deemed too expensive, and was never completed.<ref>Ortega, Stephen (2012). "The Ottoman Age of Exploration".

=== Napoleon's discovery of an ancient canal ===
During the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in late 1798, [[Napoleon]] showed an interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage. This culminated in a cadre of [[archaeologist]]s, scientists, [[cartographer]]s and engineers scouring northern Egypt.<ref name="Linda Hall">{{cite book|first=Linda|last= Hall|publisher=Kansas City, Missouri|url=http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/suez_canal.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214040954/http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/suez_canal.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-14|title=The Search for the Ancient Suez Canal}}</ref><ref>Please refer to [[Description de l'Égypte]].</ref> Their findings, recorded in the ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', include detailed maps that depict the discovery of an ancient canal extending northward from the Red Sea and then westward toward the Nile.<ref name="Linda Hall" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0GAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA2-PA351&lpg=RA2-PA351&dq=Gratien+Le+P%C3%A8re&source=bl&ots=h-ZAEgY_yZ&sig=2vmD6bS3Cj-XwCRdc_uLueFseXQ&hl=en&ei=6blFStHdO8PdsgaKxaQs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9  ''Descriptions de l'Égypte'', Volume 11 (État Moderne)], containing ''Mémoire sur la communication de la mer des Indes à la Méditerranée par la mer Rouge et l'Isthme de Sueys'',

Later, Napoleon, who would become French Emperor in 1804, contemplated the construction of a north–south canal to connect the Mediterranean with the Red Sea. But the plan was abandoned because it wrongly concluded that the waterway would require locks to operate. These would be very expensive and take a long time to construct. This decision was based on an erroneous belief that the Red Sea was {{convert|8.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the Mediterranean. The error was the result of using fragmentary survey measurements taken in wartime during Napoleon's Egyptian Expedition.<ref>Wilson, ''The Suez Canal''{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}</ref> In 1819 the Pacha of Egypt undertook some canal work.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 February 1820 |title=[untitled] |at=p. 2, col. 1.|work=The Hobart Town Gazette |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article657661 |access-date=4 May 2017}}

However, as late as 1861, the unnavigable ancient route discovered by Napoleon from [[Bubastis]] to the Red Sea still channeled water in spots as far east as [[Kassassin]].<ref name="Rappoport"/>

=== Interim period ===
[[File:Suez1856.jpg|thumb|[[Bathymetric chart]], northern [[Gulf of Suez]], route to [[Old Cairo|Cairo]], 1856]]

Although the alleged difference in sea levels could be problematic for construction, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive. In 1830, [[Francis Rawdon Chesney|F. R. Chesney]] submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention. [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn|Lieutenant Waghorn]] established his "Overland Route", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt.

[[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], a French explorer of Egypt, became chief engineer of [[Egyptian Public Works|Egypt's Public Works]]. In addition to his normal duties, he surveyed the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and made plans for the Suez Canal. French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonianists]] showed an interest in the canal and in 1833, [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]] tried to draw [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali's]] attention to the canal but was unsuccessful. [[Alois Negrelli]], the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] railroad pioneer, became interested in the idea in 1836.

In 1846, Prosper Enfantin's [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] invited a number of experts, among them [[Robert Stephenson]], Negrelli and [[Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue]] to study the feasibility of the Suez Canal (with the assistance of Linant de Bellefonds). Bourdaloue's survey of the isthmus was the first generally accepted evidence that there was no practical difference in altitude between the two seas. Britain, however, feared that a canal open to everyone might interfere with its [[British Raj|India]] trade and therefore preferred a connection by train from [[Alexandria]] via [[Cairo]] to Suez, which was eventually built by Stephenson.

===Construction by the Suez Canal Company===

====Preparations (1854–1858)====
In 1854 and 1856, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] obtained a concession from [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]], to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening. De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s. As stipulated in the concessions, Ferdinand convened the [[International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez]] (''Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme des Suez'') consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them [[John Robinson McClean]], later President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal. After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/percementdelist00lessgoog/page/n401 <!-- pg=377 --> ''Percement de l'isthme de Suez.

On Google Books (french)</ref> The Suez Canal Company (''[[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]'') came into being on 15 December 1858.

====Construction (1859–1869)====
Work started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859.

[[File:Suez Canal drawing 1881.jpg|thumb|upright|1881 drawing of the Suez Canal]]

The excavation took some 10 years, with [[forced labour]] ([[corvée]]) being employed until 1864 to dig-out the canal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tools of Empire : Technology and European Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century|last=Headrick|first=Daniel R.|date=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-502831-7|pages=151–153|oclc=905456588}}</ref> Some sources estimate that over 30,000 people were working on the canal at any given period, that more than 1.5 million people from various countries were employed, and that thousands of labourers died, many of them from cholera and similar epidemics.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Arnold.

The British government had opposed the project from the outset to its completion. As one of the diplomatic moves against the canal, it disapproved of the use of "slave labour" of forced workers. Great Britain was the major global naval power and officially condemned the forced work. Involuntary labour on the project ceased, and the viceroy condemned the corvée, halting the project.<ref>Oster (2006)</ref>

Initially international opinion was skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas. Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] did not buy a significant number of shares. However, with assistance from the Cattaui banking family, and their relationship with [[James Mayer de Rothschild|James de Rothschild]] of the [[Rothschild banking family of France|French House of Rothschild]] bonds and shares were successfully promoted in France and other parts of Europe.<ref>There is differing information on the exact amounts</ref> All French shares were quickly sold in France. A contemporary British skeptic claimed "One thing is sure... our local merchant community doesn't pay practical attention at all to this grand work, and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal's receipts... could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee. It will never become a large ship's accessible way in any case."<ref>[http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html (reported by German historian Uwe A.

===Inauguration (17 November 1869)===

The canal opened under French control in November 1869. The opening ceremonies began at Port Said on the evening of 15 November, with illuminations, fireworks, and a banquet on the yacht of the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]]. The royal guests arrived the following morning: the [[Eugénie de Montijo|French Empress Eugenie]] in the Imperial yacht ''L'Aigle''; the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince]] of [[Prussia]]; and [[Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse|Prince Louis of Hesse]].<ref name=Scotsman>{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Russel|title=Egypt: The Opening of the Great Canal|date=1869|publisher="Scotsman" Office|place=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/egyptopeninggre00russgoog}}</ref> Other international guests included the American natural historian [[H.

In the evening there were more illuminations and fireworks.<ref name=Scotsman/>

On the morning of 17 November, a procession of ships entered the canal, headed by the ''L'Aigle''. Among the ships following was [[HMS Newport (1867)|HMS ''Newport'']], captained by [[George Nares]], which would survey the canal on behalf of the [[Admiralty]] a few months later<ref name="Ritchie">{{cite book |last1=Ritchie |first1=G.S. |title=The Admiralty Chart |date=1967 |publisher=Hollis & Carter |location=London |pages=317–319}}</ref>. The ''Newport'' was involved in an incident that demonstrated some of the problems with the canal. There were suggestions that the depth of parts of the canal at the time of the inauguration were not as great as promised, and that the deepest part of the channel was not always clear, leading to a risk of grounding.<ref name=Scotsman/><ref>{{cite journal|first=G.H.|last=Richards|title=Suez Canal, with directions for is pilotage|date=1869|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London|volume=14|issue=1|pages=75–78|jstor=1799610|doi=10.2307/1799610}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=J.F.|last=Bateman|title=Some Account of the Suez Canal, in a Letter to the President|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London

The French ship ''Péluse'' anchored close to the entrance, then swung around and grounded, the ship and its hawser blocking the way into the lake. The following boats had to anchor in the canal itself until the ''Péluse'' was hauled clear the next morning, making it difficult for them to join that night's celebration in [[Ismailia]]. Except for the ''Newport''. Nares sent out a boat to carry out soundings, and was able to manoeuver around the ''Péluse'' to enter the lake and anchor there for the night.<ref name=PallMall>{{cite news|title=The Opening of the Suez Canal|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000098/18691130/014/0011|access-date=2019-10-05|work=Pall Mall Gazette (the paper's correspondent was on board HMS Newport)|date=30 November 1869|location=London|page=11}}</ref><ref>This incident appears to have been the basis for a myth that the ''Newport'' manoeuvered around the assembled yachts on the night of 16th/17th November, and beat the ''Aigle'' to be the first boat through the canal (see Talk)</ref>

===Initial difficulties (1869–1871)===
Although numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome, the [[Cost overrun|final cost]] was more than double the original estimate.

The Khedive, in particular, was able to overcome initial reservations held by both British and French creditors by enlisting the help of the [[Sursock family]], whose deep connections proved invaluable in securing much international support for the project.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kassir |first=Samir |year=2011 |orig-year=2010 |title=Beirut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97owDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 |translator=M.

After the opening, the Suez Canal Company was in financial difficulties. The remaining works were completed only in 1871, and traffic was below expectations in the first two years. De Lesseps therefore tried to increase revenues by interpreting the kind of net ton referred to in the second concession (''tonneau de capacité'') as meaning a ship's cargo capacity and not only the theoretical [[net tonnage]] of the "[[Moorsom System]]" introduced in Britain by the Merchant Shipping Act in 1854. The ensuing commercial and diplomatic activities resulted in the International Commission of Constantinople establishing a specific kind of net tonnage and settling the question of tariffs in its protocol of 18 December 1873.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/documentsdiplom21trgoog#page/n125/mode/1up Protocol of the Commission] (in Ffrench)</ref> This was the origin of the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Net Tonnage]] and the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate]], both of which are still in use today.

=== Company rule after opening ===

The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on [[Global trade|world trade]]. Combined with the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|American transcontinental railroad]] completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time. It played an important role in increasing [[European colonization of Africa]]. The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the [[Panic of 1873]], because goods from the Far East were carried in sailing vessels around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and were stored in British warehouses. An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, [[Isma'il Pasha]], in 1875 to sell his 44% share in the canal for £4,000,000 ($19.2 million), equivalent to £432 million to £456 million ($540 million to $570 million) in 2019, to the government of the United Kingdom.<ref>(£1 in 1875 = £109–114; 2019 Historical Uk Inflation Rates and Calculator; UK Inflation (CPI) Calculator - What's the Cost)</ref> French shareholders still held the majority.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 24429312|title = Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: Some Myths Reassessed|journal = History|volume = 97|issue = 2 (326)|pages = 182–203|last1 = Hicks|first1 = Geoffrey|year = 2012|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.2012.00548.x}}</ref> Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire. The British representative 1883 to 1907 was [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer]], who reorganized and modernized the government and suppressed rebellions and corruption, thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 175255|title = Lord Cromer: Practitioner and Philosopher of Imperialism|journal = Journal of British Studies|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 142–159|last1 = Tignor|first1 = Robert L.|year = 1963|doi = 10.1086/385467}}</ref>

The [[Convention of Constantinople]] in 1888 declared the canal a neutral zone under the protection of the British, who had occupied Egypt and Sudan at the request of [[Khedive]] [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfiq]] to suppress the [[Urabi Revolt]] against his rule. The revolt went on from 1879 to 1882. As a result of British involvement on the side of Khedive Tewfiq, Britain gained control of the canal in 1882. The British defended the strategically important passage against a major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[First Suez Offensive|attack]] in 1915, during the [[First World War]].<ref name="FWW87">''First World War'' – Willmott, H.P. [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Page 87</ref> Under the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], the UK retained control over the canal. The canal was again strategically important in the 1939–1945 [[Second World War]], and Italo-German attempts to capture it were repulsed during the [[North Africa Campaign]], during which the canal was closed to [[Axis powers|Axis]] shipping.  In 1951 Egypt repudiated the treaty and in October 1954 the UK agreed to remove its troops. Withdrawal was completed on 18 July 1956.

=== Suez Crisis ===

[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|left|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the Suez Canal hit during the initial [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French assault]] on [[Port Said]], 5 November 1956]]

Because of Egyptian overtures towards the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] withdrew their pledge to support the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] responded by [[nationalizing]] the canal on 26 July 1956<ref>{{cite web|title=The Suez Canal formally opened to ships|url=http://stratscope.com/the-suez-canal-formally-opened-to-ships/|website=stratscope.com|publisher=StratScope|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> and transferring it to the [[Suez Canal Authority]], intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the canal. On the same day that the canal was nationalized Nasser also closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to all Israeli ships.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_2701000/2701603.stm|title=1956: Egypt seizes Suez Canal|date=26 July 1956|work=BBC News}}</ref> This led to the [[Suez Crisis]] in which the UK, France, and [[Israel]] invaded Egypt. According to the pre-agreed war plans under the [[Protocol of Sèvres]], Israel invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French]] partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war – officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Dean Memorandum |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/https://nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2006/december/dean.htm |website=The National Archives |publisher=Government of UK |access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rhodes James |first1=Robert |title=Excerpt from "Anthony Eden: A Biography" |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20161207034157/https://nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2006/december/fco-73-205-1.htm |website=The National Archives |publisher=Government of UK |access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shlaim |first1=Avi |title=The Protocol of Sèvres, 1956: Anatomy of a War Plot |journal=International Affairs |date=1997 |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=509–530 |doi=10.2307/2624270 |jstor=2624270 |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/The%20Protocol%20of%20Sevres%201956%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20War%20Plot.html |access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref>

To save the British from what he thought was a disastrous action and to stop the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which [[Mandate (international law)|mandated]] the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of [[Pound sterling|sterling]], which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year. Pearson was later awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance.<ref>''The Other Side of Suez'' (documentary) – 2003</ref> A UN force ([[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]]) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.

===Arab–Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973===
[[File:Egyptianbridge.jpg|thumb|Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal on 7 October 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]
[[File:Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|Israeli tank crossing the Suez Canal, 1973]]

In May 1967, Nasser ordered the UN peacekeeping forces out of Sinai, including the Suez Canal area. Israel objected to the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping. The canal had been closed to Israeli shipping since 1949, except for a short period in 1951–1952.

After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces occupied the Sinai peninsula, including the entire east bank of the Suez Canal. Unwilling to allow the Israelis to use the canal, Egypt immediately imposed a blockade which closed the canal to all shipping. Fifteen cargo ships, known as the "[[Yellow Fleet]]", were trapped in the canal, and would remain there until 1975.

In 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], the canal was the scene of [[Operation Badr (1973)|a major crossing]] by the Egyptian army into Israeli-occupied Sinai and a counter-crossing by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] to Egypt. Much wreckage from this conflict remains visible along the canal's edges.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-02-09|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/egypt-opens-the-suez-canal|title=Egypt opens the Suez Canal|author= ((History.com Editors))|website=HISTORY|publisher=A&E Television Networks|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>

===Mine clearing operations (1974–75)===
After the Yom Kippur War, the United States initiated [[Operation Nimbus Moon]]. The [[amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Inchon (LPH-12)|USS ''Inchon (LPH-12)'']] was sent to the Canal, carrying 12 [[CH-53 Sea Stallion|RH-53D]] minesweeping helicopters of [[Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12|HM-12]]. These partly cleared the canal between May and December 1974. She was relieved by the LST [[USS Barnstable County|USS ''Barnstable County'']] (LST1197).

The [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] mandate expired in 1979. Despite the efforts of the United States, Israel, Egypt, and others to obtain an extension of the UN role in observing the peace between Israel and Egypt, as called for under the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979, the mandate could not be extended because of the veto by the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[UN Security Council]], at the request of [[Syria]]. Accordingly, negotiations for a new observer force in the Sinai produced the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] (MFO), stationed in Sinai in 1981 in coordination with a phased Israeli withdrawal. It is there under agreements between the United States, Israel, Egypt, and other nations.<ref>([http://www.mfo.org/ Multinational Force and Observers])</ref>

=== Bypass expansion ===
{{Main|New Suez Canal}}

In the summer of 2014, months after taking office as [[President of Egypt]], [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from {{convert|61|m}} wide to {{convert|312|m}} wide for {{convert|35|km}}. The project was called the [[New Suez Canal]], as it would allow ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/completes-waterway-egypt394813.aspx|title=Egypt Completes New Waterway in Suez Canal|first=Aiswarya|last=Lakshmi|date=17 July 2015|access-date=6 August 2015|agency=MarineLink}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/135544/Business/Economy/Egypt-completes-dredging-for-new-waterway-in-Suez-.aspx|title=Egypt completes dredging for new waterway in Suez Canal|date=16 July 2015|access-date=6 August 2015|work=Al-Ahram}}</ref> The project cost more than E£59.4 billion (US${{To USD|59.451911912 |EGY|year=2014|round=yes}}bn) and was completed within one year.

=== Timeline ===
{{more citations needed|section|reason=Citations needed for items that are not already cited in article text|date=November 2018}}

* Circa 1799: Napoleon Bonaparte conquers Egypt and orders a feasibility analysis. This reports a supposed {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} difference in sea levels and a high cost, so the project is put on hold.
* Circa 1840: A second survey finds the first analysis incorrect. A direct link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea is possible and not as expensive as previously estimated.
* 30 November 1854: The former French consul in Cairo, Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps, obtains the first license for construction and subsequent operation from the Viceroy for a period of 99 years.
* 6 January 1856: de Lesseps is provided with a second, more detailed license.
* 15 December 1858: de Lesseps establishes the "Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez", with [[Said of Egypt|Said Pasha]] acquiring 22% of the Suez Canal Company; the majority is controlled by French private holders.
* 25 April 1859: construction officially starts.
* 17 November 1869: The canal is opened, owned and operated by Suez Canal Company.
* 18 December 1873: The International Commission of Constantinople establishes the Suez Canal Net Ton and the Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate (as known today)
* 25 November 1875: Britain becomes a minority share holder in the company, acquiring 44%, with the remainder being controlled by French business syndicates.
* 20 May 1882: Britain [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|invades]] Egypt, with French assistance, and begins its occupation of Egypt.
* 25 August 1882: Britain takes control of the canal.
* 2 March 1888: The [[Convention of Constantinople]] renews the guaranteed right of passage of all ships through the canal during war and peace; these rights were already part of the licenses awarded to de Lesseps, but are recognised as international law.
* 14 November 1936: Following a [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|new treaty]], Britain theoretically pulls out of Egypt, but establishes the 'Suez Canal Zone' under its control.
* 13 June 1956: Suez Canal Zone is restored to Egyptian sovereignty, following British withdrawal and years of negotiations.
* 26 July 1956: Egypt nationalizes the company; its Egyptian assets, rights and obligations are transferred to the Suez Canal Authority, which compensates the previous owners at the established pre-nationalization price. Egypt closes the canal to Israeli shipping as part of a broader blockade involving the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba.
* 31 October 1956 to 24 April 1957: the canal is blocked to shipping following the [[Suez Crisis]], a conflict that leads to an Israeli, French, and British occupation of the canal zone.
* 22 December 1956: The canal zone is restored to Egyptian control, following French and British withdrawal, and the landing of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] troops.
* 5 June 1967 to 10 June 1975: the canal is blocked by Egypt, following the [[Six-Day War|war with Israel]]; it becomes the front line during the ensuing [[War of Attrition]] and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]], remaining closed to international shipping, until [[Sinai Interim Agreement|general agreement]] was near.
* 1 January 2008: New rules of navigation passed by the Suez Canal Authority come into force.
* 6 August 2015: The new canal extensions are opened.

The current parameters of the Suez Canal, including both individual canals of the parallel section are: depth {{convert|23|to|24|m|0}} and width at least {{convert|205|to|225|m|0}} (that width measured at {{convert|11|m|0}} of depth).<ref>{{cite web|title="Attached Charts" to Navigation Circular "The New Suez Canal" No 5/2015|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/Files/Circular/Suez%20Canal%20Cross%20Section.pdf|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|access-date=2015-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824031507/http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/Files/Circular/Suez%20Canal%20Cross%20Section.pdf|archive-date=24 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Capacity ===
{{see also|Suezmax}}

The canal allows passage of ships up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[draft (hull)|draft]] or 240,000 [[deadweight ton]]s and up to a height of {{convert|68|m|ft|abbr=on}} above water level and a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} under certain conditions.<ref name="suezcanal.gov.eg">Suez Canal Authority http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=12|title=Canal Characteristics|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|year=2010|access-date=14 April 2010}}</ref> The canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the [[Panama Canal]], as [[Suezmax]] dimensions are greater than both [[Panamax]] and [[New Panamax]]. Some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal. Others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned boat to reduce their draft, transit, and reload at the other end of the canal.

=== Navigation ===
The canal has no [[canal lock|locks]] because of the flat terrain, and the minor sea level difference between each end is inconsequential for shipping. As the canal has no sea surge gates, the ports at the ends would be subject to the sudden impact of [[tsunami]]s from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, according to a 2012 article in the ''Journal of Coastal Research''.<ref name="FinklPelinovsky2012">{{cite journal|last1=Finkl|first1=Charles W.|last2=Pelinovsky|first2=Efim|last3=Cathcart|first3=Richard B.|title=A Review of Potential Tsunami Impacts to the Suez Canal|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=283|issue=4|year=2012|pages=745–759|issn=0749-0208|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12A-00002.1|bibcode=2012EGUGA..14...76F|s2cid=54644781}}</ref>

There is one shipping lane with passing areas in Ballah-Bypass near [[El Qantara]] and in the Great Bitter Lake. On a typical day, three convoys transit the canal, two southbound and one northbound. The passage takes between 11 and 16 hours at a speed of around {{convert|8|kn|km/h mph|0}}. The low speed helps prevent erosion of the banks by ships' [[wake]]s.

By 1955, about two-thirds of Europe's oil passed through the canal. Around 8% of world sea trade is carried via the canal. In 2008, 21,415 vessels passed through the canal and the receipts totaled $5.381 billion,<ref name="suezcanal.gov.eg"/> with an average cost per ship of $251,000.

New Rules of Navigation came into force on 1 January 2008, passed by the board of directors of the [[Suez Canal Authority]] (SCA) to organise vessels' transit. The most important amendments include allowing vessels with {{convert|62|ft|adj=on}} draught to pass, increasing the allowed breadth from {{convert|32|m}} to {{convert|40|m}} (following improvement operations), and imposing a fine on vessels using divers from outside the SCA inside the canal boundaries without permission. The amendments allow vessels loaded with dangerous cargo (such as radioactive or flammable materials) to pass if they conform with the latest amendments provided by international conventions.

The SCA has the right to determine the number of [[Tugboat|tugs]] required to assist warships traversing the canal, to achieve the highest degree of safety during transit.<ref>SC News</ref>

=== Operation ===
Before August 2015, the canal was too narrow for free two-way traffic, so ships would pass in convoys and use bypasses. The by-passes were {{convert|78|km|0|abbr=on}} out of {{convert|193|km|0|abbr=on}} (40%). From north to south, they are: Port Said by-pass (entrances) {{convert|36.5|km|0|abbr=on}}, Ballah by-pass & anchorage, {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}}, Timsah by-pass {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}}, and the Deversoir by-pass (northern end of the Great Bitter Lake) {{convert|27.5|km|0|abbr=on}}. The bypasses were completed in 1980.

Typically, it would take a ship 12 to 16 hours to transit the canal. The canal's 24-hour capacity was about 76 standard ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emdb.gov.eg/suezcanal/traffic.aspx|title=Traffic system|access-date=8 February 2013|publisher=Egyptian Maritime Data Bank (EMDB)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323104619/http://www.emdb.gov.eg/suezcanal/traffic.aspx|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In August 2014, Egypt chose a consortium that includes the Egyptian army and global engineering firm [[Dar Al-Handasah]] to develop an international industrial and logistics hub in the Suez Canal area,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN0G30HY20140803|title=Egypt awards Suez hub project to consortium that includes army: sources|first=Stephen Kalin and Yasmine|last=Saleh}}</ref> and began the construction of a new canal section from km 60 to km 95 combined with expansion and deep digging of the other 37&nbsp;km of the canal.<ref>http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=69</ref> This will allow navigation in both directions simultaneously in the 72&nbsp;km long central section of the canal.

=== Convoy sailing ===
Since the canal does not cater to unregulated two-way traffic, all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis. Each day, a single northbound convoy starts at 04:00 from Suez. At dual lane sections, the convoy uses the eastern route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=13|title=Traffic system|access-date=8 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729220823/http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=13|archive-date=29 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/showNc.aspx?id=105|title=Navigation Circular 5/2015|access-date=15 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821233723/http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/showNc.aspx?id=105|archive-date=21 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Navigation, Convoy System|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/NR.aspx?node=81|access-date=17 February 2013|publisher=Suez Canal Authority}}</ref> Synchronised with this convoy's passage is the southbound convoy.

=== Canal crossings ===
[[File:Suez canal english.jpg|thumb|upright|The canal in 2015]]

From north to south, the crossings are:
* The [[Suez Canal Bridge]] ({{coord|30.828248|N|32.317572|E|region:EG_type:landmark|name=Suez Canal Bridge}}), also called the Egyptian-Japanese Friendship Bridge, a high-level road bridge at [[El Qantara]]. In [[Arabic]], ''al qantara'' means "arch". Opened in 2001, it has a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} clearance over the canal and was built with assistance from the Japanese government and by [[Kajima]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kajima.co.jp/english/prof/overview/history_08.html |title=Kajima History |publisher=[[Kajima]] |access-date=23 March 2014}}</ref>
* [[El Ferdan Railway Bridge]] ({{Coord|30.657|N|32.334|E|source:dewiki|name=El Ferdan Railway Bridge}}) {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Ismailia]] ({{Coord|30|35|N|32|16|E|name=Ismailia}}) was completed in 2001 and is the longest [[swing bridge|swing-span bridge]] in the world, with a span of 340&nbsp;m (1100&nbsp;ft). The previous bridge was destroyed in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli conflict. The current bridge is no longer functional due to the expansion of the Suez Canal, as the parallel shipping lane completed in 2015 just east of the bridge lacks a structure spanning it.
* Pipelines taking fresh water under the canal to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], about {{convert|57|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Suez, at {{Coord|30|27.3|N|32|21.0|E|name=Fresh-water pipelines}}.
* [[Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel]] ({{coord|30|5|9|N|32|34|32|E|source:svwiki_region:EG_type:landmark|name=Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel}}) south of the Great Bitter Lake ({{Coord|30|20|N|32|23|E|region:EG_type:waterbody|name=Great Bitter Lake}}) was built in 1983. Because of leakage problems, a new water-tight tunnel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kajima.co.jp/topics/perspect/vol_15_3/salt/ |title=Salt-Corroded Tunnel Undergoes Major Renovation |publisher=Kajima.co.jp |access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> was built inside the old one from 1992 to 1995.
* The [[Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing]] ({{coord|29.996|N|32.583|E|source:dewiki|name=Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing}}) was built in 1999.

A railway on the west bank runs parallel to the canal for its entire length.

Six new tunnels for cars and trains are also planned across the canal.<ref name=tunnels>{{cite news|url=http://tunnelbuilder.com/News/Six-tunnels-under-Suez-Canal-.aspx|title=Six tunnels under Suez Canal|work=Tunnelbuilder|date=1 December 2014|access-date=6 August 2015}}</ref> Currently the [[Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel|Ahmed Hamdi]] is the only tunnel connecting [[Suez]] to the Sinai.

== Alternative routes ==
=== Cape Agulhas ===
The main alternative is around [[Cape Agulhas]], the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred to as the [[Cape of Good Hope]] route. This was the only sea route before the canal was constructed, and when the canal was closed. It is still the only route for ships that are [[Capesize|too large]] for the canal. In the early 21st century, the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to [[piracy in Somalia]], with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead.<ref>Liam Stack, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/1121/p99s01-wome.html Arab countries meet to tackle Somali pirate threat] – ''The Christian Science Monitor'' (21 November 2008).</ref><ref>Louis Wasser, [http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Somali-piracy-costs-Suez-Canal-business-3163446.php Somali piracy costs Suez Canal business], ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (29 April 2009).</ref> Between 2008 and 2010, it is estimated that the canal lost 10% of traffic due to the threat of piracy, and another 10% due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]]. An [[oil tanker]] going from Saudi Arabia to the United States has {{convert|2700|mi|0|abbr=on}} longer to go when taking the route south of Africa rather than the canal.<ref>{{cite report|last=Bowden|first=Anna|display-authors=et al|url=http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/documents/The_Economic_Cost_of_Piracy_Full_Report.pdf|access-date=26 February 2011|title=The Economic Cost of Maritime Piracy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120629210819/http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/documents/The_Economic_Cost_of_Piracy_Full_Report.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2012|page=13|series=One Earth Future Working Paper|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Before the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.<ref>''Overland Mail'' by [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn]], ''Railway Alexandria – Cairo – Suez'' built by [[Robert Stephenson]]</ref>

=== Northern Sea Route ===
[[File:Northern Sea Route vs Southern Sea Route.svg|thumb|A graphical comparison between the [[Northern Sea Route]] (blue) and an alternative route through Suez Canal (red)]]

In recent years, the [[Climate change in the Arctic|shrinking]] [[Arctic]] [[sea ice]] has made the [[Northern Sea Route]] feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months, shortening the voyage by thousands of miles compared to that through the Suez Canal. According to polar climate researchers, as the extent of the Arctic summer ice pack recedes the route will become passable without the help of [[icebreaker]]s for a greater period each summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.husdal.com/2011/05/22/the-final-frontier-the-northern-sea-route|title=The Final Frontier: The Northern Sea Route}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/39881/bye-bye-pirates-hello-north-east-passage | publisher = AsianCorrespondent.com | title = Bye pirates, hello Northeast Passage | date = 3 January 2010 | access-date=29 May 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Bremen]]-based [[Beluga Group]] claimed in 2009 to be the first Western company to attempt using the Northern Sea Route without assistance from icebreakers, cutting 4000 nautical miles off the journey between [[Ulsan]], [[Korea]] and [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/german-vessels-ready-for-the-northern-sea-route.4616626-16175.html |publisher=BarentsObserver.com |title=German vessels ready for the Northern Sea Route |date=5 August 2009 |access-date=21 September 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106161908/http://www.barentsobserver.com/german-vessels-ready-for-the-northern-sea-route.4616626-16175.html |archive-date=6 January 2011 }}</ref>

=== Cape Horn ===
Sail ships going between Europe and Australia did often prefer to go past Cape Horn when going to Europe, due to prevalent wind directions, even if it is slightly longer from Sydney to Europe this way than past Cape Agulhas.

=== Negev desert railway ===
In February 2012 [[Israel]] announced its intention to construct a [[High-speed railway to Eilat|railway]] between the Mediterranean and [[Eilat]] through the [[Negev]] desert to compete with the canal.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.e24.ee/728858/iisrael-ehitab-vahemere-ja-punase-mere-vahele-raudtee/ | publisher = E24.ee | title = Iisrael ehitab Vahemere ja Punase mere vahele raudtee(Israel is building a railway between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea|language = et |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140430082809/http://e24.postimees.ee/728858/iisrael-ehitab-vahemere-ja-punase-mere-vahele-raudtee| archive-date = 30 April 2014 | date = 5 February 2012|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref> By 2019, the project had been indefinitely frozen.<ref name="Globes">{{cite news |last1=Barket |first1=Amiram |title=Millions squandered on unrealistic projects |url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-millions-squandered-on-unrealistic-projects-1001270696 |access-date=25 November 2020 |work=Globes |date=28 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806163149/https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-millions-squandered-on-unrealistic-projects-1001270696 |archive-date=6 August 2020 |location=Rishon Le-Zion, Israel}}</ref>

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main |Lessepsian migration}}
The opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Although the Red Sea is about {{convert|1.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} higher than the eastern Mediterranean,<ref>Madl, Pierre (1999). [http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/lm/lesseps.htm Essay about the phenomenon of Lessepsian Migration], Colloquial Meeting of Marine Biology I, Salzburg, April 1999 (revised in Nov. 2001).</ref> the current between the Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the [[Bitter Lakes]] flows north in winter and south in summer. The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez.<ref name=rsp/> The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the [[Atlantic]], so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite. This migratory phenomenon is called [[Lessepsian migration]] (after Ferdinand de Lesseps) or "Erythrean invasion". Also impacting the eastern Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of [[Aswan High Dam]] across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]]. This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended the higher levels of natural [[turbidity]], additionally making conditions more like those in the Red Sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Invasive species originating from the Red Sea and [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean by the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] species. About 300 species from the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and there are probably others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the canal raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, who feared that it would worsen the invasion of Red Sea species.<ref>Galil and Zenetos (2002)</ref>

Construction of the canal was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called [[Sweet Water Canal]] from [[Nile Delta|the Nile delta]] along [[Wadi Tumilat]] to the future canal, with a southern branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said. Completed in 1863, these brought fresh water to a previously arid area, initially for canal construction, and subsequently facilitating growth of agriculture and settlements along the canal.<ref>Britannica (2007)</ref>

== Suez Canal Economic Zone ==
The Suez Canal Economic Zone, sometimes shortened to the Suez Canal Zone, describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment. The zone comprises over 600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> within the governorates of [[Port Said Governorate|Port Said]], [[Ismailia Governorate|Ismailia]] and [[Suez Governorate|Suez]]. Projects in the zone are collectively described as the [[Suez Canal Area Development Project]] (SCADP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Suez Canal Economic Zone|url=http://www.gafi.gov.eg/English/MediaCenter/News/Pages/Suez06-1-2016.aspx|website=GAFI|publisher=Ministry of Investment, Egypt|language=en|date=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Egypt aims to attract $30 bln in investment in Suez Canal Zone within 5 years: Investment minister|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/274195/Business/Economy/Egypt-aims-to-attract--bln-in-investment-in-Suez-C.aspx|work=Ahram Online|date=25 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The plan focuses on development of [[East Port Said Industrial Zone|East Port Said]] and the port of [[Ain Sokhna]], and hopes to extend to four more ports at West Port Said, El-Adabiya, [[Arish]] and [[El Tor, Egypt|El Tor]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Abdel-Razek|first1=Sherine|title=Canal corridor developments|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12938.aspx|work=Al Ahram Weekly|date=4 August 2015|access-date=10 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081243/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12938.aspx|archive-date=11 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The zone incorporates the three "Qualifying Industrial Zones" at Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, a 1996 American initiative to encourage economic ties between Israel and its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qualifying Industrial Zones|url=https://www.amcham.org.eg/information-resources/trade-resources/egypt-us-relations/qualifying-industrial-zones|website=American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt|language=en|date=March 2018}}</ref>
