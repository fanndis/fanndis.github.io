He served as [[White House Chief of Staff]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and as [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] and White House Chief of Staff under President [[George H. W. Bush]].

Born in [[Houston]], Baker attended [[The Hill School]] and [[Princeton University]] before serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. After graduating from the [[University of Texas School of Law]], he pursued a legal career. He became a close friend of George H. W. Bush and worked for Bush's unsuccessful 1970 campaign for the [[United States Senate]]. After the campaign, he served in various positions for President [[Richard Nixon]]. In 1975, he was appointed Undersecretary of Commerce for [[Gerald Ford]].  He served until May 1976, ran Ford's 1976 presidential campaign, and unsuccessfully sought election as the [[Attorney General of Texas]].

Baker ran Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, but made a favorable impression on the Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan. Reagan appointed Baker as his White House Chief of Staff, and Baker remained in that position until 1985, when he became the Secretary of the Treasury. As Treasury Secretary, he arranged the [[Plaza Accord]] and the [[Baker Plan (debt relief)|Baker Plan]]. He resigned as Treasury Secretary to manage Bush's successful [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 campaign]] for president. After the election, Bush appointed Baker to the position of Secretary of State. As Secretary of State, he helped oversee [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] during the end of the [[Cold War]] and [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], as well as during the [[Gulf War]]. After the Gulf War, Baker served another stint as White House Chief of Staff from 1992 to 1993.

Baker remained active in business and public affairs after Bush's defeat in the 1992 presidential election. He served as a [[United Nations]] envoy to [[Western Sahara]] and as a consultant to [[Enron]]. During the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|Florida recount]] following the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], he managed [[George W. Bush]]'s legal team in the state. He served as the co-chairman of the [[Iraq Study Group]], which Congress formed in 2006 to study [[Iraq]] and the ongoing [[Iraq War]]. He serves on the [[World Justice Project]] and the [[Climate Leadership Council]]. Baker is the namesake of the [[James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy]] at [[Rice University]].<ref name=jbipp>{{cite web |url=http://bakerinstitute.org/about/about_bipp.cfm |title=About the Baker Institute |publisher=[[James A.

==Early life and education==
James Addison Baker III was born in [[Houston]] at 1216 Bissonnet St.,<ref name=CofH-P4HDD>[http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/forms/procdesg.pdf City of Houston: Procedures for Historic District Designation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601175031/http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/forms/procdesg.pdf |date=June 1, 2010 }}.

His father was a partner of Houston law firm [[Baker Botts]]. Baker has a sister, Bonner Baker Moffitt.<ref>"Mother of Secretary of State Baker dies here at 96". ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

Baker]], and his great-grandfather was jurist and politician [[James A. Baker (born 1821)|Judge James A. Baker]].

Baker attended [[The Hill School]], a boarding school in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]]. He graduated ''cum laude'' with an [[A.B.]] in history from [[Princeton University]] in 1952 after completing a 188-page senior thesis, titled "Two Sides of the Conflict: Bevin vs. Bevan", under the supervision of [[Walter Phelps Hall|Walter P. Hall]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=I. I.

Baker was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps]] from 1952 to 1954, attaining the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] as a naval gunfire officer serving in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aboard the {{USS|Monrovia|APA-31|6}}.  He remained in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]] until 1958, and rose to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. He earned a [[bachelor of laws]] (1957) from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] and began to practice law in Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NYDAAAAMBAJ&q=James+Baker+university+texas+llb&pg=PA61|title=The Alcalde|first=Emmis|last=Communications|date=October 24, 1991|publisher=Emmis Communications|via=Google Books}}</ref>

From 1957 to 1969, and then from 1973 to 1975, he practiced law at [[Andrews Kurth|Andrews & Kurth]].

==Early political career==
Baker's first wife, the former Mary Stuart McHenry, was active in the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], working on the [[United States Congress|Congressional]] campaigns of [[George H. W. Bush]]. Originally, Baker had been a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] but too busy trying to succeed in a competitive law firm to worry about politics, and considered himself [[apolitical]]. His wife's influence led Baker to politics and the Republican Party. He was a regular [[tennis]] partner of [[George H. W. Bush]] at the [[Houston Country Club]] in the late 1950s. When Bush Sr. decided to vacate his [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional]] seat and run for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1970, he supported Baker's decision to run for the Congressional seat he was vacating. However, Baker changed his mind about running for Congress when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer; she died in February 1970.

Bush Sr. then encouraged Baker to become active in politics to help deal with the grief of his wife's death, something that Bush Sr. himself had done when his daughter, Pauline Robinson Bush (1949–1953), died of [[leukemia]]. Baker became chairman of Bush's Senate campaign in [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], Texas. Though Bush lost to [[Lloyd Bentsen]] in the election, Baker continued in politics, becoming the Finance Chairman of the Texas Republican Party in 1971. The following year, he was selected as Gulf Coast Regional Chairman for the [[Richard Nixon]] [[Richard Nixon 1968 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]]. In 1973 and 1974, in the wake of the Nixon Administration's [[Watergate scandal|implosion]], Baker returned to full-time law practice at Andrews & Kurth.<ref name=NewhouseJ-TNY-1990-05-07>Newhouse, John.

Baker's time away from politics was very brief, however. In August 1975, he was appointed Undersecretary of Commerce by President [[Gerald Ford]], succeeding John K. Tabor.<ref>{{cite news |agency=United Press International |date=July 23, 1975 |title=Pittsburgh Businessman Ford Treasury Nominee |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/40424569/ |work=The Leader-Times |location=Kittanning, PA |url-access=subscription  |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |page=1}}</ref>  He served until May 1976, and was succeeded by Edward O.

In 1978, with [[George H. W. Bush]] as his campaign manager, Baker ran unsuccessfully for [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General of Texas]], losing to future [[Texas governor]] [[Mark White (Texas politician)|Mark White]].

==Reagan administration==

In 1981, Baker was named [[White House Chief of Staff]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]], in spite of the fact that Baker managed the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford in [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|1976]] and of George Bush in [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980|1980]] opposing Reagan.<ref>James A. Baker III, ''Work Hard, Study... and Keep Out of Politics!'' (New York, 2006), 122.</ref> He served in that capacity until 1985. Baker is considered to have had a high degree of influence over the first Reagan administration, particularly in domestic policy.

In 1982, conservative activists [[Howard Phillips (politics)|Howard Phillips]], founder of [[the Conservative Caucus]], and [[Clymer Wright]] of Houston joined in an unsuccessful effort to convince Reagan to dismiss Baker as Chief of Staff. They claimed that Baker, a former Democrat and a Bush political intimate, was undermining conservative initiatives in the administration. Reagan rejected the Phillips-Wright request, but in 1985, he named Baker as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in a job-swap with then-Secretary [[Donald T. Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer who became Chief of Staff. Reagan rebuked Phillips and Wright for having waged a "campaign of sabotage" against Baker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}</ref>

Baker managed Reagan's [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 re-election campaign]] in which Reagan polled a record 525 electoral votes total (of a possible 538), and received 58.8% of the popular vote to [[Walter Mondale]]'s 40.6%.<ref>[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1984&off=0&f=1 1984 National Results] U.S. Election Atlas.</ref>

While serving as Treasury Secretary, Baker organized the [[Plaza Accord]] of September 1985 and the [[Baker Plan (debt relief)|Baker Plan]] to target international debt. He had [[Richard Darman]] of [[Massachusetts]] as his Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Darman continued in the next administration as the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]].

In 1985, Baker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref name="jeffersonawards">{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National Winners &#124; public service awards &#124; Jefferson Awards.org|publisher=jeffersonawards.org|accessdate=January 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the Reagan administration, Baker also served on the Economic Policy Council, where he played an instrumental role in achieving the passage of the administration's tax and budget reform package in 1981. He also played a role in the development of the [[American Silver Eagle]] and [[American Gold Eagle]] coins, which both were released in 1986.

Baker also served on Reagan's [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and remained Treasury Secretary until 1988, during which time he also served as campaign chairman for George H. W. Bush's successful presidential bid.

==Bush Administration==
{{See also|George H. W. Bush#Foreign policy}}
[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] appointed Baker [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in 1989. Baker served in this role through 1992. From 1992 to 1993, he served as Bush's [[White House Chief of Staff]], the same position that he had held from 1981 to 1985 during the first Reagan Administration.

On January 9, 1991, during the [[Geneva Peace Conference]] with [[Tariq Aziz]] in Geneva, Baker declared that "If there is any user of (chemical or biological weapons), our objectives won't just be the liberation of Kuwait, but the elimination of the current Iraqi regime...."<ref>Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, ''The Gulf conflict: diplomacy and war in the new world order'' (New Jersey, 1993), p. 257.</ref> Baker later acknowledged that the intent of this statement was to threaten a retaliatory [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] on Iraq,<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plague/interviews/baker.html Plague war: Interviews: James Baker].

Baker helped to construct the 34-nation alliance that fought alongside the United States in the Gulf War.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/program/james-baker/ James Baker: The Man Who Made Washington Work]. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. 2015.</ref>  

Baker also spent considerable time negotiating one-on-one with the parties in order to organize the [[Madrid Conference]] of October 30-November 1, 1991, in an attempt to revive the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] through negotiations involving [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinians]], as well as Arab countries, including [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].<ref>Id., at pp. 430-454.</ref>

Baker was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1991.

The 1992 election was complicated by the on-again-off-again candidacy of Ross Perot, who would end up taking 19% of the popular vote.<ref>Baker, Peter, and Glasser, Susan, The Man Who Ran Washington Doubeday, 2020, at pp. 492, 505.</ref> In August, following the Democratic Convention, with Bush trailing Clinton in the polls by 24 points, <ref>Id., at p. 493,</ref> Bush announced that Baker would return to the [[White House]] as [[Chief of Staff]] and as head of the re-election campaign.<ref>Id., at p. 494</ref>  However, despite having run two winning campaigns for [[Ronald Reagan]] and one for Bush, Baker was unsuccessful in the second campaign for Bush, who lost to Clinton by 370 electoral votes to 168.<ref>Id., at p. 505</ref>

=== Policies on Palestine ===
{{Undue weight|date=November 2019}}
[[File:James Baker 1991 DA-ST-92-09582.jpg|thumb|Baker arriving in Kuwait, 1991]]

Before the 1988 election, he and a team of some [[Middle East]]<nowiki/>ern policies experts created a report detailing the Palestine-Israel interactions. His team included [[Dennis Ross]] and many others who were soon appointed to the new Bush Administration.

Baker blocked the recognition of Palestine by threatening to cut funding to agencies in the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303657404576357721571060778|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=John|last=Bolton|title=How to Block the Palestine Statehood Ploy | date=June 3, 2011|url-access=subscription }}</ref> As far back as 1988, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) issued a "declaration of statehood" and changed the name of its observer delegation to the United Nations from the PLO to Palestine.

Baker warned publicly, "I will recommend to the President that the United States make no further contributions, voluntary or assessed, to any international organization which makes any changes in the PLO's status as an observer organization."

In May 1989, he gave a speech at the annual conference of the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]]. He called for Israel to "lay aside once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel", cease the construction of Israeli settlements in West Bank and Gaza, forswear [[annexation]] of more territory, and to treat Palestinians "as neighbors who deserve political rights". Israeli officials and public were highly offended due to the tone of his speech, though his address called for little more than his predecessors.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Christison|first=Kathleen|date=Autumn 1994|title=Splitting the Difference: The Palestinian-Israeli Policy of James Baker|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=24|issue=1|pages=39–50|jstor=2537981|doi=10.2307/2537981|url=http://jps.ucpress.edu/content/24/1/39.full.pdf}}</ref>

Baker soon decided that [[Aaron David Miller]] and [[Daniel Kurtzer]] would be his principal aids in Middle Eastern policies. All three have been reported as leaning toward the policies of the [[Israeli Labor Party]].<ref name=":0" />

Baker was notable for making little and slow efforts towards improving the state of Israeli-Palestinian relations. When Bush was elected, he only received 29% of [[Jewish American|Jewish]] voters' support, and his reelection was thought to be imminent, so there was little pressure on the administration to make bold moves in diplomatic relations with Israel. During his first eight months under the Bush administration, there were five meetings with the PLO, which is far less than his predecessors. All serious issues that Palestine sought to discuss, such as elections and representation in the Israeli government, were delegated to [[Egypt]] for decisions to be made.<ref name=":0" />

More tensions rose in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with a massive influx of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Jewish people from the Soviet Union]] moved to Israel. The Israeli government decided to expand the population further into Palestinian territories. Amidst the growing support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in Palestine, due to his opposition toward Israel, and his [[invasion of Kuwait]], and the beginning of the [[Gulf War]], Baker decided that he would make some moves towards developing communications between Israel and Palestine.<ref name=":0" />

Baker became the first American statesman to negotiate directly and officially with Palestinians in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], which was the first comprehensive peace conference that involved every party involved in the [[Arab-israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] and the conference was designed to address all outstanding issues.<ref name=":0" />

After this landmark event, he did not work to further improve Arab-Israeli relations. The administration forced Israel to halt the development of the 6,000 planned housing units, but the 11,000 housing units already under construction were permitted to be completed and inhabited with no penalty.<ref name=":0" /> In the meantime, Baker also tried to negotiate with the Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]], in order to achieve a lasting peace between Israel and Syria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/world/after-the-war-diplomacy-baker-and-syrian-chief-call-time-ripe-for-peace-effort.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: DIPLOMACY; Baker and Syrian Chief Call Time Ripe for Peace Effort|website=The New York Times|date=March 15, 1991}}</ref>

However, Baker has been criticized for spending much of his tenure in a state of inaction regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which arguably led to further infringements on Palestinian rights and the growing radicalism of Arabs and Israelis.<ref name=":0" />

In 1993, Baker became the honorary chair of the [[James Baker Institute|James A. Baker III Institute of Public Policy]] at [[Rice University]] in Houston, Texas.

Also in 1993, the [[Enron Corporation]] hired Baker as a consultant within a month of his departure from the White House, and Enron said that Baker would have an opportunity to invest in any projects he developed.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite news |title=Baker and Mosbacher Are Hired by Enron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/23/business/company-news-baker-and-mosbacher-are-hired-by-enron.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Bloomberg Business News]] |access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref>

In 1995, Baker published his [[memoirs]] of service as Secretary of State in a book entitled ''The Politics of Diplomacy: Revolution, War and Peace, 1989–1992'' ({{ISBN|0-399-14087-5}}).

In March 1997, Baker became the Personal Envoy of the [[UN Secretary-General]] for [[Western Sahara]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=U.N.

In addition to the numerous recognitions received by Baker, he was presented with the prestigious [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award]] for public service on September 13, 2000, in Washington, D.C.

=== 2000 presidential election and recount ===
In 2000, Baker served as chief legal adviser for [[George W. Bush]] during the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] campaign and oversaw the [[Florida recount]]. The 2008 film ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'' covers the days following the controversial election.  Baker was interviewed during the making of the film, and British actor [[Tom Wilkinson]] portrayed him in it.

=== Roles during the Bush administration and Iraq War ===
''[[State of Denial]]'', a book by investigative reporter [[Bob Woodward]], says that [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Andrew Card]] urged President Bush to replace [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] with Baker following the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]]. However, another G. H. W. Bush Administration veteran, [[Robert Gates]], was appointed instead, and only after the 2006 elections. Baker was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2008.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref>
