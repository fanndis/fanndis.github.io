'''''Gawker''''' was an American [[blog]] founded by [[Nick Denton]] and [[Elizabeth Spiers]] and based in [[New York City]] focusing on celebrities and the [[Mass media|media]] industry.<ref name=nytpiece>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/business/media/gawker-nick-denton-moment-of-truth.html?_r=0 |title=Gawker's Moment of Truth |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |date=June 12, 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623132340/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/business/media/gawker-nick-denton-moment-of-truth.html?_r=0 |archive-date=June 23, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The blog promoted itself as "the source for daily Manhattan media news and gossip."

Gawker Media also managed other blogs such as ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'', ''[[io9]]'', ''[[Deadspin]]'' and ''[[Kotaku]]''.

''Gawker'' came under scrutiny for posting videos, communications and other content that violated copyrights or the privacy of its owners, or was illegally obtained.  In particular, ''Gawker'''s publication of a sex tape featuring [[Hulk Hogan]] resulted in a $140 million legal judgment against the company.  On June 10, 2016, ''Gawker'' announced its bankruptcy filing as a direct result of the monetary judgment against the company related to the Hulk Hogan [[Bollea v.

==History==
[[File:Gawker-office.ogg|thumb|The [[Gawker Media]] [[newsroom]] at 210 Elizabeth Street in New York on July 13, 2010.]]''Gawker'' was founded by journalist Nick Denton in 2002, after he left the ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref name=nytpiece/> It was originally edited by [[Elizabeth Spiers]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/former-gawker-editor-sews-up-fashion-site/?8dpc |title=Former Gawker Editor Sews Up Fashion Site, and More |work= The New York Times |date=December 13, 2006 |department =DealBook|access-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref> ''Gawker'''s official launch was in December 2002.<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-6/reviews/gawker-2002-2007/|title=Gawker: 2002–2007|last=Blumenkranz|first=Carla|date=January 1, 2008|magazine=n+1|access-date=July 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722042015/https://nplusonemag.com/issue-6/reviews/gawker-2002-2007/|archive-date=July 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> When Spiers left ''Gawker'', she was replaced by [[Choire Sicha]], a former art dealer.<ref name="auto"/> Sicha was employed in this position until August 2004, at which point he was replaced by Jessica Coen, and he became editorial director of [[Gawker Media]]. Sicha left for the ''[[New York Observer]]'' six months after his promotion.

Later, in 2005, the editor position was split between two co-editors, and Coen was joined by guest editors from a variety of New York City-based blogs; Matt Haber was engaged as co-editor for several months, and Jesse Oxfeld joined for longer. In July 2006, Oxfeld's contract was not renewed, and Alex Balk was installed. Chris Mohney, formerly of [[Gridskipper]], Gawker Media's [[travel blog]], was hired for the newly created position of managing editor.

On September 28, 2006, Coen announced in a post on ''Gawker'' that she would be leaving the site to become deputy online editor at [[Vanity Fair magazine|''Vanity Fair'']]. Balk shared responsibility for the ''Gawker'' site with co-editor [[Emily Gould]]. Associate editor [[Maggie Shnayerson]] also began writing for the site; she replaced [[Doree Shafrir]], who left in September 2007 for the ''[[New York Observer]]''.

In February 2007, Sicha returned from his position at the ''New York Observer'', and replaced Mohney as the managing editor. On September 21, 2007, ''Gawker'' announced Balk's departure to edit ''[[Radar Magazine]]'''s website; he was replaced by Alex Pareene of ''[[Wonkette]]''.

The literary journal ''[[n+1]]'' published a long piece on the history and future of ''Gawker'', concluding that, "You could say that as Gawker Media grew, from ''Gawker''’s success, ''Gawker'' outlived the conditions for its existence".<ref>{{cite magazine

In 2008, weekend editor Ian Spiegelman quit Gawker because Denton fired his friend Sheila McClear without cause. He made that clear in several comments on the site at the time, also denouncing what he said was its practice of hiring [[Full-time job|full-time]] employees as [[independent contractor]]s in order to avoid paying [[tax]]es and [[employment benefits]].<ref>

On October 3, 2008, ''Gawker'' announced that 19 staff members were being laid off in response to expected [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|economic hardships in the coming months]]. Most came from sites with low ad revenue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hansell |first=Saul |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/gawker-cutbacks-an-early-indicator-of-ad-slowdown/ |title=Gawker Cutbacks an Early Indicator of Ad Slowdown |publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com |date=October 3, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126121604/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/gawker-cutbacks-an-early-indicator-of-ad-slowdown/ |archive-date=January 26, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On November 12, 2008, the company announced selling the popular blog site [[Consumerist (blog)|Consumerist]] and the folding of [[Valleywag]], with managing editor Owen Thomas being demoted to a columnist on ''Gawker'', and the rest of the staff being laid off. Some members and staff writers complained that owner Nick Denton was looking to sell out all of the ''Gawker'' sites while they were still profitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://valleywag.com/5084842/extremely-literal-boss-demotes-editor-to-columnist |title=Extremely literal boss demotes editor to columnist – self-referential – Gawker |publisher=Valleywag.com |date=November 12, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218054303/http://valleywag.com/5084842/extremely-literal-boss-demotes-editor-to-columnist |archive-date=December 18, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Popken |first=Ben |url=http://consumerist.com/5084569/consumerist-is-for-sale |title=Consumerist Is For Sale |publisher=The Consumerist |date=November 12, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608134422/http://consumerist.com/5084569/consumerist-is-for-sale |archive-date=June 8, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 2009, Denton was nominated for "Media Entrepreneur of the Decade" by ''[[Adweek]],'' and ''Gawker'' was named "Blog of the Decade" by the advertising trade.  Brian Morrissey of ''Adweek'' said "''Gawker'' remains the epitome of blogging: provocative, brash, and wildly entertaining".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestofthe2000s.com/blog-of-the-decade.html |title=AdweekMedia: Best of the 2000s – Blog of the Decade |publisher=Best of the 2000s |access-date=April 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127182036/http://www.bestofthe2000s.com/blog-of-the-decade.html |archive-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In February 2010, Denton announced that ''Gawker'' was acquiring the "people directory" site CityFile.com, and was hiring that site's editor and publisher, Remy Stern, as the new editor-in-chief of ''Gawker''. Gabriel Snyder, who had been editor-in-chief for the previous 18 months and had greatly increased the site's readership, released a memo saying he was being let go from the job.<ref>{{cite news

In December 2011, A. J. Daulerio, former editor-in-chief of ''Gawker'' Media sports site [[Deadspin]], replaced Remy Stern as editor-in-chief at ''Gawker''. The company replaced several other editors, contributing editors, and authors; others left.

==Content==
''Gawker'' usually published more than 20 posts daily during the week, sometimes reaching 30 posts a day, with limited publishing on the weekends. The site also published content from its sister sites. ''Gawker'''s content consisted of celebrity and media industry gossip, critiques of mainstream news outlets, and New York-centric stories. The stories generally came from anonymous tips from media employees, found mistakes and faux pas in news stories caught by readers and other blogs, and original reporting.

On July 3, 2006, when publisher [[Nick Denton]] replaced Jesse Oxfeld with Alex Balk, Oxfeld claimed it was an attempt to make the blog more [[mainstream]] and less media-focused, ending a tradition of heavy media coverage at ''Gawker''.<ref>

Denton announced in a staff memo in November 2015 that the site was switching from covering New York and the media world to focus primarily on politics.<ref>{{cite news |last=Somaiya |first=Ravi |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/business/media/gawker-politics-media.html |title=Gawker to Retool as Politics Site |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 17, 2016 |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409233015/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/business/media/gawker-politics-media.html |archive-date=April 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2007, ''Gawker'' published an article by [[Owen Thomas (writer)|Owen Thomas]] outing Silicon Valley venture capitalist [[Peter Thiel]] as gay.

</ref> After this Gawker Stalker, originally a weekly roundup of celebrity sightings in New York City submitted by Gawker readers, was frequently updated, and the sightings are displayed on a map. The feature sparked criticism from celebrities and publicists for encouraging stalking. Actor and director [[George Clooney]]'s representative Stan Rosenfeld described Gawker Stalker as "a dangerous thing". Jessica Coen has said that the map is harmless, that Gawker readers are "for the most part, a very educated, well-meaning bunch", and that "if there is someone really intending to do a celebrity harm, there are much better ways to go about doing that than looking at the Gawker Stalker".{{ref|msnbc_stalker}}<ref>{{cite news
