An effort for this was the American [[Project Vanguard]]. After the [[Soviet space program]]'s launch of the world's first artificial [[satellite]] (''[[Sputnik 1]]'') on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "[[Sputnik crisis]]"), urged immediate and swift action; President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology", headed by [[Guyford Stever]].<ref name="NacaNASA"/> On January 14, 1958, NACA Director [[Hugh Dryden]] published "A National Research Program for Space Technology" stating:<ref name="Erickson">{{Cite book |title=Into the Unknown Together—The DOD, NASA, and Early Spaceflight |last=Erickson |first=Mark |isbn=978-1-58566-140-4 |url=http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920093817/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf |archive-date=September 20, 2009|year=2005}}</ref>

On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100&nbsp;million, three major research laboratories ([[Langley Aeronautical Laboratory]], [[Ames Aeronautical Laboratory]], and [[Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]]) and two small test facilities.<ref name="Glennan">{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Biographies/glennan.html |title=T.

{{main|North American X-15}}
[[File:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in powered flight]]

NASA inherited NACA's X-15 experimental rocket-powered [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. Three planes were built starting in 1955. The X-15 was [[drop test|drop-launched]] from the wing of one of two NASA [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]es, ''NB52A'' tail number 52-003, and ''NB52B'', tail number 52-008 (known as the ''[[Balls 8]]'').

Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA. A total of 199 flights were made between June 1959 and December 1968, resulting in the [[Flight airspeed record|official world record]] for the highest speed ever reached by a crewed powered aircraft (current {{As of|2013|alt=as of 2014}}), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, {{convert|4519|mph|km/h|sp=us}}.<ref name="Fastest">[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ Aircraft Museum X-15."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921174821/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ |date=September 21, 2011}} ''Aerospaceweb.org'', November 24, 2008.</ref> The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96&nbsp;km).<ref name="NASAHyper" /> Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]] for flying above {{convert|80|km|ft|sp=us|order=flip}}, and two flights by [[Joseph A.

In 1958, NASA formed an engineering group, the [[Space Task Group]], to manage their [[human spaceflight]] programs under the direction of [[Robert Gilruth]]. Their earliest programs were conducted under the pressure of the [[Cold War]] competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. NASA inherited the US Air Force's [[Man in Space Soonest]] program, which considered many crewed spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic [[space capsule]]s.<ref name="Project1969">[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/prot7969.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica, Project 7969] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011131311/http://astronautix.com/craft/prot7969.htm |date=October 11, 2011}}, retrieved October 17, 2011</ref> By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule,<ref>[http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm NASA, Project Mercury Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603211738/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |date=June 3, 2013}}, retrieved October 17, 2011</ref> and NASA renamed it [[Project Mercury]].

Under the direction of [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]]. They succeeded in launching two crewed flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1964 and the first EVA in 1965. After this, the program was canceled, and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer [[Sergei Korolev]] developed the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], their answer to Apollo.

To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab.

The [[Space Shuttle]] became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Originally planned as a frequently launchable, fully reusable vehicle, the design was changed to use an [[Space Shuttle external tank|expendable external propellant tank]] to save on development cost, and four Space Shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']], did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the [[Vostok 1|first known human spaceflight]].<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/flights/vostok1.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica, Vostok 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028203027/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/vostok1.htm |date=October 28, 2011}}, retrieved October 18, 2011</ref>

Its major components were a [[spaceplane]] orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side.

NASA undertook a feasibility study in 2012 and developed the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] as an uncrewed mission to move a boulder-sized [[near-Earth asteroid]] (or boulder-sized chunk of a larger asteroid) into lunar orbit. The mission would demonstrate [[ion thruster]] technology, and develop techniques that could be used for [[planetary defense]] against an asteroid collision, as well as a cargo transport to Mars in support of a future human mission.

The second administrator, [[James E. Webb]] (1961–1968), appointed by President [[John F. Kennedy]], was a Democrat who first publicly served under President [[Harry S. Truman]]. In order to implement the [[Apollo program]] to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal.

The ''[[New Horizons]]'' mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of [[Pluto]] on July 14, 2015. The probe received a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]] in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. Other active spacecraft are ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'' for [[Jupiter]] and ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' for the [[asteroid belt]]. NASA continued to support ''[[in situ#Space-related|in situ]]'' exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and [[Gas Giant]] orbiters ''Galileo'' (1989–2003), ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' (1997–2017), and ''Juno'' (2011–present).

==NEO detection==
{{further|Near-Earth object}}
In 1994, there was a Congressional directive to find near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 1 kilometer, and 90% of 1 kilometer sized asteroids are estimated to have been found by 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasas-search-for-asteroids-to-help-protect-earth-and-understand-our-history|title=NASA's Search for Asteroids to Help Protect Earth and Understand Our History|last=Loff|first=Sarah|date=April 22, 2014|website=NASA|access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref>

In 1999 NASA visited 433 Eros with the NEAR spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/433-eros/in-depth|title=In Depth &#124; 433 Eros|website=NASA Solar System Exploration}}</ref> From the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. However, many asteroids are very dark and the ones that are near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a "full Moon" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun.

In 2005, the US Congress mandated NASA to achieve by the year 2020 specific levels of search completeness for discovering, cataloging, and characterizing dangerous asteroids larger than {{convert|140|m|ft|sp=us}} (Act of 2005, H.R. 1022; 109th),<ref>[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr1022/text/rh H.R. 1022 (109th): George E.

== NASA Advisory Council ==
In response to the [[Apollo 1]] accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In the aftermath of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]], Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/asap/|title=NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP)|website=oiir.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=April 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308004409/https://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/asap/|archive-date=March 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).<ref name="NAC About">{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/offices/nac/about.html|title=About Us – Background and Charter|first=Ron|last=Mochinski|date=April 8, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228031143/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/nac/about.html|archive-date=December 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2014]] reaffirmed the importance of ASAP.

== Directives ==
{{further|Space policy of the United States}}
Some of NASA's main directives have been the landing of a crewed spacecraft on the Moon, the designing and construction of the Space Shuttle, and efforts to construct a large, crewed space station. Typically, the major directives originated from the intersection of scientific interest and advice, political interests, federal funding concerns, and the public interest, that all together brought varying waves of effort, often heavily swayed by technical developments, funding changes, and world events. For example, in the 1980s, the Reagan administration announced a directive with a major push to build a crewed space station, given the name [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']].<ref name="NASA.gov">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|title=President Reagan's Statement on the International Space Station|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref> But, when the Cold War ended, Russia, the United States, and other international partners came together to design and build the [[International Space Station]].

In the 2010s, major shifts in directives include the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]], and the later development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the [[Space Launch System]]. Missions for the new [[Space Launch System]] have varied, but overall, NASA's directives are similar to the [[Space Shuttle]] program as the primary goal and desire is human spaceflight. Additionally, NASA's [[Space Exploration Initiative]] of the 1980s opened new avenues of exploration focused on other galaxies.

For the coming decades, NASA's focus has gradually shifting towards eventual exploration of Mars.<ref name="space.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|title=President Trump Directs NASA to Return to the Moon, Then Aim for Mars|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109040720/https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|archive-date=January 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the technological options focused on was the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).<ref name="space.com" /> ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, notably on a solar electric propulsion system.<ref name="defunded">{{cite news |last1=Jeff Foust |title=NASA closing out Asteroid Redirect Mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-closing-out-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |work=Space News |date=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name="space.com" />

Longer project execution timelines leave future executive administration officials to execute on a directive, which can lead to directional mismanagement.{{vague|date=August 2020}}

New NASA administrator [[Jim Bridenstine]] addressed this directive in an August 2018 speech where he focused on the sustainability aspects—going to the Moon to stay—that are explicit in the directive, including taking advantage of US commercial space [[reusable launch vehicle|capability]] that did not exist even five years ago, which have [[Space launch market competition|driven down costs]] and increased access to space.<ref name="nasa20180829">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxV-v_YaboQ&t=276s Bridenstine Speaks at NASA Advisory Council Meeting], at 4:40, NASA TV, August 29, 2018, accessed September 1, 2018.</ref>

== Use of the metric system ==

In 1969, the [[Apollo 11]] landed on the Moon using a mix of [[United States customary units]] and [[Metric system|metric units]]. In the 1980s, NASA started the transition towards full metrication,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} and was predominantly metric by the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/|title=CNN - Metric mishap caused loss of NASA orbiter - September 30, 1999|website=edition.cnn.com}}</ref> On September 23, 1999, a unit mixup between US and SI units resulted in a loss of the [[Mars Climate Orbiter]].<ref>[https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/news/mco991110.html Mars Climate Orbiter Failure Board Releases Report]</ref>

In August 2007, NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon will be done entirely using the SI system. This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries which already use the metric system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/08jan_metricMoon.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316093535/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/08jan_metricMoon.htm|url-status=dead|title=NASA – Metric Moon|archive-date=March 16, 2010}}</ref>
