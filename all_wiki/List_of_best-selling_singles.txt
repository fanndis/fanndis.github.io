[[File:Bing Crosby - White Christmas 1942 10 inch.jpg|thumb|300px|1942 10-inch 78 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] release of the [[Single (music)|single]] "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" by [[Bing Crosby]].]]

[[File:Elton John - Candle In The Wind 1997 7 inch.jpg|thumb|300px|1997 7-inch 45 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] release of "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]"/"[[Something About the Way You Look Tonight]]", double A-side [[Single (music)|single]] by [[Elton John]].]]
This article is a [[compendium]] of the best-selling [[single (music)|music singles]]. The criterion for inclusion on the list is to have sold at least ten million copies worldwide. The singles listed here were cited by reliable sources from various media, such as [[digital journalism]], newspapers, magazines, and books.

It is notable that, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" (1942) as performed by [[Bing Crosby]] is the best-selling [[Single (music)|single]] worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite web|title= Best-selling single |work= [[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate= 14 November 2020 |url= https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-single |url-status= live}}</ref> The song, recognized as "the best-selling single of all time", was released before the [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Rock music|rock]] singles-chart era and "was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever ''Guinness Book of Records'' (published in 1955) and—remarkably—still retains the title more than 50 years later". ''Guinness World Records'' also states that double A-side charity single "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]"/"[[Something About the Way You Look Tonight]]" (1997) by [[Elton John]] (rewritten as a tribute to the late [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], rather than the [[Marilyn Monroe]] of the original 1973 version), is "the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies". This makes it the second-best-selling physical single of all time.<ref name="Guinness"/>

There are three best-selling singles lists displayed here:
#Best-selling physical singles (mainly [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[phonograph record|vinyl]]) singles)
#Best-selling digital singles (digitally downloaded tracks which first became available to purchase in the early 2000s)	
#Best-selling streaming singles (post-2015 singles where tracks streams are converted to sales using the streaming equivalent method)

==Best-selling physical singles==

===15{{nbsp}}million physical copies or more===
