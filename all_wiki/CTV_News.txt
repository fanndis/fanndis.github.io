'''CTV News''' is the [[news]] division of the [[CTV Television Network]] in [[Canada]]. The name ''CTV News'' is also applied as the title of local and regional newscasts on the network's [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&Os), which are closely tied to the national news division. Local newscasts on [[CTV 2]] are also branded as ''CTV News'', although in most cases they are managed separately from the newscasts on the main CTV network.

==National programs==
[[File:CTV News.svg|thumb|right|CTV News logo (2013-2019)]]

CTV's national news division produces the following programs:

* ''[[CTV National News]]'', the nightly newscast anchored by [[Lisa LaFlamme]] (weekdays) and [[Sandie Rinaldo]] (weekends);
* ''[[W5 (TV series)|W5]]'', a weekly newsmagazine series;
* ''[[Question Period (TV series)|Question Period]]'', a weekly news and interview series;.

CTV News also operates the national 24-hour news channel [[CTV News Channel (Canadian TV channel)|CTV News Channel]] and the 24-hour national business news channel [[Business News Network]], both of which are available across Canada on cable and satellite.

The news division produced the weekday [[breakfast television|morning news and entertainment program]] ''[[Canada AM]]'' from 1972 to October 2015, when responsibility for the program was transferred to Bell Media In-House Productions, the division responsible for CTV's other daytime lifestyle programming, until the program's cancellation in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/jeff-hutcheson-canada-am-1.3617989|title=Canada AM co-host 'saddened and disappointed' by show's cancellation|first=Kevin|last=Yarr|work=[[CBC News]]|date=2016-06-06|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref> ''Canada AM'''s replacement ''[[Your Morning]]'' is produced by Bell Media In-House Productions, with news content provided by CTV News.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellmedia.ca/pr/press/welcome-to-your-morning-ctvs-new-morning-show-to-premiere-this-summer/|title=Welcome to YOUR MORNING: CTV's New Morning Show to Premiere this Summer|author=Bell Media (press release)|date=2016-06-06|accessdate=2016-06-09}}</ref>

==Local programs==
[[Image:Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV C-FTHU (CTV News).jpg|thumb|Chopper 9, [[CIVT-DT|CTV Vancouver]] news helicopter in Vancouver operated  from August 2004-January 31, 2020. [[CFTO-DT|CTV Toronto]] is the only other station that uses the CTV Chopper. The latter unit is also used on Bell Media's Toronto-based local news channel, CP24, but referred to as Chopper 24]]

In most markets, local CTV News programs air at noon, 6 p.m., and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (CTV 2) or 11:30&nbsp;p.m. (CTV) on weekdays, and at 6 p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. / 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on weekends. In selected markets, 5:00 and/or 5:30&nbsp;p.m. newscasts are also produced, and several CTV stations in western Canada (and some CTV Two stations in eastern Canada) produce local morning newscasts under the title ''[[CTV Morning Live]]''.

In 1998, shortly following the merger of the CTV network with [[Baton Broadcasting]], local news branding on the CTV O&Os was unified with network news presentation, with newscast titles standardized under the format "([[call sign]]) News", e.g. ''[[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] News'' for the Toronto station. Prior to this, the local O&Os used various titles, though one used in the late 1970s by a number of stations was ''World Beat News'' (for late-afternoon broadcasts) and ''Night Beat News'' (for late-night broadcasts). By late 2005 the O&Os' local newscasts had been renamed ''CTV News''.

Beginning in February 2014, local programs were again rebranded using region-specific on-air titles such as ''CTV News Toronto''. At the same time, the CTV and CTV 2 O&O stations received a new graphics package, which is in a blue and white color scheme, a revised logo (similar to the ones already in use on [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[CTV National News]]), and new theme music.

National aggregate ratings published by [[BBM Canada]] refer to the local broadcasts collectively as ''CTV Evening News'', ''CTV Late News'', ''CTV Noon News'', etc., although these titles are not used on-air. Since most CTV affiliates<!-- in the loose sense of "affiliates" --> are owned by the network, CTV offers the opportunity to buy national ads on local programming across its O&Os, making these aggregate ratings useful for advertisers.

Local ''CTV News'' programs are produced in the following markets:

* [[Barrie]] ([[CKVR-DT|CKVR]]) (in HD)
* [[Calgary]] ([[CFCN-DT|CFCN]]) (in HD)
* [[Edmonton]] ([[CFRN-DT|CFRN]]) (in HD)
* [[Greater Sudbury]] ([[CICI-TV|CICI]])
* [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] ([[CJCH-DT|CJCH]] / [[CTV 2 Atlantic]]) (in HD)
* [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] ([[CKCO-DT|CKCO]]) (in HD)
* [[London, Ontario|London]] ([[CFPL-DT|CFPL]])
* [[Montreal]] ([[CFCF-DT|CFCF]]) (in HD)
* [[Ottawa]] ([[CJOH-DT|CJOH]] / [[CHRO-TV|CHRO]]) (in HD)
* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] ([[CKCK-DT|CKCK]]) (in HD)
* [[Saskatoon]] ([[CFQC-DT|CFQC]]) (in HD)
* [[Toronto]] ([[CFTO-DT|CFTO]]) (in HD)
* [[Vancouver]] ([[CIVT-DT|CIVT]]) (in HD)
* [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] ([[CIVI-DT|CIVI]]) (in HD)
* [[Winnipeg]] ([[CKY-DT|CKY]]) (in HD)
* [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] ([[CHWI-DT|CHWI]])

CTV O&Os in smaller markets air a newscast produced in one of the larger markets noted above, although some may also produce a shorter local news insert aired during a break in the main market's program, and some of these smaller stations produce their own noon newscasts.

Bell Media's secondary [[CTV 2|A]] system which was acquired through the purchase of [[CHUM Limited]], and operated primarily in smaller markets (or alternate areas of larger markets) produced similar local newscasts known as ''[[A News (TV series)|A News]]''. When the A system re-branded as "CTV Two" on August 29, 2011 (and later CTV 2), the stations' newscasts switched to the CTV News branding,<ref name=ctvtwo-pr>{{cite web|title=Bell Media's /A\ Network to Become "CTV Two" This Fall|url=http://ctvmedia.ca/ctv/releases/release.asp?id=13828&yyyy=2011|publisher=Bell Media Media Centre|accessdate=30 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124349/http://ctvmedia.ca/ctv/releases/release.asp?id=13828&yyyy=2011|archivedate=27 July 2011}}</ref> likely because "CTV Two News" might be seen as connoting a second-class newscast. The CTV News broadcasts on the CTV 2 stations previously used the main CTV logo as their [[digital on-screen graphic|logo bug]] during these newscasts as did the main CTV network, but they currently use the regionally branded titles such as ''CTV News Barrie'' as is now the case for the CTV O&Os. Most of these stations are nevertheless required to operate their local news operations separately from CTV stations serving the same or adjacent markets. This restriction does not apply to CTV Two Atlantic, a cable channel which has been co-owned with the [[CTV Atlantic|CTV stations serving that region]] since its launch (their news operations have been fully integrated since 1998), or to CTV Two Alberta, also a cable-only channel, which produces a current affairs program, ''Alberta Primetime'', using resources from that province's CTV stations.

Affiliates not owned by the network also air their own local newscasts, such as [[CJON-DT|NTV]] (which despite dropping CTV's entertainment programming in 2002, still provides coverage of Newfoundland for CTV News and airs its national newscasts), and [[CITL-DT|CITL-TV]] (which airs ''Prime Time Local News'', a production shared with its sister station, Global TV affiliate [[CKSA-DT|CKSA-TV]]).

Bell Media also operates [[CP24]], a regional news channel focusing on the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and most of [[Southern Ontario]], which was acquired through its purchase of [[CHUM Limited]], and formerly aligned with [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]]. The channel airs news programs focused on the region, and currently airs simulcasts of CFTO's 6:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. newscasts.
