'''Judy Holliday''' (born '''Judith Tuvim''', June 21, 1921 – June 7, 1965) was an American actress, comedienne and singer.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', June 9, 1965, p. 71.</ref>

She began her career as part of a nightclub act before working in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays and musicals. Her success in the 1946 stage production of ''[[Born Yesterday (play)|Born Yesterday]]'' as Billie Dawn led to her being cast in the [[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|1950 film version]] for which she won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].  She appeared in several films during the 1950s. She was known for her performance on Broadway in the musical ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]],'' winning a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] and reprising her role in [[Bells Are Ringing (film)|the 1960 film adaptation]]. 

In 1952, Holliday was called to testify before the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] to answer claims she was associated with [[communism]].

==Early life==
Holliday was born '''Judith Tuvim''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''tovim'' means good, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: ''toyvim'' means good) in [[New York City]]. She was the only child of Abe and Helen (née Gollomb) Tuvim. Her father later served as the executive director of the foundation for the [[Jewish National Fund]] of America (1951-1958).<ref name=NYTimes-Tuvim-Obit-1958>{{cite news|title=Abe Tuvim; Zionist Official,.

==Early career==
Holliday began her show business career in 1938, under her original name, as part of a nightclub act called The Revuers. The other members of the group were [[Betty Comden]], [[Adolph Green]], Alvin Hammer, John Frank, and Esther Cohen.<ref name=jwa/><ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=88083 "Judy Holliday Biography"], Turner Classic Movies (tcm.com), retrieved February 21, 2010</ref> The Revuers played engagements in New York night clubs including the [[Village Vanguard]], Spivy's Roof, the Blue Angel, and the [[Rainbow Room]], and the [[Trocadero (Los Angeles)|Trocadero]] in [[Hollywood]], California.  [[Leonard Bernstein]], a friend of the group who shared an apartment with Green at the time, sometimes provided piano accompaniment for the group's performances.  The Revuers filmed a scene for the 1944 [[Carmen Miranda]] film ''[[Greenwich Village (film)|Greenwich Village]]'', but the scene was cut, although Holliday can be seen as an unbilled extra in another scene.  The group disbanded in early 1944.<ref name=times1/><ref name=life>Sargeant, Winthrop.[https://books.google.com/books?id=6E4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA107 "Judy Holliday"], ''Life Magazine'', April 2, 1951.</ref>

Her first film role was a small but noticeable role as an airman's wife in the [[Twentieth Century Fox]] [[Winged Victory (film)|film version]] of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]]' play ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]'' (1944). She did not appear in the stage version, which toured the U.S. both before and after production of the film. Holliday made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut on March 20, 1945 at the [[Belasco Theatre]] in ''[[Kiss Them for Me (play)|Kiss Them for Me]]'' and was one of the recipients that year of the [[Clarence Derwent Award]].<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1685 "Kiss Them For Me Internet Broadway Database listing"] ibdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010; accessed 10 June 2014.</ref>

In 1946, she returned to Broadway as the scatterbrained Billie Dawn in ''[[Born Yesterday (play)|Born Yesterday]]''. Author [[Garson Kanin]] wrote the play for [[Jean Arthur]], who played the role of Billie but left out-of-town for personal reasons. Kanin then selected Holliday, two decades Arthur's junior, as her replacement.<ref name=times1/><ref name="life"/><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1768 "Born Yesterday Internet Broadway Database listing"], ibdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010</ref> In his book ''Tracy and Hepburn'' (1971), Kanin mentions that when Columbia bought the rights to the film ''Born Yesterday,'' studio boss [[Harry Cohn]] would not consider casting the Hollywood-unknown. Kanin, along with [[George Cukor]], [[Spencer Tracy]], and [[Katharine Hepburn]] conspired to promote Holliday by offering her a key part in the film ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949).

She received rave reviews for her performance in ''Born Yesterday'' on Broadway, and Cohn offered her the chance to repeat her role for [[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|the film version]],<ref name=jwa/> but only after she did a screen test (which at first was used only as a "benchmark against which to evaluate" other actresses being considered for the role).<ref>Bill Crow. ''From Birdland to Broadway: Scenes from a Jazz Life'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 185.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> She won the first [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and at the [[23rd Academy Awards]], Holliday won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], defeating [[Gloria Swanson]], nominated for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', [[Eleanor Parker]], for ''[[Caged]]'', and [[Bette Davis]] and [[Anne Baxter]], both for ''[[All About Eve]]''.<ref name=tcm/><ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/search/mmx-6803_lgcy,0,3524816.story "Top winners from 1950"]{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''Chicago Tribune'', retrieved February 21, 2010; accessed June 10, 2014.</ref>

She starred opposite then-newcomer [[Jack Lemmon]] in his first two feature films, the comedies ''[[It Should Happen to You]]'' and ''[[Phffft!]]'' (both 1954)<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047123/ "It Should Happen to You Internet Movie Database listing"], imdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010; accessed June 10, 2014.</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047349 "Phffft! Internet Movie Database listing"], imdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010; accessed June 10, 2014.</ref>

Film historian Bernard Dick summed up Holliday's acting: "Perhaps the most important aspect of the Judy Holliday persona, both in variations of Billie Dawn and in her roles as housewife, is her vulnerability...her ability to shift her mood quickly from comic to serious is one of her greatest technical gifts."<ref>Dick, Bernard F. ''Columbia Pictures: Portrait of A Studio'' (1992). University Press of Kentucky; {{ISBN|0-8131-1769-0}}, pp. 135–136.</ref> Director George Cukor also observed that Holliday had "that depth of emotion, that unexpectedly touching emotion, that thing which would unexpectedly touch your heart."<ref>Sicherman, Barbara and Green, Carol Hurd. ''Notable American Women: The Modern Period'' (1980). Harvard University Press; {{ISBN|0-674-62733-4}}, p. 349</ref>

===Investigated for Communism===
In 1950, Holliday's name appeared on a list of 151 "pro-Communist" artists in the conservative publication ''[[Red Channels|Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and TV]]''. The next year, she was [[subpoena]]ed by [[Pat McCarran|Senator Pat McCarran]]'s [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]], which was investigating subversion and Communist activity in the entertainment industry. She appeared before the committee on March 26, 1952, with [[Simon H. Rifkind]] as her legal counsel.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Unfriendly Witnesses: Gender, Theater, and Film in the McCarthy Era|last=Barranger|first=Milly S.|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2008|pages=9–33|chapter=Billie Dawn Goes to Washington: Judy Holliday}}</ref>

Holliday was advised to play dumb, as in her film portrayal of Billie Dawn, and she did – often to comedic effect.<ref name=":0" /><ref>[http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article06220901.aspx Profile], thesmartset.com; accessed June 10, 2014.</ref><ref>Stephen R. Duncan, "Judy Holliday, the Red Scare, and the (Miss-) Uses of Hollywood's Dumb Blonde Image." in Laura Mattoon D'Amor, ed. ''Smart Chicks on Screen: Representing Women's Intellect in Film and Television'' (2014) pp. 9–28 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrmCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 online]</ref>  Holliday later wrote of the experience to her friend [[Heywood Hale Broun]]: "Woodie, maybe you're ashamed of me, because I played Billie Dawn ... But I'm not ashamed of myself, because I didn't name names. That much I preserved."<ref name=":0" /> The investigation "did ''not'' reveal positive evidence of any membership in the Communist Party" and was concluded after three months, unlike many others tainted by the anti-Communist investigation.

==Later career==
She starred in the film version of ''[[The Solid Gold Cadillac]]'', which was released in August 1956.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049777 ''The Solid Gold Cadillac'' listing], imdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010.</ref> In November 1956, Holliday returned to Broadway starring in the musical ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'' with book and lyrics by her Revuers friends, [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], and directed by [[Jerome Robbins]]. In 1957, she won the [[Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical]].<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2590 ''Bells Are Ringing'' listing], ibdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010.</ref> Of her performance in the stage musical [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote in ''The New York Times'';

<blockquote>Nothing has happened to the shrill little moll whom the town loved in ''Born Yesterday''. The squeaky voice, the embarrassed giggle, the brassy naivete, the dimples, the teeter-totter walk fortunately remain unimpaired ... Miss Holliday now adds a trunk-full of song-and-dance routines...Without losing any of that doll-like personality, she is now singing music by Jule Styne and dancing numbers composed by Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse. She has gusto enough to triumph in every kind of music hall antic.<ref>[[Brooks Atkinson|Atkinson, Brooks]]. "Theater: 'Bells Are Ringing' for Judy Holliday", ''The New York Times'', November 30, 1956, p. 18</ref></blockquote>

Returning to her film career after a gap of several years, she starred in the film version of ''[[Bells Are Ringing (film)|Bells Are Ringing]]'' (1960), her last film.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053645 ''Bells Are Ringing'' listing], imdb.com, retrieved February 21, 2010.</ref>

In October 1960, Holliday started out-of-town tryouts on the play ''Laurette'' based on the life of [[Laurette Taylor]]. The show was directed by [[José Quintero]] with background music by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and produced by [[Alan Pakula]]. When Holliday became ill and had to leave the show, it closed in Philadelphia without opening on Broadway.

She had surgery for a throat tumor shortly after leaving the production in October 1960.<ref>"Judy Holliday Faces Surgery", The New York Times, October 12, 1960, p. 44</ref><ref>[http://www.kritzerland.com/elmer.htm "Laurette:  Music from the play"], kritzerland.com, retrieved February 22, 2010.</ref> Her last role was in the stage musical ''[[Hot Spot (musical)|Hot Spot]]'', co-starring newcomers such as [[Joseph Campanella]] and [[Mary Louise Wilson]], which closed after 43 performances on May 25, 1963.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3006 ''Hot Spot'' listing], Internet Broadway Database; retrieved February 22, 2010.</ref>
