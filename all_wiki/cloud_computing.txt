[[File:Cloud computing.svg|thumb|Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services need not be individually addressed or managed by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud.]]

'''Cloud computing''' is the on-demand availability of [[computer]] [[system resource]]s, especially data storage ([[cloud storage]]) and [[computing power]], without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe [[data center]]s available to many users over the [[Internet]].<ref name="NIST">[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]</ref> Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions [[distributed computing|distributed]] over multiple locations from central [[server (computing)|server]]s. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an [[edge server]].

Clouds may be limited to a single [[organization]] (enterprise clouds<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|s2cid=8251298|title=Enterprise cloud service architectures|journal=Information Technology and Management|volume=13|issue=4|pages=445–454|doi=10.1007/s10799-012-0139-4|year=2012}}</ref><ref name="aws.amazon" />), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).

Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and [[economies of scale]].

Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front [[IT infrastructure]] costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows [[Company|enterprises]] to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand,<ref name="aws.amazon">{{cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/|title=What is Cloud Computing?|date=2013-03-19|work=Amazon Web Services|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://it.tmcnet.com/channels/cloud-storage/articles/211183-rising-cloud-storage-market-opportunity-strengthens-vendors.htm |title= The Rising Cloud Storage Market Opportunity Strengthens Vendors |publisher=It.tmcnet.com |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2011-12-02|first=Rajani|last=Baburajan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thectoforum.com/content/converged-infrastructure-0 |author=Oestreich, Ken |title= Converged Infrastructure |work= CTO Forum |publisher= Thectoforum.com |date= 2010-11-15 |accessdate= 2011-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113094920/http://www.thectoforum.com/content/converged-infrastructure-0 |archive-date= 2012-01-13 }}</ref> providing the '''burst computing''' capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.<ref>Ted Simpson, Jason Novak, ''Hands on Virtual Computing'',  2017, {{ISBN|1337515744}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wtdUDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA451 p. 451]</ref>

==History==
{{confusing|section|date=July 2020}}

Cloud computing was popularized with [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]] releasing its [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Elastic Compute Cloud]] product in 2006.<ref name="Amazon.com">{{cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/
|title=Announcing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) – beta |date=24 August 2006 |access-date=31 May 2014}}</ref>

References to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a [[Compaq]] internal document.<ref>
{{Cite news | title=Who Coined 'Cloud Computing'? | author=Antonio Regalado | date= 31 October 2011 | work= Technology Review | publisher= MIT | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425970/who-coined-cloud-computing/ | access-date=31 July 2013 }}
</ref>

The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original [[ARPANET]] by as early as 1977,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_70s.html|title=Internet History 1977}}</ref> and the [[CSNET]] by 1981<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gu.friends-partners.org/Bookwriting/PART_I/Chapter_I/Total/Insertions/NSF/CSNET/CSNET.html|title=National Science Foundation, "Diagram of CSNET," 1981}}</ref>—both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word ''cloud'' was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on [[telephony]] schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the endpoints of a network are connected are not relevant to understanding the diagram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-cloud-computing|title=What Is Cloud Computing?|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>

The term ''cloud'' was used to refer to platforms for [[distributed computing]] as early as 1993, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] spin-off [[General Magic]] and [[AT&T]] used it in describing their (paired) [[Telescript (programming language)|Telescript]] and PersonaLink technologies.<ref>{{cite web |author=AT&T |title=What Is The Cloud? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a7hK6kWttE |quote=You can think of our electronic meeting place as the Cloud. PersonaLink was built from the ground up to give handheld communicators and other devices easy access to a variety of services.  [...]  Telescript is the revolutionary software technology that makes intelligent assistance possible.  Invented by General Magic, AT&T is the first company to harness Telescript, and bring its benefits to people everywhere.  [...]  Very shortly, anyone with a computer, a personal communicator, or television will be able to use intelligent assistance in the Cloud.  And our new meeting place is open, so that anyone, whether individual, entrepreneur, or a multinational company, will be able to offer information, goods, and services. |date=1993 |accessdate=2017-10-26|author-link=AT&T }}</ref>  In ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired's]]'' April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II", [[Andy Hertzfeld]] commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language:

{{Quote|"The beauty of Telescript&nbsp;... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service. No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, [[X.400]] and [[ASN.1]]] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties."<ref>Steven Levy (April 1994). [http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.04/general.magic_pr.html "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II"]. ''Wired''.</ref>}}

===Early history===
During the 1960s, the initial concepts of [[time-sharing]] became popularized via RJE ([[Remote Job Entry]]);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc105|title=Network Specifications for Remote Job Entry and Remote Job Output Retrieval at UCSB|last=White|first=J.E.|website=tools.ietf.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as [[IBM]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]].  Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data center" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM's mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.

In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering [[virtual private network]] (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ry'mone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuTEDwAAQBAJ&q=By+switching+traffic+as+they+saw+fit+to+balance+server+use,+they+could+use+overall+network+bandwidth+more+effectively.&pg=PA105|title=Internet Governance|date=2018-11-20|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-395-1|language=en}}</ref>  They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/doc/ietf/ipatm/atm-minutes-93jul.txt |publisher=Switch |location=[[Switzerland|CH]] |title=July, 1993 meeting report from the IP over ATM working group of the IETF |accessdate=2010-08-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710170149/http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/doc/ietf/ipatm/atm-minutes-93jul.txt |archive-date=2012-07-10 }}</ref> As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ry'mone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuTEDwAAQBAJ&q=By+switching+traffic+as+they+saw+fit+to+balance+server+use,+they+could+use+overall+network+bandwidth+more+effectively.&pg=PA105|title=Internet Governance|date=2018-11-20|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-395-1|language=en}}</ref> They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.<ref name="MITCorbato">{{cite web|last=Corbató|first=Fernando J.|title=An Experimental Time-Sharing System|url=http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/|work=SJCC Proceedings|publisher=MIT|accessdate=3 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906104446/http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/|archive-date=6 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ry'mone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuTEDwAAQBAJ&q=By+switching+traffic+as+they+saw+fit+to+balance+server+use,+they+could+use+overall+network+bandwidth+more+effectively.&pg=PA105|title=Internet Governance|date=2018-11-20|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-395-1|language=en}}</ref>

The use of the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates at least to [[General Magic]] in 1994, where it was used to describe the universe of "places" that [[mobile agent]]s in the [[Telescript (programming language)|Telescript]] environment could go. As described by 
[[Andy Hertzfeld]]:

The use of the cloud metaphor is credited to General Magic communications employee [http://www.whoisdavidhoffman.com/ David Hoffman], based on long-standing use in networking and telecom. In addition, to use by General Magic itself, it was also used in promoting [[AT&T]]'s associated PersonaLink Services.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steven |last=Levy |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/tech-time-warp-cloud-is-born/ |title=Tech Time Warp of the Week: Watch AT&T Invent Cloud Computing in 1994 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2014-05-23 |quote=AT&T and the film's director, David Hoffman, pulled out the cloud metaphor–something that had long been used among networking and telecom types.

Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:
* Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological infrastructure resources.
* Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers. A public-cloud delivery model converts [[capital expenditure]]s (e.g., buying servers) to [[operational expenditure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudave.com/link/recession-is-good-for-cloud-computing-microsoft-agrees |title=Recession Is Good For Cloud Computing – Microsoft Agrees |publisher=CloudAve |accessdate=2010-08-22|date=2009-02-12 }}</ref> This purportedly lowers [[barriers to entry]], as infrastructure is typically provided by a third party and need not be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks.

* [[Computer security|Security]] can improve due to centralization of data, increased security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data, and the lack of security for stored [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]]s. Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cloud-computing-security-forecast-clear-skies/ |title=Cloud computing security forecast: Clear skies |publisher=CNET News |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref> However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security [[audit log]]s may be difficult or impossible. Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s definition of cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":

{{Quote|text=''On-demand self-service.'' A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

''Broad network access.'' Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, [[laptop]]s, and workstations).

''[[Pooling (resource management)|Resource pooling]].'' The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;

''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.|sign=National Institute of Standards and Technology<ref name="nist">{{cite techreport |title=The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing |number=Special publication 800-145|institution=National Institute of Standards and Technology: U.S. Department of Commerce|date= September 2011|author1= Peter Mell |author2= Timothy Grance |doi= 10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145}}</ref>}}

}}</ref> or simply '''[[As a service|aas]]'''), cloud-computing providers offer their "services" according to different models, of which the three standard models per [[NIST]] are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).<ref name="nist"/> These models offer increasing abstraction; they are thus often portrayed as ''layers'' in a [[solution stack|stack]]: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service, but these need not be related. For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS.

===Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)===
{{Main|Infrastructure as a service}}

"Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level [[api|APIs]] used to [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. A [[hypervisor]] runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single [[Linux kernel]] running directly on the physical hardware. Linux [[cgroups]] and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elastichosts.com/blog/elastic-containers/#thetechnicaldetails|title=ElasticHosts Blog|date=2014-04-01|website=Elastichosts|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref> IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine [[disk image|disk-image]] library, raw [[block storage]], file or [[object storage]], firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, [[VLAN|virtual local area networks]] (VLANs), and software bundles.<ref name="DHAC">

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as "where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)."<ref name="nist"/>

IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in [[data centers]]. For [[Wide area network|wide-area]] connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or [[carrier cloud]]s (dedicated [[virtual private network]]s). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ry'mone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuTEDwAAQBAJ&q=Cloud+providers+typically+bill+IaaS+services+on+a+utility+computing+basis:+cost+reflects+the+amount+of+resources+allocated+and+consumed&pg=PA111|title=Internet Governance|date=2018-11-20|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|year=2018|isbn=978-1-83947-395-1|pages=111|language=en}}</ref>

===Platform as a service (PaaS)===
{{Main|Platform as a service}}

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:<ref name="nist"/>

{{quote|text=The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.}}

PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a [[computing platform]], typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.<ref>{{cite conference |author= Boniface, M. |title= Platform-as-a-Service Architecture for Real-Time Quality of Service Management in Clouds |conference= 5th International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services (ICIW) |year= 2010 |pages= 155–160 |place= Barcelona, Spain |publisher= IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ICIW.2010.91 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{qn|date=July 2015}}

Some integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data. Examples include '''iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service)''' and '''dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service)'''. iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows.<ref name="GartnerGlossary">{{cite web|publisher= Gartner|work= Gartner IT Glossary |url= http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas|title = Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)}}</ref> Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.<ref name="GartnerReferenceModel">{{cite web|last= Gartner|title= Gartner Reference Model for Integration PaaS|url= http://www.gartner.com/id=1729256|accessdate= 16 January 2013|author2= Massimo Pezzini |author3= Paolo Malinverno |author4= Eric Thoo }}</ref> dPaaS delivers integration—and data-management—products as a fully managed service.<ref name="ITBusinessEdge">{{cite web|title= IT Business Edge |url= http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/integration/liaisons-data-platform-as-a-service-includes-data-mapping.html|author= Loraine Lawson|accessdate= 6 July 2015}}</ref> Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of programs by building data applications for the customer. dPaaS users access data through [[data visualization|data-visualization]] tools.<ref name="EnterpriseCIOForum">{{cite web|last= Enterprise CIO Forum|title= The Value of Data Platform-as-a-Service (dPaaS)|url= http://www.enterprisecioforum.com/en/blogs/gabriellowy/value-data-platform-service-dpaas|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150419045605/http://www.enterprisecioforum.com/en/blogs/gabriellowy/value-data-platform-service-dpaas|url-status=dead|archive-date= 19 April 2015|author2= Gabriel Lowy|accessdate= 6 July 2015}}</ref>

===Software as a service (SaaS)===
{{Main|Software as a service}}

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:<ref name="nist"/>

{{Quote|text=
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a [[cloud infrastructure]]. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.}}
In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and [[databases]]. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Definition of: SaaS|url= https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/56112/saas |encyclopedia=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple [[virtual machines]] at run-time to meet changing work demand.<ref name="hamdaqa">{{cite book

This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software.

===Serverless computing===
{{Main|Serverless computing}}

Serverless computing is a cloud computing code [[execution (computing)|execution]] model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping [[virtual machines]] as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour.<ref name='techcrunch-lambda'>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/24/aws-lamda-makes-serverless-applications-a-reality/|title=AWS Lambda Makes Serverless Applications A Reality|last=Miller|first=Ron|website=[[TechCrunch]]| date=24 Nov 2015|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers.<ref name='techcrunch-lambda'/> Serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the [[back-end database|back-end]] code to run on.

===Private cloud===
Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.<ref name="nist" /> Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities.

They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls.

===Public cloud===
{{selfref|For a comparison of cloud-computing software and providers, see [[Cloud-computing comparison]]}}
Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|first=Margaret|last=Rouse|title=What is public cloud?|accessdate=12 October 2014|url=http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/public-cloud|publisher=Definition from Whatis.com}}</ref> Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications.<ref name="idc"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/fastconnect|title=FastConnect {{!}} Oracle Cloud Infrastructure|website=cloud.oracle.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref>

Several factors like the [[functionality]] of the solutions, [[Costing|cost]], integrational and [[Organization|organizational]] aspects as well as [[Security|safety & security]] are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or [[On-premises software|on-premise]] solution. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Rainer|last2=Möhring|first2=Michael|last3=Keller|first3=Barbara|date=2017|title=Customer Relationship Management in a Public Cloud environment - Key influencing factors for European enterprises|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/41673|journal=HICSS|doi=10.24251/HICSS.2017.513}}</ref>

===Hybrid cloud===
'''Hybrid''' cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/hybrid-cloud|title=What is hybrid cloud? - Definition from WhatIs.com|website=SearchCloudComputing|language=en|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3233132/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing.html|title=What is hybrid cloud computing? The benefits of mixing private and public cloud services|last=Butler|first=Brandon|date=2017-10-17|website=Network World|language=en|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.<ref name="nist" /> [[Gartner]] defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/thomas_bittman/2012/09/24/mind-the-gap-here-comes-hybrid-cloud/|title=Mind the Gap: Here Comes Hybrid Cloud – Thomas Bittman|work=Thomas Bittman|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref> A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.

Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/753708/Business_Intelligence_Takes_to_Cloud_for_Small_Businesses |title=Business Intelligence Takes to Cloud for Small Businesses |publisher=CIO.com |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/cloud-services/hybrid-cloud-is-it-right-for-your-business-1261343|title=Hybrid cloud: is it right for your business?|author=Désiré Athow|work=TechRadar|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

Another example of hybrid cloud is one where [[Information technology|IT]] organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.<ref>Metzler, Jim; Taylor, Steve. (2010-08-23) [http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/frame/2010/082310wan1.html "Cloud computing: Reality vs. fiction"], Network World.</ref> This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.<ref name="nist" /> Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.<ref>Rouse, Margaret. [http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-bursting "Definition: Cloudbursting"], May 2011. SearchCloudComputing.com.</ref> Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insights.dice.com/2012/06/21/how-cloudbursting-rightsizes-the-data-center/|title=How Cloudbursting "Rightsizes" the Data Center|date=2012-06-22}}</ref> The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called "Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud". A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the cloud's hardware diversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@chanwit/cross-platform-hybrid-cloud-with-docker-ded000f792fb|title=Cross-Platform Hybrid Cloud with Docker|first=Chanwit|last=Kaewkasi|date=3 May 2015}}</ref> This kind of cloud emerges from the rise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.

Hybrid cloud infrastructure essentially serves to eliminate limitations inherent to the multi-access relay characteristics of private cloud networking. The advantages include enhanced runtime flexibility and adaptive memory processing unique to virtualized interface models.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Qiang |first1=Li |title=Adaptive management of virtualized resources in cloud computing using feedback control |journal=First International Conference on Information Science and Engineering |date=2009}}</ref>

===Others===

====Community cloud====
[[Community cloud]] shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally. The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.<ref name="nist" />

====Distributed cloud====
A cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.

* '''Public-resource computing'''—This type of distributed cloud results from an expansive definition of cloud computing, because they are more akin to distributed computing than cloud computing. Nonetheless, it is considered a sub-class of cloud computing. 
* '''Volunteer cloud'''—Volunteer cloud computing is characterized as the intersection of public-resource computing and cloud computing, where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using volunteered resources. Many challenges arise from this type of infrastructure, because of the volatility of the resources used to build it and the dynamic environment it operates in. It can also be called peer-to-peer clouds, or ad-hoc clouds. An interesting effort in such direction is Cloud@Home, it aims to implement a cloud computing infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a business-model to incentivize contributions through financial restitution.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1109/NCA.2009.41| chapter=Volunteer Computing and Desktop Cloud: The Cloud@Home Paradigm| title=2009 Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications| pages=134–139| year=2009| last1=Cunsolo| first1=Vincenzo D.| last2=Distefano| first2=Salvatore| last3=Puliafito| first3=Antonio| last4=Scarpa| first4=Marco| s2cid=15848602}}</ref>

====Multi cloud====
{{Main|Multicloud}}

Multi cloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc. It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy).<ref name=rouse>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=What is a multi-cloud strategy|url=http://searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com/definition/multi-cloud-strategy|publisher=SearchCloudApplications|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=king>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Rachel|title=Pivotal's head of products: We're moving to a multi-cloud world|url=http://www.zdnet.com/pivotals-head-of-products-were-moving-to-a-multi-cloud-world-7000030737/|website=ZDnet|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.groovypost.com/reviews/multcloud-manage-multiple-cloud-accounts/ Multcloud manage multiple cloud accounts].

==== Poly cloud ====
Poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers. It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more that could be done with a single provider.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hub.packtpub.com/polycloud-a-better-alternative-to-cloud-agnosticism/|title=Polycloud: a better alternative to cloud agnosticism|last=Gall|first=Richard|date=2018-05-16|website=Packt Hub|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>

====Big Data cloud====

===Cloud engineering===
'''[[Cloud engineering]]''' is the application of [[engineering]] disciplines to cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems.

==Security and privacy==
{{Main|Cloud computing issues}}

Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time.  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.<ref name="ryan">{{cite web|url= http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103200-cloud-computing-privacy-concerns-on-our-doorstep/fulltext |title= Cloud Computing Privacy Concerns on Our Doorstep }}</ref> Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored.<ref name="ryan"/> Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.<ref name="cloudid">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025|title = CloudID: Trustworthy cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification| journal=Expert Systems with Applications| volume=42| issue=21| pages=7905–7916|year = 2015|last1 = Haghighat|first1 = Mohammad| last2=Zonouz| first2=Saman| last3=Abdel-Mottaleb| first3=Mohamed}}</ref><ref name="ryan"/> [[Identity management systems]] can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215098617316750 Identity and access management in cloud environment: Mechanisms and challenges]</ref> The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.

According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are ''Insecure Interfaces and APIs'', ''Data Loss & Leakage'', and ''Hardware Failure''—which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. "There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a process he called "hyperjacking". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.<ref name="psg.hitachi-solutions.com">{{Cite web|title = Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud Reach the Top 5 Cloud Storage Security Breaches List|url = https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|website = psg.hitachi-solutions.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123032912/https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|archive-date = 2015-11-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read [[information privacy|private data]] as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).<ref name="psg.hitachi-solutions.com"/>

There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/26/business/la-fi-tech-savvy-cloud-services-20120426 |title=Who owns your stuff in the cloud? |date=26 April 2012 |first=Michelle |last=Maltais |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2244954/virtualization/security-of-virtualization--cloud-computing-divides-it-and-security-pros.html|title=Security of virtualization, cloud computing divides IT and security pros|date=2010-02-22|publisher=Network World|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Some small businesses that don't have expertise in [[Information technology|IT]] security could find that it's more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click "Accept" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an [[intelligent personal assistant]] (Apple's [[Siri]] or [[Google Now]]). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Bumpy Road to Private Clouds| url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2549867/data-center/the-bumpy-road-to-private-clouds.html |access-date=8 October 2014| date=2010-12-20 }}</ref>

==Limitations and disadvantages==
According to [[Bruce Schneier]], "The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of [[Economies of scale|economics of scale]], and—like any outsourced task—you tend to get what you want. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it's a feature, not a bug." He also suggests that "the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs" and that businesses need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the risks.<ref>{{Cite web

Privacy and [[confidentiality]] are big concerns in some activities. For instance, sworn translators working under the stipulations of an [[non-disclosure agreement|NDA]], might face problems regarding [[sensitive data]] that are not [[encrypt]]ed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iapti.org/articles/art34-using-cloud-solutions-for-translation-yes-or-no.html |title=Cloud solutions for translation, yes or no?|access-date=23 February 2017|website=[[IAPTI]].org|last=Karra|first=Maria}}</ref>

Cloud computing is beneficial to many enterprises; it lowers costs and allows them to focus on competence instead of on matters of IT and infrastructure. Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime. Technical outages are inevitable and occur sometimes when cloud service providers (CSPs) become overwhelmed in the process of serving their clients. This may result in temporary business suspension. Since this technology's systems rely on the Internet, an individual cannot access their applications, server or data from the cloud during an outage.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Your infrastructure's in the cloud and the Internet goes down.

An alternative approach is to deploy a tool that processes in the cloud itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Adams|last2=Graham|first2=Mann|last3=Valerie|first3=Hobbs|date=2017|title=ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition|url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/|journal=Research Online|doi=10.4225/75/5a838d3b1d27f}}</ref>

For organizations using Office 365 with an 'E5' subscription, there is the option to use Microsoft's built-in ediscovery resources, although these do not provide all the functionality that is typically required for a forensic process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-365-advanced-ediscovery-fd53438a-a760-45f6-9df4-861b50161ae4|title=Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>
