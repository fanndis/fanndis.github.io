Her good performance at the BNP Paribas Open enabled Mladenovic to attain a career-high singles ranking of No. 18, and she became the No. 1 Frenchwoman once again (passing Caroline Garcia). She also had success with Kuznetsova in the doubles, knocking out the fifth-seeded pair of Andrea Hlaváčková and Peng Shuai in the second round before losing in the quarterfinals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/6394781/title/mladenovic-keeps-shining-with-kuznetsova-stuns-hlavackova-peng |title=Mladenovic Keeps Shining With Kuznetsova, Stuns Hlavackova, Peng |publisher=WTA Tennis |access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>

Mladenovic, seeded No. 14, reached her first career Premier Mandatory singles final at the [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open – Women's Singles|Madrid Open]] by defeating her doubles partner Svetlana Kuznetsova in the semifinals. In the final, she lost to third seeded Simona Halep in three sets. On 15 May (the day after the Madrid final), Mladenovic reached a career-high WTA singles ranking of No. 14. Seeded No. 13, Mladenovic lost her singles first round match against Julia Görges at the [[2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia – Women's Singles|Internazionali d'Italia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

At her home Grand Slam, the [[2017 French Open|French Open]], she won her first-round match in a tight three sets against American [[Jennifer Brady]]. In the second round, she faced the 2012 finalist Sara Errani whom she defeated in straight sets.

She defeated the defending champion [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] in three sets to advance to her second quarterfinal of a Grand Slam tournament in her career. She then lost to Timea Bacsinszky.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Her form declined in the second half of the season. At [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], she lost in the singles second round, sustaining a right knee injury in the process. Over the next four months, she struggled to get back into shape again and suffered a loss of confidence. This caused Mladenovic to lose all twelve of her remaining singles matches of 2018 after winning her first-round singles match at the [[2017 Citi Open – Women's Singles|Citi Open]] (she won only two sets in those 12 singles matches) at various hard-court tournaments (including the [[2017 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]]) in North America, Asia and Europe. Arguably her worst moment came at the [[2017 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]], where she suffered a [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|double bagel]] defeat in the first round against [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/wang-demolishes-mladenovic-tokyo-triumph |title=Wang demolishes Mladenovic in Tokyo triumph |publisher=WTA Tennis |date=2017-09-18 |access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>

However, due to a consistent first half of the season which saw Mladenovic being constantly in the top eight of the Race to the WTA Finals, she eventually broke into the top-ten of the singles rankings for the first time in her career (at No. 10) on 23 October 2017, at the start of the [[2017 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]]. And because of big results in that half of the season, Mladenovic called the season "still the best of my career", when opening about her singles slump in the second half of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/kristina-mladenovic-opens-about-her-summer-slump|title = Mladenovic opens up about her summer slump|access-date = 23 October 2017|website = wtatennis.com|publisher = WTA}}</ref>

Mladenovic next played in [[2018 St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy – Singles|St. Petersburg]] as the defending singles champion. After receiving a first-round bye, Mladenovic showed signs of her top form and confidence which enabled her to reach four WTA singles finals in the first half of 2017 by defeating former top-5 player and [[2016 WTA Finals]] champion [[Dominika Cibulková]] in the second round, ending her 15-match losing streak in singles.<ref>{{cite web| title=Mladenovic sees off Cibulkova in St. Petersburg | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/mladenovic-sees-cibulkova-st-petersburg | date = 1 February 2018 | access-date = 1 February 2018}}</ref> She then followed up her second round win by beating Kateřina Siniaková in the quarterfinals and [[Daria Kasatkina]] in the semifinals (who had beaten the 2018 Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki previously), to advance to her first WTA Tour singles final since the [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open - Women's Singles|Madrid Open]] the previous year.

==Playing style==
Mladenovic employs an [[Tennis strategy#All-court player|all-court]] playing style, using variety along with her baseline play to win points. Her forehand is the stronger wing, and is hit both flatly and with topspin. Her backhand is a solid shot, and she is capable of hitting her two-hander consistently and can earn winners from it, but she does also tend to use the backhand slice a lot to change the pace of the rally. She possesses a powerful serve, and her height of 1.84 m (6&nbsp;ft 1⁄2 in) means that she is able to nail first serves accurately with a lot of aces. However, her second serve is a lot weaker and she can serve a lot of double faults in a match. Her doubles success in recent years means she has developed a very good net game as well and she frequently approaches the net to finish off points. She uses her volleys, along with her backhand slice and drop shots, to create a lot of variety in her game. Her movement around the court is very good, considering her height and her footwork, but this can be exposed as a weakness when she needs to recover.

Mladenovic wears [[Adidas]] clothing and uses Wilson rackets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}
