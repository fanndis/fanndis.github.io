==History==
''The Straits Times'' was started by an [[Armenians in Singapore|Armenian]], Catchick Moses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amassia.com.au/moses.htm |title=The History of Armenians in Singapore and Malaysia |publisher=Amassia.com.au |access-date=2015-02-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226203314/http://amassia.com.au/moses.htm |archive-date=2015-02-26 }}</ref>  Moses's friend, Martyrose Apcar, had intended to start a local paper, but met with financial difficulties.  To fulfil his friend's dream, Moses took over and appointed [[Robert Carr Woods]] as editor.  On 15 July 1845, ''The Straits Times'' was launched as an eight-page weekly, published at 7 Commercial Square using a hand-operated press. The subscription fee then was Sp.$1.75 per month.  In September 1846, he sold the paper to Robert Woods because the press proved unprofitable to run.

On 20 February 1942, five days after the British had [[Battle of Singapore|surrendered to the Japanese]], ''The Straits Times'' became known as ''The Shonan Times'' and ''The Syonan Shimbun''.  This name change lasted until 5 September 1945, when Singapore returned to British rule.<ref name=Giese>Giese, O., 1994, Shooting the War, Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, {{ISBN|1557503079}}</ref>{{rp|240}}

During the early days of [[Self-governance of Singapore|Singaporean self-governance]] (before 1965), the paper had an uneasy relationship with some politicians, including the leaders of the [[People's Action Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590430-1.2.87|title=PAP and English Press|date=1959-04-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-08-19|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819020258/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590430-1.2.87|archive-date=2017-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590519-1.2.62|title=Press Freedom|date=1959-05-19|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-08-19|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819164945/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590519-1.2.62|archive-date=2017-08-19}}</ref> Editors were warned that any reportage that may threaten the merger between Singapore and the Malayan Federation may result in subversion charges, and that they may be detained without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Preservation of Public Security Ordinance Act]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590522-1.2.13|title=IPI to Discuss PAP Threat Against The Straits Times|date=1959-05-22|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-08-19|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820000358/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590522-1.2.13|archive-date=2017-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590528-1.2.113|title='Ugly threats' are also a menace to already dwindling liberties|date=1959-05-28|access-date=2017-08-19|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819235302/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590528-1.2.113|archive-date=2017-08-19}}</ref>

In his memoir ''OB Markers: My Straits Times Story'', former editor-in-chief [[Cheong Yip Seng]] recounts how, since 1986, there has been a government-appointed "monitor" at the newspaper, "someone who could watch to see if indeed the newsroom was beyond control", and that disapproval of the "monitor" could cost a reporter or editor their job.<ref name="sentinel">{{cite web |url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5074&Itemid=604 |title=Book Review: Lee Kuan Yew's Taming of the Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005145103/http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5074&Itemid=604 |archive-date=5 October 2013 |access-date=7 September 2016}}</ref>  Cheong identifies the first monitor as [[S.

==Criticisms==
''The Straits Times'' has also been criticised by netizens for sloppy and biased reporting. For instance, the newspaper repeatedly interviewed a commuter named Ashley Wu on 8 occasions within a span of 10 months, whenever the trains broke down, rather than getting fresh viewpoints from different affected commuters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theindependent.sg/transport-minister-vs-singapores-only-commuter-ashley-wu/ | title=Transport Minister vs. "Singapore's only commuter" Ashley Wu | access-date=2017-07-31 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731072500/http://www.theindependent.sg/transport-minister-vs-singapores-only-commuter-ashley-wu/ | archive-date=2017-07-31 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mothership.sg/2017/07/thanks-to-minister-khaw-ashley-wu-aged-35-to-37-is-spores-most-famous-public-transport-user/|title=Thanks to Minister Khaw, Ashley Wu, aged 35 to 37, is S'pore's most famous public transport user|website=Mothership.sg|access-date=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322225957/https://mothership.sg/2017/07/thanks-to-minister-khaw-ashley-wu-aged-35-to-37-is-spores-most-famous-public-transport-user/|archive-date=22 March 2018}}</ref> The newspaper is also known to modify and insert additional lines to [[op-ed]] contributors' works, altering the tone and message of the articles, without notifying them in advance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Straits Times modifies AWARE contributor's article for "Opinion" section, adds in lines without telling her|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/09/straits-times-modifies-aware-contributors-article-for-opinion-section-adds-in-lines-without-telling-her/|publisher=Mothership.sg|access-date=12 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111205057/https://mothership.sg/2017/09/straits-times-modifies-aware-contributors-article-for-opinion-section-adds-in-lines-without-telling-her/|archive-date=11 November 2017}}</ref>
