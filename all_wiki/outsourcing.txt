==Overview==

===Motivations===
[[Global labor arbitrage]] can provide major financial savings from lower international labor rates, which could be a major motivation for offshoring. Historically, there has been a strong focus on cost optimization and service improvement, however, there is now greater prioritization towards revenue generation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-06-14|title=The Evolution of Sourcing Advisory|url=https://avasant.com/insights/publications/the-evolution-of-sourcing-advisory/|access-date=2020-10-23|website=Avasant|language=en-US}}</ref> Cost savings from [[economies of scale]] and specialization can also motivate outsourcing, but a report by Forrester Research in 2015 observed that "cost-cutting is no longer the top goal of outsourcing".<ref name=forrester>Forrester Research, Inc., [https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Global+Infrastructure+Outsourcing+Q1+2015/-/E-RES118404# The Forrester Wave™: Global Infrastructure Outsourcing, Q1 2015], published 13 January 2015, accessed 21 November 2020</ref> Forrester's research among 13,822 global and technology decision-makers identified the following main objectives:

*Improving the customer experience (75%)
*Cost reduction (64%)
*Market differentiation (50%)
*[[Regulatory compliance]] (46%).<ref name=forrester />

Another motivation is speed to market; to make this work, a new process was developed: "outsource the outsourcing process".<ref name="CIO.97">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO (magazine)|CIO]] |date=April 1, 1997 |page=12

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control by allowing organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, makes available specialized expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses,<ref>{{cite journal |author=B. Olive

===Agreements===
Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an [[Financial transaction|exchange]] of [[Service (economics)|services]], expertise, and [[payments]].

====Limitations due to growth====
Inflation, high domestic interest rates, and economic growth pushed India's IT salaries 10 - 15%, making some jobs relatively "too" expensive, compared to other offshoring destinations. Areas for advancing within the value chain included research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, and [[medical transcription]].

For Australian IT companies, [[Indonesia]] is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.

===Growth of white-collar outsourcing===
Although offshoring initially focused on manufacturing, [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] offshoring/outsourcing has grown rapidly since the early 21st century. The [[digital workplace|digital workforce]] of countries like [[India]] and [[China]] are only paid a fraction of what would be [[minimum wage]] in the US. On average, [[software engineer]]s are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the [[US]] and [[Canada]].<ref name="Gillis">[http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Gillis, A.

Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar workers can choose their working hours, and for which companies to work. Clients benefit from [[telecommuting]], reduced office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are [[independent contractor|contracted workers]].<ref name="Ross">Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010).

Co-sourcing services can supplement internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information [[risk management]] or integrity services, or help during peak periods, or similarly for other areas such as software development or human resources.

====Identity management co-sourcing====
[[Identity management]] co-sourcing is when on-site hardware<ref>{{cite web

This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

====Offshore Software R&D Co-sourcing====
'''Offshore Software R&D''' is the provision of [[software development]] services by a supplier (whether external or internal) located in a different country from the one where the software will be used. The global software R&D services market, as contrasted to ''Information Technology Outsourcing'' (ITO) and [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]], is rather young and currently is at a relatively early stage of development.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6279679.stm

==Usability issues in offshore development==
The main driver for offshoring development work has been the greater availability of developers at a lower cost than in the home country. However, the rise in offshore development has taken place in parallel with an increased awareness of the importance of usability, and the user experience, in software. Outsourced development poses special problems for development, i.e. the more formal, contractual relationship between the supplier and client, and geographical separation place greater distance between the developers and users, which makes it harder to reflect the users' needs in the final product. This problem is exacerbated if the development is offshore. Further complications arise from cultural differences, which apply even if the development is carried out by an in-house offshore team.<ref name=GrailComm.cio>{{cite magazine  |magazine=[[CIO magazine]]
   |url=https://www.cio.com/article/2438045/communication--the-holy-grail-of-outsourcing.html
   |title=Communication: The Holy Grail of Outsourcing
   |author=Gabriel Fuchs   |date=September 14, 2007}}</ref>

Historically offshore development concentrated on back office functions but, as offshoring has grown, a wider range of applications have been developed. Offshore suppliers have had to respond to the commercial pressures arising from usability issues by building up their usability expertise. Indeed, this problem has presented an attractive opportunity to some suppliers to move up market and offer higher value services.<ref>[http://www.userindesign.com/Images/Papers/Usability%20Issues%20in%20Offshore.pdf "Usability Issues in Offshore Development: an Indian Perspective"], accessed January 8, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.clarotesting.com/page12.htm "What Happens to Usability when Development goes Offshore?"], accessed January 8, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.userindesign.com/Images/Papers/Offshore%20Development%20Culture%20and%20UX.pdf "Offshore Development Culture and User Experience"], accessed January 8, 2013</ref>

===Legal issues===
Offshore Software R&D means that company A turns over responsibility, in whole or in part, of an in-house software development to company B whose location is outside of company A's national jurisdiction. Maximizing the economic value of an offshore software development asset critically depends on understanding how best to use the available forms of legal regulations to protect intellectual rights. If the vendor cannot be trusted to protect trade secrets, then the risks of an offshoring software development may outweigh its potential benefits. Hence, it is critical to review the intellectual property policy of the potential offshoring supplier. The intellectual property protection policy of an offshore software development company must be reflected in these crucial documents: General Agreement; Non-Disclosure Agreement; Employee Confidentiality Contract.<ref>How to protect intellectual property and confidential information dealing with offshore software development company? https://belitsoft.com/offshore-software-development-company/protect-intellectual-property-and-confidential-information</ref>

==Implications==

===Performance measurement===
Focusing on [[software quality]] metrics is a good way to maintain track of how well a project is performing.

===Management processes===
Globalization and complex [[supply chains]], along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as [[voice over IP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Issue tracking]] systems, new [[time management]] methods such as [[Comparison of time tracking software|time tracking software]], and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as [[Comparison of development estimation software|cost estimation software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Outsourcing often represents a managerial challenge, as outsourcing drivers and goals need to be continuously aligned with contractual and managerial aspects of the business relationship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Obwegeser|first1=Nikolaus|last2=Arenfeldt|first2=Katrine|last3=Dam|first3=Amalie Corty|last4=Fenger|first4=Kim Harder|last5=Silkjaer|first5=Johan Vang|date=2020-01-02|title=Aligning drivers, contractual governance, and relationship management of IT-outsourcing initiatives|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15228053.2020.1786265|journal=Journal of Information Technology Case and Application Research|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=40–66|doi=10.1080/15228053.2020.1786265|s2cid=221056997|issn=1522-8053}}</ref> For example, strategic outsourcing initiatives that resemble corporate partnerships may rely less on strict contractual regulations and their enforcement (e.g., penalties and [[Service-level agreement|service-level-agreements]]) but rather focus on developing mutual [[Trust (social science)|trust]] and a shared strategic [[Strategic vision|vision]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Jensen|first1=Preben|title=Trust and Control in Complex Information Systems Development|date=2015|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-24366-5_3|work=Information Systems: Development, Applications, Education|volume=232|pages=32–44|editor-last=Wrycza|editor-first=Stanislaw|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24366-5_3|isbn=978-3-319-24365-8|access-date=2020-09-17|last2=Ladefoged|first2=Christian|last3=Søgård|first3=Michael|last4=Obwegeser|first4=Nikolaus}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Maida|first1=Martina|title=A Multidimensional Model of Trust in Recommender Systems|date=2012|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-32273-0_19|work=E-Commerce and Web Technologies|volume=123|pages=212–219|editor-last=Huemer|editor-first=Christian|place=Berlin, Heidelberg|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-32273-0_19|isbn=978-3-642-32272-3|access-date=2020-09-17|last2=Maier|first2=Konradin|last3=Obwegeser|first3=Nikolaus|last4=Stix|first4=Volker|editor2-last=Lops|editor2-first=Pasquale}}</ref>

These reversals, however, did not undo the damage. New factories often:
* were in different locations
* needed different skill sets
* used more automation.<ref name=NYT.ecoBart/>

Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 US presidential campaigns]], but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.<ref name=Econ1/>

* Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
* Organizations are "redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks".
* Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to "maximize the value of those relationships".

===Insourcing===
'''Insourcing''' is the process of reversing an outsourcing, possibly using help from those not currently part of the inhouse staff.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |website=Plunkettresearch.com

Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions, and some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed.  Often the reason is to maintain control of critical production or competencies, and insourcing is used to reduce costs of taxes, labor and transportation.<ref name="Shermon, G.">Shermon, G (2017). "Digital Talent – Business Models and Competencies" Page 190</ref>

[[Regional insourcing]], a related term, is when a company assigns work to a subsidiary that is within the same country. This differs from ''onshoring'' and ''reshoring'': these may be either inside or outside the company.

====Regional insourcing====
'''Regional insourcing''' is a process in which a company establishes satellite locations for specific entities of their business, making use of advantages one state may have over another<ref>such as taxes, education, or workforce skill sets</ref><ref>David Van Adelsberg, and Edward A Trolley, "Strategic Insourcing: Getting the Most from the Best," ''Training and Development'' 52. no. 7 (1998): 57-59.</ref> This concept focuses on the delegating or reassigning of procedures, functions, or jobs from production within a business in one location to another internal entity that specializes in that operation.  This allows companies to streamline production, boost competency, and increase their bottom line.

This competitive strategy applies the classical argument of [[Adam Smith]], which posits that two nations would benefit more from one another by trading the goods that they are more proficient at manufacturing.<ref>Adam Smith, ''The Wealth of Nations: Part II'' (New York: Princeton Library, 1902), 102-104</ref><ref>Robert C.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of [[globalization]] and [[Polarization (economics)|economic polarization]].<ref>[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2006).

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the [[Acquired Rights Directive]] attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

In particular, distinction is needed between
* ''cyclical unemployment'' – for which ''pump it up'' solutions have worked in the past, and
* ''structural unemployment'' – when "businesses and industries that employed them no longer exist, and their skills no longer have the value they once did."<ref name=NYT.ecoBart>{{cite newspaper

USA outsourcing's effect on Mexico, studies suggest, is that for every 10% increase in US wages, north Mexico cities along the [[Mexico–United States border|border]] experienced wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.<ref>Hanson, G. (2003), "What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico Since [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]", NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA.</ref>

By contrast, higher rates of saving and investment in Asian countries, along with rising levels of education, studies suggest, fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. There was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures.<ref>Krugman, P., Obtsfeld, M. And Melitz, M., (2012) "East Asia: Success and Crisis", in International Economics: Theory and Policy, Addison-Wesley.</ref>

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist [[Greg Mankiw]], the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.<ref name=Mankiw>{{cite web

=====Environmental policy=====
Import competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries.

As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s.

Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.<ref>Copeland, B.

  |access-date=March 17, 2014  |author=Daisie Hobson}}</ref> The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. Just as the U.S. has a "Made in U.S.A." program, other countries support products made in their countries as well.  Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster.

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.<ref>Easterly, W. (2002), "Solow's Surprise: Investment is not the Key to Growth", Ch. 3 in The Elusive Quest for Growth, The MIT Press, Cambridge.</ref>

"Outsourcing" is a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring during the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] called U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in [[tax haven]]s to avoid paying their "fair share" of [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxes]] "[[Benedict Arnold]] corporations".

A [[Zogby International]] August 2004 poll found that 71% of American voters believed "outsourcing jobs overseas" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against these companies, possibly in the form of increased taxes.<ref>Zogby International survey results online at [http://www.zogby.com/news/2004/09/22/majority-of-americans-71-say-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-bad-for-us-economy-china-viewed-as-greatest-e/ zogby.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Bonasia, J.

===Europe===
Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977 protects employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended 29 June 1998, Directive 98/50/EC & 12 March 2001's Directive 2001/23). Rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor.

Case subsequent to the European Court of Justice's Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994] have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, [[Süzen v Zehnacker Gebaeudereingung GmbH|Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice]], Case C-13/95 [1997]). In principle, employees may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

===Asia===
Countries that have been the focus of outsourcing include India, Pakistan, and the Philippines for American and European companies, and China and [[Vietnam]] for Japanese companies.

The Asian IT service market is still in its infancy, but in 2008 industry think tank Nasscom-McKinsey predicted a $17 billion IT service industry in India alone.<ref>Global Sourcing of Business and IT Services, https://books.google.com/books?id=_IHStt6MRukC&lpg</ref>

Article 44 of Japan's Employment Security Act implicitly bans the domestic/foreign workers supplied by unauthorized companies regardless of their operating locations. The law will apply if at least one party of suppliers, clients, labors reside in Japan, and if the labors are the integral part of the chain of command by the client company, or the supplier.
* No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.
** A person who falls under any of the following items shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen. (Article 64)
* Unless permitted by act, no person shall obtain profit by intervening, as a business, in the employment of another.<ref>{{cite web|title=日本法令外国語訳データベースシステム - [法令本文表示] - 労働基準法|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?yo=%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E5%9F%BA%E6%BA%96%E6%B3%95&ft=2&re=01&ky=|access-date=April 10, 2019|website=www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp}}</ref>

'''Nearshoring''' or Nearsourcing is having [[business process]]es, especially [[information technology]] processes such as application maintenance and development or testing, in a nearby country, often sharing a border with the target country. Commonalities usually include: geographic, temporal (time zone), cultural, social, linguistic, economic, political, or historical linkages.<ref name="cacm">{{cite web |work=Communications of the ACM
  |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1290959
  |title=Why 'nearshore' means that distance matters
  |date=October 2007 |author1=Erran Carmel |author2=Pamela Abbott }}</ref> However, some of these commonalities — such as cultural, social, and linguistic linkages — can also be achieved through offshore outsourcing because, historically, several nations have attempted at expanding their territory and control over other, more distant nations through [[colonization]]. 

The term '''Nearshoring''' is a derivative of the business term [[offshoring]]. The hybrid term "nearshore outsourcing" is sometimes used as an alternative for '''nearshoring''', since nearshore workers are not employees of the company for which the work is performed. It can also be a reversal, by contracting a development partner in a different country but in close proximity (same or nearby time zone), facilitating communication and allowing frequent visits. This is a business strategy to place some or all of its operations close to where its products are sold. Typically, this is contrasted with the trend to outsource low-wage manufacturing operations to developing nations (offshoring), and reflects a reversal of that trend. Sometime, the work is done by an outside contracted company rather than internally ([[insourcing]]), but unlike offshore outsourcing, the work is done in fairly close proximity to either the company headquarters or its target market.

In Europe, nearshore outsourcing relationships are between clients in larger European economies and various providers in smaller European nations.

Major centers are [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]]. The attraction is lower-cost skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. These countries also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe as they are part of EU. For example, as of 2020 Portugal is considered to be the most trending outsourcing destination<ref>{{Cite web  |website=EY.com ([[Ernst & Young]])

In the US, American clients nearshore to [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]], as well as to many nations in Central and South America.

===Reasons to nearshore ===
====Culture====
Cultural alignment with the business is often more readily achieved through near-sourcing due to there being similarities between the cultures in which the business is located and in which services are sub-contracted, including for example proficiency with the language used in that culture.<ref name=GrailComm.cio/> 

====Communication====
Constraints imposed by time zones can complicate communication; near-sourcing or nearshoring offers a solution. English language skills are the cornerstone of Nearshore and IT services. Collaboration by universities, industry, and government has slowly produced improvements. Proximity also facilitates in-person interaction regularly and/or when required.<ref name=NearZone.FT>{{cite newspaper

====Other Advantages====
Software development nearshoring is mainly due to flexibility when it comes to upscale or downscale<ref>{{Cite news
|date=2020-07-21 |title=Nearshore Software Development
|url=https://www.velv.pt/updates/2020/7/2/nearshore-software-development-teams}}</ref> teams or availability of low cost

The complexities of offshoring stem from language and cultural differences, travel distances, workday/time zone mismatches, and greater effort for needed for establishing trust and long-term relationships. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as remote insourcing were created to give clients more control in managing their own projects. Nearshoring still hasn't overcome all barriers, but proximity allows more flexibility to align organizations.<ref name="sam">{{Cite web |author=Sam Cinquegrani

==Print and mail outsourcing==
'''Print and mail outsourcing''' is the outsourcing of document printing and distribution.

The [[Print Services & Distribution Association]] was formed in 1946, and its members provide services that today might involve the word outsource. Similarly, members of the [[Direct Mail Marketing Association]] were the "outsourcers" for advertising agencies and others doing mailings. DMMA celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2017.

The term "outsourcing" became very common in the print and mail business during the 1990s, and later expanded to be very broad and inclusive of most any process by the year 2000. Today, there are web based print to mail solutions for small to mid-size companies which allow the user to send one to thousands of documents into the mail stream, directly from a desktop or web interface.<ref>examples: Neopost.com's IS-330 Mailing System (desktop), Click2mail.com, USPS Web Tool Kit Application Program Interface ... web-based  {{cite web

==Business process outsourcing==
'''Business process outsourcing''' ('''BPO''') is a subset of outsourcing that involves the [[contract]]ing of the operations and responsibilities of a specific [[business process]] to a third-party [[service provider]]. Originally, this was associated with [[manufacturing]] firms, such as [[Coca-Cola]] that outsourced large segments of its [[supply chain]].<ref>Tas, J. & Sunder, S. 2004, ''Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing'', Communications of the ACM, Vol 47, No. 5</ref>

Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximising positive outcome, minimising risks and avoiding any threats, a [[business continuity management]] (BCM) model is set up. BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.<ref>Forbes Gibb, and Steven Buchanan.

With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more<ref name="GartnerLength">{{Citation  |publisher=Gartner

On the other hand, an academic study by the [[London School of Economics]] was at pains to counter the so-called "myth" that ''RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore''.<ref name="LSEXchanging">{{Citation |publisher=London School of Economics

|url=http://www.xchanging.com/system/files/dedicated-downloads/robotic-process-automation.pdf}}</ref> One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes-based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a "lift and shift" approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.

=== Industry size ===
One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.<ref name="almanac">{{cite web  |website=itproportal.com

India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India, the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the national industry association.<ref>{{cite web   |website=ETCIO.com

<!--- "Transition methodology" (5 entries in SEE ALSO, 2 External links, a 5-step/norefs PMO text) was the only article "re" EPO, and there was no "THERE" there -->

== Economic theory ==
In [[economic theory]], the pros and cons of outsourcing have been discussed since [[Ronald Coase]] (1937) asked the famous question: Why is not all production carried on by one big firm?<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coase|first=R. H.|date=1937|title=The Nature of the Firm|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|journal=Economica|language=en|volume=4|issue=16|pages=386–405|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|issn=0013-0427}}</ref> An informal answer has been provided by [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] (1979), who has emphasized the importance of different transaction costs within and between firms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver E.|date=1979|title=Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/466942|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233–261|doi=10.1086/466942|s2cid=8559551|issn=0022-2186}}</ref> The boundaries of the firm (i.e., the distinction between transactions taking place within a firm and transactions between different firms) have been formally studied by [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] (1995) and his coauthors.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hart, Oliver D.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32703648|title=Firms, contracts, and financial structure|date=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-828881-6|location=Oxford|oclc=32703648}}</ref> According to the property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]], the ownership structure (i.e., integration or non-integration) determines how the returns to non-contractible investments will be divided in future negotiations. Hence, whether or not outsourcing an activity to a different firm is optimal depends on the relative importance of the investments that the trading partners have to make. For instance, if only one party has to make an important non-contractible investment decision, then this party should be owner.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=Sanford J.|last2=Hart|first2=Oliver D.|date=1986|title=The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261404|journal=Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=691–719|doi=10.1086/261404|issn=0022-3808}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Oliver|last2=Moore|first2=John|date=1990|title=Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261729|journal=Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=1119–1158|doi=10.1086/261729|s2cid=15892859|issn=0022-3808}}</ref> However, the conclusions of the incomplete contracting theory crucially rely on the specification of the negotiations protocol (DeMeza and Lockwood, 1998)<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Meza|first1=D.|last2=Lockwood|first2=B.|date=1998|title=Does Asset Ownership Always Motivate Managers?
