'''Glasgow''' is one of the eight [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral regions]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. Nine of the parliament's 73 [[first past the post]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]] are sub-divisions of the region and it elects seven of the 56 [[additional member (Scottish Parliament)|additional-member]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)]]. Thus it elects a total of 16 MSPs.

== Constituencies and council areas ==

As a result of the [[First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries]] the boundaries of the region and constituencies were redrawn for the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]].

Scottish Westminster constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies in 2005.<ref>See [http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ ''The 5th Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Scotland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921124603/http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ |date=21 September 2007 }}''</ref> Holyrood constituencies were unaltered.
