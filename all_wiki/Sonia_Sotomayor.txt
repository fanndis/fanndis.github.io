She was [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 26, 2009 and has served since August 8, 2009. Sotomayor is the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latina]] member of the Court.<ref name="nyt053009rc"/>

Sotomayor was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' from [[Princeton University]] in 1976 and received her [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1979, where she was an editor at the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. She worked as an [[assistant district attorney]] in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the [[LatinoJustice PRLDEF|Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund]], the [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]], and the [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]].

Sotomayor was nominated to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. Her nomination was slowed by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority in the [[United States Senate]], but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the [[New York University School of Law]] and [[Columbia Law School]].

In May 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|nominated Sotomayor]] to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice [[David Souter]]. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity, including ''[[Schuette v. BAMN]]'', ''[[Utah v. Strieff]]'', and ''[[Trump v. Hawaii]]''.

===Notable rulings===
====Abortion====
In the 2002 decision ''[[Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush]]'',<ref name="crlpvb">''[[Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush]]'', [http://openjurist.org/304/f3d/183/center-for-reproductive-law-and-policy-v-w-bush 304 F.3d 183] (2d Cir. 2002)</ref> Sotomayor upheld the [[George W.

====First Amendment rights====
In ''[[Pappas v. Giuliani]]'' (2002),<ref>''[[Pappas v. Giuliani]]'', 290 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2002).</ref> Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the [[New York Police Department]] could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected speech by the employee "away from the office, on [his] own time", even if that speech was "offensive, hateful, and insulting", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_05/018353.php|title=Sotomayor: The Record|last=Benen|first=Steve|date=May 27, 2009|work=[[The Washington Monthly]]|access-date=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for ''[[United States v. Quattrone]]''.<ref name=USvQuattroneOpenJurist>''United States v. Quattrone'', [http://openjurist.org/402/f3d/304/united-states-v-quattrone-abc-lp-lllp-lp 402 F.3d 304] (2d Cir. 2005).</ref> Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. Some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order to forbid the publication of the juror's names. In ''United States v. Quattrone'', Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, and the district court ordered the media not to publish the names of jurors, even though those names had been disclosed in open court. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press "to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom".<ref name=USvQuattroneOpenJurist />

In 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in ''[[Doninger v. Niehoff]]''<ref name=Doninger>''[[Doninger v. Niehoff]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/2nd/073885p.pdf Doninger v. Niehoff, 527 F.3d 41] (2d Cir. 2008).</ref> that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge [[Debra Livingston]], the district court's judgment that [[Lewis S. Mills High School]] did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials "douchebags" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and "piss her off more".<ref name=Doninger /> Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech "foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment",<ref>''Doninger v. Niehoff'', p. 15.</ref> which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.<ref name=Doninger />  Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives |title=Sotomayor had key role in Doninger case |work=New Britain Herald |date=May 28, 2009 |author=Collins, Steve }}</ref>

====Second Amendment rights====
Sotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in ''[[Maloney v. Cuomo]]'' (2009).<ref name="maloney-v-cuomo">''Maloney v. Cuomo'', 554 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2009)</ref>  Maloney was arrested for possession of [[nunchucks]], which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in ''[[Presser v. Illinois]]'', a Supreme Court case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment "is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state".<ref name="maloney-v-cuomo"/> With respect to the ''Presser v. Illinois'' precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has "the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,"<ref name=wapo060309conserv>{{cite news | author=Barnes, Robert | title=Conservative Judges Echo Sotomayor in Gun Ruling | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/02/AR2009060203379.html |work=The Washington Post | date= June 3, 2009 | access-date=June 4, 2009}}</ref> and the recent Supreme Court case of ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (which struck down the district's gun ban as unconstitutional) did "not invalidate this longstanding principle".<ref name="maloney-v-cuomo"/> The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.<ref>{{cite news |author=Goldstein, Tom |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2009/05/judge-sotomayors-appellate-opinions-in-civil-cases/ |title=Judge Sotomayor's Appellate Opinions in Civil Cases |publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]] | date=May 15, 2009 |access-date=September 19, 2010 |author-link=Tom Goldstein}}</ref>  On June 2, 2009, a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges [[Richard Posner]] and [[Frank Easterbrook]], unanimously agreed with ''Maloney v. Cuomo'', citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to [[Chicago]]'s gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.<ref name=wapo060309conserv />

====Fourth Amendment rights====
In ''[[N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut]]'' (2004),<ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist>''N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut'', [http://openjurist.org/382/f3d/225/ng-sg-sc-v-connecticut 382 F.3d. 225] (2d Cir. 2004).</ref> Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of "troubled adolescent girls" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to "the severely intrusive nature of strip searches",<ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist /> they should not be allowed "in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime".<ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist /> She argued that an "individualized suspicion" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.<ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist />

In ''[[Leventhal v. Knapek]]'' (2001),<ref name=LeventhalvKnapekOpenJurist>''Leventhal v. Knapek'', [http://openjurist.org/266/f3d/64 266 F.3d 64] (2d Cir. 2001).</ref> Sotomayor rejected a [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] challenge by a [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, "Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights"<ref name=LeventhalvKnapekOpenJurist /> because here "there were reasonable grounds to believe" that the search would reveal evidence of "work-related misconduct".<ref name=LeventhalvKnapekOpenJurist />

====Alcohol in commerce====
In 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in ''[[Granholm v. Heald|Swedenburg v. Kelly]]'' that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]], was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as ''Swedenburg v. Kelly'' and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite news |author=Daley, Bill |title=Sotomayor and wine: One pro's perspective |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2009/05/sotomayor-and-wine-one-pros-perspective.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303171733/http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2009/05/sotomayor-and-wine-one-pros-perspective.html |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref>

====Employment discrimination====
Sotomayor was involved in the high-profile case ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'' <!-- Link to her opinion? --> that initially upheld the right of the [[New Haven, Connecticut|City of New Haven]] to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the City believed the test had a "disparate impact"<ref name="nyt040909">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/us/10scotus.html | title=Justices to Hear White Firefighters' Bias Claims |work=The New York Times | date= April 9, 2009 | author=Liptak, Adam}}</ref> on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The City chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned [[summary order]] (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/us/politics/06ricci.html | title=New Scrutiny of Judge's Most Controversial Case | author=Liptak, Adam |work=The New York Times | date=June 5, 2009 | access-date=July 14, 2009}}</ref> Sotomayor's former mentor [[José A.

[[Maurice Clarett]] challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds.

In ''[[Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko]]'' (2000),<ref>''[[Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko]]'', 299 F.3d 374 (2d Cir. 2000).</ref> Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that an existing Supreme Court doctrine, known as "[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]"—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the Bivens doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.

Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was "contrary to the school's established policies" as well as its treatment of white students, which "supports the inference that race discrimination played a role".

====Property rights====
In ''[[Krimstock v. Kelly]]'' (2002),<ref>''Krimstock v. Kelly'', 306 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 2002)</ref> Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for "months or even years" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's continued possession of their property.

In ''[[Brody v. Village of Port Chester]]'' (2003 and 2005),<ref>''Brody v. Village of Port Chester'', 345 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2003) and ''Brody v.

A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/package/supremecourt/sotomayor-on-the-issues.html?hpid=topnews | title=Sotomayor on the Issues |work=The Washington Post | access-date=August 22, 2009}}</ref>

The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' ruling.

[imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics."<ref name="08-205"/><ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', pp. 260–264.</ref>

In succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor had done little to change the philosophical and ideological balance of the Court.<ref name="nyt-recap-2010"/><ref name="nykr-stevens"/><ref name="lat-soto-recap"/>  While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/us/supreme-courts-recent-term-a-new-phase.html?_r=1&hpw&pagewanted=all | title=Supreme Court Moving Beyond Its Old Divides | author=Liptak, Adam | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 1, 2012 | page=A1}}</ref> Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.<ref name="coyle-16"/> During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90&nbsp;percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.<ref name="nyt-recap-2010"/><ref name="SCOTUSblog">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Final-Charts-070710-JA.pdf|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|title=SCOTUSblog Statpack for the 2009 Term, chart of agreement between justices|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> In a 2015 article titled "Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.<ref name="supreme-court-justices.insidegov.com">Alex Greer.

Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) have comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.<ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', p. 4.</ref> Although, five of the justices on the Supreme Court self-identify as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.<ref name="nyt053009rc"/>  Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse set of life experiences to the court.<ref>Tribe and Matz, ''Uncertain Justice'', p. 10.</ref>

There have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the [[Confrontation Clause]] of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.<ref name="coyle-16">Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', pp. 16–17.</ref>  Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the [[originalism|originalist]] reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.

On January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President [[Joe Biden]] for [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|the inauguration of his second term]]. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama officially begins his second term with oath|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-inauguration-celebration-to-begin-with-oath/2013/01/20/651aa97e-6311-11e2-9e1b-07db1d2ccd5b_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 20, 2013|first1=David|last1=Nakamura|first2=Robert|last2=Barnes}}</ref>

By the end of her fifth year on the court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.<ref name="nyt-fifth">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/us/politics/sotomayor-finds-her-voice-among-the-justices.html | title=Sotomayor Finds Her Voice Among Justices | author=Liptak, Adam | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 7, 2014 | page=A1| author-link=Adam Liptak }}</ref> Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.<ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', p. 8.</ref> In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race," by stating, "I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis."<ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', p. 117.</ref> In the manufacturer liability case of ''[[Williamson v. Mazda]]'', which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.<ref>Tushnet, ''In the Balance'', pp. 198–199.</ref> Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.<ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', p. 233.</ref> When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: "Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench."<ref>Coyle, ''The Roberts Court'', p. 317.</ref>

During her tenure on the court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.<ref>Tribe and Matz, ''Uncertain Justice'', pp. 310–311.</ref>  She has been identified by [[Laurence Tribe]] as the foremost voice on the court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication – in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy – and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]].<ref>Tribe and Matz, ''Uncertain Justice'', pp. 10–11, 268–271.</ref>

In January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of ''[[The Week]]'' wrote that an "unexpected civil libertarian alliance" was developing between Sotomayor and [[Neil Gorsuch]] "in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kristian |first1=Bonnie |title=The unexpected alliance of Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch |url=https://theweek.com/articles/816202/unexpected-alliance-sonia-sotomayor-neil-gorsuch |access-date=28 January 2019 |magazine=The Week |date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

===Notable rulings===
[[File:Sonia Sotomayor (31682851733).jpg|thumb|right|Sotomayor in 2017]]
In 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police [[Custodial interrogation|custody]] for ''[[Miranda warning|Miranda]]'' purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in [[special education]] classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a ''Miranda'' warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his [[Legal guardian#United States|legal guardian]]. In determining that a child's age properly informs the ''Miranda'' custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that "to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults— would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that Miranda guarantees to adults".<ref name=opinion>''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf 564 U.S. ___], (U.S.S.C. 2011)</ref> Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in ''Stansbury v. California'' (holding that held that a child's age "would have affected how a reasonable person" would "perceive his or her freedom to leave") and ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (holding that a child's age "generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (e.g. limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). [[Associate Justice]] [[Samuel Alito]], jointed by three other justices, wrote a [[dissenting opinion]].

In ''[[United States v. Alvarez]]'' (2012), the Court struck down the [[Stolen Valor Act]] (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the [[Free Speech Clause]], it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.<ref>Tushnet, ''In the Balance'', pp. 216–217.</ref>

In ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's [[Taxing and Spending Clause]] rather than [[Commerce Clause]] in arriving at the support). Legal writer [[Jeffrey Toobin]] wrote, "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)."<ref name="toobin-280">Toobin, ''The Oath'', p. 280.</ref> Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.<ref name="toobin-280"/>

Sotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in ''[[Arizona v. United States]]'' (2012), that struck down several aspects of the [[Arizona SB 1070]] anti-illegal immigration law.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://ktar.com/22/1553093/Supreme-Court-strikes-down-portions-of-Arizonas-SB-1070 | title=Supreme Court upholds portions of Arizona's SB 1070 | publisher=[[KTAR-FM]] | date=June 25, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630032928/http://www.ktar.com/22/1553093/Supreme-Court-strikes-down-portions-of-Arizonas-SB-1070 | archive-date=June 30, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>Toobin, ''The Oath'', p. 285.</ref>

On the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections relating to [[privacy rights]] and [[search and seizure]].<ref name=FordFourth>Matt Ford, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/justice-sotomayor-fourth-amendment/414948/ Pleading for the Fourth], ''The Atlantic'' (November 12, 2015).</ref><ref name=RootFourth>Damon Root, [https://reason.com/2016/07/01/sonia-sotomayor-stands-up-for-the-fourth/ Sonia Sotomayor Stands Up for the Fourth Amendment], ''Reason'' (July 1, 2016).</ref> In ''[[United States v. Jones (2012)|United States v. Jones]]'' (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding [[third-party doctrine]]: "It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties."<ref name="msnbc-leon" /> The following year, federal judge [[Richard J. Leon]] cited this concurrence in his ruling that the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[NSA telephone records controversy|bulk collection of Americans' telephony records]] likely violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref name="msnbc-leon">{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-sotomayor-undermined-obamas-nsa | title=How Sotomayor undermined Obama's NSA | author=Serwer, Adam | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=December 23, 2013}}</ref>  Law professors [[Adam Winkler]] and [[Laurence Tribe]] were among those who said that Sotomayor's ''Jones'' concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, "in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks."<ref name="msnbc-leon"/> In ''[[Missouri v. McNeely]]'' (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of [[drunk driving]].<ref name=RootFourth/> In ''[[Navarette v. California]]'' (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to [[9-1-1]].<ref name=RootFourth/> Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in ''[[Mullenix v. Luna]]'' (2015), a case in which the Court held, ''per curiam'', that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed [[car chase]] was entitled to [[qualified immunity]]; Sotomayor argued that "By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow."<ref name=RootFourth/><ref>Mark Joseph Stern, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/11/sonia-sotomayor-dissents-in-mullenix-police-shooting-case.html Sonia Sotomayor Takes a Stand Against Police Brutality], ''Slate'' (November 9, 2015).</ref> In ''[[Utah v.

In 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6&ndash;3 ruling that granted [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s [[Contraceptive mandate (United States)|mandate on contraception]].<ref name="July 7, 2014">{{cite news | url=https://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5873611/the-supreme-courts-other-contraceptives-ruling-explained | title=The Supreme Court sided against birth control again, and Sotomayor is not happy about it | first= Adrianna | last=McIntyre | date= July 7, 2014 }}</ref> The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in ''[[Burwell v.

Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in ''Hobby Lobby'' and said,  "Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today." Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision compromised "hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage."<ref name="July 7, 2014"/>
