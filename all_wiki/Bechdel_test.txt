According to [[User-generated content|user-edited]] databases and the media industry press, about half of all films meet these criteria.<!-- Please refer to sources cited below, the lead paragraph cites sources only for quotations --> Passing or failing the test is not necessarily indicative of how well women are represented in any specific work. Rather, the test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in the entire field of film and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality in fiction]]. Media industry studies indicate that films that pass the test perform better financially than those that do not.<!-- Please refer to sources cited below, the lead paragraph cites sources only for quotations -->

The test is named after the American cartoonist [[Alison Bechdel]] in whose 1985 comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' the test first appeared. Bechdel credited the idea to her friend Liz Wallace and the writings of [[Virginia Woolf]]. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it emerged.

==History==

===Gender portrayal in popular fiction===
[[File:Female and male characters in film.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Female and male characters in film, according to four studies]]
In her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:<ref>{{cite news|title=Bechdel-Test: Frauen spielen keine Rolle|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|access-date=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=8 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815181554/http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|archive-date=2012-08-15|url-status=live}}</ref>

And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends. ... They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men.

In film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleakley | first1 = A. | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = P.

According to a 2014 study by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sakoui|first1=Anousha|last2=Magnusson|first2=Niklas|title='Hunger Games' success masks stubborn gender gap in Hollywood|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|access-date=22 September 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924043446/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|archive-date=24 September 2014|url-status=dead}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|title=Gender Bias Without Borders: An Investigation of Female Characters in Popular Films Across 11 Countries|url=http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|website=See Jane|access-date=16 April 2016|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412222049/http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|archive-date=2016-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|last4=Gillig|first4=Traci|last5=Lee|first5=Carmen|last6=Dylan|first6=DeLuca|title=Inequality in 700 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race, & LGBT Status from 2007 to 2014|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|access-date=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808001542/http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|archive-date=2015-08-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2016 analysis of [[screenplay]]s of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=The problem with almost all movies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|work=The Washington Post|date=12 April 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602200217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=live}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hanah|last2=Daniels|first2=Matt|title=The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever|url=http://polygraph.cool/films/|website=Polygraph|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416234733/http://polygraph.cool/films/|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Criteria and variants===
[[File:Dykes to Watch Out For (Bechdel test origin).jpg|400px|thumb|A character in ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' explains the rules that later came to be known as the Bechdel test (1985).]]
The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger,<ref name="Martindale"/> discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
# The movie has to have at least two women in it,
# who talk to each other,
# about something other than a man.<ref>Bechdel, Allison. Dykes to Watch Out For.

The other woman acknowledges that the idea is pretty strict, but good.

Several variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters,<ref name="EW 6 August 2010"/> or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |title=The Oscars and the Bechdel Test |publisher=Feminist Frequency |date=February 15, 2012 |access-date=2013-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220345/http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |archive-date=2013-11-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf |title=Bechdel Test academic paper. |access-date=2015-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621062146/http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> In June 2018, the term "Bechdel test" was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Suh |first1=Haley |title=Words To Know By Now: Binge-Watching, Bechdel Test Added To Oxford English Dictionary |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |access-date=20 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=15 June 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620125214/https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |archive-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to [[Neda Ulaby]], the test resonates because "it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns."<ref name=NPR/> Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a "commentary on how media representations enforce harmful [[gender norm]]s" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Dean |last1=Spade|first2=Craig |last2=Willse|editor-last=Hawkesworth|editor-first=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199328581|page=556}}</ref>

In 2014, the European cinema fund [[Eurimages]] incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects.

Writer [[Charles Stross]] noted that about half of the films that ''do'' pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies.<ref name="Power 2009">{{cite book |last=Power |first=Nina |title=One-dimensional woman |year=2009 |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=978-1846942419 |pages=39 et seq |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3gDWJEJblEC&pg=PA39 |access-date=2014-04-20 }}</ref> Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters.

It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!"<ref name=NPR/>

===Financial aspects===
Several analyses have indicated that passing the Bechdel test is an indicator of a film's financial success. ''Vocativ''{{'}}s authors found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to "put more women onscreen."<ref name="Vocativ 2014"/> A 2014 study by ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the [[median]] budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher [[return on investment]] (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.<ref name="538 2014">{{cite news |newspaper= [[FiveThirtyEight]] |first= Walt |last= Hickey |title= The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women |date= 1 April 2014 |url= http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ |access-date= 2014-04-08 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140408002110/http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ |archive-date= 2014-04-08 |url-status= live }}</ref>

In 2018, the [[Creative Artists Agency]] and [[Shift7]] analyzed revenue and budget data from the 350 top-grossing films of 2014 to 2017 in the United States. They concluded that female-led films financially outperformed other films, and that those that passed the Bechdel test (60% of the films studied) significantly outperformed the others. They noted that all films since 2012 who took in more than one billion dollars in revenue passed the test.<ref>{{cite web |title=Female-led films outperform at box office for 2014-2017 |url=https://shift7.com/media-research |website=Shift7 |access-date=23 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223221208/https://shift7.com/media-research |archive-date=2018-12-23 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Desta |first1=Yohana |title=Female-Led Movies Have Outperformed Male-Led Movies for the Last Three Years |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/female-led-films-study |access-date=23 December 2018 |work=Vanity Fair |date=11 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

===Explanations===
Explanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among scriptwriters<ref name=NPR/> and other movie professionals, also called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]": In 2012, one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.<ref name="Metro 18 July 2013" />

Writing in the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] magazine ''[[National Review]]'' in 2017, film critic [[Kyle Smith (critic)|Kyle Smith]] suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that "Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men". Such films, according to Smith, were more often created by men because "women's movie ideas" were mostly about relationships and "aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios".<ref name="Smith 2017">{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|title=If You Like Art, Don't Take the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|access-date=18 July 2017|work=National Review|date=10 July 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718182407/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|archive-date=2017-07-18|url-status=live}}</ref> He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained [[cowboy]]s.<ref name="Smith 2017" /> Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Conservative Film Critic Slammed for Bechdel Test Takedown|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|access-date=18 July 2017|work=[[EW.com]]|date=11 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714035354/http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|archive-date=2017-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref> Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate "big movie ideas", citing [[J.

== Limitations ==
The Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test.<ref name="ok">{{cite news |url=http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |first=Sarah |last=Wilson |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |title=Bechdel Rule still applies to portrayal of women in films |access-date=2014-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822163316/http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |archive-date=2014-08-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' and [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''[[Das Boot]]'', set in a medieval monastery and a German [[U-boat]] during [[World War II]]) or because it has few characters in general (e.g., [[Gravity (2013 film)|''Gravity'']] or ''[[All Is Lost]]'', with two named characters and set through the experience of a single protagonist respectively).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/aug/20/why-the-bechdel-test-doesnt-always-work|title=Why the Bechdel test doesn't (always) work|last=Ellis|first=Samantha|date=20 August 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="antipope">{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Bechdel's Law|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|work=Charlie's Diary|date=28 July 2008|author-link=Charles Stross|access-date=26 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825143125/http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|archive-date=2012-08-25|url-status=live}}</ref> What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined.

In an attempt at a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. For example, if a man is mentioned at any point in a conversation that also covers other topics, it is not clear whether this means that the conversation meets or fails the test. Another question is how one defines the start and end of a conversation.<ref name="sparqling">{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Faith|title=SPARQLing Conversation: Automating The Bechdel–Wallace Test|url=http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|date=June 2011|work=Paper presented at the Narrative and Hypertext Workshop, Hypertext 2011|access-date=26 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107051151/http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Criticism==
In response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a "nefarious plot to make all movies conform to [[feminist]] dogma".<ref name="Zeisler 2016">{{cite book|title=We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl¨, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement|date=2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395892|pages=55–57}}</ref> According to [[Andi Zeisler]], this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility "has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer." Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is "feminist" might lead to creators "gaming the system" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test,<ref name="Zeisler 2016" /> while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots. Similarly, the critic Alyssa Rosenberg expressed concern that the Bechdel test could become another "fig leaf" for the entertainment industry, who could just "slap a few lines of dialogue onto a hundred-and-forty-minute compilation of CGI explosions" to pass off the result as feminist.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Alyssa |title=In 2019, it's time to move beyond the Bechdel test |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/21/its-time-move-beyond-bechdel-test |access-date=11 May 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=21 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

The ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' film critic [[Robbie Collin]] disapproved of the test as prizing "box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test.<ref>{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Bechdel test is damaging to the way we think about film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|access-date=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118061927/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|archive-date=2013-11-18|url-status=live}}</ref> ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, "it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on".<ref name="538 2014" />

[[Nina Power]] wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be "realistic" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.<ref name="Power 2009" />

[[Johanson analysis]], developed by film critic MaryAnn Johanson, provides a method to evaluate the representation of women and girls in movies. Although developed for the screen, it can also be applied to books and other media. It consists of adding or subtracting points based on different categories of representation. The analysis evaluates media on criteria that include the basic representation of women, female agency, power and authority, the male gaze, and issues of gender and sexuality. Johanson's 2015 study compiled statistics for every film released in 2015, and all those nominated for Oscars in 2014 or 2015.

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] suggested in January 2016 the "DuVernay test" (named for director [[Ava DuVernay]]), asking whether "African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like 'The Birth of a Nation'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|access-date=4 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182351/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|archive-date=2018-02-04|url-status=live}}</ref> It aims to point out the lack of people of color in [[Hollywood]] [[movie]]s, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.<ref name="2016-02-01_TC">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|title=Could This Be the Bechdel Test for Race|access-date=February 4, 2018|last=Evans|first=Dayna|date=February 1, 2016|work=The Cut|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182327/https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|archive-date=2018-02-04|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nadia Latif and Leila Latif of ''[[The Guardian]]'' have suggested a series of five questions:
* Are there two named characters of color?
* Do they have dialogue?
* Are they not romantically involved with one another?
* Do they have any dialogue that isn't comforting or supporting a white character?
* Is one of them definitely not [[Magical Negro|magic stock character]]?<ref name="2016-01-19_NL-LL">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|title=How to fix Hollywood's race problem|access-date=June 20, 2017|last1=Latif|last2=Latif|first1=Nadia|first2=Leila|date=January 18, 2016|work=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130054046/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|archive-date=2017-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tests about nonfiction===
The Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[npm (software)|npm]], proposed a Bechdel test for software.
