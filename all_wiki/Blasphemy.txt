=={{Anchor|History}}Etymology==
The word "blasphemy" came via [[Middle English]] ''blasfemen'' and [[Old French]] ''blasfemer'' and [[Late Latin]] ''blasphemare'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] βλασφημέω, from βλάπτω "injure" and φήμη "utterance, talk, speech". From ''blasphemare'' also came Old French ''blasmer'', from which English "[[blame]]" came.

In [[Blasphemy law|some countries]] with a [[state religion]], blasphemy is outlawed under the criminal code.

In some states, blasphemy laws are used to impose the religious beliefs of a majority, while in other countries, they serve to offer protection of the religious beliefs of minorities.<ref name=IceNews/><ref name="Scolnicov2010">{{cite book|last=Scolnicov|first=Anat|title=The Right to Religious Freedom in International Law: Between Group Rights and Individual Rights|date=18 October 2010|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781136907050|page=261|quote=A different argument for the retention of the offence of blasphemy (and for its extension to the protection of all religions in the UK [the offence protected only the majority religion]) has been offered by Parekh: a majority religion does not need the protection offered by an offence of blasphemy, but minority religions do because of their vulnerability in the face of the majority.}}</ref><ref name="The Copenhagen Post">{{cite news|url=http://cphpost.dk/news14/national-news14/danes-overwhelmingly-support-their-own-blasphemy-law.html|title=Danes overwhelmingly support their own blasphemy law|date=21 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|language=English|accessdate=17 May 2016|quote=Denmark's own blasphemy law makes it an offence to "mock legal religions and faiths in Denmark", and according to a study carried out on behalf of the liberal think-tank CEPOS, 66 per cent of the 1,000 Danes questioned answered that the law should not be repealed.}}</ref>

Other countries have removed bans on blasphemy.

==Christianity==
{{anchor|Blasphemy in Christianity}}
[[Christian theology]] condemns blasphemy. It is spoken of in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] [[s:Bible (World English)/Mark#3:29|3:29]], where blaspheming the [[Holy Spirit]] is spoken of as unforgivable—an [[eternal sin]]. However, there is dispute over what form this blasphemy may take and whether it qualifies as blasphemy in the conventional sense; and over the meaning of "unforgivable". In 2 Kings 18, the [[Rabshakeh]] gave the word from the king of Assyria,{{Clarify|reason=unclearly phrased|date=September 2015}} dissuading trust in the Lord, asserting that God is no more able to deliver than all the gods of the land.

In {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:2–3}}, Jesus told a paralytic "your sins are forgiven" and was accused of blasphemy.

Blasphemy has been condemned as a serious sin by the major creeds and Church theologians ([[apostasy]] and [[infidel]]ity [unbelief] were generally considered to be the gravest sins, with [[heresy]] a greater sin than blasphemy, cf. Thomas Aquinas' ''Summa Theologiae'').<ref>ST II-II q10a3, q11a3, q12. Q11A3: "With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith which quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death."</ref>
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] says that "[if] we compare murder and blasphemy as regards the objects of those sins, it is clear that blasphemy, which is a sin committed directly against God, is more grave than murder, which is a sin against one's neighbor. On the other hand, if we compare them in respect of the harm wrought by them, murder is the graver sin, for murder does more harm to one's neighbor, than blasphemy does to God".<ref>Thomas Aquinas: [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3013.htm#article3 ''Summa Theologica''] 2:2, q. 13.</ref>
* The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' calls blasphemy "the greatest sin that can be outwardly committed".<ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/lc-3-tencommandments.php ''The Book of Concord''] ''The Large Catechism,'' §55.</ref>
* The ''[[Baptist Confession of Faith]]'' says: "Therefore, to swear vainly or rashly by the glorious and awesome name of God…is sinful, and to be regarded with disgust and detestation. …For by rash, false, and vain oaths, the Lord is provoked and because of them this land mourns".<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bcof.htm#part23 The Baptist Confession of Faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407070838/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bcof.htm |date= 7 April 2010 }} Ch. 23, §2–3.</ref>
* ''The [[Heidelberg Catechism]]'' answers question 100 about blasphemy by stating that "no sin is greater or provokes God's wrath more than the blaspheming of His Name".<ref>[http://www.wts.edu/resources/heidelberg.html The Heidelberg Catechism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613033525/http://www.wts.edu/resources/heidelberg.html |date=13 June 2009 }} Q. 100.</ref>
* The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Larger Catechism]]'' explains that "The sins forbidden in the third commandment are, the abuse of it in an ignorant, vain, irreverent, profane...mentioning...by blasphemy...to profane jests, ...vain janglings, ...to charms or sinful lusts and practices".<ref>[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wlc_w_proofs/WLC_091-150.html Westminster Larger Catechism] Q. 113.</ref>
* [[Jean Calvin|Calvin]] found it intolerable "when a person is accused of blasphemy, to lay the blame on the [[wikt:ebullition|ebullition]] of passion, as if God were to endure the penalty whenever we are provoked".<ref>Jean Calvin: ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom06.ii.xvii.html Harmony of the Law]'' vol. 4.

===Catholic prayers and reparations for blasphemy===
In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as [[Acts of Reparation]] for blasphemy.<ref>[http://catholicism.about.com/od/prayers/qt/Reparation_HN.htm Act of Reparation for Blasphemies Uttered Against the Holy Name, Righting Wrongs Through Prayer] By Scott P. Richert, About.com</ref> For instance, [[The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer)]] first introduced by Sister [[Marie of St Peter]] in 1844 is recited "''in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy''". This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable [[Leo Dupont]]) was approved by Pope [[Leo XIII]] in 1885.<ref>* Dorothy Scallan. The Holy Man of Tours. (1990) {{ISBN|0-89555-390-2}}</ref> The [[Raccolta]]book includes a number of such prayers.<ref>Joseph P. Christopher et al., 2003 ''The Raccolta'', St Athanasius Press {{ISBN|978-0-9706526-6-9}}</ref> The [[Five First Saturdays]] devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.

The [[Holy See]] has specific "Pontifical organizations" for the purpose of the reparation of blasphemy through [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]], e.g. the ''Pontifical Congregation of the [[Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face]].''<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html Letter for 50th anniversary of the Benedictine Sisters of Reparation of the Holy Face, 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502234831/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |date=2 May 2008 }} Vatican archives</ref>

===Punishment===
The most common punishment for blasphemers was [[capital punishment]] through hanging or stoning, justified by the words of {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:13–16}}.
{{quote|Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death."}}

The last person hanged for blasphemy in Great Britain was [[Thomas Aikenhead]] aged 20, in Scotland in 1697. He was prosecuted for denying the veracity of the Old Testament and the legitimacy of Christ's miracles.<ref name=truth>{{cite web|url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html |title=Thomas Aikenhead |publisher=5.uua.org |accessdate=10 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001011446/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html |archivedate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

In England, under [[common law]], blasphemy came to be punishable by fine, imprisonment or corporal punishment. [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], in his [[Commentaries of the laws of England|commentaries]], described the offence as,

{{Quotation|Denying the being of God, contumelious reproaches of our Saviour Christ, profane scoffing at the Holy scripture, or exposing it to contempt or ridicule.<ref>The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III, (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.412.</ref>}}

Blasphemy (and [[blasphemous libel]]) [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|remained a criminal offence]] in England & Wales until 2008. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this meant that promoting atheism could be a crime and was vigorously prosecuted.<ref>Owen Chadwick, ''The Victorian Church: Vol 1 1829-1859'' (1966) pp 487-89.</ref> It was last successfully prosecuted in the case of ''[[Whitehouse v Lemon]]'' (1977), where the defendant was fined £500 and given a nine-month suspended prison sentence (the publisher was also fined £1,000). It ended with the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel.

===Disputation of Paris===
During the [[Middle Ages]] a series of debates on [[Judaism]] were staged by the [[Catholic Church]], including the [[Disputation of Paris]] (1240), the [[Disputation of Barcelona]] (1263), and [[Disputation of Tortosa]] (1413–14), and during those disputations, Jewish converts to Christianity, such as [[Nicholas Donin]] (in Paris) and [[Pablo Christiani]] (in Barcelona) claimed the Talmud contained insulting references to Jesus.<ref>Carroll, James, Constantine's sword: the church and the Jews : a history, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002</ref><ref>Seidman, Naomi, Faithful renderings: Jewish-Christian difference and the politics of translation, University of Chicago Press, 2006 p 137</ref><ref>Cohn-Sherbok, Dan, Judaism and other faiths, Palgrave Macmillan, 1994, p 48</ref>

The [[Disputation of Paris]], also known as the Trial of the Talmud, took place in 1240 at the court of the reigning king of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (St. Louis). It followed the work of [[Nicholas Donin]], a Jewish convert to [[Christianity]], who translated the [[Talmud]] and pressed 35 charges against it to [[Pope Gregory IX]] by quoting a series of alleged blasphemous passages about [[Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] or Christianity.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rZGx-bS3vcgC&pg=PA137 Naomi Seidman, ''Faithful Renderings: Jewish-Christian Difference and the Politics of Translation'', pp. 136–138]</ref> Four [[rabbis]] defended the Talmud against Donin's accusations. A commission of Christian theologians condemned the Talmud to be burned and on 17 June 1244, twenty-four carriage loads of Jewish religious manuscripts were [[Book burning|set on fire]] in the streets of Paris.<ref>{{cite book|title=The history of the Talmud, from the time of its formation, about 200 B.

Between 1239 and 1775 the Roman Catholic Church at various times either forced the censoring of parts of the Talmud that it considered theologically problematic or the destruction of copies of the Talmud.<ref name="expunged">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bunHURgi7FcC&q=talmud+censorship&pg=PA110| title = Encyclopedia of Censorship| authors= Jonathon Green, Nicholas J.

It would be erroneous to deduce prescriptions for blasphemy in a strict canonical sense from the Guru Granth Sahib as it is written in [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] of 2, 6, 8, 16 sections/parts called Padas, [[Slokas]] which are short compositions of two or more verses, and [[Pauri]] which are a rung of a ladder or steps and hence the essence behind must be constructed from the preceding and following verses.<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/35692/14/14_abstract.pdf</ref> Blasphemy is considered as the submission to the vanity of the [[Five Thieves|Five inner thieves]] and especially excessive egoistical pride.<ref>http://globalsikhstudies.net/r_link/articles.htm/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105160424/http://globalsikhstudies.net/r_link/articles.htm |date=5 January 2019 }} Concepts in Sikhism – Edited by Dr. Surinder Singh Sodhi</ref>

==The United Nations==
{{Main|Blasphemy and the United Nations}}
In the early 21st century, blasphemy became an issue in the United Nations. The [[United Nations]] passed several resolutions which called upon the world to take action against the "defamation of religions".<ref>U.N. Resolutions:
* [http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/60/150&Lang=E A/RES/60/150]
* [http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/60/PV.64&Lang=E Vote on 16 December 2005 (A/60/PV.64)]
</ref>

The campaign for worldwide criminal penalties for the "defamation of religions" had been spearheaded by [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] on behalf of the United Nations' large Muslim bloc. The campaign ended in 2011 when the proposal was withdrawn in Geneva, in the Human Rights Council because of lack of support, marking an end to the effort to establish worldwide blasphemy strictures along the lines of those in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. This resolution had passed every year since 1999, in the United Nations, with declining number of "yes" votes with each successive year.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/263450/anti-blasphemy-measure-laid-rest-nina-shea An Anti-Blasphemy Measure Laid to Rest] Nina Shea, National Review (31 March 2011)</ref>

In July, 2011, the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] released a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression.<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf General Comment 34]</ref> Paragraph 48 states:
{{quote|Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.<ref>[https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf#page=12 General Comment 34, p. 12].</ref>}}

==Colloquial usage==
In contemporary language, the notion of blasphemy is often used [[hyperbole|hyperbolically]]. This usage has garnered some interest among linguists recently, and the word 'blasphemy' is a common case used for illustrative purposes.<ref>

== Blasphemy Day ==
International [[Blasphemy Day]], observed annually on September 30, encourages individuals and groups to openly express [[criticism of religion]] and [[blasphemy law]]s. It was founded in 2009 by the [[Center for Inquiry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/penn_jillette_celebrates_blasphemy_day/ |title=Penn Jillette Celebrates Blasphemy Day in "Penn Says" |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref> A student contacted the Center for Inquiry in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to present the idea, which CFI then supported. Ronald Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry, said, regarding Blasphemy Day, "[W]e think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are, but we have a taboo on religion", in an interview with [[CNN]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/09/30/first.blasphemy.day/ |title=Taking aim at God on 'Blasphemy Day'|work=CNN.com|date= 30 September 2009|first=Moni|last= Basu}}</ref>

Events worldwide on the first annual Blasphemy Day in 2009 included an art exhibit in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a [[free speech]] festival in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USAT>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-10-02-blasphemy-day_N.htm|title= Did you celebrate Blasphemy Day?|newspaper=USATODAY.com|first=Leanne |last=Larmondin|date= 2 October 2009}}</ref>
