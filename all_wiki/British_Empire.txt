The '''British Empire''' was the [[dominion]]s, [[Crown colony|colonies]], [[protectorate]]s, [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]], and other [[Dependent territory|territories]] ruled or administered by the [[United Kingdom]] and its predecessor states. It began with the [[English overseas possessions|overseas possessions]] and [[trading post]]s established by [[Kingdom of England|England]] between the late 16th and early 18th centuries.
At its height it was the [[List of largest empires|largest empire in history]] and, for over a century, was the foremost [[Power (international relations)#Categories of power|global power]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b}} By 1913 the British Empire held sway over 412&nbsp;million people, {{Percentage|412,000,000|1,791,020,000}} of the world population at the time,<ref>[[#refMaddison2001|Maddison 2001]], p.&nbsp;97: "The total population of the Empire was 412 million [in 1913]"; [[#refMaddison2001|Maddison 2001]], pp.&nbsp;241: "[World population in 1913 (in thousands):] 1&nbsp;791&nbsp;020".</ref> and by 1920 it covered {{convert|35500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 1997|title=Expansion and Contraction Patterns of Large Polities: Context for Russia|journal=[[International Studies Quarterly]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=475–504|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00053|author=Rein Taagepera|author-link=Rein Taagepera|jstor=2600793|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/3cn68807|access-date=28 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119114740/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cn68807|archive-date=19 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> {{Percentage|35,500,000|148,940,000}} of the Earth's total land area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=10 September 2016|quote=land: 148.94 million sq km|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105171656/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|archive-date=5 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result, its [[Westminster system|constitutional]], [[Common law|legal]], [[English language|linguistic]], and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|cultural]] legacy is widespread.

During the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires.

Britain became the dominant power in the [[Indian subcontinent]] after the [[East India Company]]'s conquest of [[Mughal Bengal]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.

The independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America in 1783 after the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] resulted in Britain losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, [[Africa]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. After the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe.<ref>Tellier, L.-N.

During the 19th century, Britain's population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, which caused significant social and economic stresses.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5kcJqmXk2oC&pg=PA63 |title=Great Britain: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present |page=63 |first=Richard S. |last=Tompson |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8160-4474-0 |location=New York |publisher=Facts on File }}</ref> To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the British government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] initiated a period of imperial expansion in [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]] and elsewhere.

By the start of the 20th century, [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United States]] had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead. Military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the [[World War I|First World War]], during which Britain relied heavily on its empire. The conflict placed enormous strain on the military, financial, and manpower resources of Britain. Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], Britain's colonies in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire. India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved [[Indian independence movement|independence]] as part of a larger [[decolonisation]] movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire. The [[Suez Crisis]] confirmed Britain's decline as a [[global power]], and the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong to China]] in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire.<ref name="Brendon-Empire-end"/><ref name="refohbev594"/> Fourteen [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]] remain under British sovereignty. After independence, many former British colonies joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a free association of independent states. The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations, a grouping known informally as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, that share a [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]], currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]].

== Origins (1497–1583) ==
[[File:Matthew-BristolHarbour-Aug2004.jpg|thumb|upright|A replica of the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]]'', [[John Cabot]]'s ship used for his second voyage to the [[New World]]]]
The foundations of the British Empire were laid when [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King [[Henry VII of England]], following the successes of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] in overseas exploration, commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=3}} Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the [[European discovery of America]], but he made landfall on the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and, mistakenly believing (like [[Christopher Columbus]]) that he had reached Asia,<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews 1985]], p.&nbsp;45.</ref> there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=4}}

No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]], during the last decades of the 16th century.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;35.</ref> In the meantime, the 1533 [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] had declared "that this realm of England is an Empire".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Historical Research |issn=1468-2281 |first=Richard |last=Koebner  |title=The Imperial Crown of This Realm: Henry VIII, Constantine the Great, and Polydore Vergil |volume=26 |issue=73 |pages=29–52 |date=May 1953 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.1953.tb02124.x }}</ref> The [[English Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] turned England and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Spain into implacable enemies.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=3}} In 1562, the [[List of English monarchs|English Crown]] encouraged the [[privateer]]s [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa<ref>[[#refThomas|Thomas]], pp.&nbsp;155–58</ref> with the aim of breaking into the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]] intensified, Elizabeth&nbsp;I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, [[Spanish treasure fleet|laden with treasure]] from the [[New World]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=7}} At the same time, influential writers such as [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] (who was the first to use the term "British Empire")<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;62.</ref> were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and [[Brazil]] to China, and [[French colonial empire|France]] had begun to settle the [[Saint Lawrence River]] area, later to become [[New France]].<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;4–8.</ref>

Although England tended to trail behind Portugal, Spain, and France in establishing overseas colonies, it established [[Plantations of Ireland|its first overseas colony]] in 16th century Ireland by settling it with Protestants from England drawing on precedents dating back to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;7.</ref><ref>[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&nbsp;5.</ref> Several people who helped establish colonies in Ireland also later played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the [[West Country men]].<ref>[[#refTaylor2001|Taylor]], pp.&nbsp;119,123.</ref>

== English overseas possessions (1583–1707) ==
{{Main|English overseas possessions}}

In 1578, Elizabeth I granted a patent to [[Humphrey Gilbert]] for discovery and overseas exploration.<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&nbsp;187.</ref> That year, Gilbert sailed for the [[Caribbean]] with the intention of engaging in [[piracy]] and establishing a colony in [[North America]], but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic.<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&nbsp;188.</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;63.</ref> In 1583, he embarked on a second attempt. On this occasion he formally claimed the harbour of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Walter Raleigh]], who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the [[Roanoke Colony]] on the coast of present-day [[North Carolina]], but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], pp.&nbsp;63–64.</ref>

In 1603, [[James VI and I|James VI, King of Scots]], ascended (as James I) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], ending hostilities with Spain. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;70.</ref> The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlement]] of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]], most notably the [[East India Company]], to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] after the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] towards the end of the 18th century, has been referred to by some historians as the "First British Empire".<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;34.</ref>

=== Americas, Africa and the slave trade ===
{{Main|British colonisation of the Americas|British America|Thirteen Colonies|Atlantic slave trade}}

The Caribbean initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;17.</ref> but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in [[British Guiana|Guiana]] in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;71.</ref> Colonies in [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]]&nbsp;(1605) and [[Grenada]]&nbsp;(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]]&nbsp;(1624), [[Barbados]]&nbsp;(1627) and [[Nevis]]&nbsp;(1628).<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;221.</ref> The colonies soon adopted the system of [[Plantation|sugar plantations]] successfully used by the Portuguese in [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;22–23.</ref> To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament [[Navigation Acts|decreed]] in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the [[Dutch Republic|United Dutch Provinces]]—a series of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;32.</ref> In 1655, England annexed the island of [[Jamaica]] from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;33, 43.</ref>

England's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], led by Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and managed by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]]. [[Bermuda]] was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's [[Sea Venture|flagship]], and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed [[Somers Isles Company]].<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;15–20.</ref> The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the [[Crown colony|crown]], thereby founding the [[Colony of Virginia]].<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&nbsp;316, 324–26.</ref> The [[London and Bristol Company]] was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful.<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&nbsp;20–22.</ref> In 1620, [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] was founded as a haven for [[Puritan]] religious separatists, later known as the [[Pilgrim]]s.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Fleeing from [[religious persecution]] would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic voyage]]: [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics&nbsp;(1634), [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]&nbsp;(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut&nbsp;(1639) for [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. The [[Province of Carolina]] was founded in 1663. With the surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for [[Suriname]].<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;40.</ref> In 1681, the colony of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[William Penn]]. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|pp=72–73}}<!-- Insert some discussion of interaction with Native Indians here -->

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] incorporated by [[royal charter]] the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] in the area known as [[Rupert's Land]], which would later form a large proportion of the [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France.<ref name="buckner25">[[British Empire#refBuckner2008|Buckner]], p.&nbsp;25.</ref>

Two years later, the [[Royal African Company]] was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;37.</ref> From the outset, [[slavery]] was the basis of the Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5&nbsp;million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=62}} To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as [[Kunta Kinteh Island|James Island]], [[Jamestown, Ghana|Accra]] and [[Bunce Island]]. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies).<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;228.</ref> For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western [[City status in the United Kingdom|British cities]] as [[Bristol]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Liverpool]], which formed the third corner of the [[triangular trade]] with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average [[mortality rate]] during the [[Middle Passage]] was one in seven.<ref>[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;440–64.</ref>

===Rivalry with other European empires===
[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] was founded at [[Chennai|Madras]] in 1639.]]

At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the [[Dutch East India Company]], chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative [[spice trade]], an effort focused mainly on two regions; the [[Malay Archipelago|East Indies archipelago]], and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=19}} and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when the Dutch [[William III of England|William of Orange]] ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=19}}

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the [[Nine Years' War]] as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their [[military budget]] on the costly land war in Europe.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;441.</ref>

The death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]], a grandson of the [[Louis XIV of France|King of France]], raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe.<ref name="shennan11"/> In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against Spain and France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which lasted for thirteen years.<ref name="shennan11"/>

==Scottish attempt to expand overseas==
{{Main|Scottish colonization of the Americas}}
In 1695, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] granted a charter to the [[Company of Scotland]], which established a settlement in 1698 on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], and afflicted by [[malaria]], the colony was abandoned two years later. The [[Darien scheme]] was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital<ref>[[#refMagnusson2003|Magnusson]], p.&nbsp;531.</ref> was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, helping to persuade the government of Scotland of the merits of a union of the two countries, rather than just crowns.<ref>[[#refMacaulay1979|Macaulay]], p.&nbsp;509.</ref>

== "First" British Empire (1707–1783) ==
The 18th century saw the [[Acts of Union 1707|newly united]] Great Britain rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, with France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.<ref>[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&nbsp;90.</ref> 

Great Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire continued the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714 and was concluded by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. [[Philip V of Spain]] renounced his and his descendants' claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe.<ref name="shennan11">[[#refShennan1995|Shennan]], pp.&nbsp;11–17.</ref> The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Acadia]], and from Spain [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]]. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative ''[[asiento]]'' (permission to sell African slaves in [[Ibero-America|Spanish America]]) to Britain.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;58.</ref> After the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727–1729)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1727–1729]], the King of Spain confiscated all British ships in his ports in [[New Spain]]. In 1731, Spanish patrol boat La Isabela boarded the British brig Rebecca off [[Havana]] and Captain Julio León Fandiño cut off the left ear of Captain [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]], accusing him of being a smuggler. In August 1737, two more British ships were boarded by Spanish coastguards near Havana; the crews were imprisoned and kept as slaves.<ref>{{cite web |title=The War of Jenkins' Ear |date=28 October 2016|url=https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/10/28/the-war-of-jenkins-ear/}}</ref> With the outbreak of the Anglo-Spanish [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] in 1739, Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the [[Triangle Trade]] routes. In 1746, the Spanish and British began peace talks, with the King of Spain agreeing to stop all attacks on British shipping; however, in the [[Treaty of Madrid (5 October 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] Britain lost its slave trading rights in South and Central America.<ref>[[#refAnderson1801|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;277.</ref> 

[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] established the [[East India Company]] as a military as well as a commercial power.]]
In the East Indies, British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles. With textiles becoming the larger trade, by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=19}}

During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were [[Carnatic Wars|several outbreaks of military conflict]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]], as the English East India Company and its [[French East India Company|French counterpart]], struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. The [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, in which the British defeated the [[Nawab of Bengal]] and his French allies, left the British East India Company in control of [[Bengal]] and as the major military and political power in India.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 17.</ref> France was left control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British [[client state]]s, ending French hopes of controlling India.<ref>[[#refSekhara2004|Bandyopādhyāẏa]], pp.&nbsp;49–52</ref> In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the [[Presidency Armies]], the vast majority of which was composed of Indian [[sepoy]]s, led by British officers.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 18–19.</ref> The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763) involving France, Britain, and the other major European powers.<ref name="buckner25"/>

The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris of 1763]] had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to [[Rupert's Land]],<ref name="buckner25"/> and the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizeable [[French Canadian|French-speaking population]] under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful [[maritime power]].<ref name="refpagden1">[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&nbsp;91.</ref>

=== Loss of the Thirteen American Colonies ===
{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:British America.png|thumb|British colonies in the Americas, 1763–1776 ([[Thirteen Colonies]])]]  
During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=84}} This was summarised at the time by the slogan "[[No taxation without representation]]", a perceived violation of the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]]. The [[American Revolution]] began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response, Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|United States declared independence]]. The entry of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French]] and [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spanish forces]] into the war tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] in 1783.<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;312–23.</ref>

The loss of such a large portion of [[British America]], at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the "first" and "second" empires,<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;92.</ref> in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the [[protectionism]] of Spain and Portugal.<ref name="refpagden1"/><ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;120.</ref> The growth of trade between the newly independent [[United States]] and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;119.</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], p.&nbsp;585.</ref>

The war to the south influenced British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000<ref>[[#refZolberg2006|Zolberg]], p.&nbsp;496.</ref> defeated [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had migrated from the new United States following independence.<ref>[[#refGames2002|Games]], pp.&nbsp;46–48.</ref> The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John]] and [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|Saint Croix river]] valleys, then part of [[Nova Scotia]], felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off [[New Brunswick]] as a separate colony in 1784.<ref>[[#refKelley2010|Kelley & Trebilcock]], p.&nbsp;43.</ref> The [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] created the provinces of [[Upper Canada]] (mainly English speaking) and [[Lower Canada]] (mainly [[French language|French-speaking]]) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;28.</ref>

Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to [[Impressment|impress]] men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the [[War of 1812]], and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 [[Treaty of Ghent]], ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States.<ref>[[#refLatimer|Latimer]], pp.&nbsp;8, 30–34, 389–92.</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;388.</ref>

[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Cook]]'s mission was to find the alleged southern continent ''[[Terra Australis]]''.]]

Since 1718, [[penal transportation|transportation]] to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;20.</ref> Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to Australia.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 20–21.</ref> The [[New Holland (Australia)|coast of Australia]] had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch [[Janszoon voyage of 1605–06|in 1606]],<ref name="autogenerated1">[[#refMulligan2001|Mulligan & Hill]], pp.&nbsp;20–23.</ref> but there was no attempt to colonise it.

During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, known to Europeans due to the 1642 voyage of Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]], and claimed both the [[North Island|North]] and the [[South Island|South]] islands for the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British crown]] in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain [[William Hobson]] and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 45.</ref> This treaty is considered to be New Zealand's founding document,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|title=Waitangi Day|website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|access-date=13 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020659/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|archive-date=20 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;579.</ref> have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.<ref>[[#refMeinSmith|Mein Smith]], p.&nbsp;49.</ref>

=== War with Napoleonic France ===
{{Main|Napoleonic Wars}}
[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] ended in the defeat of [[Napoleon]] and marked the beginning of ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.]]
Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;152.</ref> It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of [[continental Europe]].<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;151.</ref>

The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the [[Royal Navy]], which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;115–118.</ref> Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]], [[Malta Protectorate|Malta]] (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Tobago]]; Spain ceded [[Trinidad]]; the Netherlands Guyana, and the [[Cape Colony]]. Britain returned [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Réunion]] to France, and [[Java]] and [[Suriname]] to the Netherlands, while gaining control of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (1795–1815) and [[British Administration of Heligoland | Heligoland]].<ref name="refjames165">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;165.</ref><!--Aruba and Curaçao were returned as well I think-->

=== Abolition of slavery ===
{{Main|Abolitionism in the United Kingdom}}

With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], goods produced by slavery became less important to the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_111.html|title=Why was Slavery finally abolished in the British Empire?|work=The Abolition Project|access-date=31 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126120021/http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_111.html|archive-date=26 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular [[slave rebellion]]s. With support from the British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] enacted the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] in 1807, which abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the empire. In 1808, [[Sierra Leone Colony]] was designated an official British colony for freed slaves.<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;14.</ref> Parliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the [[West India Committee]] decline. The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]], passed the following year, abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, finally bringing the Empire into line with the law in the UK (with the exception of the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon, where slavery was ended in 1844). Under the Act, slaves were granted full [[emancipation]] after a period of four to six years of "apprenticeship".<ref>[[#refHinks|Hinks]], p.&nbsp;129.</ref> Facing further opposition from abolitionists, the apprenticeship system was abolished in 1838.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/the-slave-trade-and-abolition/sites-of-memory/ending-slavery/slavery-after-1807/|title=Slavery After 1807 {{!}} Historic England|website=historicengland.org.uk|language=en|access-date=24 November 2019|quote=As a result of public pressure apprenticeships were abolished early, in 1838.}}</ref> The British government compensated slave-owners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section XXIV|date=28 August 1833|access-date=3 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Manning>{{Cite news|author=Sanchez Manning|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slave-owners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html|title=Britain's colonial shame: Slave-owners given huge payouts after|date=24 February 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref>

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, called the [[All Red Line]].<ref>[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&nbsp;88–91.</ref>

=== East India Company rule and the British Raj in India ===
{{See also|Company rule in India|British Raj}}

The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from [[Egypt]] (1799),<ref>[[#refMori2014|Mori]], p.&nbsp;178.</ref> the capture of [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java]] from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of [[History of Penang#Founding of penang|Penang Island]] (1786), [[Founding of modern Singapore|Singapore]] (1819) and [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Malacca]] (1824), and the defeat of [[First Anglo-Burmese War|Burma]] (1826).<ref name="#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401"/>

From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable [[opium]] export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China.<ref>[[#refMartin2007|Martin]], pp.&nbsp;146–48.</ref> In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the [[First Opium War]], and resulted in the seizure by Britain of [[British Hong Kong | Hong Kong Island]], at that time a minor settlement, and other [[Concessions in China | Treaty Ports]] including [[Shanghai International Settlement | Shanghai]].<ref>[[#refJanin1999|Janin]], p.&nbsp;28.</ref>

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the [[Regulating Act of 1773]], [[Pitt's India Act]] of 1784 and the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired.<ref>[[#refKeay|Keay]], p.&nbsp;393</ref> The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of [[sepoy]]s, Indian troops under British officers and discipline.<ref>[[#refParsons|Parsons]], pp.&nbsp;44–46.</ref> The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the [[Government of India Act 1858]], establishing the [[British Raj]], where an appointed [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]].<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 50–57.</ref> India became the empire's most valuable possession, "the Jewel in the Crown", and was the most important source of Britain's strength.<ref name=Brown5>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to [[Famine in India|widespread famines]] on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15&nbsp;million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;133–34.</ref>

=== Rivalry with Russia ===
{{Main|The Great Game}}
[[File:Relief of the Light Brigade.png|thumb|British cavalry charging against Russian forces at [[Battle of Balaclava|Balaclava]] in 1854]]
During the 19th century, Britain and the [[Russian Empire]] vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Qajar dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]]. This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the "Great Game".<ref>[[#refHopkirk1992|Hopkirk]], pp.&nbsp;1–12.</ref> As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey]] demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;181.</ref> In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading [[Afghanistan]], but the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] was a disaster for Britain.<ref name="refjames182">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;182.</ref>

When Russia invaded the Turkish [[Balkans]] in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the [[Crimean Peninsula]] to destroy Russian naval capabilities.<ref name="refjames182"/> The ensuing [[Crimean War|Crimean War (1854–1856)]], which involved new techniques of [[modern warfare]],<ref>[[#refRoyle2000|Royle]], preface.</ref> was the only [[World war|global war]] fought between Britain and another [[Imperialism|imperial power]] during the ''Pax Britannica'' and was a resounding defeat for Russia.<ref name="refjames182"/> The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Baluchistan]] in 1876 and Russia annexing [[Kyrgyzstan|Kirghizia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Turkmenistan]]. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Beryl J.|s2cid=162474899|title=The Strategic Background to the Anglo-Russian Entente of August 1907|journal=The Historical Journal|year=1966|volume=9|pages=360–73 |jstor=2637986|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00026698|issue=3}}</ref> The destruction of the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] by the Japanese at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905 also limited its threat to the British.<ref name="hodge47">[[#refhodge47|Hodge]], p.&nbsp;47.</ref>

=== Cape to Cairo ===
[[File:Punch Rhodes Colossus.png|thumb|''[[The Rhodes Colossus]]''—[[Cecil Rhodes]] spanning "Cape to Cairo"]]

The Dutch East India Company had founded the Cape Colony on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the [[Indies|East Indies]]. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large [[Afrikaner]] (or [[Boer]]) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the [[Flanders Campaign]].<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;85.</ref> British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the [[Great Trek]] of the late 1830s and early 1840s.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&nbsp;85–86.</ref> In the process the [[Voortrekkers]] clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the [[South African Republic]] or Transvaal Republic (1852–1877; 1881–1902) and the [[Orange Free State]] (1854–1902).<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;168, 186, 243.</ref> In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two [[Boer Republics]] following the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;255.</ref>

In 1869 the [[Suez Canal]] opened under [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. Initially the Canal was opposed by the British;<ref>[[#refTilby2009|Tilby]], p.&nbsp;256.</ref> but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the "jugular vein of the Empire".<ref>[[#refRoger1986|Roger 1986]], p.&nbsp;718.</ref> In 1875, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] bought the indebted Egyptian ruler [[Isma'il Pasha]]'s 44% shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4&nbsp;million (equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|4000000|1875|r=-7}}}} in {{Inflation-year|index=UK}}). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|pp=230–33}}  Although Britain controlled Egypt into the 20th century, it was officially part of the Ottoman Empire and not part of the British Empire.  The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;274.</ref> but a compromise was reached with the 1888 [[Convention of Constantinople]], which made the Canal officially neutral territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaties |url=http://www.mfa.gov.eg/MFA_Portal/en-GB/Foreign_Policy/Treaties/Convention+Respecting+the+Free+Navigation+of+the+Suez+Maritime+Canal.htm |publisher=Egypt Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=20 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915095412/http://www.mfa.gov.eg/MFA_Portal/en-GB/Foreign_Policy/Treaties/CONVENTION%2BRESPECTING%2BTHE%2BFREE%2BNAVIGATION%2BOF%2BTHE%2BSUEZ%2BMARITIME%2BCANAL.htm |archive-date=15 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

With competitive French, [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] and Portuguese activity in the lower [[Congo River]] region undermining orderly colonisation of tropical Africa, the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the "[[Scramble for Africa]]" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.<ref>[[#refHerbst2000|Herbst]], pp.&nbsp;71–72.</ref> The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from [[Sudan]]. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist Army]] in 1896, and rebuffed an attempted French invasion [[Fashoda Incident|at Fashoda]] in 1898. Sudan was nominally made an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]], but a British colony in reality.<ref>[[#Vandervort1998|Vandervort]], pp.&nbsp;169–83.</ref>

=== Changing status of the white colonies ===
The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham Report]], which proposed unification and self-government for [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], as a solution to political unrest which had erupted in [[Rebellions of 1837|armed rebellions]] in 1837.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&nbsp;28–29.</ref> This began with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, which created the [[Province of Canada]]. [[Responsible government]] was first granted to [[Nova Scotia]] in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] by the [[British Parliament]], the Province of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of [[international relations]].<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;187</ref> Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies [[federation of Australia|federating in 1901]].<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 30.</ref> The term "dominion status" was officially introduced at the [[Imperial Conference|Colonial Conference of 1907]].<ref name="rhodes5"/>

The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted [[political campaign]]s for Irish [[home rule]]. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the [[Act of Union 1800]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and had suffered a severe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime minister]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule bill]] was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation,<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;213</ref> many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire.<ref name="James, p. 315">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;315.</ref> A [[Irish Government Bill 1893|second Home Rule bill]] was also defeated for similar reasons.<ref name="James, p. 315"/> A [[Home Rule Act 1914|third bill]] was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the [[First World War]] leading to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 92.</ref>

[[File:The Empire Needs Men WWI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A poster urging men from countries of the British Empire to enlist]]
By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the [[metropole]] and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of "[[splendid isolation]]".<ref>[[#refOBrien|O'Brien]], p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;667.</ref> and threatened at home by the [[Imperial German Navy]], Britain [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|formed an alliance with Japan]] in 1902 and with its old enemies [[Entente cordiale|France]] and Russia in 1904 and 1907, respectively.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;275.</ref>

=== First World War ===
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War}}

Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied [[German New Guinea]] and [[German Samoa]] respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]]. This agreement was not divulged to the [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif of Mecca]], who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.<ref name="Brown494-495">[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&nbsp;494–95.</ref>

The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5&nbsp;million men served in the armies of the [[Dominion]]s, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]].<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;78–79.</ref> The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on [[Anzac Day]]. Canadians viewed the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in a similar light.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;277.</ref> The important contribution of the Dominions to the [[war effort]] was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an [[Imperial War Cabinet]] to co-ordinate imperial policy.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;278.</ref>

Under the terms of the concluding [[Treaty of Versailles]] signed in 1919, the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of {{convert|1800000|sqmi|km2}} and 13&nbsp;million new subjects.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=315}} The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. Britain gained control of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]], parts of [[British Cameroons|Cameroon]] and [[British Togoland|Togoland]], and [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]. The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: the [[Union of South Africa]] gained [[South West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]), Australia gained [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], and New Zealand [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]]. [[History of Nauru#World War I to World War II|Nauru]] was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.<ref>[[#refFox2008|Fox]], pp.&nbsp;23–29, 35, 60.</ref>

=== Inter-war period ===
[[File:UK Territories 1922.png|thumb|upright=1.8|left|The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1922]]
The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.<ref>[[#refGoldstein|Goldstein]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States.<ref name="reflouis302">[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;302.</ref> This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;294.</ref> as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the [[Great Depression]], for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations.<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;303.</ref> The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British economy.<ref>[[#refLee1996|Lee 1996]], p.&nbsp;305.</ref>

In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish home rule]] led the MPs of [[Sinn Féin]], a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 British general election]], to establish an [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|independent parliament]] in Dublin, at which [[Irish Declaration of Independence|Irish independence was declared]]. The [[Irish Republican Army]] simultaneously began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the British administration.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;143.</ref> The [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 95.</ref> [[Northern Ireland]], consisting of six of the 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]] which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act]], immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.<ref>[[#refMagee|Magee]], p.&nbsp;108.</ref>

[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]] with British and Dominion prime ministers at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]]]]
A similar struggle began in India when the [[Government of India Act 1919]] failed to satisfy demand for independence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2004b|p=330}} Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the [[Ghadar conspiracy]] ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the [[Rowlatt Act]]s. This led to tension,<ref name="refjames416">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;416.</ref> particularly in the [[Punjab region]], where repressive measures culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]]. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.<ref name="refjames416"/> The [[Non-cooperation movement|Non-Co-Operation movement]] was called off in March 1922 following the [[Chauri Chaura incident]], and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Low|first=D.A.|title=The Government of India and the First Non-Cooperation Movement – 1920–1922|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1966|volume=25|issue=2|pages=241–59|doi=10.2307/2051326|jstor=2051326}}</ref>

In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British [[protectorate]] at the outbreak of the First World War, was [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|granted formal independence]], though it continued to be a British [[client state]] until 1954. [[British Army|British troops]] remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] in 1936,<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 104.</ref> under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the [[League of Nations]].<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;292.</ref> Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p. 101.</ref> In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The [[1917 Balfour Declaration]], which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power.<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;271.</ref> This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]]. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]].<ref name="Brown494-495"/>

[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|left|thumb|During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] was made up of units from many different countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth; it fought in [[North African campaign|North African]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] campaigns.]]

Britain's declaration of war against [[Nazi Germany]] in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany. While Britain continued to regard Ireland as still within the British Commonwealth, Ireland chose to remain [[Irish neutrality during World War II|legally neutral]] throughout [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the war]].<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;313–14.</ref>

After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the [[German invasion of Greece]] on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] successfully lobbied President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for [[military aid]] from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask [[United States Congress|Congress]] to commit the country to war.<ref>[[British Empire#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&nbsp;234.</ref> In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the [[Atlantic Charter]], which included the statement that "the rights of all peoples to choose the [[form of government]] under which they live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.<ref name="reflloyd316">[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;316.</ref><ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;513.</ref>

For Churchill the entry of the United States into the war was the "greatest joy".<ref>[[#refChurchill1950|Churchill]], p.&nbsp;539.</ref> He felt that Britain was now assured of victory,<ref>[[#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&nbsp;244.</ref> but failed to recognise that the "many disasters, immeasurable costs and tribulations [which he knew] lay ahead"<ref>[[#refChurchill1950|Churchill]], p.&nbsp;540.</ref> in December 1941 would have permanent consequences for the future of the empire. The manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power,<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;337.</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;319.</ref> including, particularly, the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]], which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;460.</ref> The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States and, ultimately, the 1951 [[ANZUS|ANZUS Pact]].<ref name="reflloyd316"/> The war weakened the empire in other ways: undermining Britain's control of politics in India, inflicting long term economic damage, and irrevocably changing geopolitics by pushing the Soviet Union and the United States to the centre of the global stage.<ref>[[#refDarwin2012|Darwin]], p.&nbsp;340.</ref>

== Decolonisation and decline (1945–1997) ==
{{Anchor|Decline}}
Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power.<ref>[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&nbsp;146.</ref> Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of [[Anglo-American loan|a $US 4.33&nbsp;billion loan]] from the United States,<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;331.</ref> the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.<ref name="GT-DEX-2006-33">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm|title=What's a little debt between friends?|work=BBC News|date=10 May 2006|access-date=20 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610152357/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm|archive-date=10 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing [[Cold War]] rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, American [[anti-communism]] prevailed over [[anti-imperialism]], and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check.<ref>[[#refLevine|Levine]], p.&nbsp;193.</ref> At first British politicians believed it would be possible to maintain Britain's role as a world power at the head of a re-imagined Commonwealth,<ref>[[#refDarwin2012|Darwin]], p.&nbsp;343.</ref> but by 1960 they were forced to recognise that there was an irresistible "[[Wind of Change (speech)|wind of change]]" blowing. Their priorities changed to maintaining an extensive zone of British influence<ref>[[#refDarwin2012|Darwin]], p.&nbsp;366.</ref> and ensuring that stable, non-Communist governments were established in former colonies. In this context, while other European powers such as France and Portugal,<ref>[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&nbsp;148.</ref> waged costly and unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact, Britain generally adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies. In reality this was rarely peaceable or altruistic. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700&nbsp;million to 5 million, 3 million of whom were in Hong Kong.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;330.</ref>

=== Initial disengagement ===
[[File:Emergency trains crowded with desperate refugees.jpg|thumb|right|About 14.5&nbsp;million people lost their homes as a result of the [[partition of India]] in 1947.]]
The pro-decolonisation [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, elected at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] and led by [[Clement Attlee]], moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;322.</ref> India's two major political parties—the [[Indian National Congress]] (led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]) and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] (led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]])—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate [[Islamic state]] for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing [[Civil disorder|civil unrest]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny|mutiny]] of the [[History of the Indian Navy|Royal Indian Navy]] during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 30 June 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;67.</ref> The borders drawn by the British to broadly [[Partition of India|partition India]] into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and [[Pakistan]].<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;325.</ref> Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the [[British Raj]], and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.<ref>[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], pp.&nbsp;355–356.</ref>

The British [[Mandatory Palestine|mandate in Palestine]], where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;327.</ref> The matter was complicated by large numbers of [[Jewish refugees]] seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;328.</ref> The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] subsequently voted for a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|plan to partition Palestine]] into a Jewish and an Arab state. It was immediately followed by the outbreak of a [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine, and British forces withdrew amid the fighting. The British Mandate for Palestine officially terminated at midnight on 15 May 1948 as the State of [[Israel]] declared independence and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]] broke out, during which the territory of the former Mandate was partitioned between Israel and the surrounding Arab states. Amid the fighting, British forces continued to withdraw from Israel, with the last British troops departing from [[Haifa]] on 30 June 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/conflict-Palestine|title=The British Army in Palestine {{!}} National Army Museum|website=www.nam.ac.uk|access-date=25 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629135915/https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/conflict-Palestine|archive-date=29 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the surrender of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese [[resistance movement]]s in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;335.</ref> The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Malayan Emergency]], as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the [[Federation of Malaya]] within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] joined to form [[Malaysia]], but in 1965 Chinese-majority [[Singapore]] was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations and became an independent city-state.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;364.</ref> [[Brunei]], which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union.<ref>[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;396.</ref>

In 1951, the Conservative Party returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the [[Suez Canal]] allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. Churchill could not ignore [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdul Nasser]]'s new revolutionary [[Politics of Egypt|government of Egypt]] that had [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|taken power in 1952]], and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&nbsp;339–40.</ref> Sudan was [[History of Sudan (1956–69)|granted independence]] on 1 January 1956.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;572.</ref>

In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of [[Anthony Eden]], who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on [[Republic of Egypt (1953–58)|Egypt]] that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;581.</ref> Eden infuriated US President [[Dwight D.

Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[Southern Rhodesia]], were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year [[Mau Mau uprising]], in which tens of thousands of suspected rebels were interned by the colonial government in detention camps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49363653|title=The Kenyan school where the UK held Mau Mau rebels|last=Zane|first=Damian|date=27 August 2019|access-date=24 November 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In [[Rhodesia]], the 1965 [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] by the white minority resulted in a [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]] that lasted until the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], pp.&nbsp;618–21.</ref>

In [[Cyprus]], a guerrilla war waged by the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] organisation [[EOKA]] against British rule, was ended in 1959 by the [[London and Zürich Agreements]], which resulted in Cyprus being granted independence in 1960. The UK retained the military bases of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] as sovereign base areas. The [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] colony of [[Malta (island)|Malta]] was amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of [[Malta]], though the idea had been raised in 1955 of [[1956 Maltese United Kingdom integration referendum|integration with Britain]].<ref>[[#refSpringhall2001|Springhall]], pp.&nbsp;100–02.</ref>

Most of the UK's Caribbean territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]] from the [[West Indies Federation]], established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members.<ref name="knight14">[[#refKnight1989|Knight & Palmer]], pp.&nbsp;14–15.</ref> Jamaica attained independence in 1962, as did [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

British territories in the Pacific acquired independence in the 1970s beginning with [[Fiji]] in 1970 and ending with [[Vanuatu]] in 1980.

The 1980s also saw Canada, [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] sever their final constitutional links with Britain. Although granted legislative independence by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], vestigial constitutional links had remained in place. The British Parliament retained the power to amend key Canadian constitutional statutes, meaning that effectively an act of the British Parliament was required to make certain changes to the Canadian Constitution.<ref> Gérin-Lajoie, Paul (1951).

In 1982, the last legal link between Canada and Britain was severed by the [[Canada Act 1982]], which was passed by the British parliament, formally [[patriation|patriating]] the Canadian Constitution.

Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire.

Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in [[Ireland]] from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] emigrating to other parts of the empire, such as [[Malaysia]] and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean.<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], p.&nbsp;286.</ref> The demographics of Britain itself were changed after the Second World War owing to [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922#Post-war immigration (1945–1983)|immigration to Britain]] from its former colonies.<ref>[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], p.&nbsp;135.</ref>
