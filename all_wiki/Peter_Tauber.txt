== Political positions and controversies ==
=== Telecommunications data retention ===
Until 2013, Tauber was considered to be an opponent of [[Telecommunications data retention#Germany|telecommunications data retention]],<ref>[https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2Farticle122963750%2FDer-neue-CDU-General-gibt-den-Jungen-eine-Stimme.html&edit-text=&act=url Der neue CDU-General gibt den Jungen eine Stimme] (The new CDU General secretary gives the young people a voice), Google-translation, Source: [[Die Welt]], 15 December 2013)</ref><ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnetzpolitik.org%2F2015%2Fneuer-fan-der-vorratsdatenspeicherung-peter-tauber-cdu-generalsekretaer%2F&edit-text=&act=url Früher Gegner, jetzt Fan der Vorratsdatenspeicherung: Peter Tauber, CDU-Generalsekretär] (Formerly opponent, now fan of data retention: Peter Tauber, CDU General Secretary), Google-translation, Source: netzpolitik.org, 11 May 2015</ref> whereas the majority in his party wanted to introduce a new bill,<ref>The old law from 2008 had been declared unconstitutional by the [[Federal Constitutional Court|Bundesverfassungsgericht]] of Germany in 2010</ref> but this was impossible because from 2009 to 2013 the CDU was in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], that was opposed to telecommunications data retention. But in December 2013 the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and Tauber had been nominated as general secretary of the CDU on 16 December 2013 and since January 2014 Tauber had changed his position and actively supported a new bill against a reluctant Minister of Justice from the SPD.<ref>[https://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&sl=de&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2Fcdu-generalsekretaer-tauber-mahnt-spd-zu-mehr-disziplin-a-942744.html Große Koalition: CDU-Generalsekretär mahnt SPD zu Disziplin]  (Grand coalition: CDU general secretary calls on SPD to maintain discipline), Google-translation, Quelle: [[Der Spiegel]], 10 January 2014</ref> In October 2015 the bill was approved by the [[Bundestag]] and in November 2015 by the [[Bundesrat of Germany]] and is now law.

=== "Operation Kaninchenjagd" ===
{{see also|Operation Kaninchenjagd}}
''Operation Kaninchenjagd'' ("Operation rabbit hunting") is one of two titles of an anonymous paper<ref>The paper consists of 8 pages with the title ''Operation Kaninchenjagd'' ("Operation rabbit hunting") and an additional cover page with the sole title ''Pflegehinweise für das Kaninchen'' ("Care instructions for the rabbit").</ref> that became public in September 2016 and led to accusations against the politician Peter Tauber. It is alleged that Tauber – who was at that time member of the [[Christian Democratic Party|CDU]] and the (regional) chairman of the [[Young Union]] in [[Hesse]] – was involved in (attempted) bullying of another member and employee of the [[Christian Democratic Party]].

=== Insulting mini jobbers ===
In July 2017, Tauber argued that someone who has a proper education does not have to work as a so-called ''[[mini job]]ber'' ([[marginal employment]]). This statement was criticized heavily by other politicians, the media and [[trades union]]s. In Germany, millions of workers are dependent on this type of employment to make a living due to [[Agenda 2010|economic liberalization]] implemented a decade ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/peter-tauber-loest-mit-arrogantem-tweet-shitstorm-aus-a-1155830.html|title=CDU-Generalsekretär: Tauber löst mit arrogantem Tweet Shitstorm aus - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Politik|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/der-tag-mit-thea-dorn-vollbeschaeftigung-wichtiger-als.2950.de.html?dram:article_id=390163|title=Der Tag mit Thea Dorn - Vollbeschäftigung wichtiger als Gerechtigkeit?|work=Deutschlandfunk Kultur|access-date=2017-08-23|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/28/peter-tauber-ausbildung-minijobs-fakt-fake|title=Peter Tauber: Drei Minijobs?
