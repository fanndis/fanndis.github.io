==Description==
The organization's stated goal is to inspire the wealthy people of the world to give at least half of their net worth to philanthropy, either during their lifetime or upon their death. The pledge is a public gesture of an intention to give, not a legal [[contract]].<ref name="Xinhua">{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2010-08/05/content_11098219.htm|title=Forty U.S. billionaires pledge to give half their money to charity|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=5 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811032238/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-08/05/c_13430367.htm|archive-date=11 August 2010|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|quote=A statement from the Giving Pledge website said "the pledge is a moral commitment to give, not a legal contract."}}</ref> On The Giving Pledge's website, each individual or couple writes a letter explaining why they chose to give.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
In June 2010, the Giving Pledge campaign was formally announced and [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]] began recruiting members.<ref name="founding">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2010/06/16/the-600-billion-challenge/?iid=sr-link1|title=The $600 billion challenge|date=16 June 2010|author=[[Carol Loomis]]|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref> As of August 2010, the aggregate wealth of the first 40 pledgers was $125 billion.<ref name="ABCnews">{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/WN/bill-gates-warren-buffett-organize-billionaire-giving-pledge/story?id=11325984|title=The Giving Pledge: Billionaires Promise to Donate at Least Half Their Fortunes to Charity |last=Blackburn|first=Bradley|date=4 August 2010|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> As of April 2011, 69 billionaires had joined the campaign and given a pledge,<ref>10 More U.S. Families Commit to the Giving Pledge [https://givingpledge.org/PressRelease.aspx?date=04.28.2011], retrieved 25 October 2011</ref> and by the following year, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported that a total of 81 billionaires had pledged.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/giving-pledge-warren-buffett-bill-gates_n_1441387.html "Warren Buffett, Bill Gates Giving Pledge Gets 12 More Billionaires To Commit Over Half Of Their Fortunes", Huffington Post, April 20 2012]</ref> By May 2017, 158 individuals and/or couples were listed as pledgers.<ref name=":0">[http://givingpledge.org/index.html The Giving Pledge :: Pledger Profiles] Retrieved 16 May 2017</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/01/giving-pledge-new-members-2016/|title=17 More Billionaires Join Buffett and Gates' Giving Pledge This Year|last=Lorenzetti|first=Laura|date=1 June 2016|website=Fortune|access-date=20 October 2016}}</ref> Not all pledgers are billionaires.

==Criticism==
Almost none of the signees have as of yet made significant progress towards upholding their pledge to give away half of their wealth, instead only accumulating more of it. Since the pledge was created in 2010, the wealth of the donors has not decreased but has instead increased from a combined $376 billion in 2010 to a combined $734 billion in 2020.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#48ea75053d78|title=The Real-Time Billionaires List|website=Forbes}}</ref>
Many who have made significant donations, have done so to [[donor-advised funds]], which often pay salaries to their family members and have no obligation by law to actually spend the wealth on active charity organisations.

Donations in general are a topic of public debate because in many countries they are tax-deductible, which means that billionaires who owe the government a certain amount of taxes can instead opt to "donate" a similar amount of money to their chosen charity, such as donor-advised funds which have no legal obligation to actually pay out any of that wealth to those in need. The final result of which is that the government loses millions, if not billions in tax income, whilst the money itself just sits in a fund.<ref name=Inequality.org>{{cite web |url=https://inequality.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GivingPledge-Brief-Aug3.pdf|title=The Giving Pledge at 10: A Case Study in Top Heavy Philanthropy|website=Inequality.org}}</ref>
