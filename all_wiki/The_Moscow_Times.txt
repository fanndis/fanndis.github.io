'''''The Moscow Times''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] online-only [[newspaper]] based in [[Moscow]]. It was in print from 1992 until 2017, with a peak circulation of 55,000. It was distributed free of charge at places frequented by English-speaking tourists and [[expatriate]]s such as [[hotel]]s, [[café]]s, embassies, and airlines, and also by subscription. The newspaper is popular among foreign citizens residing in Moscow and English-speaking Russians.<ref>Richardson, Dan. (2001). ''The Rough Guide to Moscow.'' Rough Guides. p. 56. {{ISBN|978-1-85828-700-3}}</ref> In November 2015 the newspaper changed its design and type from daily to weekly (released every Thursday) and increased the number of pages to 24, and it became online-only in July 2017.

The newspaper regularly publishes [[Article (publishing)|articles]] by prominent Russian [[journalist]]s such as [[Yulia Latynina]] and [[Ivan Nechepurenko]]. Some [[foreign correspondent]]s started their careers here, including [[Ellen Barry (journalist)|Ellen Barry]], who later became the ''[[New York Times]]'' Moscow bureau chief.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/russia-moscow-times-cyber-attack|title = Hackers target Russian newspaper site accused of being anti-Putin|last = Luhn|first = Alec|date = February 5, 2015|work = The Guardian|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118092556/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/russia-moscow-times-cyber-attack|archive-date = January 18, 2017}}</ref>

On 23 March 2020, the online newspaper launched a [[Russian-language]] version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/page/letter-to-readers|title=A Letter to Our Readers|access-date=24 March 2020|website=[[The Moscow Times]]}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Founding and current ownership ===
Derk Sauer, a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publisher who came to Moscow in 1989, made plans to turn his small, twice-weekly paper called the ''Moscow Guardian'' into a world-class daily newspaper. Sauer brought in Meg Bortin as its first editor in May 1992, and the team used a room at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel as its headquarters.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/opinion/meg-bortin-moscow-times-20th-anniversary.html |title=To Moscow With News|last = Bortin|first = Meg|date =October 6, 2012|work=New York Times}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Kuper|title=Russian remodelling of a cosmopolitan theme|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/28054942-39af-11da-806e-00000e2511c8.html#axzz4AbO0EstC|access-date=4 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=10 October 2005}}</ref>

''The Moscow Times''  was founded in 1992 by Derk Sauer to reach US and European expats who moved to Moscow after the fall of communism. Sauer said, "It was a completely different time, there was no internet and there was a huge influx of Western expats who didn't speak Russian. At the time, they were the only ones with money in Moscow, so ''The Moscow Times'' was an interesting medium for advertisers".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-07|title=De terugkeer van Derk Sauer in de Russische media|url=https://www.vn.nl/de-terugkeer-van-derk-sauer-in-de-russische-media/|access-date=2020-08-07|website=Vrij Nederland|language=nl}}</ref>

The first edition of ''The Moscow Times'' was published in March 1992.<ref>{{cite news |title=Derk Sauer: "20 Years Later" |author=Derk Sauer|date=2012|work=[[Moscow Times]] |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/20th/welcome/20-years-of-business-in-Russia.html |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref> It was the first Western daily to be published in Russia,<ref name="law">Lawton, Anna. (2004). ''Imaging Russia 2000: Film and Facts''. New Academia Publishing, LLC. p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0-9744934-3-5}}.</ref> and quickly became "a primary source of news and opinion" quoted in both Russia and the West.<ref name=":2" />

It "played an important role by giving space to Russian commentators". For example, in the fall of 1993, it was able to play a role in defeating the censors: "when anti-[[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] forces occupied the Russian Parliament and censorship was revived. Russian newspapers came out with large blank spaces on their front pages where articles critical of the authorities had been suppressed. The writers of those articles came to see us. Published the next day in English in ''The Moscow Times'', their articles were quickly picked up and beamed back in Russian by the [[BBC]] and other foreign radios, defeating the censors."<ref name=":2" />

From the mid 1990s until 2000, it was based in the old [[headquarters]] of ''[[Pravda]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/fire-tears-through-pravda-complex/206815.html|title = Fire Tears Through the Pravda Complex|last = Schreck|first = Carl|date = 14 Feb 2006|access-date = 30 August 2015}}</ref> In 1997, the website moscowtimes.ru was registered.

In July 2017 the operation of the paper changed to Stichting 2 Oktober, a foundation based in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ведомости|date=7 June 2017|title=Дерк Сауэр вернется в The Moscow Times|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/06/07/693453-derk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507141714/https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/06/07/693453-derk|archive-date=7 May 2018|access-date=7 May 2018|website=vedomosti.ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=7 June 2017|title=De terugkeer van Derk Sauer in de Russische media - Vrij Nederland|url=https://www.vn.nl/de-terugkeer-van-derk-sauer-in-de-russische-media/|access-date=7 May 2018|website=vn.nl}}</ref> 

''The Moscow Times'' currently belongs to a limited liability company which is 51% owned-by Vladimir Dzhao, the CEO of an airline catering company, 30% by Svetlana Korshunova, general director of the paper, and 19% by Derk Sauer, the original founder of the paper. Speaking to ''Kommersant'', Derk Sauer explained that this is merely to comply with a Russian law which prohibits foreigners from controlling more than 20% of any Russia-based media company, since Mr. Sauer is a Dutch citizen. He further said that Vladimir Dzhao is an old friend of his, and "he does not control the publication, he is a partner".<ref name="owner">{{cite web|date=11 October 2017|title=The Moscow Times подпитали акционером|url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3435096/|access-date=6 December 2018|website=Kommersant}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2017/10/11/the-moscow-times-new-majority-owner-is-a-russian-catering-company-executive|title=The Moscow Times' new majority owner is a Russian catering company executive|access-date=2020-08-06|website=meduza.io}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Moscow Times подпитали акционером|url=https://kompromat1.io/articles/72243-the_moscow_times_podpitali_aktsionerom|access-date=2020-08-06|website=kompromat1.io}}</ref>

=== Expansion ===
In 2003–04, the newspaper added Jobs & Careers and Real Estate appendices, and in 2005 the ''Moscow Guide'' appendix, featuring high culture. The annual ''Moscow Dining Guide'' was also launched in 2005.

Until 2005, the paper was owned by Independent Media, a Moscow-registered [[publishing house]] that also prints a [[Russian language|Russian-language]] daily newspaper, ''[[Vedomosti]]'', ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'' (''The Moscow Times''<nowiki/>' counterpart in [[Saint Petersburg]]) and Russian-language versions of popular glossy magazines such as ''[[FHM]]'', ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan Russia]]''.<ref name="law"/> That year, Independent Media was acquired by the Finnish publishing group [[Sanoma]].

In 2006, the paper began its alliance with the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', while 2009 saw the launch of the themoscowtimes.com website. The first color issue was published in 2010.

In 2009, it published ''Russia for Beginners: A Foreigner's Guide to Russia'', written by foreign authors who offer advice based on their own experiences of living in Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/MT_news/374986.htm|title=Russia for Beginners: A Foreigner's Guide to Russia|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=March 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235203/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/MT_news/374986.htm|archive-date=2009-03-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> The paper celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2012 with a gala dinner at the Hotel [[Balchug|Baltschug]] [[Kempinski]] in Moscow.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/20th/welcome/20-years-with-the-moscow-times.html |title=20 years with The Moscow Times |newspaper=The Moscow Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321165238/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/20th/welcome/20-years-with-the-moscow-times.html |date=2012 |archive-date=21 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Decline & move to digital ===
In January 2014, malicious ads on the newspaper's website redirected visitors to an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] kit [[landing page]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/01/hard-times-on-the-moscow-times|title = Hard times on The Moscow Times|author = Jérôme Segura|date = January 7, 2014|work = [[Malwarebytes]]|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150605010400/https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/01/hard-times-on-the-moscow-times/|archive-date = June 5, 2015}}</ref> In December 2014, ''The Moscow Times'' was forced offline for two days by a [[distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attack. It was forced offline a second time in February 2015 for unknown reasons.<ref name=":1" />

In April 2014 longtime editor-in-chief Andrew McChesney stepped down and was replaced by Nabi Abdullaev, a former ''Moscow Times '' reporter, news editor, managing editor, and deputy editor-in-chief who had left in 2011 to head [[RIA Novosti]]'s foreign-language news service.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/nabi-abdullaev-to-replace-andrew-mcchesney-as-mt-editor/497983.html|title = Nabi Abdullaev to Replace Andrew McChesney as MT Editor|date = April 14, 2014|work = The Moscow Times|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140417010112/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/nabi-abdullaev-to-replace-andrew-mcchesney-as-mt-editor/497983.html|archive-date = April 17, 2014}}.</ref> Shortly after his appointment, Abdullaev argued in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the west's "biased journalism&nbsp;...robs the west of its moral authority".<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/western-media-coverage-ukraine-crisis-russia|title = Is western media coverage of the Ukraine crisis anti-Russian?|last = Nabi Abdullaev|date = 4 August 2014|work = The Guardian|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140829000533/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/western-media-coverage-ukraine-crisis-russia|archive-date = 29 August 2014}}</ref> In Autumn 2015 Abdullaev was removed from his post and replaced by [[Mikhail Fishman]].

In the aftermath of the [[Ukrainian crisis]], ''The Moscow Times'' was criticized by a number of journalists. In October 2014 ''The Moscow Times'' made the decision to suspend online comments after an increase in offensive comments. The paper said it disabled comments for two reasons—it was an inconvenience for its readers as well as being a legal liability, because under [[Russian law]] websites are liable for all content, including [[user-generated content]] like comments.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://uatoday.tv/politics/russian-english-language-newspaper-becomes-latest-victim-in-kremlin-info-war-389384.html| title = Russian English-language newspaper The Moscow Times becomes latest victim in Kremlin info war|date = October 31, 2014|work = Ukraine Today}}</ref>

In 2014, sister publication ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'' ceased publication.<ref>{{Cite web|title=St. Pete's main English-language newspaper suspends operation|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=17 May 2015|date=22 December 2014|url=http://rbth.com/news/2014/12/22/st_petes_main_english-language_newspaper_suspends_operation_42461.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724081313/https://www.rbth.com/news/2014/12/22/st_petes_main_english-language_newspaper_suspends_operation_42461.html|archive-date=24 July 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, Sanoma sold MoscowTimes LLC to Demyan Kudryavtsev, a former director of [[Kommersant]].<ref>{{Cite news|issn=0362-4331|author=Andrew Roth|title=New Owner for The Moscow Times and Vedomosti|work=The New York Times|access-date=17 May 2015|date=30 April 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/world/europe/new-owner-for-the-moscow-times-and-vedomosti.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504210110/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/world/europe/new-owner-for-the-moscow-times-and-vedomosti.html|archive-date=4 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=mt-20150504>{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russian-owner-wants-modernized-moscow-times-not-kremlin-stooge/520174.html|title=Russian Owner Wants Modernized Moscow Times, Not Kremlin Stooge|author=Peter Hobson |newspaper=Moscow Times|date=4 May 2015|access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Russia blocks sale of Russian Cosmopolitan, Esquire|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-blocks-sale-of-russian-cosmopolitan-esquire/523781.htmll|access-date=4 June 2016|work=The Moscow Times|date=16 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605134217/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-blocks-sale-of-russian-cosmopolitan-esquire/523781.htmll|archive-date=5 June 2016}}</ref>
