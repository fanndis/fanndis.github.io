In the context of the [[Iraq War]], '''the surge''' refers to United States President [[George W.

The surge was developed under the [[working title]] "'''The New Way Forward'''" and was announced in January 2007 by Bush during a television speech.<ref name="Bush 01-10-07" /><ref name=fact /> Bush ordered the deployment of more than 20,000 soldiers into Iraq (five additional brigades), and sent the majority of them into [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Bush 01-10-07" /> He also extended the tour of most of the [[United States Army|Army]] troops in country and some of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] already in Anbar.<ref name="Bush 01-10-07" /> The President described the overall objective as establishing a "unified, democratic federal Iraq that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself, and is an ally in the War on Terror."<ref name=fact /> The major element of the strategy was a change in focus for the US military "to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security".<ref name="Bush 01-10-07" /> The President stated that the surge would then provide the time and conditions conducive to reconciliation between communities.<ref name="fact">{{cite news |title=Fact Sheet: The New Way Forward in Iraq |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary|date=January 10, 2007 |quote=After talking to some Afghan leaders, it was said that the Iran's would be revolting if more troops were to be sent to Iran. |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070110-3.html |author=President George W.

Initiated against strong domestic opposition and after the Republican defeat in the [[2006 midterm elections]], the surge was considered extremely politically difficult. One White House staffer explained the political rationale succinctly: "If you're going to be a bear, be a grizzly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/fred-barnes/|title=Fred Barnes on Conversations with Bill Kristol|website=conversationswithbillkristol.org}}</ref>  In retrospect, [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Barack Obama]] and other critics of the surge have argued that it was successful.<ref name=Feaver>{{cite news|author=[[Peter Feaver|Feaver, Peter]]|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/13/clinton-surge-iraq-maliki-obama/|title=Hillary Clinton and the Inconvenient Facts About the Rise of the Islamic State|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date= August 13, 2015|quote=[T]he Obama team itself, including Clinton, have repeatedly confirmed that they understand that the surge was successful.

====2006 election====
Polls showed that after the [[2006 United States general elections|2006 general election]], "A substantial majority of Americans expect [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to reduce or end American military involvement in Iraq if they [won] control of Congress".<ref>{{cite news|title=With Election Driven by Iraq, Voters Want New Approach|author=Adam Nagourney and Megan Thee|date=November 2, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/politics/02poll.html?ex=1320123600&en=307df668f49e0b07&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> This view of the election as a referendum on the war was endorsed by Democratic leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] who in the final days of the campaign said, "This election is about Iraq. If indeed it turns out the way that people expect it to turn out, the American people will have spoken, and they will have rejected the course of action the president is on."<ref>{{cite news|title=Election 2006: America's referendum on war|author=Marc Sandalow|date=November 5, 2006|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/11/05/PELOSI.TMP |accessdate=January 23, 2007 }}</ref> The news media viewed the Democratic victory in both houses of the US Congress as "punishing President George W.

====Democratic position====
After her party's victory then House Speaker-elect [[Nancy Pelosi]] (who would a month later make clear her disdain for the "surge proposal"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_070119.htm|title=Political bulletin: Friday, January 19, 2007|publisher=U.S. News & World Report|date=2007-01-19
|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref>) wrote an article entitled "Bringing the War to an End is my Highest Priority as Speaker". The article explained that after visiting wounded Iraq War veterans at the [[Bethesda Naval Medical Center]], "I left there more committed than ever to bringing the war to an end. I told my colleagues yesterday that the biggest ethical issue facing our country for the past three and a half years is the war in Iraq. ... When the House reconvenes on January 4, 2007, Democrats will take power and I will take the gavel knowing the responsibility we have to you and to the country. The new Democratic Congress will live up to the highest ethical standard... [we] are prepared to lead and ready to govern. We will honor the trust of the American people; we will not disappoint."<ref>{{cite news|title=Bringing the War to an End is my Highest Priority as Speaker|date=2006-11-17|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-nancy-pelosi/bringing-the-war-to-an-en_b_34393.html|work=The Huffington Post|author=Nancy Pelosi |accessdate=January 23, 2007}}</ref>

====Republican position====
Following the  [[2006 United States general elections|2006 United States midterm elections]] where the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] lost control of the House and Senate, a [[Heritage Foundation]] conference was chaired by Republican [[whip (politics)|whip]] Rep. [[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO) under the title "The New Way Forward: Refocusing the Conservative Agenda" on November 9, 2006 to analyze "setbacks" from the election results. Blunt bemoaned the fact Republicans had "become the defenders rather than the challengers of business as usual."<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Way Forward: Refocusing the Conservative Agenda|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev110906b.cfm|date=November 9, 2006|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|author=Rep. Roy Blunt (R-MO) |accessdate=January 22, 2007}}</ref>

Blunt opened his speech listing the oft voiced explanations of his party's defeat which included that the results were in part "a referendum on the war in Iraq". He dismissed the notion that any one single reason explained the loss, saying "Different candidates lost for different reasons." He saw a bright side in events saying "The good news is that even with these shortcomings, low presidential approval numbers, and uncertainty about Iraq, our candidates saw, even with all those things happening, their ideas taking hold in the final days of their campaigns. A shift of 78,000 votes in the entire country would have changed the outcome. Our ideas didn't get beat; in fact, we did." He applauded the Constitutional system saying the defeat proves "that no one party has a permanent claim to power. ... This means any viable political movement, such as ours, can never afford to become stagnant or complacent. We must constantly refresh our ideas, assess our performance, and make corrections when necessary. This is a great moment to do all three of those things. For a generation [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] conservatives have consistently demonstrated an ability to do just that. Nowhere has this been more evident than in our response to the threats of Islamic totalitarianism and the fight with our terrorist enemies." He said "While the threats of Islamic totalitarianism at times require different tactics, we are approaching those challenges with the same resolve that allowed us to defeat communism. I am convinced that in this fight we will also prevail because the American people understand the need to win. We must continue to lead the fight against Islamic totalitarianism and sustain the will to win the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. ... [On the war and on domestic issues] Our plan must avoid the mistakes of the past several years. ... I am confident that we will successfully move forward."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blunt.house.gov/Read.aspx?ID=761|title=Blunt Speech on GOP future|date=2006-11-09|author=Rep.

===Development of the strategy===

====Senturion Forecasts====
In January 2005, the [[National Defense University]] applied its "Senturion" predictive analysis software to the Iraqi elections in order to determine which factions would support the elections, which would oppose them, and which would remain neutral.  Senturion's forecasts were largely borne out by the actual course of events. Among other things, Senturion predicted that "increased coalition military strength in Iraq would have improved the attitudes of Iraqi stake holders toward the election by making them feel more secure." The simulations indicated that a 50% increase in troop strength was optimal, though a 25% increase would have been sufficient to capture the support of "neutral Iraqis". It also determined that due to Iraqi perceptions, the use of United Nations peacekeepers in place of US or coalition forces could achieve the same results with a smaller troop increase. These analyses were "performed and briefed to senior government decisionmakers well in advance of events."<ref>Abdollahian, Mark, Michael Baranick, Brian Efird, and Jacek Kugler, ''Senturion A Predictive Political Simulation Model'', Center for Technology and National Security Policy, National Defense University, July 2006. {{cite web|url=http://www.ndu.edu/ctnsp/Def_Tech/DTP%2032%20Senturion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110102241/http://www.ndu.edu/ctnsp/Def_Tech/DTP%2032%20Senturion.pdf |archive-date=2009-01-10 }}</ref>

====Iraq Study Group Report====
{{Main|Iraq Study Group Report}}

On December 6, 2006 the [[Iraq Study Group]] presented their report, which recommended both external and internal approaches for achieving positive progress in Iraq.  Among other approaches, the report suggested that the "United States should significantly increase the number of U.S. military personnel, including combat troops, imbedded in and supporting Iraqi Army units."<ref>"Iraq Study Group Report," {{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615040856/http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/index.html |archive-date=2009-06-15 }}, December 6, 2006, page 7, Retrieved on September 3, 2008</ref> However, this language is not specifically included in any of the report's 79 recommendations.  The ISG report mentioned a possible 10,000-20,000 troop increase for training but only until early 2008.  Co-chairman [[James Baker]] said that since "events in Iraq could overtake what we recommend...[members] believe that decisions should be made by our national leaders with some urgency."<ref name="Snow 12-6-06">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/06/iraq.change/index.html|title=Bush may announce 'new way forward' in Iraq|date=December 6, 2006|publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Upon receiving the report Bush told the group "we will take every proposal seriously, and we will act in a timely fashion."<ref name="Snow 12-6-06" />

Later in the day White House spokesman [[Tony Snow]] told [[CNN]]'s [[Larry King]] that Bush was comparing recommendations "by the [[Iraq Study Group]] with pending studies by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]."<ref name="Snow 12-6-06" /> Once the review was finished, Snow believed that the President would be able to "announce a new way forward" in Iraq by the end of the year.<ref name="Snow 12-6-06" />

====State Department====
On December 11, 2006 Bush met with Senior [[United States Department of State|State Department]] advisers (including Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]) "on how to shape U.S. policy in Iraq as part of Bush's mission to come up with a new strategy."<ref name="CNN 12-11-06">{{cite news|title=Bush briefed by State Dept. officials on Iraq|date=December 12, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/11/monday/index.html|publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2007 }}</ref> He reiterated his intent to communicate that strategy to the nation before Christmas 2006, and said "There is no question we've got to make sure that the State Department and the Defense Department – the efforts and their recommendations are closely coordinated, so that when I do speak to the American people, they will know that I've listened to all aspects of government and that the way forward is the way forward to achieve our objective: to succeed in Iraq."<ref name="CNN 12-11-06" />

====Experts====
Later on December 11, 2006 Bush met "with a group of Iraqi experts, including historians and former generals, in the [[Oval Office]]."<ref name="CNN 12-11-06" /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that among the panel of experts were retired four-star generals [[Barry McCaffrey]], [[Wayne A. Downing]], and [[Jack Keane|John Keane]]; along with academics [[Stephen Biddle]] and [[Eliot Cohen]], who panned the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.<ref name="WaPo 12-11-06">{{cite news|author=Michael A.

John M. Keane arguing that several thousand additional soldiers could be used to improve security in [[Baghdad]], and others expressing doubt about that proposal."<ref name="WaPo 12-11-06" /> The group also suggested Bush change personnel in his national security team. One panel member reported that "All of us said they have failed, that you need a new team."<ref name="WaPo 12-11-06" /> The President thanked the panel and told reporters "I appreciate the advice I got from those folks in the field. And that advice is ... an important component of putting together a new way forward in Iraq."<ref name="WaPo 12-11-06" />

The [[CIA]]'s top counterinsurgency experts conducted an assessment that found the presence of US forces was key to stability. [[Brett H. McGurk]] added that "when we have a presence we are able to help resolve local disputes before they get out of control, police illegal conduct by Iraqi forces, and ultimately help the Iraqis develop their own patterns of interaction."<ref>[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/18/the_secret_surge_debate_iraq_bush_administration?page=0,3 The Secret Surge Debate] Foreign Policy</ref>

====Joint Chiefs====
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff May 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bush makes a statement to reporters on the war in Iraq, following a meeting with senior US military leaders at the Pentagon, May 2007.]]

On December 13, 2006 Bush and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] met with the members of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] for "more than an hour," discussing different military options for Iraq. While "no dramatic proposals" were put forward, "a pragmatic assessment of what can and cannot be done by the military" was offered.<ref name="Joint Chiefs 06" />

They did "not favor adding significant numbers of troops to Iraq" but saw "strengthening the Iraqi army as pivotal to achieving some degree of stability." They pressed for "greater U.S. effort on economic reconstruction and political reconciliation." They stressed the need for "employment programs, reconstruction and political reconciliation ... [as] key to pulling young men from the burgeoning militias." They said there was "no purely military solution for Iraq" and "without major progress on the political and economic fronts, the U.S. intervention is simply buying time." They also urged "that any new strategy be sensitive to regional context, particularly the impact of political or military decisions." They fear that throwing too much support to the Shiite majority may lead Sunni nations in the region to step up support of Sunni insurgents, and that a crackdown on Iraq's largest Shiite militia, the Mahdi army, may instigate more interference by Iran.<ref name="Joint Chiefs 06">{{cite news|title=Joint Chiefs Advise Change In War Strategy|author=Robin Wright and Ann Scott Tyson|work=Washington Post|date=December 14, 2006|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/13/AR2006121301379.html |accessdate=January 23, 2007}}</ref>

=====Chiarelli plan=====
General [[George William Casey Jr.]], the top US commander in Iraq, was reported to be "reviewing a plan to redefine the American military mission there: U.S. troops would be pulled out of Iraqi cities and consolidated at a handful of U.S. bases while day-to-day combat duty would be turned over to the Iraqi army." It was said that he was "still considering whether to request more troops, possibly as part of an expanded training mission to help strengthen the Iraqi army." These options were laid out by the outgoing US ground commander, Lt. Gen. [[Peter W. Chiarelli]]. Under the Chiarelli plan "the military would shift about half of its 15 combat brigades away from battling insurgents and sectarian violence and into training Iraqi security forces as soon as the spring of 2007. ... About 4,000 U.S. troops are now serving on 11-person military training teams embedded with Iraqi forces. The new plan would add 30 troops to each team, allowing them to provide supervision and mentoring down to the level of Iraqi army companies. ... the remaining seven to eight brigades of U.S. combat forces would focus on three core missions: striking al-Qaeda, strengthening security along Iraq's borders, and protecting major highways and other routes to ensure U.S. forces freedom of movement in Iraq. ... The plan would not allow for any major reduction in U.S. troops in Iraq over the next year – nor would it call for any surge in troops". Military spokesman Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said that "In northern and western Iraq, U.S. commanders are already moving troops out of combat missions to place them as advisers with lower-level Iraqi army units."<ref name="Joint Chiefs 06" />

The Chiefs expressed "concern about the erosion of the U.S. military's ability to deal with other crises around the world because of the heavy commitment in Iraq and the stress on troops and equipment". They told Bush that there was "significantly increased risk to readiness in the event of a new emergency".<ref name="Joint Chiefs 06" />

Speaking to reporters afterward Bush said "Our military cannot do this job alone. Our military needs a political strategy that is effective." He also stressed his ongoing commitment to securing Iraq, saying "If we lose our nerve, if we're not steadfast in our determination to help the Iraqi government succeed, we will be handing Iraq over to an enemy that would do us harm." When pressed for when he would announce his new way forward, he said he would not be "rushed" into a decision and was still reviewing his options.<ref name="Joint Chiefs 06" />

====December 14 comments====
On December 14, 2006, when pressed by reporters for more information on his thinking on the matter Bush said "I am listening to a lot of advice to develop a strategy to help you succeed, a lot of consultations. I will be delivering my plans after a long deliberation, after steady deliberation. I'm not going to be rushed into making a decision." He stated that he had heard some "interesting" ideas. He also said he heard some "ideas that would lead to defeat ... [and] I reject those ideas. Ideas such as leaving before the job is done. Ideas such as not helping this (Iraqi) government take the necessary and hard steps to be able to do its job." He said he wanted the incoming Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] "to have time to evaluate the situation" and come up with his own suggestions. That same day Iraqi President [[Jalal Talabani]] issued a written statement saying that he had received Bush's assurances that "he would make no decisions on his new Iraq strategy that would be 'against your interests' ... [and his pledge] to work with Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Maliki]] on his efforts to implement a Baghdad security plan". CNN reported that "Administration officials say Bush is 'not satisfied' with some of the information he has been getting and 'is asking people to get him more' information on various options in Iraq."<ref>{{cite news |title=Bush says he won't be rushed on Iraq changes |date=December 14, 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/13/bush.iraq/index.html |work=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118001522/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/13/bush.iraq/index.html |archive-date=January 18, 2007}}</ref>

Though originally scheduled for late 2006, the announcement on "the new way forward" was delayed to give the President "more time" to gather information. Press secretary Tony Snow said the administration was hoping for the president to deliver the speech before Christmas, although he said the timing was not nailed down.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

This more holistic approach – reportedly entitled 'The New Way Forward' – echoes in many ways a paper from the [[American Enterprise Institute]], authored by Frederick Kagan, better known as the prime mover of the 'surge option.'"

==Presentation==

===Pre-speech expectations===
Bush was expected to announce a "surge" in forces that some sources say could be up to 20,000 troops. According to Reuters, "While Bush is to announce a complete overhaul of his Iraq policy, including economic and political components, the possibility of a troop increase has gained the most attention. Despite a divide on the issue, Bush in recent days has hinted toward a preference for increasing troop strength by saying he wanted to help Iraqis gain control of the security situation there. "One thing is for certain, I will want to make sure that the mission is clear and specific and can be accomplished," Bush said on Thursday when asked about a troop increase."<ref>[[Reuters]], Steve Holland [http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=25582007 Bush launches overhaul of Iraq team] 5 January 2007, ''[[The Scotsman]]''.

===Plan announcement===
[[File:Bush surge announcement jan 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|President George W. Bush announces the new strategy on Iraq from the White House Library, January 10, 2007.]]
In a nationally televised address on January 10, Bush stated "America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The vast majority of them– five brigades– will be deployed to Baghdad".<ref name="Bush 01-10-07">{{cite news |title=President's Address to the Nation |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 10, 2007 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070110-7.html |author=President George W.

On the same day of the speech, ABC News announced that ninety advance troops from the [[82nd Airborne Division]] had already arrived in Baghdad.

===2007 State of the Union address===
{{Main|2007 State of the Union Address}}

In advance of the [[State of the Union]] address, Bush gave several promotional speeches to [[Belo]] television and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group|Sinclair television]], suggesting that the surge "should be given a chance" and challenged critical lawmakers to offer an alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16705268 |title=Bush on Iraq plan: 'I believe it will work' – Politics&nbsp;— NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>

On the night of Tuesday, January 23, the president had this to say on the troop increase in Iraq, outlining its purpose in supporting the Iraqi government's maintenance of control:

{{quote|In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure [[List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad|neighborhoods]], and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. (Applause.) We didn't drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.}}

====Congress====
{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
On January 16, Republican [[Chuck Hagel]], Delaware Democrat [[Joe Biden]] ([[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chair), and Michigan Democrat [[Carl Levin]] ([[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] chair) co-sponsored a [[non-binding resolution]] that said it was "not in the national interest of the United States to deepen its military involvement in Iraq."<ref>{{cite news|author=Joel Roberts |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/16/politics/main1719964.shtml |title=House Passes Symbolic Iraq Resolution |publisher=CBS News |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats in her chamber would back a [[non-binding resolution]] "declaring that President Bush's decision to send additional troops to Iraq is 'not in the national interest of the United States.'" ''The Washington Times'' reported Pelosi "has made clear her disdain for the 'surge' proposal" since before Bush unveiled it last week, but her latest remarks "were her first indication of the language that she will want the House to approve."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_070119.htm |title=Political Bulletin: Friday, January 19, 2007 |work=U.S. News & World Report |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>

Following passage in the House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) convened an unusual Saturday session of the Senate on February 17, 2007, to consider an identically-worded resolution. However, the measure was tabled when a [[cloture]] motion failed on a 56–34 vote (four votes short of the 60 votes needed to end debate).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/18/Worldandnation/GOP_blocks_Iraq_resol.shtml|title=GOP blocks Iraq resolution in Senate|accessdate=2007-02-17|agency=Associated Press|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/election/ci_5250490|title=Iraq Resolution: Senate Roll Call|accessdate=2007-02-18|agency=Associated Press|work=[[El Paso Times]]}}</ref>

===Units deployed===
The six US Army brigades committed to Iraq as part of the surge were
# [[2nd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division]] (Infantry): 3,447 troops. Deployed to Baghdad, January 2007
# [[4th Brigade (US 1st Infantry Division)|4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division]] (Infantry): 3,447 troops. Deployed to Baghdad, February 2007
# [[3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division]] (Heavy): 3,784 troops. Deployed to southern [[Baghdad Belts]], March 2007
# [[4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division (United States)|4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division]] (Stryker): 3,921 troops. Deployed to [[Diyala Governorate]], April 2007
# [[2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division]] (Heavy): 3,784 troops. Deployed to the southeast of Baghdad, May 2007
# 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (Light), September 2007 Deployed to Kirkuk
This brought the number of US brigades in Iraq from 15 to 20. Additionally, 4,000 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] in [[Al Anbar]] had their 7-month tour extended. These included Marines from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]], [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit]], the [[2nd Battalion 4th Marines]], the [[1st Battalion 6th Marines]] and the [[3rd Battalion, 4th Marines]]. Most of the 150,000 Army personnel had their 12-month tours extended as well. By July, 2007, the percentage of the mobilized Army deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was almost 30%; the percentage of the mobilized Marine Corps deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was 13.5%.<ref>''Army Times'', July 16, 2007, pg. 7 and M''arine Corps Times'', July 16, 2007.</ref>

===Operations===
The plan began with a major operation to secure Baghdad, codenamed [[Operation Fardh al-Qanoon]] (Operation Imposing Law), which was launched in February 2007. However, only in mid-June 2007, with the full deployment of the 28,000 additional US troops, could major counter-insurgency efforts get fully under way. [[Operation Phantom Thunder]] was launched throughout Iraq on June 16, with a number of subordinate operations targeting insurgents in Diyala and Al Anbar Governorates and the southern Baghdad Belts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12431&Itemid=128 |title=Multi-National Force&nbsp;— Iraq&nbsp;— MNC-I conducts Operation Phantom Thunder |publisher=Mnf-iraq.com |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US Iraq troop surge 'starts now'|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-06-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757329.stm}}</ref> The additional surge troops also participated in [[Operation Phantom Strike]] and [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]], named after the [[III Corps (United States)|III "Phantom" Corps]] which was the major US unit in Iraq throughout 2007.

===Counterinsurgency strategy===
[[File:Baghdad Ethno-Sectarian Violence.jpg|thumb|Success of the counterinsurgency strategy measured in decrease of ethno-sectarian violence.]]
Counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq changed significantly under the command of General Petraeus since the 2007 troop surge began.<ref>New U.S. Counterinsurgency Tactics Face Challenges Ahead by Oliver Read Online NewsHour January 26, 2007 [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/middle_east/jan-june07/iraq_01-22.html]</ref> The newer approach attempted to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people through building relationships, preventing civilian casualties and compromising with and even hiring some former enemies.<ref>US uses Sunnis to patrol streets [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/us-uses-sunnis-to-patrol-streets/2007/08/19/1187462082102.html] August 20, 2007</ref> The new strategy was population-centric in that it focused in protecting the population rather than killing insurgents.<ref name="Kilcullen129">{{cite book|title=The Accidental Guerrilla: Fighting Small Wars in the Midst of a Big One|author=[[David Kilcullen]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536834-5|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/accidentalguerri00kilc/page/129 129]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/accidentalguerri00kilc/page/129}}</ref> In implementing this strategy, Petraeus used experience gained while commanding the [[David Petraeus#101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne Division in Mosul]] in 2003.  He also explained these ideas extensively in Field Manual 3-24: Counterinsurgency,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usacac.leavenworth.army.mil/cac2/coin/repository/FM_3-24.pdf |title=FM 3–24 text – COUNTERINSURGENCY -DECEMBER 2006 |publisher=Usacac.army.mil |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928152550/http://usacac.leavenworth.army.mil/cac2/coin/repository/FM_3-24.pdf |archive-date=September 28, 2011 }}</ref> which he assisted in the writing of while serving as the Commanding General of [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, and the [[US Army Combined Arms Center]] (CAC) located there.

Instead of seeing every Iraqi as a potential enemy, COIN strategy focused on building relationships and getting cooperation from the Iraqis against Al Qaeda and minimizing the number of enemies for US forces. The belief was that maintaining a long-term presence of troops in a community improves security and allows for relationships and trust to develop between the locals and the US military. Civilian casualties are minimized by carefully measured use of force.  This means less bombing and overwhelming fire-power, and more soldiers using restraint and even sometimes taking more risk in the process.<ref>Counterinsurgency Field Manual: Afghanistan Edition [https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4587] By Nathaniel C. Fick, John A. Nagl</ref>

Another method of gaining cooperation is by paying locals, including former insurgents, to work as local security forces. Former Sunni insurgents have been hired by the US military to stop cooperating with Al Qaeda and to start fighting against them.<ref>US bribe insurgents to fight Al-Qaeda [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2413200.ece] September 9, 2007</ref>

To implement this strategy, troops were concentrated in the Baghdad area (at the time, Baghdad accounted for 50% of all the violence in Iraq).<ref>Kilcullen, 130</ref>  Whereas in the past, Coalition forces isolated themselves from Iraqis by living in large [[forward operating base]]s far from population centers,<ref>Kilcullen, 133</ref> troops during the surge lived among the Iraqis, operating from joint security stations (JSSs) located within Baghdad itself and shared with Iraqi security forces.<ref>Kilcullen, 135</ref>  Coalition units were permanently assigned to a given area so that they could build long-term relationships with the local Iraqi population and security forces.<ref name="Kilcullen129" />

However, opponents to occupation such as US Army Col. David H. Hackworth (Ret.), when asked whether he thought that British soldiers are better at nation-building than the Americans, said "They were very good at lining up local folks to do the job like operating the sewers and turning on the electricity. Far better than us – we are heavy-handed, and in Iraq we don't understand the people and the culture. Thus we did not immediately employ locals in police and military activities to get them to build and stabilize their nation."

CNN war correspondent Michael Ware, who has reported from Iraq since before the US invasion in 2003 had a similar dim view of occupation saying, "there will be very much mixed reaction in Iraq" to a long-term troop presence, but he added, "what's the point and will it be worth it?" Mr. Ware contended that occupation could, "ferment further resentment [towards the U.S]."

On September 10, 2007, [[David Petraeus]] delivered his part of the [[Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq]]. He concluded that "the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met." He cited recent consistent declines in security incidents, which he attributed to recent blows dealt against [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] during the surge. He added that "we have also disrupted Shia militia extremists, capturing the head and numerous other leaders of the Iranian-supported Special Groups, along with a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative supporting Iran's activities in Iraq." He argued that Coalition and Iraqi operations had drastically reduced ethno-sectarian violence in the country, though he stated that the gains were not entirely even. He recommended a gradual drawdown of US forces in Iraq with a goal of reaching pre-surge troop levels by July 2008 and stated that further withdraws would be "premature".<ref name=report>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070910193939/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/Petraeus-Testimony20070910.pdf "Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq"] [[United States Department of Defense]] [http://www.defenselink.mil/ central website].

===Interpretation of results===
Whether the surge led to the improvement in Iraqi security, or other factors caused it, is disputed by some. [[Council of Foreign Relations]] fellow [[Noah Feldman]] has remarked that:
{{quote|These questions can be stated with some precision. They begin with the issue of how to interpret the comparative reduction in violence since the surge of United States troops began nearly a year ago. Does the decrease show that more troops on the ground were necessary to impose effective control over territory and persuade insurgents to back down? Or is the reduced violence a sign instead that the prospect of imminent United States withdrawal has made Iraqis more hesitant to foment a civil war from which the United States will not save them? Whatever the answer, the practical consequences are huge: either we keep troop levels relatively stable, drawing down slowly while we consolidate increasing stability, or we accelerate withdrawal to underscore our seriousness about leaving.<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/publication/15255/vanishing_act.html "Vanishing Act"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222144711/http://www.cfr.org/publication/15255/vanishing_act.html |date=2008-02-22 }}.

[[Peter Mansoor]], General [[Petraeus]]'s executive officer and author of the ''Baghdad at Sunrise: A Brigade Commander's War in Iraq'', stated in an August 2008 ''The Washington Post'' [[op-ed]] that "The Iraq war is not over, but our war effort is on a firmer foundation...

In July 2008, Yon stated in a ''[[New York Daily News]]'' editorial that "'The war in Iraq is over ... the Iraqi people won."<ref>{{cite news|last=Yon |first=Michael |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/07/20/2008-07-20_as_iraqis_stop_living_in_fear_end_of_ira.html |title=As Iraqis stop living in fear, end of Iraq war is at hand |work=New York Daily News |date=2008-07-20 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |location=New York}}</ref>

Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] argued in his book ''America's Victories: Why the U.S. Wins Wars'', that the surge's success, in part, came from the incredible casualties the US military inflicted on al-Qaeda in Iraq and on the "insurgents" from 2003 to 2006---some 40,000 killed, about 200,000 wounded, 20,000 captured, and nearly 10,000 deserted. He has stated that those levels of attrition on an enemy the estimated size of al-Qaeda were substantial and deeply damaging, not only to the terrorists' efforts in Iraq, but had the effect of depleting them worldwide.  Moreover, Schweikart argued, virtually all estimates of enemy casualties were severely under-counted (as are all numbers of guerilla casualties) given the inability to identify bodies which were completely annihilated by explosives or to count carcasses dragged away, as well as how many would die later after attempted medical treatment by other Al Queda sympathizers.

Senator John McCain argued on air September 11, 2014 at CNN @THISHOUR WITH BERMAN AND MICHAELA that the surge was a victory and reached its goal of providing substantial security and stability in resolving government agendas between various groups within Iraq. That it was more less an aftermath of pulling troops out after the "surge" that resulted in increase terrorist operations and the presence of ISIS currently in Iraq. "We had it won, thanks to the surge. It was won. The victory was there. All we needed was a force behind to provide support, not to engage in combat, but to supply support, logistics, intelligence. And, by the way, the Korean war we left troops behind; Bosnia, we left troops behind, not to fight, but be for a stabilizing force."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1409/11/ath.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com}}</ref>

''Washington Post'' reporter [[Bob Woodward]] has interviewed US government sources according to whom the US "surge" was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007–2008. Instead, according to his view, the reduction of violence was due to new covert techniques by US military and intelligence officials to find, target and kill insurgents.<ref name=woodward />

Some, such as then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], have credited the [[Iranian government]] for all or part of the reduction in violence. Pelosi stated in May 2008 that "some of the success of the surge is that the goodwill of the Iranians-they decided in Basra when the fighting would end, they negotiated that cessation of hostilities-the Iranians."<ref>{{cite news|last=Evangelista |first=Benny |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&entry_id=26858%22 |title=Chronicle Podcasts : House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the presidential race, her legislative agenda and Iraq |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> Cockburn has also stated that the Iranians played the major role.<ref name=patrick />

Other commentators have pointed to the [[Sunni Awakening]] (which started in 2005) as the most important reason for the decline in Iraqi violence.

On April 20, 2007, four months after the surge went into effect, Senator [[Harry Reid]] made a statement on the floor of the [[US Senate]] that the US had already lost the war in Iraq and that the surge would accomplish nothing, stating "I believe myself that the secretary of state, secretary of defense and – you have to make your own decisions as to what the president knows – (know) this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday."<ref>{{cite news|last=AP |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18227928/#.Umzb_SR5F1M |title=Reid: Iraq war lost, US can't win |date=2013-10-27 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>
