===Financial and donor information===
According to ''The New York Times'', the cache included "thousands of emails exchanged by Democratic officials and party fund-raisers, revealing in rarely seen detail the elaborate, ingratiating and often bluntly transactional exchanges necessary to harvest hundreds of millions of dollars from the party's wealthy donor class.

===France===
In 2011, France, under President Nicolas Sarkozy, led calls for international intervention in the [[Libyan Civil War]], voted in favor of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] and, subsequently, dispatched the [[French Air Force]] into direct military action in Libya in support of the [[National Transitional Council]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Michael|title=Viewpoint: How Libya Became a French and British War|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=March 19, 2011}}</ref> At the time, France said  the move was to protect Libyan civilians. But in a private email from [[Sidney Blumenthal]] to [[Hillary Clinton]] - revealed as part of the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak - Blumenthal claimed France was more concerned with Libya's large gold reserves, which might pose a threat to the value of the [[Central African Franc]], thereby weakening French influence in [[Africa]], and that Sarkozy was interested in increased access to Libyan oil. Former French diplomat Patrick Haimzadeh called Blumenthal's analysis, while it reflected a popular theory on conspiracy websites, "not credible" because "the timeline just doesn't add up" with Sarkozy's decision to intervene preceding knowledge of Gaddafi's plans.<ref name="vice">{{cite news|last1=Asher-Schapiro|first1=Avi|title=Libyan Oil, Gold, and Qaddafi: The Strange Email Sidney Blumenthal Sent Hillary Clinton In 2011|url=https://news.vice.com/article/libyan-oil-gold-and-qaddafi-the-strange-email-sidney-blumenthal-sent-hillary-clinton-in-2011|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=[[VICE News]]|date=January 12, 2016}}</ref> French investigative journalist Fabrice Arfi dismissed Blumenthal's claim as "far-fetched," while also acknowledging that even [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence]] did not find France's publicly stated motivations for the Libya intervention to be entirely credible either.<ref name="vice" />

After the emails were released, the Australian diplomat [[Alexander Downer]] informed the U.S. government that, in May 2016 at a London wine bar, Trump campaign staffer [[George Papadopoulos]] had told him that the Russian government had a large trove of [[Hillary Clinton]] emails that could potentially damage her presidential campaign.

On October 14, 2016, NBC News reported that multiple sources were telling them that Barack Obama had ordered the CIA to present him with options for a retaliatory cyber attack against the Russian Federation for allegedly interfering in the US presidential election.

==Media coverage and public perception==
On July 27, 2016, ''The New York Times'' reported that Julian Assange, in an interview on British ITV on June 12, 2016, had "made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency", and that in a later interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/exclusive_wikileaks_julian_assange_on_releasing|title=EXCLUSIVE: WikiLeaks' Julian Assange on Releasing DNC Emails That Ousted Debbie Wasserman Schultz|website=Democracy Now!|language=en|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> on the program [[Democracy Now!]] on July 25, 2016, the first day of the Democratic National Convention, he acknowledged that "he had timed their release to coincide with the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]]."<ref name= "SpyAgencyConsensus"/><ref name = "NYT">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html |title=Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic Convention |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 26, 2016 }}</ref> In an interview with CNN, Assange would neither confirm nor deny who WikiLeaks' sources were; he claimed that his website "...{{nbsp}}might release "a lot more material" relevant to the US electoral campaign{{nbsp}}..." <ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/26/politics/julian-assange-dnc-email-leak-hack/ |first=Matthew |last=Chance |title=Julian Assange: 'A lot more material' coming on US elections |work=CNN |date=July 27, 2016 }}</ref>

Following the publication of the stolen emails, NSA whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] criticized WikiLeaks for its wholesale leakage of data, writing that "their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake."<ref name="PetersonClash"/> ''The Washington Post'' contrasted the difference between WikiLeaks' practices and Snowden's disclosure of information about NSA: while Snowden worked with journalists to vet documents (withholding some where it would endanger national security), WikiLeaks' "more radical" approach involves the dumping of "massive, searchable caches online with few—if any—apparent efforts to remove sensitive personal information."<ref name="PetersonClash"/>

On July 25, 2016, [[Anne Applebaum]], columnist for ''The Washington Post'', writes that

<blockquote>... with the exception of a few people on Twitter and a handful of print journalists, most of those covering this story, especially on television, are not interested in the nature of the hackers, and they are not asking why the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this particular moment, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. They are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails ...</blockquote>

She goes on to describe in detail other [[Active measures|Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anne|first1=Applebaum|title=Connecting the dots: How Russia benefits from the DNC mail leaks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/07/25/connecting-the-dots-how-russia-benefits-from-the-dnc-email-leak/|date=July 25, 2016}}</ref>

On July 25, 2016, Thomas Rid, Professor in Security Studies at King's College, London, and non-resident fellow at the School for Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, DC, summed up the evidence pointing to Russia being behind the hacking of the DNC files and the "Guccifer-branded leaking operation". He concludes that these actions successfully blunted the "DNC's ability to use its opposition research in surprise against Trump{{nbsp}}..." <ref name= "Rid"/> He further writes that data exfiltration from political organizations is done by many countries and is considered to be a legitimate form of intelligence work. "But digitally exfiltrating and then publishing possibly manipulated documents disguised as freewheeling hacktivism is crossing a big red line and setting a dangerous precedent: an authoritarian country directly yet covertly trying to sabotage an American election."<ref name="Rid"/>

Russian security expert and investigative journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]] said "It is almost impossible to know for sure whether or not Russia is behind a hack of the DNC's servers". According to him, one of the reasons Russia would try to sway the US presidential election is that the Russian government considers Clinton "a hater of Russia": "There is this mentality in Russia of being besieged; that it is always under attack from the United States ... They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs so why not try to do the same thing to them?"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/pro-kremlin-youth-groups-could-be-behind-dnc-hack/a-19430216 |title='Pro-Kremlin youth groups' could be behind DNC hack|date=July 27, 2016|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] }}</ref>

==Civil DNC lawsuit==
{{Main|Democratic National Committee v. Russian Federation}}
On April 20, 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New York, accusing the Russian government, the Trump campaign, Wikileaks, and others of conspiracy to alter the course of the 2016 presidential election and asking for monetary damages and a declaration admitting guilt. A hearing on the defendants' motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 17, 2018.<ref name="nyt180420">{{Cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Alexander|last2=Shear|first2=Michael D.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/dnc-russia-trump-lawsuit.html|title=Democratic Party Alleges Trump-Russia Conspiracy in New Lawsuit|website=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 2018|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name="wapo180420">{{Cite web|last1=Hamburger|first1=Tom|last2=Helderman|first2=Rosalind S.|last3=Nakashima|first3=Ellen|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-files-lawsuit-alleging-russia-the-trump-campaign-and-wikileaks-conspired-to-disrupt-the-2016-campaign/2018/04/20/befe8364-4418-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Democratic Party sues Russia, Trump campaign and WikiLeaks alleging 2016 campaign conspiracy|website=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 2018|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref> In July 2019, the suit was dismissed [[with prejudice]]. In his judgement, federal judge [[John Koeltl]] said that although he believed the Russian government was involved in the hacking, US federal law generally prohibited suits against foreign governments. The judge said the other defendants, "did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC's argument was "entirely divorced from the facts" and even if the Russians had directly provided the hacked documents to the Trump team, it would not be criminal for the campaign to publish those documents, as long as they did not contribute to the hacking itself. Koeltl denied the defendants motion for sanctions, but dismissed the suit with prejudice, meaning it had a substantive legal defect and could not be refiled.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Re |first1=Gregg |title=Judge dismisses DNC lawsuit against Trump campaign, Russia, WikiLeaks over hacking |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/judge-dismisses-dnc-lawsuit-against-trump-campaign-russia-wikileaks-over-hacking/ar-AAF5bE9 |work = msn|accessdate=July 31, 2019 |date=July 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730221720/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/judge-dismisses-dnc-lawsuit-against-trump-campaign-russia-wikileaks-over-hacking/ar-AAF5bE9 |archive-date=2019-07-30 }}</ref>
