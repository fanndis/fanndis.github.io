'''Dominic Mckenzie Cummings''' (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist who served as chief adviser to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] from 24 July 2019 until 13 November 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54938050|title=Cummings to leave No 10 with immediate effect|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-11-13|title=Dominic Cummings: PM's top adviser leaves No 10 to 'clear the air'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54938050|access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>

From 2007 to 2014, he was a [[Special adviser (UK)|special adviser]] to [[Michael Gove]], including the time that Gove served as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]], leaving when Gove was made [[Chief Whip]] in a cabinet reshuffle. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was [[Campaign manager|director]] of [[Vote Leave]], an organisation which successfully executed the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] campaign for [[Brexit|Britain's exit]] from the [[European Union]].

After Johnson was appointed prime minister in July 2019, Cummings was appointed as Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister. Cummings had a contentious relationship with [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Sajid Javid]] which culminated in [[2020 British cabinet reshuffle|Javid's resignation in February 2020]] after he refused to comply with Cummings's request to dismiss his special advisers.

In May 2020, two leaders of opposition parties called for Cummings to resign after it was reported that he travelled to his parents' farm in [[Durham, England|Durham]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] lockdown. After he gave the reasons for his journey at a press conference in the [[garden of 10 and 11 Downing Street]], Prime Minister Johnson supported his chief adviser by saying Cummings had acted "responsibly, legally and with integrity".<ref name=tg_20200524/> On 28 May 2020, Durham police said that they did not consider an offence was committed when Cummings travelled from London to [[Durham, England|Durham]] and that a minor breach might have occurred in travelling from there to [[Barnard Castle]].

In March 2019, the [[Commons Select Committee of Privileges]] recommended the House issue an admonishment for [[contempt of Parliament]] after Cummings failed to appear before the [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] inquiry into claims of false news during the referendum campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47712040 |accessdate=27 July 2019 |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2019}}</ref> The resolution admonishing him was passed by resolution of the House of Commons on 2 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Privileges – Hansard |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-04-02/debates/B24A6227-E736-4100-8DDF-9CE02A37A533/Privileges?highlight=cummings%20contempt |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref>

In July 2017, the lawyer and political commentator [[David Allen Green]] asked Cummings via Twitter, "Is there anything which could now happen (or not happen) which would make you now wish Leave had not won the referendum result?" Cummings replied, "Lots! I said before REF was dumb idea, other things should have been tried 1st."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Freedland |first1=Jonathan |title=Is Brexit an error?

===Chief Adviser to Boris Johnson (2019–2020)===
On 24 July 2019, Cummings was appointed as a senior adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/controversial-ex-vote-leave-chief-dominic-cummings-to-join-boris-johnsons-team-in-number-10-11769523|title=Who is 'career psychopath' Dominic Cummings set to join Johnson's team?|last=Heffer|first=Greg|date=24 July 2019|website=Sky News|language=en|accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref> and was described as the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Downing Street Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morrison |first1=Sean |title=Key players in Boris Johnson's election campaign |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-election-campaign-key-players-a4312441.html |accessdate=17 November 2020 |work=[[Evening Standard]] |date=13 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wickham |first1=Alex |title=How Dominic Cummings Took Control In Boris Johnson’s First Days As Prime Minister |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/how-dominic-cummings-took-control-in-boris-johnsons-first |accessdate=17 November 2020 |work=BuzzFeed |date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

On his appointment, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that at a conference in 2017 Cummings had argued that: "People think, and by the way I think most people are right: 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me{{' "}}; and that "Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS. And the public has kind of cottoned on to that".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/dominic-cummings-tories-do-not-care-about-poor-people-or-the-nhs|title=Dominic Cummings: Tory MPs do not care about poor people or NHS|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=30 July 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=31 July 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on Cummings's past rivalry with [[Nigel Farage]] from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum campaign]], and quoted Farage as saying that: "He has never liked me. He can't stand the [[European Research Group|ERG]]. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Asa |title=Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage: the Brexit referendum rivalry that continues to rage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/31/dominic-cummings-nigel-farage-brexit-referendum-rivalry-continues/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=31 July 2019 | accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Cummings was accused by [[Layla Moran]] of hypocrisy when, not long after his appointment, it was reported that a farm that he co-owns had received €250,000 (£235,000) in [[Common Agricultural Policy|EU farming subsidies]]. Cummings had previously described such subsidies as "absurd", complaining that some of them were handed out to "very rich landowners to do stupid things".<ref>{{cite news |title= Brexit enforcer Cummings' farm took €235,000 in EU handouts |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy |work=The Guardian |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date= 1 August 2019 }}</ref>

In November 2019, a [[whistleblower]] raised questions about Cummings's interactions during his years in Russia; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Whitehall was keeping certain government business from Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-asks-about-dominic-cummings-years-working-in-russia-vl6d0w62z|title=Labour asks about Dominic Cummings' years working in Russia|newspaper=The Times|last1=Harper|first1=Tom|last2=Wheeler|first2=Caroline|date=3 November 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

As is customary procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament dissolved]] for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government following [[2019 England floods|widespread flooding]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097#block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097|title=YouGov poll suggests Tories on course for comfortable general election victory|last=Lyons|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

According to ''[[Politico]]'', Cummings played a role in the Conservative Party's victory in the election,<ref>{{cite web | last1=Dickson | first1=Annabelle | last2=Casalicchio | first2=Emilio | last3=Blanchard | first3=Jack | last4=Courea | first4=Eleni | title=We're all living in Dominic Cummings' world now | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/dominic-cummings-uk-electio-2019-strategy-conservative-victory/ | date=13 December 2019 | work=[[Politico]] | accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> after having passed the party's running of the election campaign to [[Isaac Levido]]. After the election, Cummings called for people interested in working in government to contact him through a private [[Gmail]] address. In a blog post, he said he wanted to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to help improve the performance of government, making his own role "within a year largely redundant".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50978329|title=PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings calls for civil service changes|date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> The recruitment drive was reported to have resulted in several appointments on short-term contracts, including [[Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich|Baroness Wolf of Dulwich]], Professor [[Vernon C.

Cummings' relationship with the media has been seen as adversarial; [[Jim Waterson]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' argued that although Cummings attempted to go to "war with the BBC, Channel 4 News and all manner of other news outlets deemed to represent the views of the metropolitan elite and not the 52% of the country who had voted for Brexit" the "half-finished cultural revolution" of Cummings and Cains had "often been more bark than bite. Proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee ... have been kicked into the long grass. A boycott of [government ministers appearing on] Radio 4's [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'']] programme was meant to last until 'they better understand the country' but was dropped after a few months. When the full scale of the coronavirus pandemic became apparent, Cain gathered journalists together and promised a more cooperative attitude to fit the times."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waterson |first1=Jim |title=Dominic Cummings' media approach often more bark than bite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/16/dominic-cummings-media-approach-often-more-bark-than-bite |access-date=25 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=16 November 2020}}</ref> (Conservative boycotting of the ''Today'' programme in particular was a goal of Cummings' when he was a member of the New Frontiers Foundation, before he was an adviser to Johnson.<ref name="Mason"/>) Conversely, ITV political editor [[Robert Peston]] said in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that he was the victim of [[social media]] abuse "for reporting anything perceived to have originated anywhere near Cummings", and was accused of being Cummings' personal [[stenographer]]. He also added that "one senior Tory who thought about applying to be Beeb chair" told him that calls for the BBC's "cultural re-education", which many assumed came from Cummings, actually came from [[Munira Mirza]], director of the [[Number 10 Policy Unit]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Peston |first1=Robert |author1-link=Robert Peston |title=Diary |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-truth-about-me-and-dominic-cummings |access-date=25 November 2020 |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=21 November 2020 |page=9}}</ref>

====Sonia Khan's dismissal====
In August 2019 Cummings dismissed Sonia Khan, one of the Treasury's [[Special adviser (UK)|special advisers]], without the permission or knowledge of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Sajid Javid]]. The dismissal occurred during preparations for [[prorogation|suspending parliament]], which Cummings had planned and which would limit the time in which MPs could block a no-deal Brexit. According to ''The Guardian'', Cummings believed that Khan had been dishonest about her recent contact with her ex-boss, previous Chancellor and no-deal opponent [[Philip Hammond]], and, according to an unconfirmed report, dismissed her after summoning her to 10 Downing Street and viewing recent activity on her phones, and then asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises. Former [[attorney general]] [[Dominic Grieve]] said that the [[cabinet secretary]] should hold an inquiry and that "it was wrong of the police to get involved". Dal Babu, former [[chief superintendent]] of the Metropolitan police, said it was "a shocking abuse of armed officers" and that the police should be asking questions of both Cummings and the Prime Minister about an abuse of process.<ref>{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/boris-johnson-must-launch-inquiry-dominic-cummings-reign-of-terror |title=PM 'must launch urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings's reign of terror'|first1=Toby |last1=Helm|first2=Mark |last2=Townsend|date=1 September 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The following month, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Cummings had "seized new powers to sack ministers' advisers", as their new employment contracts stipulated that responsibility for disciplinary matters rested with the Prime Minister's [[Downing Street Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] as well as with their respective ministers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/dominic-cummings-cements-his-power-to-sack-advisers-m6q77gkxd|title=Dominic Cummings cements his power to sack advisers|last=Zeffman|first=Henry|date=18 September 2019|work=The Times|accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref>

Sonia Khan, supported by the [[FDA (trade union)|FDA trade union]], took a claim for [[Unfair dismissal in the United Kingdom|unfair dismissal]] to an [[employment tribunal]], arguing Cummings was pivotal to a claim of sex discrimination. The hearing was scheduled for December 2020 at which Cummings was due to give evidence, but in November 2020 a "five-figure" financial settlement of the claim was agreed.<ref name=guardian-20201113>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/13/special-adviser-sacked-by-dominic-cummings-to-receive-payoff |title=Special adviser sacked by Dominic Cummings to receive payoff |last=Syal |first=Rajeev |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 November 2020 |access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref>

====Relationship with Sajid Javid at the Treasury====

In the weeks leading up to the February 2020 reshuffle, a number of briefings in the press had suggested that a new economic ministry led by [[Rishi Sunak]] might be established, to reduce the power and political influence of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Sunak was considered to be a Johnson loyalist, favoured by Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/35e7bf74-1521-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385|title=Johnson's 'favourite minister' tipped to run super-ministry|date=25 December 2019|newspaper=Financial Times|author=Parker, George}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2020/02/is-sajid-javid-at-war-with-no-10/|title=Is Sajid Javid at war with No. 10?|author=Balls, Katy|newspaper=The Spectator|date=13 February 2020}}</ref> By February 2020, it was reported that Sunak would stay on as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], for Cummings to "keep an eye" on Javid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/05/johnson-loyalists-to-be-rewarded-in-long-awaited-reshuffle|title=Ministers jostle as Johnson plans long-awaited reshuffle|date=5 February 2020|author=Mason, Rowena|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

On 13 February 2020, the day of the reshuffle, Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer, following a meeting with the Prime Minister. During the meeting, Johnson had said Javid could keep his position on the condition that he dismiss all of his advisers at the Treasury, who would be replaced with ones selected by Cummings. Upon resigning, Javid told the [[PA Media|Press Association]] that "no self-respecting minister would accept those terms".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle|title=Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor amid Johnson reshuffle|author=Mason, Rowena|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2020/0213/1115043-sajid-javid-quits-as-british-chancellor/|title=Sajid Javid quits as British Chancellor|date=13 February 2020|website= RTÉ}}</ref>

The Chancellor's resignation was unexpected, given Johnson's commitment to retain Javid within the Cabinet, and recent reports that an alternative finance ministry would not be made. Robert Shrimsley, chief political commentator of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', stated that the Prime Minister's choice of Cummings over Javid at the time risked damaging the government, that "good government often depends on senior ministers – and the Chancellor in particular – being able to fight bad ideas".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f1e8b996-4e59-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5|title=Johnson has backed Cummings over his chancellor — and there will be a cost|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=Financial Times|author= Shrimsley, Robert|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

{{main|Dominic Cummings scandal}}

In March 2020, it was reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that during a private engagement the previous month, Cummings had said that the government's strategy towards the coronavirus was "herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad". The spokesman for [[10 Downing Street]] decried the article as "a highly defamatory fabrication" which "includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=No 10 denies claim Dominic Cummings argued to 'let old people die' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die |accessdate=22 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=22 March 2020}}</ref> On 27 April, the ''Guardian'' website reported that Cummings sat in on meetings of the [[Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]] (SAGE), which advises the cabinet on coronavirus response.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage|first=Ian|last=Sample|title=Who's who on secret scientific group advising UK government?|work=The Guardian|date=24 April 2020|access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref> According to two participants in a SAGE meeting of 18 March, Cummings pressed for a faster lockdown, including closure of pubs and restaurants within two days.<ref>{{cite news |title=Johnson's Top Aide Pushed Scientists to Back U.K. Lockdown |last1=Morales|first1=Alex|last2=Ring|first2=Suzi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/top-aide-to-u-k-s-johnson-pushed-scientists-to-back-lockdown |work=Bloomberg |date=28 April 2020}}</ref>

A joint investigation by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', published on 22 May, alleged that Cummings had broken lockdown rules by travelling to Durham in late March. This report triggered criticism of Cummings at the time as the government had instructed people to remain at home unless absolutely necessary, with certain provisos. On 25 May, Cummings made a public statement in the [[Garden of 10 and 11 Downing Street|garden of 10 Downing Street]], giving the following account of his actions during the time in question. 

{{quote|
On 27 March 2020 Cummings received a phone call at work from his wife to say that she was feeling ill. After going home to check on her, he returned to work. Later that day, the couple discussed her health and thought it was possible she had caught COVID-19, even though she was not displaying the symptoms at the time. They were both worried that they would become too weak to look after their four-year-old son if he became ill as well. He said he travelled to Durham that night to stay at a house on his parents' farmland, near to their house and that of his sister, {{Convert|264|mi|km}} from his usual residence in London. He stated that the lockdown regulations allowed journeys to facilitate child care as necessary journeys and he believed that this trip was therefore allowed. On 28 March he woke up with what were clearly COVID-19 symptoms, which got worse so that he barely left his bed over the following days.<ref name=":1" /> 

On 30 March, Downing Street reported that Cummings had displayed symptoms of COVID-19 and was self-isolating. This was three days after Boris Johnson had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buchan |first=Lizzy |date=30 March 2020 |title=Dominic Cummings self-isolates after he develops coronavirus symptoms |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-test-symptoms-positive-latest-a9433331.html|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref> In his statement, Cummings went on to say that on 2 April 2020, his son became ill and was taken to hospital by ambulance and tested for COVID-19 (the test results a few days later were negative). Cummings said he was too ill to go to the hospital but his wife went by ambulance and he collected them by car the next day, but did not get out of the car. He said that on 12 April (Easter Day) he was well enough to return to London. He continued that he drove the family to the town of [[Barnard Castle]] (30 miles away) to assess whether he was well enough to drive, as his wife was concerned that the disease had affected his eyesight.<ref name=itv_20200525>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-25/dominic-cummings-public-statement/ |title=Dominic Cummings: 'I don't regret what I did' |date=25 May 2020 |work=ITV News}}</ref> He said they then returned to London the next day.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Ford |first1=Richard |last2=Hamilton |first2=Fiona |date=25 May 2020 |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dominic-cummings-feverish-days-and-boris-johnsons-closest-adviser-is-not-out-of-the-woods-snq0vb7wv |title=Feverish days and PM's closest adviser is not out of the woods |page=4 |work=The Times}}</ref>

The [[BBC]] reported on 13 November 2020 that following the decision of Cummings' long-time ally [[Lee Cain]], [[Downing Street Director of Communications]], to stand down, Cummings was expected to leave Downing Street by the end of 2020.

==Political views==
Cummings has described his political views as "not Tory (Conservative), libertarian, 'populist' or anything else".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cummings-insight/an-archetypal-rebel-how-johnsons-chief-adviser-is-driving-brexit-idUKKCN1UY0ML|work=[[Reuters]]|title=An archetypal rebel – how Johnson's chief adviser is driving Brexit|last=Piper|first=Elizabeth|date=8 August 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

In January 2016, five months prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] in the United Kingdom, Cummings said:
{{quote|Extremists are on the rise in Europe and are being fuelled unfortunately by the Euro project and by the centralisation of power in Brussels. It is increasingly important that Britain offers an example of civilised, democratic, liberal self-government.<ref name="interview"/>}}

At an [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] conference in 2017, Cummings stated his belief that the EU, rather than solving issues, was fuelling radicalism and extremism due to a perceived lack of control over issues such as economy and immigration:
{{quote|For me ... the worst-case scenario for Europe is a return to 1930s-style protectionism and extremism. And to me the EU project, the Eurozone project, are driving the growth of extremism. The single most important reason, really, for why I wanted to get out of the EU is I think that it will drain the poison of a lot of political debates ...
