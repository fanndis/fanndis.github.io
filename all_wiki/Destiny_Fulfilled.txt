'''''Destiny Fulfilled''''' is the fifth and final [[studio album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] trio [[Destiny's Child]]. It was released on November 16, 2004, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Sony Urban Music]]. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] as well as several new producers.

For the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and [[ballad]]s that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among [[music journalism|music critics]] who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.

As part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. ''Destiny Fulfilled'' spawned four singles—the [[lead single]] "[[Lose My Breath]]", "[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]", "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]" and "[[Cater 2 U]]". After the tour, the group disbanded.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be. Women can get along and be businesswomen and be smart and not be catty all the time."

While recording their third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' in late 2000, [[Beyoncé]] announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group.<ref>{{cite news|last=VanHorn|first=Teri|title=Destiny's Child Solo CDs Won't Compete With Group, Each Other|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1375037/destinys-child-solo-cds-wont-compete-with-group-each-other/|publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks|date=2000-12-08|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyoncé's father, [[Mathew Knowles]]. [[Kelly Rowland]] further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child has been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to "give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute".<ref name="CNN" /> During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would return to the studio in fall 2003 to start with the work on a new album.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news|title=Kelly Rowland pursues her own destiny|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/23/mroom.rowland/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]].

Two members of the group, Beyoncé and Rowland each released one album, while [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyoncé's had been regarded as the most successful with the release of ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.<ref name="MossReunited">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml |title=Destiny's Child: Reunited And It Fells So Good |last=Moss |first=Corey |publisher=[[MTV News]].

After this album, the group planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their solo careers. Beyoncé has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album ''Destiny Fulfilled'' was not a coincidence.<ref name="VineyardSplit">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504619/20050623/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child Talk Split: 'It's Not The End' |last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=2005-06-23|publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Beyoncé has said that "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" with the album before adding: "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.".<ref name="Cohen">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62619/destinys-child-to-split-after-fall-tour|title=Destiny's Child To Split After Fall Tour|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=2005-06-12|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> Rowland commented: "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.'

The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move."<ref name="Benson"/>

== Production and recording ==
Production of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including [[Rockwilder]], [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks.<ref name="MossReunited" /> Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album ''Dangerously in Love'', concerned how he would manage the production, saying, "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?".<ref name="VineyardSplit"/> He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process "natural".<ref name="VineyardSplit"/> The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quality time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.<ref name="VineyardSplit"/>

Differing from ''Survivor'' in that previously Beyoncé had taken an active role in writing and producing, ''Destiny Fulfilled'' saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'.<ref name="MossReunited" /> In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in ''Destiny Fulfilled'', their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.<ref name="MossReunited" /> Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated "We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance."<ref name="MossReunited" /> As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: "All of us have been in three different places&nbsp;... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record."<ref name="MossShut">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1489338/destinys-child-back-in-the-studio-so-shut-up-kelly-rowland-says/|title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

== Composition ==
During an interview with [[MTV]], Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, "[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be."<ref name="VineyardSplit"/> For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by [[The Emotions]], [[Jodeci]] and [[SWV]] mixing elements of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493304/beyonce-salutes-jay-z-on-destinys-child-track-soldier/|title=Beyonce Salutes Jay-Z On Destiny's Child Track 'Soldier'|publisher=MTV News.

== Disbandment ==
In a visit at the [[Palau Sant Jordi]] in Barcelona, Spain on July 11, 2005, Rowland announced before 16,000 spectators that Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It would be Destiny's Child last tour together, revealing their formal disbandment.<ref name="KaufSplit">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503975/20050612/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child Announce Split|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=2005-06-12|publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> After their final North American leg, the group parted ways.<ref name="KaufFame"/> In a statement released to [[MTV]], the band said that the tour had provided them the opportunity to depart from Destiny's Child on a "high note".<ref name="KaufSplit"/> They also talked about the moment when the group started their musical endeavor and their realizations of pursuing individual careers after working together for several years. Destiny's Child thanked fans for their support while not closing the chance of seeing them continuing each member's goals in music, film, and television.<ref name="KaufSplit"/> In another interview they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of the album. While in the studio, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. Rowland revealed that they wanted to break up while they were still successful and "friends [with each other]".<ref name="VineyardSplit"/> Beyoncé, however, emphasized that ''Destiny Fulfilled'' would not be their last album and disclosed the idea of a possible reunion.
