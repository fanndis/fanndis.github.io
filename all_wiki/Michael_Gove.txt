'''Michael Andrew Gove''' ({{IPAc-en|g|o:|v|}}; born '''Graeme Andrew Logan'''; 26 August 1967) is a British politician and former journalist serving as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] since 2019 and [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] since 2020. He has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] since 2005. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he served as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] from 2010 to 2014, [[Chief Whip]] from 2014 to 2015, [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] from 2015 to 2016 and [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] from 2017 to 2019. He has twice run to become [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]], in [[2016 Conservative Party leadership election|2016]] and [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|2019]], finishing in third place on both occasions.

Born in [[Aberdeen]], Gove was in care until being adopted aged four months old, after which he was raised in the [[Kittybrewster]] area of the city. He attended the independent [[Robert Gordon's College]] and studied English at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]]. He then began a career as a journalist at [[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|''The Press and Journal'']] before having a long tenure as lead writer at ''[[The Times]]''. Elected for [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], he was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron|Shadow Cabinet]] by [[David Cameron]] in 2007 as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Education|Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]].

Appointed [[Secretary of State for Education]] in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], Gove terminated the previous Labour government's [[Building Schools for the Future]] programme; reformed [[A-Level]] and [[GCSE]] qualifications, abolishing modular units and coursework in most subjects, in favour of final [[examinations]], and responded to the [[Trojan Horse scandal]]. The [[National Association of Head Teachers]], the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]], the [[National Union of Teachers]] and the [[NASUWT]] passed motions of no confidence in his policies at their conferences in 2013. In [[2014 United Kingdom Cabinet reshuffle|a 2014 Cabinet reshuffle]], he was moved to the post of [[Chief Whip#United Kingdom|Chief Whip]]. Following the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] and the formation of the [[Second Cameron ministry|majority Cameron government]], Gove was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] and [[Lord Chancellor]].

In 2016, Gove played a major role in the UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on EU membership]] as the co-convenor of [[Vote Leave]]. Along with fellow Conservative MP [[Boris Johnson]], Gove was seen as one of the most prominent figures of the Vote Leave campaign. In June 2016, Gove, who was campaign manager for Johnson's Conservative leadership campaign, withdrew his support on the morning Johnson was due to declare, and announced his own candidacy in the [[2016 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]], finishing third behind [[Theresa May]] and [[Andrea Leadsom]]. Following May’s appointment as Prime Minister, he was sacked from the Cabinet but was appointed to the [[Second May ministry|second May government]] as [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. He launched a second Conservative leadership bid in 2019 although eventually came third behind Johnson and [[Jeremy Hunt]]. Upon the appointment of Johnson as Prime Minister, Gove was appointed [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with responsibilities including preparations for a [[no-deal Brexit]]. He took on the additional role of [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] in the [[2020 British cabinet reshuffle|cabinet reshuffle post-Brexit]].

With the formation of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government]] following the hung parliament after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Gove became [[Secretary of State for Education]]. His first moves included reorganising his department,<ref>{{cite news |title= Department for Education returns in coalition rebrand |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8679749.stm |accessdate=27 October 2013 |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2010 }}</ref> announcing plans to allow schools rated as Outstanding by [[Ofsted]] to become [[Academy (English school)|academies]],<ref>{{cite news |last= Harrison |first= Angela |date=26 May 2010 |title= Schools are promised an academies 'revolution' |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10159448 |accessdate= 27 October 2013 |work= BBC News}}</ref> and cutting the previous government's school-building programme.<ref>{{cite news |last= Richardson |first= Hannah |date=5 July 2010 |title= School buildings scheme scrapped |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10514113 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |work=BBC News}}</ref> He apologised, however, when the list of terminated school-building projects he had released was found to be inaccurate; the list was reannounced several times before it was finally accurately published.<ref>{{cite news |title= Gove apologises over school building list errors |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10538754 |accessdate= 27 October 2013 |work= BBC News |date=7 July 2010}}</ref>

In July 2010, Gove said that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] had failed in their attempt to break the link between [[social class]] and school achievement despite spending billions of pounds: quoting research, he indicated that by the age of six years, children of low ability from affluent homes were still out-performing brighter children from poorer backgrounds. At a House of Commons [[Education Select Committee]] he said that this separation of achievement grew larger throughout pupils' school careers, stating, "In effect, rich thick kids do better than poor clever children when they arrive at school [and] the situation as they go through gets worse".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7914719/Rich-thick-kids-do-better-at-school-says-Gove.html |first=Graeme |last=Paton |title= 'Rich thick kids' do better at school, says Gove |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2010}}</ref>

In March 2011, Gove was criticised for not understanding the importance of school architecture and accused of having misrepresented the cost.<ref name=guard>{{Cite news |last= Moore |first= Rowan |date=6 March 2011 |title= Architects do matter, Mr Gove |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/06/michael-gove-architecture-in-schools |accessdate=27 October 2013 |newspaper= [[The Observer]]}}</ref> In February 2011, he told parliament that one individual made £1,000,000 in one year when the true figure was £700,000 for five advisers at different times over a four-year period.<ref name=guard/>

During the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that the [[National Curriculum for England|primary and secondary-school national curricula]] for England would be restructured, and that study of authors such as [[Byron]], [[Keats]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] would be reinstated in English lessons as part of a plan to improve children's grasp of [[English literature]] and [[English language|language]]. [[Academy (English school)|Academies]] were not required to follow the national curriculum, and so weren't affected by the reforms. Children who failed to write coherently and grammatically, or who were weak in spelling, were penalised in the new examinations. Standards in mathematics and science were also strengthened.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8043872/Conservative-Part-Conference-schoolchildren-ignorant-of-the-past-says-Gove.html |title=Conservative Party Conference: schoolchildren 'ignorant of the past', says Gove |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |first=Graeme |last=Paton}}</ref>

Gove was criticised by teachers unions for his attempts to overhaul English education. At the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] (ATL) Annual Conference in March 2013 a motion of no-confidence in Gove was passed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Teachers Pass No Confidence Vote In Gove|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1069526/teachers-pass-no-confidence-vote-in-gove|accessdate=27 October 2013|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=25 March 2013}}</ref> The next month the [[National Union of Teachers]] (NUT) passed a vote of no confidence in Gove at their annual conference and called for his resignation.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/02/nut-no-confidence-michael-gove |title=NUT passes unanimous vote of no confidence in Michael Gove |last=Shepherd |first=Jessica |date=2 April 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London |access-date=25 October 2019 }}</ref> The [[National Association of Head Teachers]] and [[NASUWT]] also passed motions of no confidence at their conferences that year.<ref name="bbc18may13">{{cite news|date=18 May 2013|title=Michael Gove heckled at head teachers' conference in Birmingham|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22558756|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="gran2apr13">{{cite news|last=Shepherd|first=Jessica|date=2 April 2013|title=NUT passes unanimous vote of no confidence in Michael Gove|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/02/nut-no-confidence-michael-gove|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Chief Whip of the House of Commons (2014–2015) ===
On 15 July 2014, Gove's four-year stint in charge of the Department for Education came to an end when he was replaced as Secretary of State for Education by former Treasury Minister [[Nicky Morgan]] in [[2014 British cabinet reshuffle|a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle]].

The position came with a £30,000 pay cut, and a specific media role saw Gove on television and radio "more than a traditional Chief Whip would be".<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10970261/Michael-Gove-was-prepping-for-Whips-role-for-days-his-wife-says.html |title=Michael Gove was prepping for Chief Whip role for days, says his wife |last=Graham |first=Georgia |date=16 July 2014 |access-date=4 September 2019 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London }}</ref> He missed his first House of Commons vote in the new role, as explained by Shadow Commons Leader [[Angela Eagle]]; "Gove not only lost his first vote but managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/michael-gove-gets-stuck-in-commons-toilet-on-first-day-in-new-job-as-chief-whip-9612203.html|title=Michael Gove 'gets stuck in Commons toilet' on first day in new job as Chief Whip|date=17 July 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=4 September 2019|last=Withnall|first=Adam}}</ref> Gove remained in the post of Chief Whip until May 2015, when the role was taken over by [[Mark Harper]].

=== Secretary of State for Justice (2015–2016) ===
After the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] promoted Gove as [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] in his newly formed [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Gove moves to justice in post-election reshuffle|date=10 May 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32679004|work=BBC News}}</ref> He was praised in December 2015 for scrapping the courts fee introduced by his predecessor, [[Chris Grayling]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tax-on-justice-michael-gove-scraps-criminal-courts-charges-after-independent-campaign-a6758616.html |title=Tax on justice: Michael Gove scraps criminal courts charges after Independent campaign|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=4 December 2015|newspaper=The Independent|last=Dugan|first=Emily|last2=Wright|first2=Oliver}}</ref> The fee had been heavily criticised for, among other things, causing innocent people to plead guilty out of financial concerns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/court-charges-could-put-pressure-on-defendants-to-plead-guilty-claim-judges-a6736906.html|title=Court charges could put pressure on defendants to plead guilty, claim judges|date=16 November 2015|newspaper=The Independent|last=Cooper|first=Charlie}}</ref> Gove removed the 12-book limit on prison books introduced by Grayling, arguing that books increased literacy and numeracy, skills needed for making prisoners a "potential asset to society". The move, effective from September 2015, was welcomed by Frances Cook of the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33497581|title=Prisoner book restrictions scrapped by Michael Gove|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2015|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Gove was also praised for his prominent role in scrapping a British bid for a Saudi prison contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/uk-ditches-plan-to-bid-for-saudi-arabia-prisons-contract|title=UK ditches plan to bid for £5.9m Saudi Arabia prisons contract|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=6 December 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|last2=Travis|first2=Alan}}</ref>

=== European Union membership referendum (2016) ===
Gove was a prominent figure in the [[Vote Leave|campaign for Britain to leave the EU]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] and described his decision to take that side as "the most difficult decision of my political life".<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title='Brexit' Campaign Leaders|url=https://graphics.wsj.com/embeddable-carousel/?slug=ukpolitics0626|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 October 2019|website=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref name="bbcbrexit">{{cite news|title=UK 'better off' out of EU – Michael Gove|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35617843|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=20 February 2016|title=Michael Gove's 1,500-word essay on why he wants Britain to leave the EU|work=The Independent|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-michael-goves-full-statement-on-why-he-is-backing-brexit-a6886221.html}}</ref> He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at [[Chequers]] where, according to [[Craig Oliver (British journalist)|Craig Oliver]], Cameron was under the impression that Gove would support remaining in the EU.{{sfn|Oliver|2016|p=52}} He argued Britain would be "freer, fairer and better off" for leaving.<ref name="bbcbrexit" /> When in an interview it was claimed that there was no expert opinion to support this, Gove remarked that "the people of this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong."<ref name=Newsweek>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/michael-gove-sky-news-brexit-economics-imf-466365|title=Brexit campaigner Michael Gove says he's 'glad' big economic bodies don't back Brexit|first=Josh Lowe On 6/3/16 at 5:59 PM|last=EDT|date=3 June 2016|website=Newsweek}}</ref> However, interviewer [[Faisal Islam]] interrupted Gove after the word "experts",<ref name=GuGoveInt>{{cite AV media

In December 2016 Gove repeated the controversial [[Vote Leave]] claim that an additional £350&nbsp;million a week could be spent on the NHS when Britain left the EU but said it was up to the Government to decide how to spend it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/28/brexit-campaigner-michael-gove-defends-nhs-funding-pledge|title=Brexit campaigner Michael Gove defends NHS funding pledge |first=Rowena |last=Mason |work=The Guardian|date=28 December 2016|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>

In his memoir ''[[For the Record (book)|For the Record]]'', [[David Cameron]] described Gove during this period as "mendacious", adding: "One quality shone through, disloyalty.

In the aftermath of the referendum, Gove was accused by [[Nick Clegg]] of being the source of a claim by [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] that Queen [[Elizabeth II]] made comments supportive of Brexit in a private lunch at [[Windsor Castle]].

===Conservative Party leadership candidate (2016)===
After [[David Cameron]] announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister, with his successor now likely to be in office by September 2016, Gove was not a candidate, having said in the past that he had no interest in becoming Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/06/michael-gove-rules-out-running-for-tory-leader-and-says-his-frie|title=Michael Gove rules out running for Tory leader and says his friendship with David Cameron will survive the referendum |accessdate=30 June 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=6 May 2016 |last1=Dominiczak |first1=Peter }}</ref> Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of [[Boris Johnson]] for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and announced his own candidacy in [[2016 Conservative Party leadership election|the leadership election]]. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672591|title=Boris Johnson rules himself out of Conservative leader race|accessdate=30 June 2016|work=BBC News|date=30 June 2016}}</ref>

Gove said: "I wanted to help build a team behind [[Boris Johnson]] so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. I have, therefore, decided to put my name forward for the leadership. I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take. Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it.

By 5 July 2016, Gove was in third place in the leadership election, behind [[Theresa May]] and [[Andrea Leadsom]]; the latter had gained an endorsement from Boris Johnson.

=== Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2017–2019) ===
In May 2016, Gove voted not to reduce the permitted carbon dioxide emission rate of new homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11858/michael_gove/surrey_heath/divisions?policy=1030|title=Michael Gove – Environment|last=MP for Surrey Heath|first=Hansard|date=|website=TheyWorkForYou|archive-url=|archivedate=|url-status=|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>

After his appointment, Gove announced that a microbead ban would be put into place by the end of 2017. The ban arrived in early 2018. It meant that manufacturers could no longer produce the tiny beads used in cosmetics and care products. Another ban came in June 2018 which stopped shops from selling products that contained the beads. The reasoning behind the ban was to stop the beads harming marine life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-microbeads-ban-comes-into-force|title=World leading microbeads ban comes into force|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2017 after being appointed to Environment Secretary, Gove announced that a fuel combustion vehicle ban will be put into place due to air pollution. He said that the ban would take effect by 2040 and end the sales of new fuel combustion cars, trucks, vans, and buses that have petrol and diesel engines in the UK. The ban does not include plug-in hybrid vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-autos-idUSKBN1AB0U5|title=Electric cars win?

In March 2019, Gove argued that "we didn't vote to leave without a deal. That wasn't the message of the campaign I helped lead.

==Controversies==

===Expenses claims===

Over a five-month period between December 2005 and April 2006, Gove claimed more than £7,000 on a house bought with his wife [[Sarah Vine]], in 2002. Around a third of the money was spent at [[OKA Direct|OKA]], an upmarket interior design company established by Viscountess Astor, PM [[David Cameron]]'s mother-in-law.<ref name=Telegraph>{{Cite news|last=Hope|first=Christopher|date=11 May 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5305434/Michael-Gove-flipped-homes-MPs-expenses.html|title=Michael Gove 'flipped' homes: MPs' expenses|work=The Telegraph|access-date=18 July 2014}}</ref> Shortly afterwards he reportedly '[[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal#Areas of abuse|flipped]]' his designated second home, a property for which he claimed around £13,000 to cover stamp duty.<ref name=Telegraph/> Gove also claimed for a cot mattress, despite children's items being banned under updated Commons rules.

=== Freedom of Information and email ===
During the [[Cameron–Clegg ministry]], Gove was the subject of repeated criticism for alleged attempts to avoid the provisions of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]. The criticism surrounds Gove's use of various private email accounts to send emails that allegedly relate to his departmental responsibilities. The allegations suggest that Gove and his advisers believed they could avoid their correspondence being subject to Freedom of Information requests, as they believed that their private email accounts were not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. In September 2011, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Gove had used an undisclosed private email account – called ‘Mrs Blurt’ – to discuss government business with advisers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ensor |first=Josie |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8775646/Michael-Gove-faces-questions-over-use-of-private-email.html |title=Michael Gove faces questions over use of private email |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=25 August 2012 |date=20 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Vasagar |first=Jeevan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/02/michael-gove-email-private-account |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Michael Gove aides accused of deleting government correspondence | date=2 March 2012|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>

In March 2012 the Information Commissioner ruled that because emails the ''Financial Times'' had requested contained public information they could be the subject of a Freedom of Information request and ordered the information requested by the paper to be disclosed.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Smith|first=Graham|title=Decision Notice|url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2012/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2012/fs_50422276.ashx|publisher=Information Commissioner's Office|date=1 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306035417/http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2012/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2012/fs_50422276.ashx|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17235168|title=Michael Gove loses 'private email' battle|work=BBC News|date=2 March 2012}}</ref> Gove was also advised to cease the practice of using private email accounts to conduct government business.

It was also alleged by the ''Financial Times'' that Gove and his advisors had destroyed email correspondence in order to avoid [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] requests.

Some of Gove's key points were rebuffed by the academics that Gove had used to support his thesis. Gove had criticised Cambridge professor [[Richard J.

Instead he urged people to listen to [[Margaret MacMillan]] of [[Oxford University]]. MacMillan responded, saying: "I agree with some of what Mr Gove says, but he is mistaking myths for rival interpretations of history.

=== Dominic Cummings ===

In May 2020 Gove was criticised{{by whom|date=July 2020}} after defending [[Dominic Cummings]] for making a 260-mile trip to Durham with his wife who was ill with COVID-19 at the time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=Ian |title=Michael Gove blasted for tweet defending Dominic Cummings |url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/michael-gove-blasted-tweet-defending-18302627 |accessdate=24 May 2020 |work=getsurrey |date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

== Political stances ==
Gove is generally considered as combining socially liberal views — for example, on [[gay marriage]]<ref>{{cite news |title = Here's where all the Tory candidates stand on LGBT rights |url = http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/06/30/heres-where-all-the-tory-pm-candidates-stand-on-lgbt-rights/  |newspaper = Pink News |date = 30 June 2016 |accessdate =11 June 2017 |quote = He was one of just 29 Conservative MPs to vote in favour of Labour’s Equality Act in 2007.}}</ref> — with a harder [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] and [[neoconservative]] position on foreign affairs.<ref name = "FT interview"/> He has expressed his view that the state should generally not interfere in domestic affairs and attests to have campaigned for economic freedom in certain matters. Gove has argued that "the only sustainable ethical foundation for society is a belief in the innate worth and dignity of every individual."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{Cite news | last = McSmith | first = Andy | date = 27 September 2008 | title = Michael Gove: The modest moderniser | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-gove-the-modest-moderniser-944074.html | accessdate = 27 October 2013 | newspaper = [[The Independent]] }}</ref> 

Giving evidence before the [[Leveson Inquiry]] in May 2012, Gove said he was "unashamedly on the side of those who say that we should think very carefully before legislation and regulation because the cry 'Something must be done' often leads to people doing something which isn't always wise."<ref>{{cite web |title = Michael Gove, Leveson, and the case for liberty |url = http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/michael-gove-leveson-and-case-for.html |publisher = Archbishop Cranmer |date = 30 May 2012 |accessdate = 30 May 2012 |quote = some of us believe that before the case for regulation is made, the case for liberty needs to be asserted as well. |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120602062344/http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/michael-gove-leveson-and-case-for.html |archive-date = 2 June 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

During the 2008 Conservative Party Conference, Gove argued that [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century philosopher who commented on [[organic society]] and the [[French Revolution]], was the greatest [[conservative]] ever. When asked about those who believe "Marx was right all along", he responded that they were guilty of ignoring the systematic abuses and poverty of centrally planned economies, and criticised the historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], saying that "only when Hobsbawm weeps hot tears for a life spent serving an ideology of wickedness will he ever be worth listening to."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/michael_gove/article5019248.ece |newspaper=The Times |title=When you're in a hole, don't dig any new ones |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |first=Michael |last=Gove |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In remarks prepared for the 2020 [[Ditchley Foundation|Ditchley Lecture]], Gove portrayed what he saw as the malaise of modern society as leading to populism, because the non-intellectual classes "chose to opt for polarised identity politics rather than stay with broad-based national political movements" instead of choosing to follow the politics of diversity, inclusion and identity politics they were force-fed by the elites. He praised [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as a model for his renewal of [[capitalism]] and he imagined the construction of inclusive societies with the deconstruction of [[Whitehall]]. Gove stressed "basic writing, meeting chairing and time management skills" for all policy civil servants. He ended with a paean to his purpose in public service: "to tackle inequality".<ref name="tnsp">{{cite news |last1=Gove |first1=Michael |title="The privilege of public service": Michael Gove's Ditchley Lecture – full text |url= https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/privilege-public-service-michael-gove-s-ditchley-lecture-full-text |newspaper= New Statesman |location= London |date=28 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="ssowe">{{cite news |last1=Speer |first1=Sean |title=Opposition to WE Charity shows Tories lack a basic theory of statecraft |url= https://nationalpost.com/opinion/sean-speer-opposition-to-we-charity-shows-tories-lack-a-basic-theory-of-statecraft |newspaper=National Post |location= Toronto |date=3 July 2020}}</ref>

=== Capital punishment ===
In 1997, Gove wrote in support of the restoration of hanging as [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]], which was abolished in the UK in 1965. Gove argued in ''[[The Times]]'' that "Were I ever alone in the dock I would not want to be arraigned before our flawed tribunals, knowing my freedom could be forfeited as a result of political pressures. I would prefer a fair trial, under the shadow of the noose."<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11595776/Michael-Gove-new-Justice-Secretary-wanted-to-bring-back-hanging.html |title=Michael Gove, new Justice Secretary, wanted to bring back hanging |newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
The ''Financial Times'' describes Gove as having "strong neoconservative convictions".<ref name = "FT interview"/>

In 2003, he stated that he did not believe the United States' "current position in the world [was] analogous to that of an Imperial power, as we have come to understand imperial powers".<ref name="LibInt discussion">{{cite web|last=Gove|first=Michael|date=26 July 2003|title=Liberal Intervention: The Empire's New Clothes?|url=http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/160.pdf|publisher=Panel discussion sponsored by the [[Foreign Policy Centre]] and [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]|accessdate=12 February 2012|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191250/http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/160.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>

====Iraq====
Gove proposed that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] would bring peace and democracy both to Iraq and the wider Middle East.{{cn|date=July 2020}} In December 2008, he wrote that declarations of either victory or defeat in Iraq in 2003 were premature, and that the [[liberation of Iraq]] was a foreign policy success.

{{quote|The liberation of Iraq has actually been that rarest of things – a proper British foreign policy success.

====Saudi Arabian prisons====
In 2015, Gove cancelled a £5.9 million contract to provide services for prisons in [[Saudi Arabia]], according to ''[[The Guardian]]'', because it was thought "the British government should not be assisting a regime that uses beheadings, stoning, crucifixions and lashings as forms of punishment." Foreign Secretary [[Philip Hammond]] was reported{{by whom|date=October 2017}} to have accused Gove of being naive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/13/saudi-prisons-contract-gove-and-hammond-clash-over-deal|title= Saudi prisons contract: Gove and Hammond clash over deal|work=The Guardian|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, Gove was behind plans to provide schools throughout England and Wales with a copy of the [[King James Bible]] (inscribed "presented by the Secretary of State for Education") to celebrate the 400th anniversary of its translation into English, though he said he backed the scheme because of the historical and cultural significance of that translation rather than on purely religious grounds.<ref name="Indy-kjb">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/michael-gove-defends-school-bibles-scheme-7788925.html|title=Michael Gove defends school Bibles scheme|last=Hughes|first=David|date=25 May 2012|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=27 October 2013|location=London}}</ref><ref name="guardiankingjames">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/17/michael-gove-king-james-bible|title=And lo!

In 2013, while noting the singing of the "deliberately anti-Catholic rant" (the [[Famine Song]] at [[Old Firm|Rangers-Celtic matches]]) Gove credited Cardinal [[Keith O'Brien]] with using his intellect to protect the vulnerable in Scotland whilst regretting the absence of a similar figure in the Kirk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/michael-gove-flabby-kirk-needs-to-regain-its-moral-might-1-1300849|title=Flabby Kirk needs to regain its moral might|last=Gove|first=Michael|date=1 November 2008|newspaper=The Scotsman|accessdate=27 October 2013|location=Edinburgh}}</ref>

In April 2015, he described his faith in an article for [[The Spectator|''The Spectator'' magazine]].
