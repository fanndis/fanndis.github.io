==Meteorological history==
[[File:NWS-NOAA Europe Total Percipitation MAY 11-17, 2014.png|thumb|left|Total precipitation between 11 and 17 May]]

On 13 May, a  [[low-pressure area]] formed over the Adriatic Sea, as polar air from Central Europe penetrated into the Mediterranean basin. The cold polar air mass met with humid subtropical air, leading to very low pressure. On 14 May, the low moved over the Balkans, becoming stationary. As a result, extremely heavy rain fell within the region; Serbia (in the area around Belgrade) and Bosnia were most affected.<ref>{{cite news|last=Herold|first=Christian|title=Thema des Tages: 16 Mai 2014, Die wilde "Yvette" sorgt für schwere Unwetter im südöstlichen Europa|newspaper=German Weather Service|date=16 May 2014}}</ref> Serbian and Bosnian meteorologists named the formed [[cyclone]] "Tamara".<ref>{{cite news|title=TAMARA HARA SRBIJOM: Meteorolozi dali ime ciklonu koji nas je potopio!|url=http://www.kurir-info.rs/tamara-hara-srbijom-meteorolozi-dali-ime-ciklonu-koji-nas-je-potopio-clanak-1368603|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=Kurir|date=2014-05-15|language=sr}}</ref><ref name=tamara>{{cite news|title=Ode "Tamara"!|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/466212/Ode-Tamara|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=Blic|date=18 May 2014|language=sr}}</ref> On 15 May, the daily amounts of rainfall broke historical records in Belgrade (107.9&nbsp;mm), [[Valjevo]] (108.2&nbsp;mm) and [[Loznica]] (110&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/1070475-rekord-u-beogradu-valjevu-i-loznici-pale-najobilnije-kise-u-istoriji |title=REKORD: U Beogradu, Valjevu i Loznici pale najobilnije kiše u istoriji! |publisher=Telegraf |date=15 May 2014 |accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> By 15 May, the monthly rainfall in Belgrade had broken the historical record (175&nbsp;l from 1897), reaching 205&nbsp;l.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oboren rekord, više kiše nego ikad|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&mm=05&dd=15&nav_category=12&nav_id=848243|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=15 May 2014|agency=B92|language=sr}}</ref> By Saturday, May 17, the rain had subsided, and the weather gradually became warmer and sunnier, somewhat easing relief and rescue efforts.

[[File:BosniaSerbiaflood.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Severe flooding in the Balkans seen by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on [[NASA]]'s Aqua satellite, 19 May 2014.]]
The main flooding region was the watershed of the [[Sava]] river, which forms a border between Bosnia and Croatia, flows into Serbia, and drains into the Danube in Belgrade. On Wednesday, 14 May, heavy rainfall caused [[torrent (stream)|torrential]] floods across mountainous regions, which destroyed bridges and infrastructure, and caused numerous [[landslide]]s. The deadliest impact occurred on Thursday, 15 May, when water levels in several right-bank tributaries of the Sava suddenly and uncontrollably rose at an unprecedented rate, flooding towns in their valleys. The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river in central Bosnia completely flooded the cities of [[Doboj]], [[Maglaj]], [[Zavidovići]] and [[Šamac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Šamac]], while the [[Kolubara]], near Belgrade, did the same to [[Obrenovac]]; those cities had the major share of victims. Subsequently, the Sava itself rose to record-high levels, threatening the cities of [[Slavonski Brod]], [[Šabac]] and [[Sremska Mitrovica]] and numerous villages, but the damage was relatively contained as the population, helped by army and volunteers, strengthened [[flood control|flood defenses]]. Nonetheless, [[levee|embankments]] gave way in several places.

Heavy rainfall was also experienced in the region on 3 and 4 May, affecting Romania, Italy and Bosnia. The event produced limited damage but left a number of flooding incidents and high rivers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Southeast Europe Flooding|url=http://www.rms.com/Catastrophe/Catupdates/CatSummary?event_id=4232|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=RMS|date=5 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527071620/http://www.rms.com/Catastrophe/Catupdates/CatSummary?event_id=4232|archive-date=27 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> A state of emergency was declared in parts of Bosnia by local government.

==Hydrology==
Though heaviest affected areas were in the valleys of the Sava and Kolubara rivers, the center of the flood was the drainage basin of the Bosna river and its mouth into the Sava. Water in the Sava then broke through the newly constructed embankment on the left bank in Croatia and flooded the Lower [[Syrmia]] region. The water then uncontrollably rushed into the [[Bosut river]] which flows back into the Sava in Serbia. In Serbia, the heaviest floods were in the Kolubara river basin where the major rainfall caused extreme torrents in the mountains, causing the hydrological coincidence, a fact that high tidal waves appeared simultaneously on both the left and the right tributaries of the Kolubara. Rivers of Peštan and Vraničina also spilled over, flooding the [[surface mine]] "Tamnava-Zapadna Polje", within the [[RB Kolubara|Kolubara mines]] (see [[Paljuvi#Lake Paljuvi|Lake Paljuvi]]). The flooded mines captured 200 million m3 of the flood water.<ref name=Politika>{{ citation | author = Stevan Prohaska, "Jaroslav Černi Institute" | title = Ugroženost of poplava | trans-title = Flood threats | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 26 | language = sr | date = 12 December 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/394310/Pogledi/Ugrozenost-od-poplava}}</ref>

Belgrade's Institute "Jaroslav Černi", funded by [[UNDP]], compiled a study "Improvement of the water protection in the Kolubara drainage basin". Hydrological section of the report concludes that the cyclone caused the "continual rain of temperate intensity", which however lasted for too long (over three days). In May, the measured 48-hours rainfall was higher than the millennial rains in Loznica while the [[return period]] in Belgrade and Valjevo was 400 years. Return periods of the flow in the Kolubara was 120–520 and at the confluence into the Sava, when the Kolubara flooded Obrenovac and the mines, the discharge was {{convert|1.456|m3/s|abbr=on}}. If the system against the floods was finished and functioning properly, and that mines and Obrenovac weren't flooded, the discharge would be {{convert|2.460|m3/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Politika/>

In the drainage basin of the Bosna river in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rains in some places were exceeding the return period of 5,000 years (Vidmar A., et al., "The Bosna River floods in May 2014", Journal on Flood Risk, p.&nbsp;1–25). At the same time, during the massive overspill in the basin, the return period of the maximal discharge ({{convert|4.121|m3/s|abbr=on}}, 15 May 2014) was only 152 years and of the wave volume ({{convert|1,463,000,000|m3|abbr=on}}) was 189 years. After the reconstruction of the flood in the controlled environment, it was concluded that the discharge of the Bosna at Doboj would be {{convert|5.000|m3/s|abbr=on}} on 16 May 2014. A discharge of the Sava, right after the mouth of the Bosna, at the Šamac bridge, was {{convert|6.000|m3/s|abbr=on}} on 17 May (Abdulaj R., et al., ''{{lang|hr|Velike vode donjeg toka rijeke Save tijekom svibnja 2014}}'', {{lang|hr|Hrvatska vodoprivreda|italic=no}}, 207, 14–16, 2014). Downstream, in Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia, the discharge of the Sava was {{convert|6.420|m3/s|abbr=on}} (''{{lang|sr|Hidrološki godišnjak RHMZ Srbije za 2014}}'').<ref name=Politika/>

If the entire flood control system in all three countries functioned, and that there were no overspills and floods, a hydrological coincidence of joining the highest Sava and Kolubara water levels would occur. That means that in Belgrade, downstream from the mouth of Kolubara into the Sava, the Sava would bring almost {{convert|9.000|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The riparian zone along the Sava in Belgrade, called [[Savski Nasip]] and enhanced with the embankments, is deigned for receiving {{convert|6.500|m3/s|abbr=on}}, so the city would probably suffer a major damage. Additionally, due to the illegal construction of the houses in the Savski Nasip area, the riparian zone is being destroyed and its volume is reduced.<ref name=Politika/>

Officials say it may take 5 years for agriculture in the affected regions to recover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Floods deluge Balkan states|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/27475121|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> The managing director of the Kolubara coal field stated that it would take one year for the Tamnava pit to be dredged and dried, while the Veliki Crljeni pit would take around two months to be operational again. He has stated that the Tamnava pit is now an artificial lake. The Kolubara coal fields are open pits from which coal is supplied to the [[TPP Nikola Tesla]]. There are enough stockpiles of coal at hand to bridge the period until the coal pits are fully operational, but the delivery system needs repairs.<ref name="b92.net">[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2014&mm=05&dd=19&nav_id=850195 Godinu dana da se isuši kop Tamnava - B92.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid]] [[Kristalina Georgieva]] stated that Croatia and Serbia have the possibility to apply for aid from the [[European Union Solidarity Fund]], up to one billion euro in one year,<ref>{{cite news|last=Maksimović|first=Marina|title=EU obećala pomoć BiH, Srbiji i Hrvatskoj|url=http://www.dw.de/eu-obe%C4%87ala-pomo%C4%87-bih-srbiji-i-hrvatskoj/a-17646029|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=dw.de|date=20 May 2014|language=sr}}</ref> but this was later rescinded as a misstatement of the Commissioner. The EU Solidarity Fund in 2014 is 500 million euros, while individual countries can expect around 10 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=EU: Mnogo manje od milijarde za SRB|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&mm=05&dd=20&nav_category=1262&nav_id=850446|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=B92|date=20 May 2014|author=Tanjug|language=sr}}</ref> The aid can be transferred if the damage is assessed to be over 0.64% of the country's [[GDP]]. For Serbia, that would be around 175 million euros in damages. Bosnia, not being a candidate or member country of the EU, is not eligible for aid from this fund.

Serbia applied for the World Bank aid credit, amounting to a total of 227 million Euros.<ref>[http://mondo.rs/a716243/Info/Ekonomija/Od-obecanih-kredita-koristicemo-samo-dva.html Od obećanih kredita na donatorskoj konferenciji koristićemo samo dva? | Mondo Portal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
