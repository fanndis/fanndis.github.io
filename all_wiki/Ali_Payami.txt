'''Ali Payami''' is a Swedish record producer, songwriter, and [[Disc jockey|DJ]].<ref name=":billboard2017" /> With ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' by Taylor Swift he won a Grammy for [[Album of the Year (Grammy)|Album of the Year]].

He worked with [[Demi Lovato]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Ellie Goulding]] and [[Katy Perry]]. Payami's first number one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] was [[The Weeknd]]'s single "[[Can't Feel My Face]]".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://storytelling.di.se/max-martin-english/|title=Max Martin - world exclusive interview - Di Storytelling|date=11 February 2016|work=Di Storytelling|access-date=29 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Ali was first exposed to music in [[Malmö]], Sweden, when he was a child. At a young age he listened to many genres of music, ranging from [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[The Chronic]]'' to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name=":billboard2017" /> He watched people in bands rehearse and make music, which prompted him to develop interest in the same.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiojavan.com/podcasts/podcast/AliPayami-Interview|title=Ali Payami Interview Podcast (Jan 22, 2008)|website=Radio Javan|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref> This interest was reflected by his statement "When you play something and see people's reactions when they hear it... It really affected me."

Growing up, however, he became more interested in house music, siding away from the pop genre he was exposed to. This was evident from his words "...these guys were more into pop and mainstream, and I chose more house music..." in an interview. Payami didn't understand how to make music when he was younger. However, as years passed and new, better software became available for music production, he learnt the basics by watching others do so. Later, he bought the programs and started creating music himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ru.popularvideos.top/watch/Pr8rD9MkJP4|title=Polar Talks 2016 - From hip hop to pop: A talk with songwriter Ali Payami}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

Ali Payami then started DJing at school parties and in local clubs. He said “DJing played a big part in what I do now; the mentality of it and the love of both new and old music. When you play something and see people's reactions when they hear it... It really affected me.” in an interview with Billboard. While working in clubs, Payami had to get other jobs to support himself, including a short lived job as a telemarketer. He described this experience as "weird", stating “I loved DJing, but what I didn't like was being the center of attention.”<ref name=":billboard2017">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7728855/pop-songwriter-ali-payami-interview|title=Max Martin Collaborator Ali Payami Shares Stories of Writing Hits With Katy Perry & the Weeknd|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Beginnings ===
Ali Payami met Julius Petersson, then an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner/Chappel]], during the time he was DJing in clubs. This provided him a major opportunity at the time, as the public house gave him a cash advance. In Payami's words, "It allowed me to not have to work on anything else but music, so you can eat but also concentrate on what you want to do". Payami was also grateful to Julius and considered him a visionary, stating "Julius was such a visionary. He believed in not just me, but a lot of people who are very successful now."

Through Petersson, [[Max Martin]]'s brother-in-law, Payami was introduced to [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], a highly successful Swedish music producer. This eventually enabled Payami to collaborate with Max Martin. Payami commented on Martin, saying "He's not only amazing and talented the way everyone knows him, but he's also a great guy. It's not just music; you learn so much about life, how to collaborate with people, and how to be open and not let egos take over the room.”<ref name=":billboard2017" />

=== Rise to fame ===
Ali Payami's collaborations with Max Martin since 2014 have been an "ubiquitous part of the pop radio landscape", as described by ''Billboard''. His work on [[Ariana Grande]]'s song "[[Love Me Harder]]" was one of the first of such collaborations, on which Payami commented, "I remember sitting in a studio in L.A. and me and [Peter Svensson] were just playing around. A few days later, he showed me this voice note with a part of a melody that we had played, and we tried to recreate it. From there, the whole thing came together. [[Savan Kotecha|Savan]] came in with more melodies and lyrics, and then after that The Weeknd did his thing."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7728855/pop-songwriter-ali-payami-interview|title=Max Martin Collaborator Ali Payami Shares Stories of Writing Hits With Katy Perry & the Weeknd|work=Billboard|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

Ali Payami worked on [[The Weeknd]]'s song "[[Can't Feel My Face]]", which helped him settle himself as a popular pop artist. The song hit No.1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and obtained two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, for "Record of the Year" and "Best Pop Solo Performance". Payami said that it was a very simple song, and not "super advanced".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.popjustice.com/articles/savan-kotecha-interview-the-people-with-the-longest-careers-are-the-people-who-learn-how-to-do-it-on-purpose/|title=Savan Kotecha interview: The people with the longest careers are the people who learn how to do it on purpose|date=5 October 2015|work=Popjustice|access-date=29 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Max Martin, on Payami, jokingly commented that he was envious of him, who "listened to new music all the time"<ref name=":1" />

Payami has worked with [[Taylor Swift]], co-writing and co-producing "[[Style (Taylor Swift song)|Style]]" from her album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), and "[[...Ready for It?]]" from ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017).

Payami co-wrote and co-produced [[Katy Perry]]'s single "[[Chained to the Rhythm]]" from her album ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'' (2017).

Payami resides in Stockholm and works in [[Wolf Cousins]] Studio.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eliasson |first1=Fredrik |title=Bakom kulisserna på Max Martins nya hitfabrik |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=103&artikel=6149328 |website=Sveriges Radio |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=sv |date=24 April 2015}}</ref>
