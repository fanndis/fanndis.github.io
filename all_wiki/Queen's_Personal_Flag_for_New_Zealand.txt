The '''personal flag of [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth II]]''' in her role as [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]] was approved for use in 1962. It is used by the Queen only  when she is in [[New Zealand]] or attending an event abroad in her role as head of state in New Zealand. The Queen's Representative, the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] has their [[Flag of the Governor-General of New Zealand|own flag]].

==Background==
On 11 October 1962 the Queen announced the adoption of a special personal flag for use on her [[Monarchy in New Zealand#Royal presence|tour of New Zealand]] between 6–18 February 1963 and for use afterwards.

==Description==
[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_New_Zealand.svg|thumb| The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of the [[coat of arms of New Zealand]] serves as basis for the flag.]]

The flag follows the same basic pattern used by queen across several other realms since the 1960s: it is the escutcheon of a country's coat of arms (e.g. the [[Coat of arms of New Zealand|arms of New Zealand]]) in banner form defaced with a device taken from her personal flag (a blue roundel surrounded by a garland of roses encircling a crowned letter 'E', all in gold).

The flag is divided into four quadrants: The first quadrant includes depicts four stars as representative of the [[Crux|Southern Cross constellation]], as depicted on the [[Flag of New Zealand|national flag]]. The second quadrant consists of a golden [[wool|fleece]] on a red field. The third quadrant contains a golden [[wheat]] [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] on a red field. The final quadrant includes two crossed gold hammers on a blue field.

The central stripe consists of three [[ship]]s. Superimposed in the centre is a dark blue roundel bearing a Roman E surmounted by a Royal Crown within a chaplet of [[rose]]s, all gold-coloured, obscuring the centre ship.

The central blue disc is taken from the [[Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen's Personal Flag]], which is used by the Queen in relation to her role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

==Usage and protocol==
The flag is flown continuously on any building in which the Queen is in residence and by a ship transporting the Queen in New Zealand waters. It is also flown whilst the Queen is attending a state or public function, and it is to be seen above the saluting base at military parades and open air gatherings when she is present. It is also broken when the Queen sets foot on board one of [[Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship]]s.

When flown with the [[New Zealand Flag]], the Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand takes the position of honour.

The only occasions on which the Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand are flown in her absence are at parades in honour of Her Majesty's Official Birthday.

==Legal==
The flag is protected under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981, Section 12(1) states:
{{cquote|Every person commits an offence against this Act who, without the authority of Her Majesty or (as the case may require) the Governor-General, displays or exhibits or otherwise uses any representation to which this subsection applies in such a manner as to be likely to cause any person to believe that he does so under the authority, sanction, approval, appointment, or patronage of Her Majesty or the Governor-General.<ref>Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981, Section 12(1)</ref>}}

According to Section 12(2)(c), this applies to, among others, "any representation of the Royal Standard, or the Sovereign’s personal flag for New Zealand".<ref>Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981, Section 12(2)(c)</ref>

During the coronation ceremony of the monarch at Westminster Abbey, the "standards" of various countries are carried by various officials in the procession inside the abbey. These flags are the country's coat of arms as a [[banner of arms]]. For New Zealand, unlike [[Royal Standards of Canada|Canada]] and [[Royal Standard of Australia|Australia]], the banner remained the same for the [[Coronation of George V and Mary|King George V]], [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|King George VI]] and [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1911, 1937, and 1953, respectively.{{fact|date=August 2015}}. The banner was in a 3:4 ratio and without defacement.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1911-05-15|title=CORONATION STANDARDS.|pages=5|work=Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876 - 1954)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72278988|access-date=2020-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alfred Pearse (c.1854-1933) - Coronation of George V: Standard bearers|url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/923166/coronation-of-george-v-standard-bearers|access-date=2020-08-18|website=www.rct.uk|language=en}}</ref>
