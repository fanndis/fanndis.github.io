==Etymology==
The precise etymology of "Bhutan" is unknown, although it is likely to derive from the [[Old Tibetan|Tibetan]] [[endonym]] "Böd" for [[Tibet]]. Traditionally, it is taken to be a transcription of the [[Sanskrit]] ''Bhoṭa-anta'' "end of [[Tibet]]", a reference to Bhutan's position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture.<ref>{{cite book |title = A Cultural History of Bhutan |volume = 1 |first = Balaram |last = Chakravarti |publisher = Hilltop |year = 1979 |page = 7 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6VxuAAAAMAAJ |access-date = 18 October 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112111434/https://books.google.com/books?id=6VxuAAAAMAAJ |archive-date = 12 January 2016 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Names&Histories">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Isaac|url=https://archive.org/details/namesandtheirhi00taylgoog|title=Names and Their Histories: A Handbook of Historical Geography and Topographical Nomenclature|publisher=Gale Research Co.|year=1898|page=[https://archive.org/details/namesandtheirhi00taylgoog/page/n83 69]}}</ref><ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov">{{Cite book|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/|title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies|date=1993|publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]]|isbn=0-8444-0777-1|editor-last=Savada|editor-first=Andrea Matles|edition=3rd|location=Washington, D.C.|chapter=Origins and Early Settlement, A.D. 600–1600|oclc=27429416|postscript=. {{PD-notice}}}}</ref>

Since the 17th century, Bhutan's official name has been ''Druk yul'' (literally, "country of the [[Drukpa Lineage]]" or "the Land of the Thunder Dragon," a reference to the country's dominant Buddhist sect); "Bhutan" appears only in English-language official correspondence.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> The terms for the Kings of Bhutan, ''Druk Gyalpo'' ("Dragon King"), and the Bhutanese [[endonym]] ''Drukpa'', "Dragon people," are similarly derived.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bhutan/Government-and-society |title=Bhutan - Government and society |newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date= October 15, 2020}}</ref>

Names similar to Bhutan—including Bohtan, Buhtan, Bottanthis, Bottan and Bottanter—began to appear in Europe around the 1580s. [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]]'s 1676 ''Six Voyages'' is the first to record the name ''Boutan''. However, these names seem to have referred not to modern Bhutan but to the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Kingdom of Tibet]]. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into the Scottish explorer [[George Bogle (diplomat)|George Bogle]]'s 1774 expedition. Realizing the differences between the two regions, cultures, and states, his final report to the [[East India Company]] formally proposed calling the [[Druk Desi]]'s kingdom "Boutan" and the [[Panchen Lama]]'s kingdom "Tibet". The EIC's surveyor general [[James Rennell]] first [[anglicized]] the French name as "Bootan," and then popularized the distinction between it and [[Greater Tibet]].<ref name="Kuensel">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120216090138/http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_history_europe.php "History of Bhutan: How Europe heard about Bhutan"].

Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorized that the state of ''Lhomon'' (literally, "southern darkness"), or ''Monyul'' ("Dark Land", a reference to the [[Monpa people|Monpa]], an ethnic group in Bhutan & Arunachal Pradesh) may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600. The names ''Lhomon Tsendenjong'' ([[Sandalwood]] Country), and ''Lhomon Khashi'', or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.<ref name="WIAS">{{cite web |url = http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |title = Bhutan |publisher = World Institute for Asian Studies |date = 21 August 2006 |access-date = 23 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090801085158/http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |archive-date = 1 August 2009 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="CS0">{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Origins and Early Settlement, A.D. 600–1600|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>

Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital, [[Punakha]], in 1827. By the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronized by the various [[Mongols|Mongol]] warlords.

Bhutan may have been influenced by the Yuan dynasty with which it shares various cultural and religious similarities.

After the decline of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] by the 16th century.<ref name=CS1/><ref name=CS4>{{country study |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |year=1991 |section=Rivalry among the Sects |author=Worden, Robert L |pd=yes}}</ref>

Locally, Bhutan has been known by many names. The earliest Western record of Bhutan, the 1627 ''Relação'' of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]]s [[Estêvão Cacella]] and [[João Cabral]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bengala e o Reino do Dragão – 37|url=https://www.oclarim.com.mo/todas/bengala-e-o-reino-do-dragao-37/|website=O clarim}}</ref> records its name variously as ''Cambirasi'' (among the [[Koch Bihar]]is<ref>Cacella, Estêvão.

To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable ''[[dzong architecture|dzongs]]'' or fortresses, and [[promulgation|promulgated]] the [[Tsa Yig]], a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralized control.

They met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer.

When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, his passing was kept secret for 54 years. After a period of consolidation, Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict. In 1711 Bhutan went to war against the [[Raja]] of the kingdom of [[Koch Bihar]] in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714.<ref name=CS3>{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Administrative Integration and Conflict with Tibet, 1651–1728|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>

In the 18th century, the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar. In 1772, the [[Maharaja]] of Koch Bihar appealed to the British [[East India Company]] which assisted by ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the [[British India|British]] were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] (1864–65), a confrontation for control of the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After Bhutan lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British India]] and Bhutan. As part of the [[war reparations]], the Duars were ceded to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in exchange for a rent of Rs. 50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.

During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Tongsa]] led to civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''[[Penlop of Trongsa|penlop]]'' (governor) of [[Trongsa District|Trongsa]]. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882–85.<ref name=CS2>{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=British Intrusion, 1772–1907|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>

In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by ''Gongzim'' [[Ugyen Dorji]]. [[John Claude White]], British Political Agent in Bhutan, took photographs of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hannavy|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-87327-1|page=1496|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112111434/https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy, and in 1910 Bhutan signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]], a [[subsidiary alliance]] which gave the British control of Bhutan's foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian [[princely state]]. This had little real effect, given Bhutan's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect Bhutan's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] gained [[Independence of India|independence]] from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent India.<ref name=WIAS/>

In 1953, King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature – a 130-member [[National Assembly]] – to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971, Bhutan was admitted to the United Nations, having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.

Bhutan's sixth Five-Year Plan (1987–92) included a policy of 'one nation, one people' and introduced a code of traditional Drukpa dress and etiquette called ''Driglam Namzhag'' . The dress element of this code required all citizens to wear the ''gho'' (a knee-length robe for men) and the ''kira'' (an ankle-length dress for women).<ref name="academic.oup.com">{{cite journal |last1=Hutt |first1=Michael |title=Ethnic Nationalism, Refugees and Bhutan |journal=Journal of Refugee Studies |date=December 1996 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=397–420 |doi=10.1093/jrs/9.4.397 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jrs/article-abstract/9/4/397/1546497?redirectedFrom=fulltext |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref> A central plank of the Bhutanese government's policy since the late 1980s has been to strengthen the role and status of [[Dzongkha]] in national life.

Each family was required to present census workers with a tax receipt from the year 1958—no earlier, no later—or with a certificate of origin, which had to be obtained from one’s place of birth, to prove that they were indeed Bhutanese citizens. Previously issued citizenship cards were no longer accepted as proof of citizenship. Very few [[Lhotshampa]] people were classified as citizens.

===Political reform and modernization===
{{further|Law of Bhutan|Constitution of Bhutan}}
Bhutan's political system has recently changed from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]]. King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] transferred most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowed for [[impeachment]] of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.democracy-international.org/fileadmin/di/pdf/papers/di-bhutan.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110610012322/http://www.democracy-international.org/fileadmin/di/pdf/papers/di-bhutan.pdf |archive-date = 10 June 2011 |last = Hoffman |first = Klus |title = Democratization from Above: The Case of Bhutan |date = 1 April 2006 |access-date = 24 April 2010 }}</ref>

In 1999, the government lifted a ban on television and internet, making Bhutan one of the last countries to introduce television. In his speech, the King said that television was a critical step to the modernization of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country's [[gross national happiness]],<ref name="GNH">{{cite journal |last = Larmer |first = Brook |date = March 2008 |title = Bhutan's Enlightened Experiment |journal = National Geographic |issn = 0027-9358 |url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/bhutan/larmer-text/2 |access-date = 19 June 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511073652/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/bhutan/larmer-text/2 |archive-date = 11 May 2011 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> but warned that the "misuse" of this new technology could erode traditional Bhutanese values.<ref>{{cite web |first1 = Cathy |last1 = Scott-Clark |first2 = Adrian |last2 = Levy |url = https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,975769,00.html |title = Fast Forward into Trouble |website = The Guardian |date = 14 June 2003 |access-date = 1 September 2011 }}</ref>

A new constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008.

{{Main|Geography of Bhutan}}
[[File:Bhutan topo en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A topographic map of Bhutan.]]
Bhutan is on the southern slopes of the eastern [[Himalayas]], landlocked between the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of China to the north and the Indian states of [[Sikkim]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] to west and south and the Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] to the east. It lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26°N]] and [[29th parallel north|29°N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88°E]] and [[93rd meridian east|93°E]]. The land consists mostly of steep and high [[mountains of Bhutan|mountains]] crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers that form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains. Elevation rises from {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} in the southern foothills to more than {{convert|7000|m|abbr=on}}. This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.<ref name=official/>

Bhutan's northern region consists of an arc of [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over {{convert|7000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level; the highest point is {{convert|7570|m|adj=on|sp=us}}-tall [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which has the distinction of being the [[highest unclimbed mountain]] in the world.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html |title = Bhutan – The World Factbook |publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |access-date = 1 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101228202246/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html |archive-date = 28 December 2010 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The lowest point, at {{convert|98|m|abbr=on}}, is in the valley of [[Drangme Chhu]], where the river crosses the border with India.<ref name=CIA/> Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds.

The [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]] in Bhutan's central region form a watershed between two major river systems: the [[Mo Chhu]] and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between {{convert|1500|and|4925|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] in higher elevations and [[Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests]] in lower elevations. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The [[Torsa River|Torsa]], [[Raidak]], [[Sankosh]], and [[Manas River|Manas]] are Bhutan's main rivers, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.

In the south, the [[Shiwalik Hills]] are covered with dense [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]], alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical [[Duars]] Plain, which is the eponymous gateway to strategic mountain passes (also known as dwars or dooars; literally, "doors" in [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], and [[Magahi language|Magahi]] languages.).<ref name="Bhutan"/><ref>[http://www.westbengaltourism.gov.in/web/guest/dooars-main West Bengal Tourism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806220511/http://www.westbengaltourism.gov.in/web/guest/dooars-main |date=2013}}</ref> Most of the Duars is in India, but a {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}-wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts, the northern and southern Duars

The northern Duars, which abut the Himalayan foothills, have rugged, sloping terrain and dry, porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy [[savanna]] grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by melting snow or monsoon rains, empty into the [[Brahmaputra River]] in India. Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005.

=== Climate ===
{{See also|Thimphu#Geography and climate}}
Bhutan's climate varies with elevation, from subtropical in the south to [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the highlands and [[polar climate|polar-type]] climate with year-round snow in the north. Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern Bhutan are temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters.<!--Library of Congress|Geography-->

The [[Bengal tiger]], [[clouded leopard]], [[hispid hare]] and the [[sloth bear]] live in the tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, [[grey langur]], tiger, [[goral]] and [[serow]] are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit-bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the [[Himalayan black bear]], [[red panda]], [[squirrel]], [[sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[Sus (genus)|wild pig]] and [[barking deer]]. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the [[snow leopard]], [[blue sheep]], [[marmot]], [[Tibetan wolf]], [[antelope]], [[Himalayan musk deer]] and the [[takin]], Bhutan's [[national animal]]. The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern Bhutan, although in small numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last = Choudhury |first = A.U. |year = 2010 |title = The Vanishing Herds: Wild Water Buffalo |publisher = Gibbon Books & The Rhino Foundation for Nature in North East India |location = Guwahati, India |isbn = 978-9380652009 }}</ref>

More than 770 species of bird have been recorded in Bhutan.

The Eastern [[Himalayas]] have been identified as a global [[biodiversity]] hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding [[ecoregion]]s of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] between 1995 and 1997.

According to the Swiss-based [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], Bhutan is viewed as a model for proactive [[Conservation movement|conservation]] initiatives.

Pressures on the natural environment, fueled by a complex array of forces, are already evident. They include: population pressures, agricultural modernization, poaching, hydro-power development, mineral extraction, industrialization, urbanization, sewage and waste disposal, tourism, competition for available land, road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/8743947|title = Environmental degradations and response in third world countries: a study on the republic of bhutan|last = Tims-Lewechi}}</ref>

In practice, the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment. Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered alarm fences, watch towers, and search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/addressing-human-wildlife-conflict/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110901021127/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/addressing-human-wildlife-conflict/ |archive-date = 1 September 2011 |title = Addressing Human-Wildlife Conflict |first = Jigme |last = Wangchuk |publisher = [[Bhutan Observer]] online |date = 8 July 2011 |access-date = 13 July 2011 }}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Bhutan's principal foreign relations were with [[British India]] and [[Tibet]]. The government of [[British India]] managed relations with the kingdom from the [[Bhutan House]] in [[Kalimpong]]. Fearful of Chinese communist expansion, Bhutan signed a friendship treaty with the newly independent Republic of India in 1949. Its concerns were exacerbated after the [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|Chinese incorporation of Tibet]].<ref name="bhutanstudies.org.bt"/> Relations with [[Nepal]] remained strained due to [[Bhutanese refugees]]. Bhutan joined the United Nations in 1971. It was the first country to recognize Bangladesh's [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh|independence]] in 1971. It became a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) in 1985. The country is a member of 150 international organizations,<ref name="bhutanstudies.org.bt">{{cite journal |url=http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/publicationFiles/JBS/JBS_Vol10/v10-8.pdf |title=International Politics of Bhutan |author=Galay, Karma |volume=10 |pages=90–107 |journal=Journal of Bhutan Studies |access-date=10 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210121931/http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/publicationFiles/JBS/JBS_Vol10/v10-8.pdf |archive-date=10 February 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> including the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]], [[BBIN]], [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Group of 77]].

By long-standing agreement, Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other's countries without a [[Bhutanese passport|passport]] or visa, but must still have their national identity cards. Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction.

On 13 November 2005, Chinese soldiers crossed into the disputed territories between China and Bhutan and began building roads and bridges.<ref name=dispcb/> Bhutanese Foreign Minister [[Khandu Wangchuk]] took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People's Republic of China said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute, denying that the presence of soldiers in the area was an attempt to forcibly occupy it.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.china.com/zh_cn/domestic/945/20051201/12906175.html |script-title = zh:中国不丹同意平等友好协商早日解决边界问题 |trans-title = China and Bhutan Agree to Equal and Amicable Talks in Order to Resolve the Border Issue Quickly |language = zh |publisher = News.china.com |date = 1 December 2005 |access-date = 23 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090925120828/http://news.china.com/zh_cn/domestic/945/20051201/12906175.html |archive-date = 25 September 2009 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> An Indian intelligence officer said that a Chinese delegation in Bhutan told the Bhutanese they were "overreacting".

In February 2007 the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised. Whereas the Treaty of 1949, Article 2 stated: "The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations," the revised treaty now states "In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other." The revised treaty also includes this preamble: "Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity", an element absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 clarifies Bhutan's status as an independent and sovereign nation.

===Political divisions===<!--Linked from Template:Bhutan topics-->
{{Main|Districts of Bhutan|Gewogs of Bhutan|Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009}}
Bhutan is divided into twenty ''[[Dzongkhag]]'' (districts), administered by a body called the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. In certain ''[[thromde]]s'' (urban municipalities), a further municipal administration is directly subordinate to the Dzongkhag administration. In the vast majority of constituencies, rural ''[[Gewogs of Bhutan|geog]]'' (village blocks) are administered by bodies called the Geog Tshogde.<ref name=LGA09>{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |title=Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=11 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162642/http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}</ref>

Thromdes (municipalities) elect Thrompons to lead administration, who in turn represent the Thromde in the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. Likewise, ''geog'' elect headmen called ''gup''s, vice-headmen called ''mangmis'', who also sit on the Dzongkhag Tshogdu, as well as other members of the Geog Tshogde. The basis of electoral constituencies in Bhutan is the ''[[chiwog]]'', a subdivision of gewogs delineated by the Election Commission.<ref name=LGA09/>

{{Main|Economy of Bhutan}}
Bhutan's currency is the [[ngultrum]], whose value is [[Fixed exchange rate|fixed]] to the [[Indian rupee]]. The rupee is also accepted as [[legal tender]] in the country.
Though Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest,<ref>{{cite web |title = World development indicators |url = http://wdi.worldbank.org/tables |publisher = The World Bank Group |access-date = 28 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233007/http://wdi.worldbank.org/tables |archive-date = 30 December 2013 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> it has grown rapidly in recent years, by eight percent in 2005 and 14 percent in 2006. In 2007, Bhutan had the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, with an annual economic growth rate of 22.4 percent. This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic [[Tala Hydroelectric Power Station]]. {{As of|2012}}, Bhutan's [[per capita income]] was US$2,420.<ref>{{cite web |title = World development indicators: size of economy |url = http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/1.1 |publisher = The World Bank Group |access-date = 28 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140116230339/http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/1.1 |archive-date = 16 January 2014 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Bhutan's economy is based on agriculture, forestry, tourism and the sale of [[hydroelectric power]] to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for 55.4 percent of the population.<ref>{{cite web |title = GNH Survey 2010 |url = http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/docs/2010_Results/PDF/National.pdf |publisher = The Centre for Bhutan Studies |access-date = 17 October 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130318035825/http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/docs/2010_Results/PDF/National.pdf |archive-date = 18 March 2013 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Agrarian practices consist largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars, are a small [[cottage industry]]. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.

This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan has no [[rail transport|railways]], though [[Indian Railways]] plans to link southern Bhutan to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050126/main5.htm |first = Rajeev |last = Sharma |title = MoUs with Bhutan on Rail Links, Power Projects |website = The Tribune |date = 25 January 2011 |access-date = 23 April 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090917004511/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050126/main5.htm |archive-date = 17 September 2009 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Bhutan and India signed a 'free trade' accord in 2008, which additionally allowed Bhutanese imports and exports from third markets to transit India without tariffs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/india_e.htm |title = MEMBER INFORMATION: India and the WTO |publisher = [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) |access-date = 23 April 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090422224717/http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/countries_e/india_e.htm |archive-date = 22 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bhutan had trade relations with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of China until 1960, when it closed its border with China after an influx of refugees.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA12Ad02.html |title = In Bhutan, China and India Collide |first = Mohan |last = Balaji |date = 12 January 2008 |access-date = 3 October 2010 |work = [[Asia Times]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513085403/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA12Ad02.html |archive-date = 13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The industrial sector is currently in a nascent stage. Although most production comes from cottage industry, larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as cement, steel, and [[ferroalloy]] have been set up. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on [[contract labor]] from neighboring India. Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (some yak, mostly cow) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations. Industries include cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and [[calcium carbide]].<!---CIA factbook|CIA-1--->

Incomes of over [[Ngultrum|Nu]] 100,000 [[per annum]] are taxed, but as Bhutan is currently one of the world's least developed countries, very few wage and salary earners qualify. Bhutan's inflation rate was estimated at about three percent in 2003. Bhutan has a [[gross domestic product]] of around US$5.855&nbsp;billion (adjusted to [[purchasing power parity]]), making it the 158th-largest economy in the world. Per capita income (PPP) is around $7,641,<ref name=CIA/> ranked 144th. Government revenues total $407.1&nbsp;million, though expenditures amount to $614&nbsp;million.

Bhutan's exports, principally electricity, [[cardamom]], [[gypsum]], timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and spices, total €128&nbsp;million (2000 est.). Imports, however, amount to €164&nbsp;million, leading to a [[trade deficit]]. Main items imported include fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery, vehicles, fabrics and rice. Bhutan's main export partner is India, accounting for 58.6 percent of its export goods. Hong Kong (30.1 percent) and Bangladesh (7.3 percent) are the other two top export partners.<ref name=CIA/> As its border with Tibet Autonomous Region is closed, trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent.

Bhutan has deposits of numerous minerals. Commercial production includes [[coal]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], [[gypsum]], and [[limestone]]. The country has proven reserves of [[beryl]], [[copper]], graphite, [[lead]], [[mica]], [[pyrite]], [[tin]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. However, the country's mineral deposits remain untapped, as it prefers to conserve the environment, rather than to exploit and destroy it for money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambotravels.com/bhutan/gross-national-happiness/|title=Gross National Happiness - an introduction|last=Ads|first=Ambo Digital|website=Ambo Travels|language=en|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>

Besides hydropower, it is also endowed with significant renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and bioenergy. Technically viable solar energy generation capacity is around 12,000 MW and wind around 760 MW. More than 70% of its land is under forest cover, which is an immense source of bioenergy in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Road===
The [[Lateral Road]] is Bhutan's primary east–west corridor, connecting the towns of [[Phuentsholing]] in the southwest to [[Trashigang]] in the east. Notable settlements that the Lateral Road runs through directly are [[Wangdue Phodrang]] and [[Trongsa]]. The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital [[Thimphu]] and other [[population center]]s such as [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Punakha]]. As with other roads in Bhutan, the Lateral Road presents serious safety concerns due to pavement conditions, sheer drops, hairpin turns, weather and landslides.<ref>{{cite book |title = Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey into Bhutan |first = Jamie |last = Zeppa |publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |year = 2000 |isbn = 978-1-57322-815-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=383rWqWgga8C |access-date = 18 October 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112111434/https://books.google.com/books?id=383rWqWgga8C |archive-date = 12 January 2016 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4775 |title = Icy Roads Claim Lives |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 4 December 2004 |access-date = 10 August 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025945/http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4775 |archive-date = 19 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=16502 |title = Landslide at Dzong Viewpoint |first = Samten |last = Yeshi |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 24 August 2010 |access-date = 25 July 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025950/http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=16502 |archive-date = 19 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Since 2014, road widening has been a priority across Bhutan, in particular for the north-east–west highway from Trashigang to Dochula. The widening project is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and will make road travel across the country substantially faster and more efficient. In addition, it is projected that the improved road conditions will encourage more tourism in the more inaccessible eastern region of Bhutan.<ref>{{cite web|title=North-East-West highway widening progressing under pre-financing|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/north-east-highway-widening-progressing-under-pre-financing/|website=KuenselOnline|access-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510235526/http://www.kuenselonline.com/north-east-highway-widening-progressing-under-pre-financing/|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Embassy of India Thimphu, Bhutan|url=https://www.indianembassythimphu.bt/pages.php?id=111|website=indianembassythimphu.bt|access-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510110800/https://www.indianembassythimphu.bt/pages.php?id=111|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=East-West highway widening on track|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/east-west-highway-widening-on-track/|website=KuenselOnline|access-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510235519/http://www.kuenselonline.com/east-west-highway-widening-on-track/|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Currently, the road conditions appear to be deterring tourists from visiting Bhutan due to the increased instances of road blocks, landslides and dust disruption caused by the widening project.<ref>{{cite web|title=International tourists bemoan bad road conditions in Bhutan {{!}} Asia News Network|url=http://www.asianews.network/content/international-tourists-bemoan-bad-road-conditions-bhutan-18438|access-date=30 June 2017|date=31 May 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708150611/http://www.asianews.network/content/international-tourists-bemoan-bad-road-conditions-bhutan-18438|archive-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>

=== Ethnic groups ===
Bhutanese people primarily consist of the [[Ngalop]]s and [[Sharchop people|Sharchops]], called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese respectively. Although the [[Sharchops]] are slightly larger in demographic size, the Ngalops dominate the political sphere, as the King and the political elite belong to this group.<ref name=growup3>{{cite web |author=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform |title=Ethnicity in Bhutan |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/Bhutan |publisher=ETH Zurich |access-date=24 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024152724/https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/Bhutan |archive-date=24 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the Sharchops, the largest group, who traditionally follow the [[Nyingmapa]] rather than the official [[Drukpa Kagyu]] form of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In modern times, with improved transportation infrastructure, there has been much intermarriage between these groups.

The [[Lhotshampa]], meaning "southerner Bhutanese", are a heterogeneous group of mostly [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] ancestry who have sought political and cultural recognition including equality in right to abode, language, and dress.

Buddhism was introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king [[Songtsän Gampo]] (reigned 627–649), a convert to Buddhism, ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at [[Bumthang (town)|Bumthang]] in central Bhutan and at Kyichu Lhakhang (near [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]]) in the [[Paro Valley]].<ref name="CS1"/>

The national language is [[Dzongkha]] (Bhutanese), one of 53 languages in the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]] family. The script, locally called ''Chhokey'' (literally, "Dharma language"), is identical to classical Tibetan. In Bhutan's education system, English is the medium of instruction, while Dzongkha is taught as the national language. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan, all of them in the [[Tibeto-Burman]] family, except [[Nepali language|Nepali]], an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]].<ref name=CIDCM/>

Until the 1980s, the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in southern Bhutan. With the adoption of the ''[[Driglam Namzhag]]'' (Bhutanese code of etiquette) and its expansion into the idea of strengthening the role of Dzongkha, Nepali was dropped from the curriculum. The languages of Bhutan are still not well characterized, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. Before the 1980s, the [[Lhotshampa]] (Nepali-speaking community), mainly based in southern Bhutan, constituted approximately 30% of the population.<ref name=CIDCM>{{cite web |title = Assessment for Lhotshampas in Bhutan |url = http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=76001 |website = Database |publisher = Center for International Development and Conflict Management, [[University of Maryland]] |access-date = 9 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622213816/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=76001 |archive-date = 22 June 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> However, after a purge of Lhotshaampas from 1990 to 1992 this number might not accurately reflect the current population.

Dzongkha is partially intelligible with [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]] and spoken natively by 25% of the population. [[Tshangla language|Tshangla]], the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre-Tibetan language of Bhutan, is spoken by a greater number of people. It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto-Burman. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers constituted some 40% of the population {{As of|2006|lc=y}}. The larger minority languages are [[Dzala language|Dzala]] (11%), [[Limbu language|Limbu]] (10%), [[Kheng language|Kheng]] (8%), and [[Bantawa language|Rai]] (8%). There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of Bhutan, so these numbers do not add up to 100%.

Today Bhutan has two decentralized universities with eleven constituent colleges spread across the kingdom. These are the [[Royal University of Bhutan]] and [[Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences]], respectively. The first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|five-year plan]] provided for a central education authority—in the form of a director of education appointed in 1961—and an organized, modern school system with free and universal primary education.

[[Education program]]s were given a boost in 1990, when the [[Asian Development Bank]] (see Glossary) granted a US$7.13&nbsp;million loan for staff training and development, specialist services, equipment and furniture purchases, salaries and other recurrent costs, and facility rehabilitation and construction at Royal Bhutan Polytechnic.

Since the beginning of modern education in Bhutan, teachers from India, especially [[Kerala]] have served in some of the most remote villages of Bhutan. Thus, 43 retired teachers who had served for the longest length of time were personally invited to [[Thimphu]], Bhutan during the Teachers' Day celebrations in 2018, where they were honored and individually thanked by His Majesty [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]]. To celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between Bhutan and India, Bhutan's Education Minister, [[Jai Bir Rai]] honored 80 retired teachers who served in Bhutan at a special ceremony organized at [[Kolkata]], [[India]] on 6 January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=109304|title=Indian teachers who served in Bhutan honoured|date=8 January 2019|access-date=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111175724/http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=109304|archive-date=11 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Currently, there are 121 teachers from India placed in schools across Bhutan.

While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad, Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter budgets. Entry is free for citizens of India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/plan-your-trip/travel-requirements |title=Travel Requirements |publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan |access-date=1 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120162648/http://www.tourism.gov.bt/plan-your-trip/travel-requirements |archive-date=20 November 2010 }}</ref> Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web |title = New MICE hardware on the cards for Bhutan |url = http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&issues&ID=23596 |publisher = TTGmice |access-date = 16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605131337/http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&issues&ID=23596 |archive-date = 5 June 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Bhutan is the [[List of smoking bans#Bhutan|first nation in the world]] to ban smoking. It has been illegal to smoke in public or sell tobacco, according to [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010]]. Violators are fined the equivalent of $232—a month's salary in Bhutan.

===Dress===
The national dress for Bhutanese men is the ''[[gho]]'', a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the ''kera''. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the ''[[kira (dress)|kira]]'', which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical brooches called the ''koma'' and tied at the waist with kera. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the "''wonju''," which is worn underneath the kira. A long-sleeved, jacket-like garment called the "''toego''" is worn over the kira. The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs, inside out. Social status and class determine the textures, colors, and decorations that embellish the garments.

[[Jewelry]] is commonly worn by women, especially during religious festivals ("[[tsechu]]s") and public gatherings. To strengthen Bhutan's identity as an independent country, Bhutanese law requires all Bhutanese government employees to wear the national dress at work and all citizens to wear the national dress while visiting schools and other government offices though many citizens, particularly adults, choose to wear the customary dress as formal attire.

Varicolored scarves, known as ''rachu'' for women and ''[[kabney]]'' for men, are important indicators of social standing, as Bhutan has traditionally been a [[feudal]] society; in particular, red is the most common color worn by women. The "Bura Maap" (Red Scarf) is one of highest honors a Bhutanese civilian can receive. It, as well as the title of [[Dasho]], comes from the throne in recognition of an individual’s outstanding service to the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=21155 |title=Four individuals conferred Bura Maap - BBS |newspaper=Bbs.bt |access-date= October 16, 2020}}</ref> On previous occasions, the King himself conferred Bura Maaps to outstanding individuals such as the Director General of Department Hydropower and Power System, Yeshi Wangdi, the Deputy Chairperson of National Council, Dasho Dr. Sonam Kinga, and former National Assembly Speaker, Dasho Ugyen Dorji.<ref name="MyUser_Bbs.bt_October_15_2020c">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=8105 |title=His Majesty awards red scarf and medals - BBS |newspaper=Bbs.bt |access-date= October 15, 2020}}</ref>

===Film industry===
{{Main|Cinema of Bhutan}}

===Music and dance===
[[File:Bhutan-masked-dance.jpg|thumb|upright|''Chaam'', sacred masked dances, are annually performed during religious festivals.]]
{{Main|Music of Bhutan}}
Dance dramas and masked dances such as the [[Cham dance]] are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. At these events, dancers depict heroes, demons, [[Daemon (classical mythology)|dæmons]], death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people by wearing colorful wooden or composition face masks and stylized costumes. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask-making.

The [[music of Bhutan]] can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties; traditional music comprises religious and folk genres, the latter including ''[[zhungdra]]'' and ''[[boedra]]''.<ref name=Greenwood>{{cite book |title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife: Southeast Asia and India, Central and East Asia, Middle East |volume = 2 |first = William M. |last = Clements |publisher = Greenwood Press |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-313-32849-7 |pages = 106–110 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ |access-date = 18 October 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112111434/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ |archive-date = 12 January 2016 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The modern ''[[rigsar]]'' is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards, and dates back to the early 1990s; it shows the influence of Indian popular music, a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences.<ref name=k1>{{cite web |access-date = 16 October 2011 |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2420 |first = Ugyen |last = Penjor |title = From Ngesem Ngesem to Khu Khu Khu&nbsp;...

===Family structure===
In Bhutanese families, inheritance generally passes [[matrilineally]] through the female rather than the male line. Daughters will inherit their parents' house. A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife's home. [[Love marriage]]s are more common in urban areas, but the tradition of [[arranged marriage]]s among acquainted families is still prevalent in most of the rural areas. Although uncommon, [[polygamy]] is accepted, often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it.<ref>{{cite book |title = Sikkim and Bhutan |publisher = Vikas Publications, Indian Council for Cultural Relations |first = V.H. |last = Coelho |year = 1970 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KD0KAQAAIAAJ |page = 82 |access-date = 18 October 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112111434/https://books.google.com/books?id=KD0KAQAAIAAJ |archive-date = 12 January 2016 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The previous king, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], who abdicated in 2006, had four queens, all of whom are sisters.

[[File:Bhutanese red rice with chicken and spinach.jpg|thumb|Traditional dish with lemon glazed chicken, sauteed spinach and steamed Bhutanese red rice]]

[[Rice]] ([[Bhutanese red rice|red rice]]), [[buckwheat]], and increasingly [[maize]], are the staples of [[Bhutanese cuisine]]. The local diet also includes pork, beef, [[yak]] meat, chicken, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chilies and cheese are prepared. ''[[Ema datshi]]'', made very spicy with cheese and chilies, might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it. Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include [[butter tea]], black tea, locally brewed ''[[ara (drink)|ara]]'' ([[rice wine]]), and beer. Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of [[tobacco]] under its [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010|Tobacco Act of 2010]].<ref name=LP/>

===Sports===

It differs from [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. Two targets are placed over {{convert|100|m|sp=us}} apart, and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event, and competitions are organized between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. [[Darts]] (''khuru'') is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10&nbsp;cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target {{convert|10|to|20|m|sp=us}} away.

Another traditional sport is the ''[[Digor (sports)|Digor]]'', which resembles the [[shot put]] and [[Horseshoes|horseshoe throwing]].

Another popular sport is [[basketball]].<ref name="impress BHUTAN"/> In 2002, Bhutan's [[Bhutan national football team|national football team]] played [[Montserrat national football team|Montserrat]], in what was billed as [[The Other Final]]; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]], but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world's two lowest ranked teams.

=== Women in the workforce ===

Rooted deep in Bhutan culture is the idea of selflessness and the women of Bhutan take on this role in the context of the household.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dayaram |first1=Kandy |last2=Pick |first2=David |title=Entangled between tradition and modernity: the experiences of Bhutanese working women |journal=Society and Business Review |date=22 June 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=134–148 |doi=10.1108/17465681211237600 }}</ref> Bhutan culture has shown a tolerance for domestic violence with nearly 1/4 of all women having had experienced some form of violence from their husband or partner.<ref name=":3"/> Some Bhutanese communities have what is referred to as matrilineal communities, where the eldest daughter receives the largest share of the land.<ref name=":03"/> This is due to the belief that she will stay and take care of her parents while the son will move out and work to get his own land and for his own family.<ref name=":03"/> Importantly, land ownership does not necessarily equate to economic benefits - despite the eldest daughter having control of the house, it is the husband that is in charge of making decisions.<ref name=":03"/> However, the younger generation has stepped away from this belief, in splitting the land evenly between the children instead of the eldest daughter inheriting the most land.<ref name=":03"/>

=== Women's health ===
Throughout Bhutan, there has been an improvement in reproductive health services that has led to a drastic drop in maternal mortality rate, dropping from 1,000 in 1990 to 180 in 2010.<ref name=":03"/> There has also been an increase in contraceptive use from less than 1/3 in 2003 to 2/3 in 2010.<ref name=":03"/>
