''Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority'', 386 F.3d 1148,<ref>{{cite court
|litigants=Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|reporter=DC|opinion=03-7149|court=[[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]|year=2004 |url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200410/03-7149a.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised [[zero tolerance]] "no eating" policy in a [[Washington Metro]] station by eating a single french fry.  She was released to her mother three hours later. She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] (unreasonable search and seizure) and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (equal protection).

"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation," Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a [[rational basis review|rational basis]] test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. "Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not." The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that "the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution," language reminiscent of Justice [[Potter Stewart]]'s dissent in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''. "We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine," Stewart had written; "[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do."

===Military tribunals===
In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding [[military tribunal]]s set up by the Bush administration for trying [[terrorism]] suspects known as [[enemy combatant]]s. Circuit judge [[A. Raymond Randolph]], writing for the court, ruled that [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], a driver for [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=712&p=local&a=5 |title=Lawyer says Hamden not al-Qaeda – Yemeni was bin Laden's driver – local |work=Yemen Times |access-date=August 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608064851/http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=712&p=local&a=5 |archive-date=June 8, 2011}}</ref> could be tried by a military court because:

# the military commission had the approval of the [[United States Congress]];
# the [[Third Geneva Convention]] is a [[treaty]] between nations and as such it does not confer [[individual rights]] and remedies enforceable in U.S. courts;
# even if the Convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because, for a conflict such as the [[War on Terror|war against Al-Qaeda]] (considered by the court as a separate war from that against Afghanistan itself) that is not between two countries, it guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.

The court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200507/04-5393a.pdf |title=USCA-DC Opinions - Search - 04-5393a.pdf |publisher=Pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov |date=July 15, 2005 |access-date=July 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629045051/http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200507/04-5393a.pdf |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.<ref>{{cite web|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/548/557.html|website=Findlaw|access-date=January 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212201353/http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/548/557.html|archive-date=December 12, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Environmental regulation===
Roberts wrote a dissent in ''Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/dc/015373b.html 323 F.3d 1062], a case involving the protection of a rare [[California toad]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. When the court denied a rehearing [[en banc]], [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/dc/015373b.html 334 F.3d 1158] (D.C. Cir. 2003), Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' in that it incorrectly focused on whether the ''regulation'' substantially affects [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] rather than on whether the regulated ''activity'' does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called "a hapless toad" that "for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California." He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court "alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent."<ref>See also: "Chief Justice Roberts—Constitutional Interpretations of Article III and the Commerce Clause: Will the 'Hapless Toad' and 'John Q.

== Appointment to Supreme Court ==
{{Main|John Roberts Supreme Court nomination and hearings}}[[File:Robertsoath6.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005)]]
On July 19, 2005, [[George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|President Bush nominated]] Roberts to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to fill a vacancy to be created by the retirement of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. It was the first Supreme Court nomination since [[Stephen Breyer]] in 1994.

While Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] died on September 3, 2005. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as chief justice.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/JusticeNomi |title=Chief Justice Nomination Announcement |work=C-SPAN |date=September 5, 2005 |access-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

===Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence===
During his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did "not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document."<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name="multiple1" /> Roberts analogized judges to baseball umpires: "[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300693.html | title=Transcript: Day One of the Roberts Hearings | work=The Washington Post | date=September 13, 2005 | access-date=July 4, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019142313/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300693.html | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:

====Commerce Clause====
In Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:

{{quote|Starting with ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time ''[[United States v. Lopez|Lopez]]'' was decided, many of us had learned in [[law school]] that it was just sort of a formality to say that [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. ''Lopez'' certainly breathed new life into the [[Commerce Clause]].

I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in ''Lopez'' at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant—and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.<ref name="multiple1">[http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf ''Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 108th Congress, 1st Session''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121190047/http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf |date=November 21, 2011 }}, [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]. Retrieved April 12, 2010.</ref>}}

====Federalism====
Roberts stated the following about [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]] in a 1999 radio interview:

{{quote|We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether it is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is I think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf |title=Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |access-date=May 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121190047/http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf |archive-date=November 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

====Reviewing Acts of Congress====
At a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:

{{quote|The Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.

Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called [[judicial activism]], that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.<ref name="multiple1" />}}

====''Stare decisis''====
On the subject of ''[[stare decisis]]'', referring to ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board]]'', the decision overturning school [[Racial segregation|segregation]], Roberts said that "the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly."<ref>{{cite press release|title=Testimony of the Honorable Dick Thornburgh|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]|date=September 15, 2005|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1611&wit_id=4609|access-date=December 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205031655/http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1611&wit_id=4609|archive-date=December 5, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====''Roe v. Wade''====
While working as a lawyer for the Reagan administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenburg|first=Jan Crawford|title=Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court|url=https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree|url-access=registration|isbn=978-1594201011|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2007|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree/page/232 232]}}</ref> At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own.<ref name="rasoai">{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Amy|author2=Charles Babington|title=Roberts Avoids Specifics on Abortion Issue|work=The Washington Post|date=September 15, 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300682.html|access-date=December 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829201140/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300682.html|archive-date=August 29, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position," Roberts said.<ref name="rasoai"/> As a lawyer in the [[George H.

In private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that ''Roe'' was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of ''[[stare decisis]],''<ref name="greenburg 233">{{cite book|last=Greenburg|first=Jan Crawford|title=Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court|url=https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree|url-access=registration|isbn=978-1594201011|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2007|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree/page/233 233]}}</ref> meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.

In his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the [[Circuit Court|Appellate Court]], he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an [[abortion]]. He stated: "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Casey]]''." Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=[[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]|title=Confirmation Hearings on Federal Appointments|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]|year=2003|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_senate_hearings&docid=f:92548.wais|access-date=December 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208125417/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_senate_hearings&docid=f:92548.wais|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> however, [[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]] adds "I wouldn’t bet on Chief Justice Roberts’s siding unequivocally with the anti-Roe forces."<ref name=AtlanticRosen>{{cite news|last= Rosen|first=Jeffrey|author-link=Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/06/the-day-after-roe/304882/|title=The Day After Roe|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=May 20, 2019|date=June 2006}}</ref>

Roberts took the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] [[oath of office#United States|oath of office]], administered by Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] at the [[White House]], on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] at the [[United States Supreme Court building]].

Seventh Circuit judge [[Diane Sykes]], surveying Roberts's first term on the court, concluded that his jurisprudence "appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review."<ref>Diane S.

In November 2018, the [[Associated Press]] approached Roberts for comment after President [[Donald Trump]] described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an "Obama judge".

On January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] in ''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]'', which held that the [[Controlled Substances Act]] does not allow the [[United States Attorney General|United States attorney general]] to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the [[assisted suicide]] of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not [[federalism]].

On March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in ''[[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights]]'' that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]-initiated "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy.

===Campaign finance===
Following his concurrence in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' (2010), Roberts wrote the majority decision for another landmark [[campaign finance]] case called ''[[McCutcheon v. FEC]]'' (2014). In ''McCutcheon'' the court ruled that "aggregate limits" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the [[First Amendment]].<ref name=epps /><ref>{{cite web| title = McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission| work = Oyez| access-date = 2018-08-05| url = https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/12-536}}</ref>

===Fourth Amendment===
Roberts wrote his first dissent in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'' (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior [[case law]] and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Third Party Consent Searches After Georgia v.

In ''[[Utah v. Strieff]]'' (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding [[arrest warrant|warrant]] may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without [[reasonable suspicion]], before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf|title=Utah v.

In ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'', a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5–4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf |title=CARPENTER v. UNITED STATES |date=2017 |website=supremecourt.gov |access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

===Notice and opportunity to be heard===
Although Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in ''[[Jones v. Flowers]]'', siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]], while Roberts's opinion was joined by [[David Souter]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[John Paul Stevens]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. [[Samuel Alito]] did not participate.

===Abortion and reproductive health care===
On the Supreme Court, Roberts has indicated he supports some abortion restrictions. In ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' (2007), he voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and concluded that the court's previous decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future [[as-applied challenge]]s, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.<ref>{{cite web |title=Justice Thomas wrote separately to emphasize this: "whether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZC.html |publisher=law.cornell.edu |access-date=May 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414013714/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZC.html |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''Casey'' should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.

In 2018, Roberts and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny [[Medicaid]] funding to Planned Parenthood,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/10/supreme-court-hamstrings-states-efforts-to-defund-planned-parenthood.html|title=Supreme Court hamstrings states' efforts to defund Planned Parenthood|last=Higgins|first=Tucker|date=2018-12-10|website=cnbc.com|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/10/politics/supreme-court-planned-parenthood-abortion/index.html|title=Supreme Court sides with Planned Parenthood in funding fight|last=de Vogue|first=Ariane|date=December 10, 2018|website=cnn.com}}</ref> Roberts also joined with liberal justices in 5–4 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana [[Types of abortion restrictions in the United States|abortion restriction]] (2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.tv/v/PgnL/2019/02/08/u-s-supreme-court-blocks-louisiana-abortion-law|title=U.S. Supreme Court blocks Louisiana abortion law|website=Reuters TV|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> and later striking down that law (''[[June Medical Services, LLC v.

=== Capital punishment ===
On November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5–3 decision to stay an execution.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/justice-roberts-thomas-death-penalty/index.html|title=Why John Roberts blocked an execution|first=Ariane|last=de Vogue |website=CNN|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alabama-execution-idUSKCN1PX07C|title=Muslim man executed after U.S. Supreme Court denies request for imam's presence|date=2019-02-08|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-02-21|language=en}}</ref> Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision to block the execution of a man with an "intellectual disability" in Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/430556-supreme-court-tosses-death-sentence-for-texas-man|title=Supreme Court tosses death sentence for Texas man|last=Rowland|first=Geoffrey|date=2019-02-19|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/19/supreme-court-bobby-james-moore-death-penalty-case/2914569002/|title=Divided Supreme Court blocks Texas from executing intellectually disabled man, citing 'lay stereotypes'|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

===Free speech===
Roberts authored the 2007 student free speech case ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.<ref name="multiple2">{{cite news|last=Economist.com|title=The Supreme Court says no to race discrimination in schools|work=[[The Economist]]|date=June 28, 2007|url=https://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9424122&top_story=1|access-date=December 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080655/http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9424122&top_story=1|archive-date=December 5, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On April 20, 2010, in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]'', the Supreme Court struck down an [[animal cruelty]] law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals, was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.<ref>Tribune Wire Services.

===Health care reform===
On June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', which upheld the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the "individual mandate" component of the Act could not be upheld under the [[Commerce Clause]], the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under [[U. S. Congress|Congress's]] authority to "lay and collect taxes."<ref name=politico>{{cite news|last=Haberkorn|first=Jennifer|title=Health care ruling: Individual mandate upheld by Supreme Court|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77935.html|access-date=June 28, 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=June 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628204932/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77935.html|archive-date=June 28, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=cushman>{{cite news|last=Cushman|first=John|title=Supreme Court Lets Health Law Largely Stand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html|access-date=June 28, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628152412/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html|archive-date=June 28, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of [[Medicaid]]; Roberts wrote that "Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding."<ref name=cushman/>
