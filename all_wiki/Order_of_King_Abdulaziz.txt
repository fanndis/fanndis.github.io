The '''Order of King Abdulaziz''' is a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi-Arabia]]n [[order of merit]]. The order was named after [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Al Saud]], founder of the modern Saudi state.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://thekingsaudlibrary.org/en/archives/medals/349/|title=Military Medals of Saudi Arabia - Archives {{!}} King Saud|website=www.kingsaud.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref>

==History==
In 1971, the introduction of orders was announced in a [[decree]].<ref>No.122 van 24 1-1391</ref><ref>No.123 of 24 1-1391</ref> It was instituted by [[King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz|King Faisal]] on 20 March 1971.<ref name=medals>{{cite web|title=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: King Abdulaziz Order of Merit|url=http://www.medals.org.uk/saudi-arabia/saudi-arabia003.htm|work=Medals|accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> However, the order had been awarded before that date unsystematically.<ref name=rawrees>{{cite web|last=Raw Rees|first=Owain|title=The Awards of King Saud|url=http://www.kingsaud.net/at/?c=121&a=1101|publisher=King Saud website|accessdate=18 July 2013|location=Jeddah|date=May 1999}}</ref> These earliest versions were produced by Bichay in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].<ref name=rawrees/> The early version of the order was called [[Great Chain of Badr]]. The Saudi king, [[Fons honorum]] of the orders, confirmed the decree in his Royal decree.<ref>No.4 of 25 1-1391</ref>

==The Collar of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud==

The [[Collar (order)#Middle East|collar]] is regarded as a separate order.<ref name=":0" /> It also confers the highest rank in the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud, and, unlike the Great Chain of Badr, is awarded to non-Muslim heads of state.

==The Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud==
The order is awarded to citizens of Saudi Arabia and foreigners for meritorious service to the Kingdom. The Council of Ministers makes the nominations but the King confers awards to foreigners himself when he determines it to be appropriate. Awardees enter in the 4th class of the order, with the exception of ministers and appointees for bravery, who can enter the order in a higher class. Members of the order can advance to the next higher class every five years. 

The number of Saudi conferments is limited annually. The statutes of the order stipulate no more than 20 grand sashes of the distinguished class. Up to 40, 60, 80 and 100 awards can be granted to members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th classes, respectively.

===Classes===
The Classes include: 
*''Special Class'' (comparable with "Grand Cordon"). A sash with pendant is worn on the right shoulder, plus a star on the left chest;
*''Distinguished First Class'' (comparable with "Grand Officer"). The insignia is worn on a [[necklet]], plus a golden star on the left chest;
*''First Class'' (comparable with "Commander 1st Class"). The insignia is worn on a necklet, plus a silver star on the left chest;
*''Second Class'' (comparable with "Commander"). The insignia is worn on a necklet;
*''Third Class'' (comparable with "Officer"). A badge is worn on a ribbon with a [[Rosette (decoration)|rosette]] on the left chest;
*''Fourth Class'' (comparable with "Knight"). A badge is worn on a ribbon on the left chest.

The Saudis avoid words like "cross" (as in "Grand-Cross") and "knight".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The order is sometimes referred to as the:

* King Abdulaziz Order of Merit
* King Abdulaziz Al Saud Excellence Medal
* King Abdulaziz Medal
