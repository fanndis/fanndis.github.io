On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] [[Yugoslav nationalist]], [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], leading to the [[July Crisis]].<ref name="AJPT2">{{harvnb |Taylor |1998 |pp=80–93}}</ref>{{sfn |Djokić |2003 |p=24}} In response, [[Austria-Hungary]] issued an ultimatum to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] on 23&nbsp;July. Serbia's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians, and the two moved to a war footing. A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the [[Balkans]] to one involving most of Europe. By July 1914, the [[great powers]] of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the [[Triple Entente]], consisting of [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[British Empire|Britain]]; and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], Austria-Hungary, and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. The Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war until [[Treaty of London (1915)|April 1915]], when it joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated.<ref name="Seymour">{{cite book |title=The Diplomatic Background of the War |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.47310 |author=Charles Seymour |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=1916 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.47310/page/n55 35], 147}}</ref> Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia, and approved partial mobilisation after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of [[Belgrade]] on 28{{nbsp}}July.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lieven |first1=Dominic |title=Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141399744 |page=326}}</ref> Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30{{nbsp}}July; the following day, Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same, while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last1=Martel |first1=Gordon |title=The Month that Changed the World: July 1914 and WWI |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |at=6286 |edition=Kindle |ref=B00K79UOPK}}</ref> When Russia failed to comply, Germany declared war on Russia on 1{{nbsp}}August in support of Austria-Hungary, the latter following suit on 6{{nbsp}}August; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2{{nbsp}}August.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Le Président de la République, R.

Germany's strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within 6 weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zuber |first1=Terence |title=Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 |date=2011 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0198718055 |pages=46–49 |edition=2014}}</ref> On 2{{nbsp}}August, Germany demanded [[German invasion of Belgium|free passage through Belgium]], an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Note Given 2 August 1914, at 19 hours, by M. de Below Saleske [Klaus von Below-Saleske], Minister of Germany, to M.

On 12&nbsp;August, Britain and France also declared war on Austria-Hungary; on 23{{nbsp}}August, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] sided with Britain, seizing German possessions in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] and the Pacific. In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered the war on the side of Austria-Hungary and Germany, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Peninsula]]. The war was fought in (and drew upon) each power's colonial empire also, spreading the conflict to [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and across the globe. The Entente and its allies eventually became known as the Allied Powers, while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies became known as the [[Central Powers]].

The German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition|war of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917 (the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a [[Alpine Front|front in the Alps]]. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers in 1915 and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|war in the Balkans]]. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war [[materiel]] to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to initiate war against the United States, the [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declared war on Germany]] on 6{{nbsp}}April 1917. Trained American forces did not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] ultimately reached some two million troops.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edward M. |last=Coffman |title=The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I |date=1998}}</ref>

Though [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbia was defeated in 1915]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the Allied Powers in 1916 [[Romania during World War I|only to be defeated in 1917]], none of the great powers was knocked out of the war until 1918. The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Russian monarchy|Monarchy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. Germany now controlled much of eastern Europe and transferred large numbers of combat troops to the Western Front. Using [[Infiltration tactics|new tactics]], the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]] was initially successful. The Allies fell back and held. The last of the German reserves were exhausted as 10,000 fresh American troops arrived every day. The Allies drove the Germans back in their [[Hundred Days Offensive]], a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}</ref>  One by one the Central Powers quit: first Bulgaria, then the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian empire. With its allies defeated, [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolution]] at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] abdicated on 9{{nbsp}}November and Germany signed an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice on 11&nbsp;November 1918]], ending the fighting.

World War I was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. The war [[Aftermath of World War I|and its immediate aftermath]] sparked numerous [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|revolutions and uprisings]]. The [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the most well known being the German peace treaty: the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gerwath |first1=Robert |title=The Vanquished: Why the First World War Failed to End, 1917–1923 |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |at=3323–3342 |isbn=978-0141976372 |edition=Kindle}}</ref> Ultimately, as a result of the war, the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, and numerous new states were created from their remains. However, despite the conclusive Allied victory (and the creation of the [[League of Nations]] during the Peace Conference, intended to prevent future wars), a [[World War II|second world war]] followed just over [[Interwar period|twenty years]] later.

The term "world war" was first used in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]], who claimed that "there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'&nbsp;... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"{{sfn |Shapiro |Epstein |2006 |p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' on 20 September 1914.

Prior to [[World War II]], the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the '''Great War''' or simply the '''World War'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Were they always called World War I and World War II? |url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/were-they-always-called-world-war-i-and-world-war-ii |website=Ask History |access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>{{sfn |Braybon |2004 |p=8}} In October 1914, the Canadian magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "Some wars name themselves.

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}

===Political and military alliances===
[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=Map of Europe focusing on Austria-Hungary and marking the central location of ethnic groups in it including Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles.|Rival military coalitions in 1914: [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in brown. Only the Triple Alliance was a formal "alliance"; the others listed were informal patterns of support.]]

For much of the 19th century, the major European powers had tried to maintain a tenuous [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] among themselves, resulting in a complex network of political and [[Military]] alliances.{{sfn |Clark |2013 |pp=121–152}} The biggest challenges to this were Britain's withdrawal into so-called [[splendid isolation]], the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] and the post-1848 rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] under [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Victory in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] established Prussian hegemony in [[Germany]], while victory over France in the 1870–1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] [[Unification of Germany|unified]] the German states into a [[German Empire|German Reich]] under Prussian leadership. French desire for revenge over the defeat of 1871, known as [[revanchism]], and the recovery of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] became a principal object of French policy for the next forty years (see [[French–German enmity]]).<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848–1945: Volume II: Intellect, Taste, and Anxiety'' (1977) 2: 117.</ref>

In 1873, to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between Austria-Hungary, [[Russia]] and [[Germany]]. Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877–1878 [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]] and its influence in the [[Balkans]], the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]; this became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] when Italy joined in 1882.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}{{sfn|Keegan |1998 |p=52}}

The practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three Imperial Powers, and to isolate France. Attempts by Britain in 1880 to resolve colonial tensions with Russia and diplomatic moves by France led to Bismarck reforming the League in 1881.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Medlicott |first1=W.N. |title=Bismarck and the Three Emperors' Alliance, 1881–87 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |date=1945 |volume=27 |pages=66–70 |doi=10.2307/3678575 |jstor=3678575}}</ref> When the League finally lapsed in 1887, it was replaced by the [[Reinsurance Treaty]], a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.

In 1890, the new German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], forced Bismarck to retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by the new [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Leo von Caprivi]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keenan |first1=George |title=The Fateful Alliance: France, Russia and the Coming of the First World War |date=1986 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0719017070 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/20 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/20 }}</ref> This allowed France to counteract the Triple Alliance with the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894 and the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Britain, while in 1907 Britain and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. The agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility. These interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Willmott15>{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=15}}</ref> British backing of France against Germany during the [[Second Moroccan Crisis]] in 1911 reinforced the Entente between the two countries (and with Russia as well) and increased Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would erupt in 1914.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sidney B. |last=Fay |title=The Origins of the World War |edition=2nd |date=1930 |volume=1 |pages=290–293}}</ref>

===Arms race===
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-23, Linienschiff "SMS Rheinland".jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|{{SMS|Rheinland}}, a {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}, Germany's first response to the British ''Dreadnought'']]

The creation of the German Reich following victory in the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to a massive increase in Germany's economic and industrial strength. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Wilhelm II, who became Emperor in 1890, sought to use this to create a ''Kaiserliche Marine'' or [[Imperial German Navy]] to compete with Britain's [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.<ref name=willmott21/> In doing so, he was influenced by US naval strategist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Mahan]], who argued possession of a [[blue-water navy]] was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz translated his books into German, and Wilhelm made them required reading.<ref>Holger Herwig,"The Failure of German Sea Power, 1914–1945: Mahan, Tirpitz, and Raeder Reconsidered", ''The International History Review'', 10:1 (February 1988), 72–73.</ref> However, it was also driven by Wilhelm's admiration of the Royal Navy and desire to outdo it.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moll |last2=Kendall |first1=Luebbert |first2=Gregory |title=Arms Race and Military Expenditure Models: A Review |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=1980 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=153–185 |jstor=173938|doi=10.1177/002200278002400107 |s2cid=155405415 }}</ref>

This resulted in the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]. Yet the launch of {{HMS |Dreadnought |1906 |6}} in 1906 gave the Royal Navy a technological advantage over its German rival, which they never lost.<ref name=willmott21>{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=21}}</ref> Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources to creating a German navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it. In 1911, Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] acknowledged defeat, leading to the ''Rüstungswende'' or ‘armaments turning point', when Germany switched expenditure from the navy to the army.{{sfn|Stevenson|2016|p=45}}

This was driven by Russia's recovery from the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], specifically increased investment post-1908 in railways and infrastructure in its western border regions. Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere. When Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the [[Balkans|Balkan powers]] and Italy, which led to increased expenditure by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and Austria-Hungary. Absolute figures are hard to calculate, due to differences in categorising expenditure, while they often omit civilian infrastructure projects with a military use, such as railways. However, from 1908 to 1913, defence spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real terms.{{sfn|Stevenson|2016|p=42}}

===Conflicts in the Balkans===

In October 1908, Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|had occupied]] since 1878. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]]. The Balkans came to be known as the "[[powder keg of Europe]]".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=48–49}} The [[Italo-Turkish War]] in the 1911–1912 was a significant precursor of the World War I as it sparked [[nationalism]] in the Balkan states and paved the way for the [[Balkan Wars]].<ref>{{cite book |lccn=2012515665 |last=Clark |first=Christopher M. |author-link=Christopher Clark |isbn=9780713999426 |title=The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 |location=London |publisher=[[Allen Lane]] |year=2012 |pages=251–252}}</ref>

In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent [[Albania]]n state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], by the end of which it lost most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Serbia and Greece, and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania, further destabilising the region.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |pp=2–23}} The [[Great Powers]] were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

===Sarajevo assassination===
{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}
[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb |This picture is usually associated with the arrest of [[Gavrilo Princip]], although some<ref name="FinestoneMassie">{{cite book |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Finestone |first2=Robert K. |last2=Massie |title=The last courts of Europe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-1cvAAAAMAAJ |page=247}} |year=1981 |publisher=Dent |page=247}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith |2010}} believe it depicts Ferdinand Behr, a bystander.]]

On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir presumptive to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], and [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], who had been supplied with arms by the Serbian [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade was to pass, with the intention of assassinating him. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces, which Austria-Hungary had annexed from the Ottoman Empire, so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia.

Čabrinović threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car but missed. Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Ferdinand's convoy carried on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.

About an hour later, when Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, Princip stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Although they were reportedly not personally close, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was profoundly shocked and upset. The reaction among the people in Austria, however, was mild, almost indifferent. As historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]] later wrote, "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday (28 and 29 June), the crowds in [[Vienna]] listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo |title=European powers maintain focus despite killings in Sarajevo &nbsp;– This Day in History |date=30 June 1914 |publisher=History.com |access-date=26 December 2013}}</ref>{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=26}} Nevertheless, the political effect of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and was described by historian [[Christopher Clark]] on the BBC Radio{{nbsp}}4 series ''Month of Madness'' as a "[[September 11 attacks#Effects|9/11 effect]], a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna."<ref name="Christopher Clark 2014">{{cite AV media |title=Month of Madness |first=Christopher |last=Clark |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t7p27}}</ref>

=== July Crisis ===
{{Main|July Crisis|German entry into World War I|Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I|Russian entry into World War I}}

The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvering between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain, called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary correctly believed that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) had been involved in the plot to murder the Archduke, and wanted to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia.{{sfn |Stevenson |1996 |p=12}} On 23{{nbsp}}July, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the [[July Crisis#Austro-Hungarian ultimatum (23 July)|July Ultimatum]], a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |p=27}} Serbia decreed general mobilisation on 25{{nbsp}}July. Serbia accepted all the terms of the ultimatum except for article six, which demanded that Austrian delegates be allowed in Serbia for the purpose of participation in the investigation into the assassination.<ref>Fromkin, David; ''Europe's Last Summer: Why the World Went to War in 1914'', Heinemann, 2004; pp. 196–97.</ref> Following this, Austria broke off diplomatic relations with Serbia and, the next day, ordered a partial mobilisation. Finally, on 28 July 1914, a month after the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910. [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed]] in 1908.]]
On 25{{nbsp}}July, Russia, in support of Serbia, declared partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary.<ref>L. F. C. Turner, "The Russian Mobilization in 1914." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 3.1 (1968): 65-88 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259967 online].</ref> On 30{{nbsp}}July, Russia ordered general mobilisation. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg waited until the 31st for an appropriate response, when Germany declared ''Erklärung des Kriegszustandes'', or "Statement on the war status".<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite journal |date=31 July 1914 |title=Verordnung, betreffend die Erklärung des Kriegszustandes |language=de |journal=Reichs-gesetzblatt |lccn=14013198}}</ref> Kaiser Wilhelm II asked his cousin, Tsar [[Nicolas II]], to suspend the Russian general mobilisation. When he refused, Germany issued an ultimatum demanding its mobilisation be stopped, and a commitment not to support Serbia. Another was sent to France, asking her not to support Russia if it were to come to the defence of Serbia. On 1{{nbsp}}August, after the Russian response, Germany mobilised and declared war on Russia. This also led to the general mobilisation in Austria-Hungary on 4{{nbsp}}August.

The German government issued demands to France that it remain neutral whilst they decided which deployment plan to implement, it being extremely difficult to change the deployment once it was underway. The modified German [[Schlieffen Plan]], ''Aufmarsch II West'', would deploy 80% of the army in the west, while ''Aufmarsch I Ost'' and ''Aufmarsch II Ost'' would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east. The French did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border to avoid any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of their reserves. Germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing ''Aufmarsch II West''. The British cabinet decided on 29 July that being a signatory to the 1839 treaty about Belgium did not oblige it to oppose a German invasion of Belgium with military force.<ref>Christopher  Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers'' (2012) p. 539.</ref>

On 1 August, Wilhelm ordered General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] to "march the whole of the{{nbsp}}... army to the East" after being informed that Britain would remain neutral if France was not attacked (and, possibly, that her hands might, in any case, be stayed by crisis in Ireland).<ref>{{cite news|title=On This Day, March 24, 1917.

Yet Wilhelm insisted that the German army should not march into Luxembourg until he received a telegram sent by his cousin [[George V]], who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. Eventually the Kaiser told Moltke, "Now you can do what you want."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11002644/First-World-War-centenary-how-events-unfolded-on-August-1-1914.html|title=First World War centenary: how the events of August 1 1914 unfolded|first=Richard|last=Preston|date=1 August 2014|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>McMeekin, Sean, July 1914: Countdown to War, Basic Books, 2014, 480 p., {{ISBN|978-0465060740}}, pp. 342, 349</ref>

For years, the French had been aware of intelligence indicating that Germany planned to attack France through Belgium. General [[Joseph Joffre]], chief of staff of the French military from 1911, inquired about the possibility of moving some French troops into Belgium to preempt such a move by Germany, but France's civilian leadership rejected this idea. Joffre was told that France would not be the first power to violate Belgian neutrality and that any French move into Belgium could come only after the Germans had already invaded.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Margaret MacMillan|last=MacMillan|first=Margaret|title=The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2013|isbn=9780812994704|pages=565–568 (e-book)}}</ref> On 2 August, [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|Germany occupied Luxembourg]], and on 3{{nbsp}}August declared war on France; on the same day, they sent the Belgian government an ultimatum demanding unimpeded right of way through any part of Belgium, which was refused.

==Progress of the war==
{{Further|Diplomatic history of World War I}}

===Opening hostilities===
====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |pp=292–296, 343–354}}<!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --> Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

====Serbian campaign====
{{Main|Serbian Campaign of World War I}}
[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumb|Serbian Army [[Blériot XI]] "Oluj", 1915]]

Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara]] beginning on 12 August. Over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory.

{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}

[[File:Georges Scott, A la baïonnette !.jpg|thumb|A French bayonet charge at the [[Battle of the Frontiers]]; by the end of August, French casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.]]

When the war began, the [[German Army order of battle (1914)|German Order of Battle]] placed 80% of the army in the West, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East. The plan was to quickly knock France out of the war, then redeploy to the East and do the same to Russia.

The German offensive in the West was officially titled ''Aufmarsch II West,'' but is better known as the Schlieffen Plan, after its original creator. [[Alfred von Schlieffen|Schlieffen]] deliberately kept the German left (i.e. its positions in [[Alsace-Lorraine]]) weak to lure the French into attacking there, while the majority were allocated to the German right, so as to sweep through Belgium, encircle Paris and trap the French armies against the Swiss border (the French charged into Alsace-Lorraine on the outbreak of war as envisaged by their [[Plan XVII]], thus actually aiding this strategy).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horne |first1=Alistair |title=The Price of Glory |url=https://archive.org/details/priceofgloryverd00horn |url-access=registration |date=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0140170412 |page=[https://archive.org/details/priceofgloryverd00horn/page/22 22] |edition=1993}}</ref> However, Schlieffen's successor Moltke grew concerned that the French might push too hard on his left flank. Consequently, as the German Army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the German right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30. Ultimately, Moltke's changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.{{sfn |Holmes |2014 |pp=194, 211}}{{Dubious|date=November 2018}}

The initial German advance in the West was very successful: by the end of August the Allied left, which included the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), was in [[Great Retreat|full retreat]]; French casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]].{{sfn |Stevenson |2012 |p=54}} German planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Julian |title=A Certain Idea of France: The Life of Charles de Gaulle |date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=978-1846143519 |page=55}}</ref> The French and British exploited this gap to halt the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] from 5{{nbsp}}to 12 September and push the German forces back some {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome, and it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=376–378}} This amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the Marne, [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]] told an American reporter; "We have lost the war.

====African campaigns====
{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}

Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]] and [[Kamerun]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign during World War{{nbsp}}I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.{{sfn |Farwell |1989 |p=353}}

====Trench warfare begins====
[[File:Cheshire Regiment trench Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|Trenches of the 11th [[Cheshire Regiment]] at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], July 1916]]

Military tactics developed before World War I failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while [[artillery]], vastly<!--between HE }} hydraulic recoil mechanisms, something like two orders of magnitude--> more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine gun]]s, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=424}} Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for [[Trench warfare|breaching entrenched]] positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas warfare]] and the [[Tanks in World War I|tank]].{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |pp=421–423}}

After the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5–12 September 1914), Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the "[[Race to the Sea]]". By the end of 1914, the opposing forces were left confronting each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from [[Alsace]] to Belgium's North Sea coast.<ref name=AJPT2/> Since the Germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since Anglo-French trenches were initially intended as "temporary," and would only be needed until the breaking of German defences.{{sfn |Goodspeed |1985 |p=199 (footnote)}}

Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (violating the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |access-date=5 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn |Love |1996}} Tanks were developed by Britain and France and were first used in combat by the British during the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.

====Continuation of trench warfare====

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. Strategically, while the Germans mounted only one major offensive, the Allies made several attempts to break through the German lines.

In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the [[Battle of Verdun]], lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000{{sfn |Dupuy |1993 |p=1042}} to 975,000{{sfn |Grant |2005 |p=276}} casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/verdun-myths-and-memories-of-the-lost-villages-of-france-5335493.html |title=Verdun: myths and memories of the 'lost villages' of France |last=Lichfield |first=John |date=21 February 2006 |work=The Independent |access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref>

The [[Battle of the Somme]] was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The [[first day on the Somme|opening day]] of the offensive (1 July 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the [[British Army]], suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000.{{sfn |Harris |2008 |p=271}} Gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides.

Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916,{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1221}} combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using [[frontal assault]] came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread [[French Army Mutinies]], after the failure of the costly [[Nivelle Offensive]] of April–May 1917.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=854}} The concurrent British [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=325–326}}{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |p=244}} A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]], became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.{{sfn |Inglis |1995 |p=2}}{{sfn |Humphries |2007 |p=66}}

The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.

The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German [[Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917|tactics constantly evolved]] to meet new battlefield challenges.

===Naval war===

At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. Before the beginning of the war, it was widely understood that Britain held the position of strongest, most influential navy in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://warandsecurity.com/2014/08/04/the-naval-balance-of-power-in-1914/ |title=The Naval Balance of Power in 1914 |date=4 August 2014 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=Looks to be a [[WP:SPS|SPS]] blog post.|date=May 2018}} The publishing of the book ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'' by Alfred Thayer Mahan in 1890 was intended to encourage the United States to increase their naval power.

The German flotilla and {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was virtually destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too had been destroyed or interned.{{sfn |Taylor |2007 |pp=39–47}}

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.{{sfn|Keene |2006 |p=5}} Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.{{sfn|Halpern |1995 |p=293}} Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.{{sfn|Zieger |2001 |p=50}}

The [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the [[Skagerrak]]") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. It was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. The Kaiserliche Marine's [[High Seas Fleet]], commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], fought the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeremy Black |title=Jutland's Place in History |journal=Naval History |date=June 2016 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=16–21}}</ref>

After the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the "[[Prize rules|cruiser rules]]", which demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet).{{sfn |von der Porten |1969}} Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], realising the Americans would eventually enter the war.<ref name="Sheffield"/>{{sfn|Jones |2001 |p=80}} Germany sought to strangle Allied [[sea lane]]s before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.<ref name="Sheffield"/>

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in [[Convoys in World War I|convoys]], escorted by [[destroyer]]s. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters.

Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy.

Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 12 October 1915 and joined in the attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000 that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. The Serbs suffered defeat in the [[Kosovo Offensive (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=1075–1076}} After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=102}}

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers. However, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] before the Allied expeditionary force arrived.{{sfn |Neiberg |2005 |pp=108–110}} The friction between the King of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the [[National Schism]], which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica. After intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as [[Noemvriana]]), the King of Greece resigned and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place; Greece officially joined the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917.

The Macedonian front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 following the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilisation of the front.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Richard |title=Balkan Breakthrough: The Battle of Dobro Pole 1918 |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=11 |isbn=978-0-253-35452-5}}</ref>

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918 in the [[Vardar Offensive]], after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]], and by 25 September British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September 1918.{{sfn |Tucker |Wood |Murphy |1999 |pp=150–152}} The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.<ref name=militera>{{cite web |url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html |title=The Balkan Front of the World War |language=ru |first=N. |last=Korsun |publisher=militera.lib.ru |access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref>

The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.{{sfn|Doughty |2005 |p=491}}

The Ottomans threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. As the conflict progressed, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian populations, known as the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]], and [[Assyrian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Gettleman |editor1-first=Marvin |editor2-last=Schaar |editor2-first=Stuart |title=The Middle East and Islamic world reader |date=2003 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8021-3936-8 |pages=119–120 |edition=4th |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=srLGT3dwTogC}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=January |first1=Brendan |title=Genocide : modern crimes against humanity |date=2007 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |location=Minneapolis, Minn. |isbn=978-0-7613-3421-7 |page=14 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IoPMDp2WA6cC}}}}</ref><ref name=lieberman>{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=The Holocaust and Genocides in Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Continuum Publishing Corporation |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9478-7 |pages=80–81 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ySFMAQAAQBAJ}}}}</ref>

The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In [[Mesopotamia]], by contrast, after the defeat of the British defenders in the [[Siege of Kut]] by the Ottomans (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian tribesmen, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and Turcoman tribes.<ref>Arthur J.

Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the [[Battle of Romani]] by the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]] and the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]. Following this victory, an [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] advanced across the [[Sinai Peninsula]], pushing Ottoman forces back in the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December and the [[Battle of Rafa]] on the border between the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.<ref>{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Crawford |first2=Ian |last2=McGibbon |title=New Zealand's Great War: New Zealand, the Allies and the First World War |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mtEEuD_-2SMC |page=219}} |year=2007 |publisher=Exisle Publishing |pages=219–220}}</ref>

Russian armies generally had success in the [[Caucasus campaign]]. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.{{sfn|Fromkin |2004 |p=119}} He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter.

The Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]) in December 1914 in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to [[petroleum reservoir]]s around [[Baku]] near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>a b c The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.403</ref> Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence.

The [[Persian Campaign]] was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia.<ref>a b c d e f g {{harvnb|Northcote |1922 |p=788}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2020}}</ref>

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.<ref name=caven/> During the 1916 campaign, the Russians defeated the Turks in the [[Erzurum Offensive]], also [[Trebizond Campaign|occupying Trabzon]]. In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Tsar abdicated in the course of the [[February Revolution]], and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

The [[Arab Revolt]], instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign Office]], started June 1916 with the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]] before surrendering in January 1919.{{sfn |Sachar |1970 |pp=122–138}}

The [[Senussi]] tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the [[Senussi Campaign]]. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.{{sfn |Gilbert |1994}}

Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men.

Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Trentino]], the [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (Rijeka) and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its part in the Triple Alliance;<ref>{{cite book |first=Hall |last=Gardner |title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=631TBgAAQBAJ |page=120}} |year=2015 |publisher=Ashgate |page=120}}</ref> Italy secretly agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany.<ref name="Seymour" /> At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Southern Tyrol]], Austrian Littoral and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later, Italy declared war on Germany.<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas Nelson |last=Page |title=Italy and the world war |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nQgyAQAAIAAJ |page=142}} |year=1920 |publisher=Scribners |pages=142–208}}</ref>

[[File:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Austro-Hungarian troops, Tyrol]]

The Italians had numerical superiority, but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which the fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed.<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall|page=108}}{{Full citation needed|date=September 2019}}</ref> [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening Vienna.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress and were defeated by the Italians.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Thompson |title=The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915–1919 |location=London |publisher=Faber and Faber |page=163 |isbn=978-0-571-22334-3 }}</ref>

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo]] (Soča) River, northeast of [[Trieste]]. Of these eleven offensives, five were won by Italy, three remained inconclusive, and the other three were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the [[Battle of Doberdò]], the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the [[Banjšice Plateau|Banjšice]] and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.

The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans, and achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] ([[Kobarid]]). The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} to reorganise. The new Italian chief of staff, [[Armando Diaz]], ordered the Army to stop their retreat and defend the [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] summit, where fortified defenses were constructed; the Italians repelled the Austro-Hungarian and German Army, and stabilised the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since the Italian Army had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Caporetto, the Italian Government ordered conscription of the so-called ''{{'}}99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99''): all males born in 1899 and prior, who were 18 years old or older. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the Piave and were finally decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October. On 1{{nbsp}}November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in [[Pula]], preventing it from being handed over to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 3{{nbsp}}November, the Italians invaded Trieste from the sea. On the same day, the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] was signed.

Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. On 4{{nbsp}}August 1916, Romania and the Entente signed the Political Treaty and Military Convention, that established the coordinates of Romania's participation in the war. In return, it received the Allies' formal sanction for [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]] and other territories of Austria-Hungary to be annexed to Romania. The action had large popular support.<ref>Laurentiu-Cristian Dumitru, Preliminaries of Romania's entering the World War I,

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and [[Bolshevik]] Russian governments following talks between 5{{nbsp}}and 9{{nbsp}}March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia, inhabited by a Romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.{{sfn|Clark|1927}}

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7{{nbsp}}May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 against the Central Powers. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=Erdély története |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=History of Transylvania |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html |isbn=978-84-8371-020-3 |year=1998}}</ref> Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Потери народонаселения в 20. веке |language=ru |trans-title=The loss of population in the 20th Century |last=Erlikman |first=Vadim |year=2004 |location=Moscow |publisher=Русская панорама |isbn=978-5931651071}}</ref>

===Eastern Front===

====Initial actions====

Russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and East Prussia. Although Russia's initial [[Battle of Galicia|advance into Galicia]] was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at the battles of Tannenberg and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=715}}{{sfn |Meyer |2006 |pp=152–154, 161, 163, 175, 182}} Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership were instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated from Galicia, and, in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers with their [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]].<ref name="Smele">{{harvnb |Smele}}</ref> On 5{{nbsp}}August, they captured [[Warsaw]] and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.

Despite Russia's success in the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] against the Austrians in eastern Galicia,{{sfn |Schindler |2003}} the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other Russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only briefly by [[Romania during World War I|Romania's entry into the war]] on 27 August, as Romania was rapidly defeated by a Central Powers offensive. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsar]] remained at the front. The increasingly incompetent rule of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

====Russian Revolution====
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Territory lost under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]]]
In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Neiberg |first1=Michael |title=The Cambridge History of the First World War |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=110–132 |edition=1st}}</ref>

Following the Tsar's abdication, [[Vladimir Lenin]]—with the help of the German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia 16 April 1917.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Germany got the Russian Revolution off the ground |url=https://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-got-the-russian-revolution-off-the-ground/a-41195312 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 November 2017}}</ref> Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3{{nbsp}}March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wheeler-Bennett|first1=John W.|title=Brest-Litovsk : The forgotten peace |date=1938 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |pages=36–41}}</ref> Despite this enormous German success, the manpower required by the Germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of their [[Spring Offensive]], and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]] for the Central Powers war effort.

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the [[White movement|"Whites"]] (as opposed to the "Reds") in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn |Mawdsley |2007 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/russiancivilwar00evan/page/54 54–55]}} Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk]] and in [[Vladivostok]] as part of the [[North Russia Intervention]].

====Czechoslovak Legion====
{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}
[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Czechoslovak Legion]], Vladivostok, 1918]]

The Czechoslovak Legion fought on the side of the Entente. Its goal was to win support for the independence of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The Legion in Russia was established in September 1914, in December 1917 in [[French Third Republic|France]] (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Czechoslovak Legion troops defeated the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army at the Ukrainian village of [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]], in July 1917. After this success, the number of Czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as Czechoslovak military power. In the [[Battle of Bakhmach]], the Legion defeated the Germans and forced them to make a truce.

In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War, siding with the Whites against the [[Bolsheviks]], at times controlling most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and conquering all the major cities of [[Siberia]]. The presence of the Czechoslovak Legion near [[Yekaterinburg]] appears to have been one of the motivations for the Bolshevik [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execution of the Tsar and his family]] in July 1918. Legionaries arrived less than a week afterwards and captured the city. Because Russia's European ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of Vladivostok. The last transport was the American ship Heffron in September 1920.

===Central Powers peace overtures===

On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a [[Romania during World War I#The counteroffensive of the Central Powers (September–December 1916)|successful offensive against Romania]], Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies.<ref name=lanoszka>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/11/why-the-first-world-war-lasted-so-long/? |author=Alexander Lanoszka |author2=Michael A.

Soon after, the US president, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721–766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.

===1917–1918===
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

====Developments in 1917====

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before American intervention could have an effect. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.

On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall|page=292}}{{Full citation needed|date=September 2019}}</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

The victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.{{sfn|Heyman |1997 |pp=146–147}}

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. Italy opposed the proposals. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.{{sfn|Kurlander |2006}}{{sfn|Shanafelt |1985 |pp=125–130}}

In early 1918, the front line was [[Capture of Jericho (1918)|extended]] and the [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|Jordan Valley]] was occupied, following the [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|First Transjordan]] and the [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|Second Transjordan]] attacks by British Empire forces in March and April 1918.{{sfn|Erickson |2001 |p=195}} In March, most of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's British infantry and [[Yeomanry]] cavalry were sent to the Western Front as a consequence of the Spring Offensive. They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.

The reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918. In two days the British and Indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)]] at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], the continuous trench lines at [[Battle of Tabsor (1918)|Tabsor]], [[Battle of Arara|Arara]], and the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)]] headquarters at [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]]. The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry. During virtually continuous operations by [[Australian Light Horse]], British mounted Yeomanry, Indian [[Lancers]], and New Zealand [[Mounted Riflemen|Mounted Rifle]] brigades in the [[Jezreel Valley]], they captured [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]], [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah and Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]], along with [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Haifa]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Daraa]] east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway. [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]] and [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]] were captured on the way northwards to [[Damascus]]. Meanwhile, [[Third Transjordan attack|Chaytor's Force]] of Australian light horse, New Zealand mounted rifles, Indian, British West Indies and Jewish infantry captured the crossings of the [[Jordan River]], [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]], [[Amman]] and at Ziza most of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)]]. The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of [[Aleppo]].

====15 August 1917: Peace offer by the Pope====
{{See also|Pope Benedict XV#Peace efforts}}
On or shortly before 15 August 1917 [[Pope Benedict XV]] made a peace proposal<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Wednesday 15 August 1917, reprinted on p. 26 of ''Daily Telegraph'' Tuesday 15 August 2017</ref> suggesting:
* No annexations
* No indemnities, except to compensate for severe war damage in Belgium and parts of France and of Serbia
* A solution to the problems of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]]
* Restoration of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]
* Germany to pull out of Belgium and France
* Germany's overseas colonies to be returned to Germany
* General disarmament
* A Supreme Court of arbitration to settle future disputes between nations
* The freedom of the seas
* Abolish all retaliatory economic conflicts
* No point in ordering reparations, because so much damage had been caused to all belligerents

====Entry of the United States====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

At the outbreak of the war, the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When the German U-boat [[SM U-20 (Germany)|''U-20'']] [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sank the British liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7{{nbsp}}May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] insisted that America is "too proud to fight" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. However, he also repeatedly warned that the United States would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced German acts as "piracy".{{sfn |Brands |1997 |p=756}} Wilson was narrowly re-elected in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]] after campaigning with the slogan "he kept us out of war".<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/354921942/ "Wilson for 'America First'"], ''[[The Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' (12 October 1915).</ref><ref>Cooper, John Milton.

[[File:USA bryter de diplomatiska förbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917]]

In January 1917, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, in the hopes of starving Britain into surrender. Germany did this realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.<ref name="Karp-PoW-1979">{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}</ref> After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2{{nbsp}}April 1917,<ref>[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany"]] (Wikisource)</ref> which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4{{nbsp}}days later]].

The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8&nbsp;million men,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |access-date=27 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211238/http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |archive-date=7 May 2009}}</ref> and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the US Congress granted US citizenship to Puerto Ricans to allow them to be drafted to participate in World War{{nbsp}}I, as part of the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]]. German General Staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the British and French forces before American troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=David |title=The Kaiser's Army: The German Army in World War One |date=2014 |publisher=COnway |location=London |isbn=978-1844862924}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Ireland]], and [[submarine]]s to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[US Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as filler material. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, and earned a unit [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Château-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and Sechault.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=US [[National Archives and Records Administration]] |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I |access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604163502/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |archive-date=4 June 2009}}</ref> AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.{{sfn |Millett |Murray |1988 |p=143}}

A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference on 5 November 1917. General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently. General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing still sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March 1918.

====German Spring Offensive of 1918====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}
[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]

Ludendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<ref>{{harvnb |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2020}}</ref>

[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British [[55th (West Lancashire) Division]] soldiers blinded by tear gas during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]], 10 April 1918]]

The front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.

====New states enter the war====
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{sfn|Hovannisian |1967 |pp=1–39}}

===Allied victory: summer 1918 onwards===

====Hundred Days Offensive====

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], began on 8{{nbsp}}August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]. The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British, [[Dominion]], and French troops, and by the end of its first day a gap {{convert|24|km|mi}} long had been created in the German lines. The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Vanwell |orig-year=1977 |year=2004 |title=Shock Army of the British Empire: The Canadian Corps in the Last 100 Days of the Great War |last=Schreiber |first=Shane B. |place=St. Catharines, ON |isbn=978-1-55125-096-0 |oclc=57063659}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}</ref>{{sfn |Rickard |2001}}<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Pan |orig-year=1998 |year=1999 |title=1918: Year of Victory |last=Brown |first=Malcolm |place=London |isbn=978-0-330-37672-3 |page=190}}</ref> After an advance as far as {{convert|23|km|mi|0}}, German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.

Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name="Pitt-1962">{{harvnb |Pitt |2003}}</ref>

The day after the Offensive began, Ludendorff said: "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended."{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could continue the war only until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. [[Prince Rupprecht]] warned [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]]: "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier."<ref name="Chron-FWW" />

=====Battle of Albert=====

British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]] on 21 August.{{sfn |Terraine |1963}} The assault was widened by French<ref name="Chron-FWW">{{harvnb |Gray |Argyle |1990}}</ref> and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the Allied pressure along a {{convert|110|km|mi|0|adj=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."<ref name="Pitt-1962" />

Faced with these advances, on 2 September the German ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'' ("Supreme Army Command") issued orders to withdraw in the south to the [[Hindenburg Line]]. This ceded without a fight the [[Salient (territory)|salient]] seized the previous April.{{sfn |Nicholson |1962}} According to Ludendorff, "We had to admit the necessity&nbsp;... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle."{{sfn |Ludendorff |1919}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning on 8{{nbsp}}August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken. The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected.<ref name="Chron-FWW" />

====Allied advance to the Hindenburg Line====

In September the Allies [[Hundred Days Offensive#Advance to the Hindenburg Line|advanced to the Hindenburg Line]] in the north and centre. The Germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September an assault by both the British and French came within {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} of St. Quentin. The Germans had now retreated to positions along or behind the Hindenburg Line.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=380}}{{sfn |Hull |2006 |pp=307–310}}{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=383}} The Americans supplied more than 80% of Allied oil during the war, and there was no shortage.{{sfn |Painter |2012 |p=25 |<!-- ps=.

====German Revolution 1918–1919====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R72520, Kiel, Novemberrevolution, Matrosenaufstand.jpg|thumb|[[German Revolution]], Kiel, 1918]]

News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy.

In northern Germany, the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]], which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel]], spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9{{nbsp}}November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kurkuhl.de/docs/kieler_14punkte.pdf |author=K.

====New German government surrenders====
With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government on 3{{nbsp}}October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=385}} There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9{{nbsp}}November declared Germany to be a republic. The Kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and Wilhelm fled to exile in [[the Netherlands]]. It was the end of Imperial Germany, a new Germany had been born as the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |loc=Chapter 17}}

On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3{{nbsp}}November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3{{nbsp}}November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the following days the Italian Army occupied [[Innsbruck]] and all [[Tyrol]] with over 20,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andrea di Michele |title=Trento, Bolzano e Innsbruck: l'occupazione militare italiana del Tirolo (1918–1920) |language=it |trans-title=Trento, Bolzano and Innsbruck: The Italian Military Occupation of Tyrol (1918–1920) |journal=Trento e Trieste.

On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros.<ref name="indiana.edu-1918"/>

On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne. At 11&nbsp;am on 11 November 1918—"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"—a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. The [[occupation of the Rhineland]] took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185–188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58&nbsp;billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25&nbsp;billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21&nbsp;billion and the US$17&nbsp;billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerd |last=Hardach |title=The First World War, 1914–1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1977 |page=[https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard/page/153 153] |isbn=0-520-03060-5 |postscript=none }}, using estimated made by {{cite book |first=H. |last=Menderhausen |title=The Economics of War |location=New York |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1941 |page=305 |oclc=774042 }}</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}
In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian. Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]], the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]]s, and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]]. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4&nbsp;million soldiers dead,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm "France's oldest WWI veteran dies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm |date=28 October 2016 }}, ''BBC News'', 20 January 2008.</ref> not counting other casualties.

===Formal end of the war===

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastedt |first=Glenn P. |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2009 |page=483 |isbn=978-1-4381-0989-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Murrin |first1=John |last2=Johnson |first2=Paul |last3=McPherson |first3=James |last4=Gerstle |first4=Gary |last5=Fahs |first5=Alice|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People |publisher=Cengage Learning |volume=II |date=2010 |page=622 |isbn=978-0-495-90383-3}}</ref> and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]] was signed on 2{{nbsp}}July 1921 by President [[Warren G.

After the Treaty of Versailles, treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the negotiation of the treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]] was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918.<ref>http://www.warmemorials.org/uploads/publications/117.pdf</ref> Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

===Peace treaties and national boundaries===
[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|thumb|300px|[[Dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] after war]]
After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] dealt with Germany and, building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.{{sfn |Magliveras |1999 |pp=8–12}}{{sfn |Northedge |1986 |pp=35–36}}

The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement was [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]]. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.<ref>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Morrow |title=The Great War: An Imperial History |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-20440-8 |page=290}}</ref> Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the "[[diktat]] of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."<ref>{{cite book |first=Hagen |last=Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=B84ZaAdGbS4C |page=204}} |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard U.P. |page=204}}</ref> Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s:
<blockquote>Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. The legend of the "[[stab in the back]]" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics. Even a man of peace such as <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Gustav Stresemann|Gustav]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt. As for the Nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of revenge. Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurence Van |last=Ypersele |title=Mourning and Memory, 1919–45 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Horne |work=A Companion to World War I |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EjZHLXRKjtEC |page=584}} |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley |page=584}}</ref></blockquote>

Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ethomp/The%20Surrogate%20Hegemon.pdf|title=The Surrogate Hegemon in Polish Postcolonial Discourse Ewa Thompson, Rice University}}</ref> The Peace Conference required all the defeated powers to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all the damage done to civilians. However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany.

Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3&nbsp;million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up approximately 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (according to the [[Ethnic and religious composition of Austria-Hungary#Transleithanian states|1910 census]]), only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Károly |last1=Kocsis |first2=Eszter Kocsisné |last2=Hodosi |title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin |year=1998 |isbn=978-963-7395-84-0 |page=19}}</ref>

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[History of Estonia#Road to the republic|Estonia]], [[History of Finland#Independence and Civil War|Finland]], [[History of Latvia#Independence|Latvia]], [[History of Lithuania#Independent Lithuania (1918–40)|Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918.{{sfn |Clark |1927}}

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, with much of its [[Levant]] territory awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core in [[Anatolia]] was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

Though by 1923 most countries had made peace treaties, [[Andorra]] was an exception. Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914. At that time, it had an army of 600 part-time military men, commanded by two officials. Andorra had a very small population, so it never sent soldiers to the battlefield. Andorra was therefore not allowed to attend the Treaty of Versailles. The country finally concluded a peace treaty with Germany in 1958.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://everything-everywhere.com/8-facts-about-andorra/ | title=8 Facts You Might Not Have Known About Andorra| date=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://halfapage.com/44-year-war-germany-andorra/ | title=The 44-year war between Germany and Andorra| date=3 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/wars-that-were-extended-by-quirks-of-diplomacy-2015-12?IR=T/#andorra-and-the-german-empire-6 | title=9 wars that were technically ongoing due to quirks of diplomacy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/worldwarone/25-things-you-might-not-know-about-world-war-one/5546018 | title=25 things you might not know about WWI| date=24 June 2014}}</ref>

Czechoslovakia, combining the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new nation. Russia became the [[Soviet Union]] and lost Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, which became independent countries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.

In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]]. [[Anzac Day]], commemorating the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), celebrates this defining moment.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1916/04/26/archives/anzac-day-in-london-king-queen-and-general-birdwood-at-services-in.html |title='ANZAC Day' in London; King, Queen, and General Birdwood at Services in Abbey |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 April 1916}}</ref><ref name="awmtradition">{{Cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp |title=The ANZAC Day tradition |last=Australian War Memorial |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501163212/http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp |archive-date=1 May 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=2 May 2008}}</ref>

World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82–86}} and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies<!--- surely most companies at the start of the war had more than 200-men!---> were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H. (2008). ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century''. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-732-6}} p. 444.</ref> [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

[[File:Austin21.jpg|thumb|A Russian armoured car, 1919]]

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in using heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42–48}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}</ref>

[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm "[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]

On 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed "[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750&nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Much of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War{{nbsp}}I. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

[[File:Mustard gas burns.jpg|thumb |left|A Canadian soldier with [[mustard gas]] burns, c. 1917–1918]]

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included chlorine, [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] (as opposed to [[tactical bombing]]) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future "gas wars" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>

The most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.<ref>{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|"Heavy Railroad Artillery"}}</ref> The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).

[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]

Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War{{nbsp}}I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].

Another new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

====Areas taken in major attacks====
[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0]]

On the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai—the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.

The areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the First Masurian Lakes driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at Gorlice–Tarnów, which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.

Germany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive [[sonar]], 1917), blimps, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name="price1980"/> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916).

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref name="Cross 1991">{{harvnb |Cross |1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS ''Furious'' launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.{{sfn |Cross |1991 |pp=56–57}}

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,{{sfn |Winter |1983}} so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}</ref>

Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name="Cross 1991"/><ref name=FullCircle/>

The Canadian hospital ship {{HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} was torpedoed by the German submarine [[SM U-86]] on 27 June 1918 in violation of international law. Only 24 of the 258 medical personnel, patients, and crew survived. Survivors reported that the U-boat surfaced and ran down the lifeboats, machine-gunning survivors in the water. The U-boat captain, [[Helmut Patzig]], was charged with war crimes in Germany following the war, but escaped prosecution by going to the [[Free City of Danzig]], beyond the jurisdiction of German courts.<ref name="Davies2013c">{{cite book |first=J.D. |last=Davies |author-link=J.

The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), after German scientists working under the direction of [[Fritz Haber]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] developed a method to weaponize [[chlorine]].{{efn|A German attempt to use chemical weapons on the Russian front in January 1915 failed to cause casualties.}}<ref name="AJPH">{{cite journal |last=Fitzgerald |first=Gerard |title=Chemical Warfare and Medical Response During World War I |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=611–625 |date=April 2008 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.11930 |doi-access=free |pmid=18356568 |pmc=2376985 |quote=<!--In the late afternoon of April 22, 1915, members of a special unit of the German Army opened the valves on more than 6000 steel cylinders arrayed in trenches along their defensive perimeter at Ypres, Belgium.

The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Sir Douglas Haig]] wrote in his diary, "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront.

===Rape of Belgium===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential ''[[francs-tireurs]]'' ([[guerrillas]]) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at [[Leuven|Louvain]]—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.{{sfn |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 1–2, esp. p. 76}} Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories.

About eight million men surrendered and were held in [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]], and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.{{sfn |Phillimore |Bellot |1919 |pp=4–64}} Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered ''en masse''. At the [[Siege of Maubeuge]] about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the [[battle of Galicia]] Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the Brusilov Offensive about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, and at the Battle of Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near [[Przasnysz]] (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the First Battle of the Marne about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5–3.5&nbsp;million men as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.{{sfn |Ferguson |1999 |pp=368–369}} Germany held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9&nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000.

The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.{{sfn |Blair |2005}}{{sfn |Cook |2006 |pp=637–665}} Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War{{nbsp}}II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.

In Russia, when the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as [[forced labour]], e.g., in France until 1920.

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{harvnb |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1001}}</ref> But European socialists split on national lines, with the concept of [[class conflict]] held by radical socialists such as Marxists and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] being overborne by their patriotic support for the war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1069}} Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=884}}

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions.

Once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolsheviks]], the [[Socialist Party of America]], the Italian Socialist Party, and people like [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and their followers in Germany.

[[Benedict XV]], elected to the papacy less than three months into World War{{nbsp}}I, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. In stark contrast to his [[pope Pius X|predecessor]],<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Church |year=1981 |publisher=Burns & Oates |location=London |isbn=978-0-86012-091-9 |translator-first=Margit |translator-last=Resch |volume=9 |series=The Church in the industrial age |first=Roger |last=Aubert |editor=Hubert Jedin |editor2=John Dolan |page=521 |chapter=Chapter 37: The Outbreak of World War I}}</ref> five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. His first encyclical, ''[[Ad beatissimi Apostolorum]]'', given 1{{nbsp}}November 1914, was concerned with this subject. Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers. Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed [[World War I#15 August 1917: peace offer by the Pope|seven-point Peace Note]] of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Who's Who&nbsp;– Pope Benedict XV |publisher=firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/popebenedict.htm}}</ref>

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the British Army, [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the imminence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present),
<blockquote>that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.<ref>''"Merely For the Record": The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.</ref></blockquote>
Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from doing his duty in World War{{nbsp}}I to the best of his abilities.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the US, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,<ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"/> and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pennell |first=Catriona |title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-959058-2}}</ref> The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=584}} The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.<ref>O'Halpin, Eunan, ''The Decline of the Union: British Government in Ireland, 1892–1920'', (Dublin, 1987)</ref> However, opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight.

In 1917, a series of French Army Mutinies led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

On 1–4 May 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], and after them, the workers and soldiers of other Russian cities, led by the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading "Down with the war!" and "all power to the soviets!" The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the [[Russian Provisional Government]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Pipes|title=The Russian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtE54LuhFzEC&pg=PA407|year=1990|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=407|isbn=9780307788573}}</ref> In [[Milan]], in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.<ref name="Seton_6">Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967.

==Conscription==
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription, [[New York City]], 5 June 1917]]

Conscription was common in most European countries. However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries. It was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland and Australia,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Alan J. |last=Ward |title=Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish conscription crisis |journal=Historical Journal |year=1974 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=107–129 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X00005689 }}</ref> and the French Catholics in Canada.

===Canada===
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1917}}
In Canada the issue produced [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|a major political crisis that permanently alienated the Francophones]]. It opened a political gap between [[French Canadian]]s, who believed their true loyalty was to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their British heritage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP12CH2PA3LE.html |title=The Conscription Crisis |publisher=CBC |date=2001}}</ref>

===Australia===

[[File:Melbourne recruiting WWI.jpg|thumb|Military recruitment in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], 1914]]
Australia had a form of conscription at the outbreak of the war, as compulsory military training had been introduced in 1911. However, the ''Defence Act 1903'' provided that unexempted males could be called upon only for home defence during times of war, not overseas service. Prime Minister Billy Hughes wished to amend the legislation to require conscripts to serve overseas, and held two non-binding referendums – [[1916 Australian conscription referendum|one in 1916]] and [[1917 Australian conscription referendum|one in 1917]] – in order to secure public support.<ref name=parl>{{cite news|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ComParl|title=Commonwealth Parliament from 1901 to World War I|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=4 May 2015|access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref> Both were defeated by narrow margins, with farmers, the [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and Irish-Australians combining to campaign for the "No" vote.<ref>J.M.

{{See also|Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War}}
[[File:British recruits August 1914 Q53234.jpg|thumb|British volunteer recruits in [[London]], August 1914]]
In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.<ref>Chelmsford, J.E. "Clergy and Man-Power", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12</ref> Conscription lasted until mid-1919. Due to the political situation in Ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].

===United States===
{{Main|Conscription in the United States#World War I}}
In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.<ref>{{cite book |first=John Whiteclay |last=Chambers |title=To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-02-905820-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/toraisearmydr00cham }}</ref> The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1{{nbsp}}million target in the first six weeks of the war.<ref>{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Zinn |title=A People's History of the United States |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |page=134 |title-link=A People's History of the United States }}{{edition needed|date=September 2019}}</ref> In 1917 10&nbsp;million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24&nbsp;million men that were registered with nearly 3{{nbsp}}million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).

Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for "obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7{{nbsp}}January 1918.

===Austria-Hungary===
Like all the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being "run on colonial lines" and the Slav soldiers as "disaffected". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}</ref>

The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda campaigns]]; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.{{sfn |Stevenson |1988 |p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}<ref>{{cite book |first=Z.

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway, more than a century later.

===Historiography===
Historian Heather Jones argues that the [[historiography]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Heather |last=Jones |title=As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography |journal=[[Historical Journal]] |year=2013 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=857–878 [p. 858] |doi=10.1017/S0018246X13000216 }}</ref>

World War I had a lasting impact on [[social memory]]. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mark David |last=Sheftall |title=Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada |location=London |publisher=I. B. Tauris |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84511-883-9 }}</ref> Historian [[Samuel Hynes]] explained:

{{quote |A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.<ref name="Hynes1991"/>}}

This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name="Hynes1991">{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |author-link=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i–xii}}</ref> Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:

<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War{{nbsp}}I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}</blockquote>

Though these views have been discounted as "myths",<ref name="Hynes1991"/><ref name="Fussell2000">{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |access-date=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1–78}}</ref> they are common. They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}

===Social trauma===
[[File:Cover-of-book-for-WWI-veterans-by-William-Brown-Meloney-born-1878.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A 1919 book for veterans, from the [[United States Department of War|US War Department]]]]

The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi–xv}}

The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].{{sfn |Roden}} For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.{{sfn |Wohl |1979}} Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=108–1086}} Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi–xv}}

===Discontent in Germany and Austria===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[stab-in-the-back myth|stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstoßlegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the "stab-in-the-back" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left. The same occurred in Austria which counterfactually considered himself not being responsible for the outbreak of the war and claimed not to have suffered a military defeat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cole|first=Laurence |chapter=Geteiltes Land und getrennte Erzählungen.

Communist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}</ref> World War{{nbsp}}II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War{{nbsp}}I. Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War{{nbsp}}I.{{sfn |Baker |2006}}<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II |title=World War II |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=12 November 2009}}</ref>{{sfn |Chickering |2004}} American historian [[William Rubinstein]] wrote that:

<blockquote>The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War{{nbsp}}I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}</ref></blockquote>

===Economic effects===
{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}
[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]

One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to the present. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.

[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]{{efn|10{{sup|9}} in this context&nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]}} of World War{{nbsp}}I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain Finally pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems £1.9bn |work=Daily Express |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 }}</ref>

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}</ref>

World War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and [[margarine]]), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}

Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called "war guilt" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."<ref>{{harvnb|Marks|1978|pp=231–232}}</ref> In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132&nbsp;billion gold marks. However, "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion&nbsp;... into believing the "total sum was being maintained."<ref name=Marks237>{{harvnb|Marks|1978|p=237}}</ref> Thus, 50&nbsp;billion gold marks (12.5&nbsp;billion dollars) "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay" and "therefore&nbsp;... represented the total German reparations" figure that had to be paid.<ref name=Marks237/>

This figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the [[Library of Louvain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marks|1978|pp=223–234}}</ref> By 1929, the [[Great Depression]] arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=World War One: A Short History |first=Norman |last=Stone |location=London |publisher=Penguin |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-14-103156-9 }}</ref> In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point Germany had paid only the equivalent of 20.598&nbsp;billion gold marks in reparations.<ref>{{harvnb|Marks|1978|p=233}}</ref> With the rise of Adolf Hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. [[David A. Andelman|David Andelman]] notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the Second World War, at the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Conference]] in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3{{nbsp}}October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.{{efn|World War I officially ended when Germany paid off the final amount of reparations imposed on it by the Allies.<ref>{{Cite news |title=First World War officially ends |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8029948/First-World-War-officially-ends.html |website=The Telegraph |access-date=15 March 2017 |quote=<!--The final payment of £59.5&nbsp;million, writes off the crippling debt that was the price for one world war and laid the foundations for another.--> |first=Allan |last=Hall |date=28 September 2010 |location=Berlin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html |title=Why Did World War I Just End? |last1=Suddath |first1=Claire |date=4 October 2010 |work=Time |access-date=1 July 2013 |quote=<!--World War{{nbsp}}I ended over the weekend.
