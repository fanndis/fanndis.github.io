'''Framatome''' is a French [[nuclear reactor]] business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world-nuclear-news.org/C-New-NP-resurrects-Framatome-name-0401184.html|title=New NP resurrects Framatome name|website=World-Nuclear-News.org|access-date=26 January 2018}}</ref> It is owned by [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) (75.5%), [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (19.5%), and [[Assystem]] (5%).

The company first formed in 1958 to license [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse's]] [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) designs for use in France. Similar agreements had been put in place with other European countries, and this led to a 1962 contract for a complete plant at [[Chooz Nuclear Power Plant|Chooz]]. Westinghouse sold its stake to engineering firm [[Creusot-Loire]] in 1976, and the company became solely French owned.

In 2001, [[Siemens]] sold its reactor business to Framatome. As part of a larger series of mergers with [[Cogema]] and Technicatome, Framatome became the '''Areva NP''' division of the new [[Areva]]. It changed its name back to Framatome in 2018 after a major investment by utility operator [[Électricité de France|EDF]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/New-NP-resurrects-Framatome-name |title= New NP resurrects Framatome name |date=4 January 2018}}</ref>

While originally a licensing and construction business, today Framatome supplies the entire reactor life-cycle, including design of the [[European Pressurized Reactor]] (EPR), construction, fuel management and many related tasks.

==History==
Framatome was founded in 1958 by several companies of the French industrial giant [[Schneider-Empain|Schneider Group]] along with [[Empain]], [[Merlin Gérin]], and the American [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], in order to license Westinghouse's [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) technology and develop a bid for [[Chooz Nuclear Power Plant|Chooz A]] (in France). Called Franco-Américaine de Constructions Atomiques (Framatome), the original company consisted of four engineers, one from each of the parent companies.

The original mission of the company was to act as a nuclear engineering firm and to develop a nuclear power plant that was to be identical to Westinghouse's existing product specifications.<ref name=fundinguniverse-1998>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/framatome-sa-history/ |title=Framatome SA History |work=International Directory of Company Histories |publisher=FundingUniverse |year=1998 |access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>  The first European plant of Westinghouse design was by then already under construction in Italy. A formal contract was signed in September 1961 for Framatome to deliver a [[turnkey]] system, that is, not only the reactor, but an entire, ready-to-use system of piping, cabling, supports, and other auxiliary systems, propelling Framatome from a nuclear engineering firm to an industrial contractor.

In January 1976, Westinghouse agreed to sell its remaining 15% share to [[Creusot-Loire]], which now owned 66%, and to cede complete marketing independence to Framatome.<ref name=nyt-19810124>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/24/business/france-set-to-build-reactors.html |title=France Set to Build Reactors |first=Paul |last=Lewis |newspaper=New York Times |date=24 January 1981 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=pubs-1976>{{cite journal |title=Westinghouse sells French nuclear stake |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |year=1976 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages = 5|doi=10.1021/cen-v054n002.p005 |quote=An agreement signed in Paris calls for Westinghouse to sell its 45% stake in Framatome, France's sole maker of commercial nuclear plants, to the government-run Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) and to Creusot-Loire, a major French engineering firm, for $25 million... Westinghouse will continue to receive license royalties at present rates on the existing and planned nuclear reactors designed around its pressurized-water reactor system.}}</ref> In February, the Belgian [[Édouard-Jean Empain]] sold his 35% interest in Creusot-Loire to Paribas, a French government-linked banking group.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A January 1982 company reorganization simultaneously strengthened French public and private control of the company by allowing Creusot-Loire to increase its share of the company while increasing [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] say in the running of the firm. In 2001, German company [[Siemens]]' nuclear business was merged into Framatome.<ref name=WSJ110415>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704547804576260953845777640 |title=Siemens Rethinks Nuclear Ambitions |date=2011-04-15 |author= Vanessa Fuhrmans |publisher=The Wall Street Journal }}</ref> Framatome and Siemens had been officially cooperating since 1989 for the development of the [[European Pressurized Reactor]] (EPR).<ref name=EPR-presentation>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/Downloads/INPRO/Files/2010-Feb-DF-WS/15-Teller.pdf |title=The EPR Reactor: Evolution to Gen III+ based on proven technology |author=Andrew Teller |publisher=Areva |date=2 February 2010 |access-date=19 July 2010}}</ref>

In 2001, after a merger with the [[Cogema]] (now: [[Orano]]) and Technicatome a nuclear conglomerate [[Areva]] was formed and Framatome became Areva NP. In 2007, Areva and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] created a joint venture named [[Atmea]].<ref name=nei080118>

In 2016, following a discovery at Flamanville 3, about 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Framatome's Le Creusot Forge operation since 1965 were found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of French reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns, continued over the winter high electricity demand period into 2017.<ref name=ft-20161028>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f86a3c6c-9c60-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a |title=French nuclear outages threaten higher UK power bills |author=Andrew Ward |newspaper=Financial Times |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=large-2016>{{cite report |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |title=Irregularities and Anomalies Relating to the Forged Components of Le Creusot Forge |author=John Large |work=Large Associates |publisher=Greenpeace France |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192609/https://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |archive-date=27 October 2016}}</ref> In December 2016 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' characterised the problem as a "decades long coverup of manufacturing problems", with Framatome executives acknowledging that Le Creusot had been falsifying documents.<ref name=wsj-20161213>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-at-nuclear-components-supplier-spark-global-reviews-1481625005 |title=Coverup at French Nuclear Supplier Sparks Global Review |author1=Matthew Dalton |author2=Inti Landauro |author3=Rebecca Smith |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> Le Creusot Forge was out of operation from December 2015 to January 2018 while improvements to process controls, the quality management system, organisation and safety culture were made.<ref name=wnn-20201117>{{cite news |url=https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Framatome-forge-raises-replacement-parts-productio |title=Framatome forge raises replacement parts production |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref>
