"'''The 1975'''" is a song by [[the 1975]] from their fourth studio album, ''[[Notes on a Conditional Form]]'' (2020). The song was released on 24 July 2019,{{efn|While some publications including ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',<ref name="tele Horner"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref name="guardian"/> and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/07/the-1975-greta-thunberg-notes-on-a-conditional-form/|title=The 1975's New Song Is a Speech About Climate Change|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|last=Burks|first=Tosten|date=24 July 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref> consider the song to be a single, others such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-1975-greta-thunberg-new-song-listen-862169/|title=The 1975 Enlist Climate Change Activist Greta Thunberg for Self-Titled New Song|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|date=24 July 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref> and the [[BBC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49098434|title=The 1975: Greta Thunberg writes climate essay for new album|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 July 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref> have written that it is not.}} while included on the album as the opening track in May of the following year. The band's song "The 1975" has opened each of their albums and features the same lyrics and music with a different arrangement; however, this fourth version deviates entirely from previous versions and is distinguished as such by fans by the fan-title "'''The 1975 (NOACF)'''". This version uses an entirely new musical composition of piano, harp and orchestral flourishes and features environmental activist [[Greta Thunberg]] calling for [[civil disobedience]] and [[direct action]], both personal and political, in response to [[climate change]], in a modified version of her own speech "Our House Is on Fire" from the 2019 [[World Economic Forum]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/the-1975-climate-change-activist-greta-thurnberg/|title=The 1975 share new song featuring climate activist Greta Thurnberg|last=Jenke|first=Tyler|date=25 July 2019|work=Tonedeaf|access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref>

The song was recorded in June 2019. Proceeds went to the grassroots movement [[Extinction Rebellion]]; the song's release coincided with measures by the 1975 which had the described aim of reducing their environmental impact, including reprinting new designs over older, unsold merchandise. The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised its emotional impact, the message and the transition on ''Notes on a Conditional Form'' from the song into the lead single "[[People (The 1975 song)|People]]".

==Critical reception==
Critical reviews following the song's initial release were mostly positive. On 27 July 2019, ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' named the song their favourite of the week. Sean Lang from the publication praised that lead vocalist Matthew Healy let Thunberg deliver the speech, rather than trying to deliver the message himself, and lauded Thunberg for her delivery of a difficult message. Lang called the song a "surprising, refreshing risk".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/top-song-of-the-week-the-1975/|title=Top Song of the Week: The 1975 Take Surprising and Refreshing Risks With "The 1975"|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Lang|first=Sean|last2=Blackard|first2=Cap|date=27 July 2019|accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref> Madison Feller of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' complimented the song as "pretty stunning", saying that it gave her chills.<ref name="elle">{{cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a28521995/the-1975-song-greta-thunberg/|title=The 1975 and Greta Thunberg Released the Song of the Scary Hot Summer|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|last=Feller|first=Madison|date=26 July 2019|accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref> Laura Snapes from ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the 1975 for using their platform to highlight a woman's voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/why-greta-thunberg-joined-the-1975|title=Hot and bothered: why Greta Thunberg joined the 1975|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Snapes|first=Laura|author-link=Laura Snapes|date=25 July 2019|accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'s}} Al Horner called the track "surprising and inspiring" and "brutally, rebelliously stark".<ref name="tele Horner">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/1975s-greta-thunberg-single-woke-gimmick-sound-future/|title=Is The 1975's Greta Thunberg single a woke gimmick, or the sound of the future?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Horner|first=Al|date=25 July 2019|accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref> Jake Kerridge of ''The Telegraph'' praised it as the "most terrifying" spoken word pop music since the 1984 anti-nuclear war song "[[Two Tribes]]", by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].

The song also received positive commentary in its context as the opening song on ''Notes on a Conditional Form''.
