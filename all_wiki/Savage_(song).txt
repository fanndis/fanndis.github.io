==Recording and production==
According to [[audio engineer|engineer]] Eddie "eMIX" Hernandez, Megan did the song "on the spot", in under an hour. Hernandez explained the recording process: "The collaboration was going on at the same time. We were building as the song was forming. While he [producer [[J. White Did It]]] was laying down the [[snare drum|snares]] and the [[bass drum|kicks]], she was writing to the skeleton of the beat. Once he had the production all ready and sent it over to me, she was ready to go. She had all her writing done.

White described "Savage" as a "godsend", adding: "That song came out of the air man, it came out of the air from God... It was a gift. And straight away, I told her, 'This is going to be a number one record, watch.'

==Composition==
Candace McDuffie of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' noted, in the song, Megan "paints herself as 'the [[ghetto|hood]] [[Mona Lisa]]' while celebrating her complexity."<ref name="COS">{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/03/album-review-megan-thee-stallion-suga/|title=Megan Thee Stallion Hones Her Craft on the Suga EP|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=McDuffie|first=Candace|date=March 10, 2020|accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref> 
Megan employs huge bravado on the song, which, according to ''[[HipHopDX]]''{{'}}s Aaron McKrell, works to her advantage, as she "surgically pummels a formidable [[J.

Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé, both natives of [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], first met each other at a New Year's Eve party in 2019. Megan recalled when she first learned that Beyoncé would remix the song: "I got a call one day and they were like, 'Yeah… Beyoncé's gonna do a&nbsp;remix&nbsp;of 'Savage' [...] I was like, 'Shut the f— up!' I didn't believe it."

J. White Did It, the producer of the original "Savage", spoke about how he did not know about Beyoncé's remix until the day of release.

She was like, "I can’t tell you yet, I can't tell you nothin.' That was tearing me up because I don’t really like surprises. The first time we all heard the remix, we all heard it together... I sat there and heard the song and was literally like "WOW." Great song! This is really, really good. "Savage" has now arrived on the remix level, let's go! The song was already doing good by itself, but that remix… it took it to a whole new level.</blockquote>
