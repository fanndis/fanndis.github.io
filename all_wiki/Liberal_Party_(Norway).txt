Founded in 1884, then with the main support from [[farmer]]s and [[Progressivism|progressive]] members of the [[bourgeoisie]], it was the first political party that came into existence in Norway, and was the dominant government party for several decades. Since the 1880s, the party has seen many internal schisms. A politically moderate and religious wing broke out in 1888 to form the [[Moderate Liberal Party]], and the [[Conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] faction, including among them the first Prime Minister of Norway [[Christian Michelsen]] broke out in 1909 to form the [[Free-minded Liberal Party]] (both parties eventually merged into the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]). The most notable recent schism was in 1972, when the Liberal Party decided to oppose Norwegian membership in the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), and the faction supporting membership broke out and formed the [[Liberal People's Party (Norway, 1972)|Liberal People's Party]].<ref name=nrk/>

== History ==
The party Venstre was formed in 1884 in connection with the dispute about whether or not to introduce [[parliamentarism]] in Norway. Venstre (which means "Left" in Norwegian) was the party advocating parliamentarism, whereas the conservatives, who opposed parliamentarism, formed the party [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Høyre]] (which means "Right"). When the fight for parliamentarism was won, Venstre's leader [[Johan Sverdrup]] became the first Norwegian prime minister to be appointed on the basis of having the support of a majority in the [[Storting]]. Later, Venstre advocated universal [[suffrage]] for men, which was achieved in 1898, the break-up of the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Swedish-Norwegian Union]], which happened in 1905, and universal [[women's suffrage]], which was introduced in 1913. In the first decades after 1884, Venstre formed several governments, interspersed with periods of [[Høyre]]-governments. Six different [[List of Prime Ministers of Norway|Prime Ministers of Norway]] have come from Venstre, all of them before 1935. With the growth of [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]], Venstre gradually lost ground. The election of 1915 was the last in which Venstre was the largest party and won an outright majority in the [[Storting]]. Venstre was further weakened with the formation of ''Bondepartiet'' (the present day [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]]) in 1920, and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian People's Party]] in 1933, both of which were formed partly by former Venstre members. After World War II, Venstre has been part of five coalition governments, the most recent one being [[Solberg's Cabinet]] from 2018.

A dispute over Norwegian membership in the [[European Community]], now the European Union, made the party split up at [[Røros]] in 1972, with the people favoring EC membership departing, and forming [[Liberal People's Party (Norway, 1972)|Liberal People's Party]]. These included the party leader, ''Helge Seip'', and 9 of the 13 members of parliament. Since then, Venstre has been a fairly small party. The parliamentary group was reduced to two after the 1973 election.

In 1974, Venstre elected the first female leader of a political party in Norway, [[Eva Kolstad]].

Election results continued to be poor for Venstre. Before the 1985 elections, the party announced for the first, and so far only, time that they would support a [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] government. At the following election they lost their two remaining seats, and were without representation in the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] for the first time. In 1988, Venstre was re-united with the splinter party from 1972, now calling itself the [[Liberal People's Party (Norway, Old)|Liberal People's Party]], but at the elections of 1989, the re-united party again failed to win parliamentary seats. In 1993 the party again failed to achieve the [[Election threshold|4% threshold]] which would make them eligible for the [[leveling seat]]s in parliament, but [[Lars Sponheim]] was elected directly from [[Hordaland]] county. (Before the election, Sponheim had made the wager that he would walk across the mountains from his home in [[Ulvik]] to the parliament in capital city [[Oslo]] if elected—a wager he delivered on, to much good-humoured interest from the press.)

In 1997, Venstre passed the 4% threshold, increasing their seats in parliament to six. As a consequence Venstre also saw their first participation in cabinet since 1973. The party held four seats in the minority first government of [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]]. Lars Sponheim became minister of industry and commerce, [[Odd Einar Dørum]]; minister of communications, later minister of justice, [[Guro Fjellanger]]; minister of environmental protection, and [[Eldbjørg Løwer]]; minister of administration, later minister of defense. Mrs. Løwer was the first female minister of defense in Norway. This cabinet resigned in 2000, refusing to accept the Storting's decision to build gas power plants. In 2001, Venstre narrowly failed to reach the 4% threshold, but got two representatives elected, Sponheim and Odd Einar Dørum. However, due to Venstre becoming part of the second coalition government of [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]], with Sponheim and Dørum entering the cabinet, the two were represented in parliament by deputies. The party also got a third member of the cabinet, with the appointment of [[Torild Skogsholm]] as Minister of Transport and Communications.

The [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 elections]] gave Venstre 5.9% of the vote, their best result since the 1969 elections. Venstre won 6 seats directly, and an additional 4 seats through the 4%+ compensatory system. Due to the majority of the [[Red-Green Coalition]], Venstre became an opposition party.

In the [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 general elections]].<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article3268805.ece Sponheim: – Jeg trekker meg – Nyheter – Politikk – Aftenposten.no<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214725/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article3268805.ece |date=22 September 2009 }}</ref> Venstre ended up below the 4% threshold for [[levelling seat]]s, leaving the party with only two seats in parliament, [[Trine Skei Grande]] and [[Borghild Tenden]], whereas they had ten seats before the election. The same evening, 14 September 2009, Lars Sponheim announced that he would step down as party leader, as a consequence of the poor result. After the election, the party experienced growth in members. At the party conference in April 2010, Trine Skei Grande was unanimously elected as the new leader of the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/04/17/nyheter/politikk/venstre/11324837/|title=Skei Grande ny leder i Venstre|date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

Venstre climbed over the threshold with 5.2% in the [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|2013 elections]] and entered into coalition talks with the Conservative, Christian Democratic, and Progress parties. Venstre and the Christian Democrats decided not to enter the new [[Solberg's Cabinet|Solberg Cabinet]], thus leaving it without a parliamentary majority, but made a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Her-er-avtalen-mellom-de-borgerlige-partiene-7325495.html|title=Her er avtalen mellom de borgerlige partiene|last=Wright|first=Martin Aasen|date=30 September 2013|publisher=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>

Winning 8 seats in the [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|2017 elections]], Venstre entered into new talks with the Conservative and Progress Party coalition, and joined the coalition in January 2018 with three cabinet posts; [[Ola Elvestuen]] became Minister of Climate and Environment, [[Iselin Nybø]] Minister of Research and Higher Education, while party leader Trine Skei Grande became Minister of Culture.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.adressa.no/nyheter/politikk/2018/01/17/Disse-20-skal-styre-Norge-15920215.ece|title=Disse 20 skal styre Norge|publisher=Adresseavisa|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>

==Ideology==
{{Update|section|date=March 2018}}
Venstre is a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] and [[centrism|centrist]] party. Through its history it has taken part in both [[centre-right]] and pure centrist coalition governments. From 2001 to 2005, it was in a centre-right coalition government with the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]]; since the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 general election]], the party has been in opposition. More recently the party has been a proponent of a blue–green alliance in Norwegian politics, with Venstre constituting the green part.<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/video/PS*102944 Venstre-lederen vil ha makt i blågrønn regjering]. ''NRK''. 12 April 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/11/03/nyheter/politiske_partier/politikk/statsbudsjett/36055514/ Venstre med «blågrønt» budsjettforslag]. ''Dagbladet''. 3. november 2014.</ref>

In the last few election campaigns, Venstre's main focus has been on environmental issues, education, small-business and social issues. Venstre advocates higher taxes on activities that damage the environment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.venstre.no/print.php?article=981 |title=Venstre official English website |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612032210/http://www.venstre.no/print.php?article=981 |archivedate=12 June 2010  }}</ref> Some other issues Venstre advocate are increased labour immigration, abolition of the [[Church of Norway]] as the [[state church]], abolishing the [[Wealth tax|wealth]] and [[Inheritance tax|inheritance]] taxes, and more power to local authorities ([[Municipalities of Norway|kommuner]]). 

At the national convention in 2005, Venstre decided with a margin of only five votes to still oppose Norway joining the [[European Union]], albeit weakly, while still advocating that Norway remain part of the [[European Economic Area]]. In 2020, however, a majority at the national convention voted for Venstre to support EU membership for Norway. Thus, the official stance of Venstre is now in support of Norwegian membership of the European Union. Regardless, the party retains the position that the question of potential Norwegian EU membership should only be decided by a national referendum, similar to referendums held in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Krekling|first=David Vojislav|date=2020-09-27|title=Venstre går inn for at Norge skal bli medlem i EU|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/venstre-gar-inn-for-at-norge-skal-bli-medlem-i-eu-1.15177141|access-date=2020-10-02|website=NRK|language=nb-NO}}</ref>

In 2007, Venstre became the first Norwegian party to advocate legalizing sharing of copyrighted digital material.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uv.no/politics/translated-items/culture-wants-to-be-free?set_language=en |title=Culture wants to be free! |accessdate=16 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418003337/http://www.uv.no/politics/translated-items/culture-wants-to-be-free?set_language=en |archivedate=18 April 2007  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.venstre.no/artikkel/2780/ |title=Slipp kulturen fri!

==Etymology==
While the name of the party means ''Left'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the party refers to itself as a centrist party. Since the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] was a component of the governing centre-left [[Red-Green Coalition]], and ''Venstre'' was part of the "non-socialist" opposition, a situation has been produced where the ''centre'' party is more on the left than ''Left'' itself. When the name ''Left'' was chosen in 1884, the word did not refer to [[socialism]] in the way "Left wing" does today. It meant ''liberal'' or ''radicalism'' in comparison to the ''conservatives'' on the right, and referred to the position of the seats in Parliament. The use of the word for "left" in the names of the [[Denmark|Danish]] political parties ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' and ''[[Danish Social Liberal Party|Radikale Venstre]]'' is also meant to refer to [[liberalism]] and [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] rather than [[socialism]].
