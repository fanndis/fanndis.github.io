'''Ann Lennox''' <small>[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]</small> (born 25 December 1954) is a Scottish singer-songwriter, political activist and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Annie Lennox was born on Christmas Day 1954 in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland the daughter of Dorothy Farquharson (née Ferguson; born 1930) and Thomas Allison Lennox (1925–1986).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/treeview/tree_view.php?&tree_id=11936|title=Start building your family tree today|website=Thegenealogist.co.uk|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Lennox won a place at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London, where she studied the [[flute]], piano and harpsichord for three years. She lived on a student grant and worked at part-time jobs for extra money. Lennox was unhappy during her time at the Royal Academy and spent her time wondering what other direction she could take.<ref name="DIDiscs AL">{{cite episode|title=Desert Island Discs with Annie Lennox|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20080511.shtml|series=Desert Island Discs|serieslink=Desert Island Discs|network=BBC|station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]|airdate=11 May 2008}}</ref>

Lennox's flute teacher's final report stated: "Ann has not always been sure of where to direct her efforts, though lately she has been more committed. She is very, very able, however." Two years later, Lennox reported to the Academy: "I have had to work as a waitress, barmaid, and shop assistant to keep me when not in musical work." She also played and sang with a few bands, such as [[Windsong (band)|Windsong]], during the period of her course. In 2006, the academy made her an honorary Fellow.<ref>Royal Academy of Music Bulletin, August 2006, p. 7</ref> Lennox also was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] that year.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sutherland|first=Bryony|last2=Ellis|first2=Lucy|year=2002|title=Annie Lennox: The Biography|publisher=Omnibus Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AIvGU3nuZL0C|isbn=0-7119-9192-8|ref=harv}}</ref>

Lennox and Stewart reconvened Eurythmics in the late 1990s with the album ''[[Peace (Eurythmics album)|Peace]]'', their first album of new material in ten years.

The 1988 single, "[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]", was a duet with [[Al Green]] recorded for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Scrooged]]''.

[[file:Anniesing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|After releasing "[[Sing (Annie Lennox song)|Sing]]" with 23 other invited singers, Lennox launched the [[Sing campaign|SING campaign]] in 2007]]
Ending her long association with [[Stephen Lipson]], Lennox's fourth solo album, ''[[Songs of Mass Destruction]]'', was recorded in Los Angeles with veteran producer [[Glen Ballard]] (known for producing [[Alanis Morissette]]'s album, ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]''). It was released on 1 October 2007, and was the last studio album of Lennox's contract with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. It peaked at No.&nbsp;7 in the UK and No.&nbsp;9 in the US.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="UKCharts"/> Lennox stated that she believed the album consisted of "twelve strong, powerful, really emotive songs that people can connect to". If she achieves that, she says, "I can feel proud of [it], no matter if it sells ten copies or 50 million."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58022/annie-lennox-gets-busy-on-new-album | title=Annie Lennox Gets Busy on New Album | author=Newman, Melinda |work=Billboard  | date=23 June 2006 | access-date=29 June 2006 | ref=harv}}</ref> Lennox described it as "a dark album, but the world is a dark place.

===2008–2009: ''The Annie Lennox Collection'' and departure from Sony===
{{Main|The Annie Lennox Collection}}
Finishing out her contract with Sony BMG, Lennox released the compilation album ''[[The Annie Lennox Collection]]''. Initially intended for release in September 2008, the release date was pushed back several months to allow Lennox to recuperate from a back injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/music/annie-lennox-from-the-eurythmics-talks-about-new-album/story-e6frexl9-1225690039466|title=Annie Lennox from the Eurythmics talks about new album|website=Dailytelegraph.com.au|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> The compilation was eventually released in the US on 17 February 2009, and in the UK and Europe on 9 March 2009. Included on the track listing are songs from her four solo albums, one from the ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' soundtrack, and two new songs. One of these is a cover of [[Ash (band)|Ash's]] single, "[[Shining Light]]". The other is a cover of a song by the English band [[Keane (band)|Keane]], originally the B-side of their first single in 2000. Lennox renamed the song from its original title "[[Call Me What You Like#Closer Now|Closer Now]]" to "[[Pattern of My Life]]". A limited 3-disc edition of the album included a DVD compilation featuring most of Lennox's solo videos since 1992, and also featured a second CD of rarer songs including a version of [[R.E.M.]]'s "[[Everybody Hurts]]" with [[Alicia Keys]] and Lennox's Oscar-winning "Into the West" from the third ''Lord of the Rings'' film. The album entered the [[UK Album Chart]] at No.&nbsp;2 and remained in the top 10 for seven weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/ |title=Annie Lennox: The Collection |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151153/http://www.officialcharts.com/archive/ |archive-date=21 September 2014 }}</ref>

Lennox's recording contract with [[Sony BMG]] concluded with the release of ''Songs of Mass Destruction'' and the subsequent retrospective album ''The Collection'', and much was made in the press in late 2007/early 2008 about the apparent animosity between Lennox and the record company. Lennox stated that while on a trip to South Africa in December 2007 to appear at the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] campaign in Johannesburg, the regional company office of the label failed to return phone calls and e-mails she made to them for three weeks, and had completely failed to promote the Sing project as planned. Upon her return to the UK, Lennox met with the head of Sony BMG UK, Ged Docherty, who was "mortified" by the problems she had encountered with the South African branch. However, the debacle (partly inflamed when Lennox's dissatisfaction with the South African office was made public on her blog) led to press reports falsely stating that she was being dropped by Sony BMG. The record company themselves quickly refuted the rumour stating that Lennox's contract with them had merely been fulfilled and that they hoped she would consider remaining with them. The British tabloid, ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', subsequently printed a retraction of its story about her being dropped by the label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |title=Official press statement Jan 2008 |website=Annielennox.com |date=15 January 2008 |access-date=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145210/http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |archivedate=7 July 2011  }}</ref>

===Relationship with the LGBT+ community===
[[File:Annie Lennox Rock am Ring 1987.jpg|thumb|upright|Lennox was known for her [[androgyny]] during the 1980s]]
Lennox's longtime support for [[LGBT]] rights have helped garner a significant following within the community.<ref name="Independent 2014-10-30">{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/annie-lennox-on-being-mistaken-for-a-lesbian-i-think-intelligent-heterosexual-women-are-challenging-9828047.html |title=Annie Lennox on being mistaken for a lesbian |date=30 October 2014 |website=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> According to ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', "her distinctive voice and provocative stage persona have made Lennox a longtime [[gay icon]]."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid49737.asp |title=Annie Lennox to Host Logo's Music Show |date=13 October 2007 |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=12 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620102445/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid49737.asp |archive-date=20 June 2009 |url-status=dead |ref=harv}}</ref>

Known for her [[androgynous]] look in the 1980s–first widely seen in the 1983 music video for "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]" where she had close-cropped, orange-coloured hair, and wore a man's suit brandishing a cane, a video which made her a household name–Lennox was viewed as the female version of [[Boy George]], and during the [[Second British Invasion]] spurred by MTV, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine ran an issue which featured Lennox and Boy George on the cover of its 23 January 1984 edition with the caption ''Britain Rocks America&nbsp;– Again''.<ref>Simon Reynolds, Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984, pp. 340, 342–3.</ref>

===Exhibition===
In conjunction with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, Lennox put many items from her collection—costumes, accessories, photographs, awards, ephemera from her political campaigns, and personal belongings—on display. This collection, which spanned her entire career, along with music videos and interviews, became ''The House of Annie Lennox'' at the institution from 15 September 2011 to 26 February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/p/past-exhibitions-and-displays-2011/|title=Past exhibitions & displays 2011|website=Vam.ac.uk|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> An expanded version of the exhibit was later installed at [[The Lowry]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[England]] from 17 March 2012 to 17 June,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxs09u9w3NY|title=The House of Annie Lennox – Interview with Annie|work=YouTube|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelowry.com/events/the-house-of-annie-lennox/home/|title=Exhibit dates|website=Thelowry.com|access-date=27 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081122/http://www.thelowry.com/events/the-house-of-annie-lennox/home/|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref> before moving to [[Aberdeen]] for twelve weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/CouncilNews/ci_cns/pr_annielennox_270912.asp|title=Aberdeen City Council – Annie Lennox exhibition (27 Sep 2012)|website=Aberdeencity.gov.uk|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Controversy ===
In October 2014, Lennox faced criticism for failing to mention the history of [[lynching in the US]] when discussing her cover Billie Holiday's "[[Strange Fruit]]" on her ''Nostalgia'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Annie Lennox is singing about lynching, but she doesn't want to talk about it|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7080287/annie-lennox-strange-fruit-tavis-smiley-nostalgia|last=Desmond-Harris|first=Jenée|date=2014-10-28|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> Lennox did not respond to the criticism or apologize until the following January, noting that she felt speaking on it earlier could have made things worse and that a DVD covering the album includes comments from her concerning the horrors of lynching.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Annie Lennox Says 'Strange Fruit' Criticism Was 'Painful'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6443799/annie-lennox-says-strange-fruit-criticism-was-painful|date=2015-01-20|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref>
