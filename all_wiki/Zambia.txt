'''Zambia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|æ|m|b|i|ə|,_|ˈ|z|ɑː|m|-}}), officially the '''Republic of Zambia''' ([[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]]: ''Cisi ca Zambia''; [[Chewa language|Nyanja]]: ''Dziko la Zambia''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Southern Africa|Southern]]-[[Central Africa|Central]] Africa<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zambia |title=Zambia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> (although some sources consider it part of [[East Africa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |title=United Nations Statistics Division- Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49) |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date=31 August 1999 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>). Its neighbours are the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the north-east, [[Malawi]] to the east, [[Mozambique]] to the southeast, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Botswana]] to the south, [[Namibia]] to the southwest, and [[Angola]] to the west. The capital city is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.

Originally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] in the eighteenth century, the British [[Colonisation|colonised]] the region into the [[British protectorate|British protectorates]] of [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Zambian High Commission|url=https://www.zambiapretoria.net/history/|website=www.zambiapretoria.net|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

On 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and [[prime minister]] [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural president. Kaunda's [[Socialism|socialist]] [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States, and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto "One Zambia, One Nation". Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government [[decentralisation]]. [[Levy Mwanawasa]], Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death on 19th August 2008 and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, [[Rupiah Banda]] presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding the office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 elections]] by [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] party leader [[Michael Sata]]. Sata died on 28 October 2014, making him the second Zambian president to die in office.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29813612 Zambian President Michael Sata dies in London&nbsp;– BBC News].

==Etymology==

{{further|Rhodesia (name)}}

The territory of what is now Zambia was known as [[Northern Rhodesia]] from 1911. It was renamed Zambia at independence in 1964.
The new name of Zambia was derived from the [[Zambezi]] river (Zambezi may mean "Grand River").<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Everett-Heath|first1=John|title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJCDwAAQBAJ&q=zambezi+name+meaning&pg=PT1589|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|date=7 December 2017|isbn=9780192556462}}</ref>

===Prehistoric era===
[[Archaeological excavation]] work on the [[Zambezi Valley]] and [[Kalambo Falls]] show a succession of human cultures. In particular, ancient camping site tools near the [[Kalambo Falls]] have been radiocarbon dated to more than 36,000 years ago.

The fossil skull remains of [[Homo rhodesiensis|Broken Hill Man]], dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years BC, further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malcolm Southwood, Bruce Cairncross & Mike S.

=== Khoisan and Batwa ===
[[File:NsaluCave.jpg|thumb|Ancient (but graffitied) Rock Art in Nsalu Cave, Kasanka National Park in North-Central Zambia.]]
The area of modern Zambia is known to have been inhabited by the [[Khoisan]] and [[Twa|Batwa]] peoples until around AD 300 when migrating [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] began to settle around these areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Timothy|title=Cultures of the World: Zambia|publisher=Times Books International|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7614-0694-5|location=Tarrytown, New York|pages=19–20}}</ref> Its is believed the [[Khoisan|Khoisan people]] groups originated in East Africa and spread southwards around 150,000 years ago. The Twa people were split into two groups one, The [[Kafwe Twa]] lived around the [[Kafue Flats|Kafue flats]] while the other, The [[Lukanga Twa]] lived around the [[Lukanga Swamp]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-30|title=Twa|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/pre-bantu-invasion/twa/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref> Many of the ancient rock arts in Zambia like the [[Mwela Rock Paintings]], [[Mumbwa Caves]], and [https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nachikufu-cave Nachikufu Cave] are attributed to these early [[hunter-gatherer]] groups. The Khoisan and more especially the Twa formed a [[patron-client relationship]] with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups.

===The Bantu (Abantu)===
The Bantu people or Abantu (meaning people) are an enormous and diverse [[ethnolinguistic group]] that comprise the majority of people in much of [[East Africa|East]], [[Southern Africa|Southern]] and [[Central Africa]]. Due to Zambia's location at the crossroads of [[Central Africa]], [[Southern Africa]], and the [[African Great Lakes]], the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions. 

Many of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously, thus Zambia's history, like many African nation's histories, cannot be presented perfectly chronologically. The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records, archaeology, and written records, mostly from non-Africans.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Scott D.|title=Culture and Customs of Zambia|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/scott_d._taylor_culture_and_customs_of_zambia_cbook4you.pdf|publisher=Greenwood Press|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> 

====Bantu origins====

The Bantu people originally lived in [[West Africa|West]]/[[Central Africa]] around what is today [[Cameroon]]/[[Nigeria]]. Around 4000 to 3000 years ago they began a millennia-long expansion into much of the continent. This event has been called the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Expansion]], it was one of the largest human migrations in history. The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought [[Ferrous metallurgy|iron working]] technology into large parts of Africa. The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes, one was western via the [[Congo Basin]] and the other eastern via the African Great Lakes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bostoen|first=Koen|date=2018-04-26|title=The Bantu Expansion|url=https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-191|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-191}}</ref> 

====First Bantu settlement====
[[File:Ba-Ila man.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ila people|Ila]] Headman's son in Southern Zambia, Cattle formed an important part of their society.]]
The first Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes.[[File:Ba-ila Village.jpg|thumb|Enormous [[Ila people|Ba-Ila]] settlement. These communities have been of interest to mathematicians due to their [[Fractal|fractal pattern]] design.]] They arrived around the 1st millennium AD among them were the [[Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe|Tonga people]] (also called Ba-Tonga, "Ba-" meaning "men") and the [[Ila people|Ba-Ila]] and other related groups who settled around [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]] near [[Zimbabwe]]. According to Ba-Tonga oral records they are believed to have come from the east near the "big sea".

They were later joined by the [[Tumbuka people|Ba-Tumbuka]] who settled around [[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Zambia]] and [[Malawi]].     

These first Bantu people lived in large villages. They never had an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and help each other in times of field preparation for their crops. Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted due to using the [[slash-and-burn]] technique of planting crops. They also keep large herds of cattle which formed an important part of their societies.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-12|title=Ila|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/early-bantu-settlers/ila/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref>     

The first Bantu communities in Zambia were extremely self-sufficient. Many groups of people who encountered them were very impressed by this self-sufficiency, its actually hypothesised by some that the Ba-Tonga got they're name from the translation of the word "independent" in a [[Shona dialect]].      

The early [[Missionary|European missionaries]] that settled in [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]] also noted the extreme independence of these Bantu societies, on of these missionaries noted: [[File:Ingombe.jpg|thumb|[[Ingombe Ilede]] trading post in Southern Zambia.]]     

"[If] weapons for war, hunting, and domestic purposes are needed. The [Tonga] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore. He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes, hoes, and other useful implements. He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge. His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile, and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained. He moulds, welds, shapes, and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of South and South Central Africa, by H.

These early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site [[Ingombe Ilede]] (which translate sleeping cow in [[Chitonga|Chi-Tonga]] because the fallen baobab tree appears to resembles a cow) in [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]], at this trading site they met numerous [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] traders from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders from the East African [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]]. Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe, others being the Swahili port cities like of [[Sofala]].    

The goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included fabrics, beads, gold, and bangles, some of these items came from what is today southern [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] while others as far away as [[India]], [[China]] and the [[Arab world|Arab World]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Origins of trade - Zambia Travel Guide|url=http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1084|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.zambia-travel-guide.com}}</ref> The African traders were later joined by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pikirayi|first=Innocent|date=August 2017|title=Ingombe Ilede and the demise of Great Zimbabwe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003598X17000953/type/journal_article|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=91|issue=358|pages=1085–1086|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.95|issn=0003-598X}}</ref>   

The decline of Great Zimbabwe, due to increasing trade competition from other [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] kingdoms like [[Khami]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], spelt the end of [[Ingombe Ilede]]. 

====Second Bantu Settlement====
The second mass settlement of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]] into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the western route of the Bantu migration through the [[Congo Basin]]. These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-08|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=2020-11-07|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref> [[File:(Kibango) Luba peoples The Metropolitan Museum of Art.png|left|thumb|Seated female Staffs of office (Kibango), were displayed by Luba kings. In Luba society, women's bodies were considered the ultimate vessels of spiritual power.]]

While there is some evidence that the [[Bemba people]] or [[Bemba people|AbaBemba]] have a strong ancient connection to the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo Kingdom]] through [[Kongo people|BaKongo]] ruler [[Manikongo|Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba]] this evidence is not well documented. 

'''Luba-Lunda States''' [[File:Brooklyn Museum 76.20.4 Lukasa Memory Board.jpg|thumbnail|Lukasa memory board, was used members of Mbudye (an association of groits in charge of maintaining Baluba history)]]   

The Bemba, along with other related groups like the [[Lamba people (Zambia)|Lamba]], [[Lala-Bisa language|Bisa]], [[Senga people|Senga]], [[Kaonde language|Kaonde]], [[Swaka language|Swaka]], [[Nkoya]]  and [[Soli language|Soli]], formed integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the [[Luba people|BaLuba people]]. The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and ironworkers since the 300's AD. Over time these communities learned to use [[Fishing net|nets]], [[Harpoon|harpoons]], make [[Dugout canoe|dugout canoes]], clear [[Canal|canals]] through swamps and make [[Dam|dams]] as high as 2.5 meters. As a result, the grew a [[Economic diversity|diverse economy]] trading fish, copper and iron items, and salt for goods from other parts of [[Africa]] like the [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]] and, later on, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. From these communities arose the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] in the 14th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>  

The Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a [[Centralized government|centralised government]] and smaller independent [[Chiefdom|chiefdoms]]. It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the [[Congo Basin]] and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today [[Copperbelt Province]] and stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] to the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean Coast]]. The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom and artisans where held in high regards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>

The [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] literature was also well developed. One renowned [[Luba people|Luba]] genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors when as followed: 

"[[Kongolo Mwamba|Nkongolo Mwamba]], the red king, and [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]], a prince of legendary black complexion. Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot, Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, the refined and gentle prince. Nkongolo the red is a man without manners, a man who eats in public, gets drunk, and cannot control himself, whereas [Ilunga] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation, obsessed with good manners; he does not eat in public, controls his language and his behaviour, and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people. Nkongolo Mwamba symbolizes the embodiment of tyranny, whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luba {{!}} people|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Luba-people|access-date=2020-11-07|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> [[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of Lunda houses by a Portuguese. The size of the doorways relative to the building emphasizes the scale of the buildings. ]]

In the same region of southern the [[Lunda people]] were made into a satellite of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba empire]] and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance and thus became the [[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda empire]] to the south. According to Lunda genesis myths, a Luba hunter named [[Tshibinda Ilunga|Chibinda Ilunga]] son of [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]] introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom. Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire. The Lunda kings, however, remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|access-date=2020-11-29|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref> [[File:Mwata.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the ruler of Lunda, [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]], receiving Portuguese in the royal courtyard in the 1800s]]

The Lunda, like its parent state Luba, also traded with both coasts, the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]. With ruler [[List of rulers of the Lunda Empire|Mwaant Yaav Naweej]] had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] and forest products and controlling the regional [[Copper|copper trade]], and settlements around [[Lake Mweru]] regulated commerce from the [[Swahili coast|East African coast]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|access-date=2020-11-29|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>

The [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba-Lunda states]] eventually declined as a result of both [[Atlantic slave trade]] in the west and [[Arab slave trade]] in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms. The [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], a group that is highly related to the [[Luvale people|Luvale]] and formed a Lunda satellite state, initially suffered from the European demand for slaves but once the broke away from the Lunda State, the defeated the previous parent state became notorious slave traders, exporting slaves to both coasts. The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Azuonye|first=Chukwuma|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&pg=PA11&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Chokwe: (Angola, Zambia)|date=1996-12-15|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|language=en}}</ref>

This instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda States and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-08|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref>

People also arrived early in the expansion, coming from the [[Luba Empire|Luba]]–[[Lunda Empire|Lunda]] kingdoms in the southern parts of the modern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and northern Angola, followed by a much larger influx, especially between the late 12th and early 13th centuries<ref>{{cite book|author=Clay, Gervas |title=History of the Mankoya District|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZZHcAAACAAJ|year=1945|publisher=Rhodes-Livingstone Institute}}</ref>

To the [[Eastern Province, Zambia|east]], the [[Maravi Empire]], also spanning the vast areas of [[Malawi]] and parts of modern northern [[Mozambique]] began to flourish under [[Kalonga]].

At the end of the 18th century, some of the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] migrated to [[Barotseland]], [[Mongu]] upon the migration of among others, the [[Rulers of Mbundaland|Ciyengele]].<ref>'' The elites of Barotseland, 1878–1969: a political history of Zambia's Western Province'': a.

In the early 19th century, the Nsokolo people settled in the [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala district]] of Northern Province. During the 19th century, the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] and [[Sotho people]]s arrived from the south. By the late 19th century, most of the various peoples of Zambia were established in their current areas.

===Colonial Period===
====Europeans====
[[File:David Livingstone -1.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1864 portrait of [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]].]]
The earliest recorded European to visit the area was the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer [[Francisco de Lacerda]] in the late 18th century. Lacerda led an expedition from Mozambique to the Kazembe region in Zambia (with the goal of exploring and to crossing Southern Africa from coast to coast for the first time),<ref>{{cite web|title = Instructions and Travel Diary that Governor Francisco Joze de Lacerda e Almeida Wrote about His Travel to the Center of Africa, Going to the River of Sena, in the Year of 1798|url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/234/|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}</ref> and died during the expedition in 1798. The expedition was from then on led by his friend Francisco Pinto.<ref>{{cite web|title = Portuguese Expedition to Northern Rhodesia, 1798–99&nbsp;– Great North Road (GNR, Northern Rhodesia, Zambia)|url = http://www.greatnorthroad.org/maps/european_travellers/portuguese_expedition.php|website = www.greatnorthroad.org|accessdate = 3 September 2015|first = Craig Hartnett of NinerNet|last = Communications.|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023553/http://www.greatnorthroad.org/maps/european_travellers/portuguese_expedition.php|archive-date = 24 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> This territory, located between [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola]], was claimed and explored by Portugal in that period.

Other European visitors followed in the 19th century. The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] through the "3 Cs": Christianity, Commerce, and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: "Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Livingstone Discovers Victoria Falls, 1855|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/livingstone.htm|website=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref>

Locally the falls are known as [[Mosi-oa-Tunya|"Mosi-o-Tunya"]] or "thundering smoke" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], near the Falls, is named after him. Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors, missionaries and traders after his death in 1873.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HISTORY|url=https://www.cbt.gov.zm/?page_id=4385|website=THE PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION WEBSITE|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627015544/https://www.cbt.gov.zm/?page_id=4385|archive-date=27 June 2020}}</ref>

'''British South Africa Company'''

In 1888, the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSA Company), led by [[Cecil Rhodes]], obtained mineral rights from the [[Litunga]] of the Lozi people, the Paramount Chief of the [[Lozi people|Lozi (Ba-rotse)]] for the area which later became [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]].<ref name="livingstone">{{cite web

In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region, and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the [[Kafue River]].<ref name="burnham1899">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |author-link=Frederick Russell Burnham |editor-first=Walter H. |editor-last=Wills |title=Bulawayo Up-to-date; Being a General Sketch of Rhodesia |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co. |year=1899 |pages=177–180 |chapter=Northern Rhodesia|title-link=s:Northern Rhodesia }}</ref>

[[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] and [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] were administered as separate units until 1911 when they were merged to form [[Northern Rhodesia]], a British protectorate. In 1923, the BSA Company ceded control of Northern Rhodesia to the British Government after the government decided not to renew the Company's charter.

====British colonisation====

In 1923, [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), a conquered territory which was also administered by the BSA Company, became a self-governing British colony. In 1924, after negotiations, the administration of Northern Rhodesia transferred to the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]].

'''Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland'''[[File:Rodésia e Niassalândia 32.jpg|thumb|Stamp with portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], 1955]]
In 1953, the creation of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] grouped together Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and [[Nyasaland Protectorate|Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]) as a single semi-autonomous region. This was undertaken despite opposition from a sizeable minority of the population, who demonstrated against it in 1960–61.<ref name="infoplease">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0841738.html|title=Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Federation of|author=Pearson Education|accessdate=29 October 2007}}</ref> Northern Rhodesia was the center of much of the turmoil and crisis characterizing the federation in its last years. Initially, [[Harry Nkumbula]]'s [[Zambian African National Congress|African National Congress]] (ANC) led the campaign, which [[Kenneth Kaunda]]'s United National Independence Party (UNIP) subsequently took up.

===Independence===

[[File:Zambia123f.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth David Kaunda|Kenneth Kaunda]], first Republican president, on a state visit to [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] in 1970]]

A two-stage election held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]] based on a broader, more democratic franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia - Post-Colonial History|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/africa/zm-history.htm|website=globalsecurity.org}}</ref>

The federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia|Colonial Governor]], Sir [[Evelyn Dennison Hone|Evelyn Hone]], was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the [[Lumpa Church|Lumpa Uprising]] led by [[Alice Lenshina]]&nbsp;– Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alice Lenshina|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/alicelenshinalumpa.htm|date=2020-05-26|website=The British Empire|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

Northern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as the first president. At independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government, and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. This expertise was provided in part by [[John Willson CMG]]<ref>[http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/BDOHP/Willson.pdf WILLSON, John Michael (born 15 July 1931)].

=== Post Independence ===
Kaunda's endorsement of [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Patriotic Front]] guerrillas conducting raids into neighbouring [[Rhodesia|(Southern) Rhodesia]] resulted in political tension and a militarisation of the border, leading to its closure in 1973.<ref name="blackfire">{{cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Michael|title=We are everywhere: Narratives from Rhodesian guerillas|pages=[https://archive.org/details/weareeverywheren00raeb/page/1 1–209]|year=1978|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0394505305|url=https://archive.org/details/weareeverywheren00raeb/page/1}}</ref> The [[Kariba Dam|Kariba hydroelectric]] station on the Zambezi River provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country's requirements for electricity, despite Rhodesian management.

On 3 September 1978, civilian airliner, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825]], was shot down near Kariba by the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA). 18 people, including children, survived the crash only for most of them to be shot by militants of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) led by [[Joshua Nkomo]]. Rhodesia responded with Operation Gatling, an attack on Nkomo's guerilla bases in Zambia, in particular, his military headquarters just outside Lusaka; this raid became known as the Green Leader Raid. On the same day, two more bases in Zambia were attacked using air power and elite [[Paratrooper|paratroops]] and helicopter-borne troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helion.co.uk/new-and-forthcoming-titles/green-leader-operation-gatling-the-rhodesian-military-s-response-to-the-viscount-tragedy.html|title=GREEN LEADER.

A [[TAZARA Railway|railway]] (TAZARA&nbsp;– Tanzania Zambia Railways) to the [[Tanzania]]n port of [[Dar es Salaam]], completed in 1975 with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on railway lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly troubled [[Portuguese Angola]]. Until the completion of the railway, Zambia's major artery for imports and the critical export of copper was along the TanZam Road, running from Zambia to the port cities in Tanzania. The [[Tazama Pipeline|Tazama oil pipeline]] was also built from Dar es Salaam to [[Ndola]] in Zambia.

By the late 1970s, Mozambique and Angola had attained independence from Portugal. Rhodesia's predominantly white government, which issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965, accepted majority rule under the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in 1979.<ref name="zimstudy">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=54–137|year=1983|isbn=978-0160015984|publisher=Claitors Publishing Division}}</ref>

The [[Benguela railway]], which extended west through Angola, was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late 1970s. Zambia's support for [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] movements such as the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) also created security problems as the [[South African Defence Force]] struck at dissident targets during external raids.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Evans, M. |title=The Front-Line States, South Africa and Southern African Security: Military Prospects and Perspectives |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol12n1/juz012001002.pdf |page=1 |journal=Zambezia |year=1984 |volume=12}}</ref>

====Economic troubles====

In the mid-1970s, the price of copper, Zambia's principal export, suffered a severe decline worldwide. In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to the market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia (12/08)|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/zambia/102331.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

====Democratisation====

In the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006–2007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}

[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]

Politics in Zambia take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Zambia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in a pluriform<!--Does this add anything to multi-party system?--> [[multi-party system]]. The government exercises executive power, while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.

Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October 1964. From 2011 to 2014, Zambia's president had been Michael Sata, until Sata died on 28 October 2014.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29813612 Zambian President Michael Sata dies in London]. BBC. 29 October 2014</ref>

After Sata's death, Vice President [[Guy Scott]], a Zambian of Scottish descent, became acting President of Zambia. On 24 January 2015, it was announced that [[Edgar Lungu|Edgar Chagwa Lungu]] had won the [[Zambian presidential election, 2015|election]] to become the 6th President in a tightly contested race. He won 48.33% of the vote, a lead of 1.66% over his closest rival, [[Hakainde Hichilema]], with 46.67%.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/defence-minister-edgar-lungu-wins-zambia-vote-203552285.html Defence Minister Lungu wins Zambia's disputed presidential race].

In December 2019, it was reported that [[United States]] Ambassador to Zambia [[Daniel Lewis Foote]] was "horrified" by Zambia's jailing of same-sex couple Japhet Chataba and Steven Samba. After an appeal failed and the couple was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Foote asked the Zambian government to review both the case and the country's anti-homosexuality laws. Foote faced a backlash and canceled public appearances after he was threatened on social media, and was subsequently recalled after President Lungu declared him [[persona non grata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50901537|title=US recalls ambassador to Zambia after gay rights row|website=BBC News|date=December 24, 2019}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Zambia|Geology of Zambia}}

[[File:Zambia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Zambia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Zambia is a [[landlocked]] country in southern Africa, with a [[tropical climate]], and consists mostly of high [[plateaus]] with some hills and mountains, dissected by river valleys. At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes [[8th parallel south|8°]] and [[18th parallel south|18°S]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22°]] and [[34th meridian east|34°E]].

Zambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the center, west, and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.

In the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with [[Namibia]], Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most are lost by evaporation.<ref name="Beilfuss">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001)  [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf "Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>

Two of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with [[Mozambique]]. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].

The Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Victoria Falls]], located in the south-west corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east, it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].

The north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The [[floodplain|flood]] dominates the natural environment and the lives, society, and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.

[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]
In Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and [[Lake Tanganyika]] valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala. These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as a large section of the [[Central Zambezian miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Geography {{!}} Zambian High Commission|url=https://www.zambiapretoria.net/geography/|website=www.zambiapretoria.net|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

Eastern Zambia shows great diversity. The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the [[Lunsemfwa River]]. Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley, notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau ({{convert|2200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the Malawi border, which extend into Zambia as the [[Mafinga Hills]], containing the country's highest point, [[Mafinga Central]] ({{convert|2339|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/mafinga-south-and-mafinga-central-the-highest-peaks-in-zambia/ |title=Mafinga South and Mafinga Central: the highest peaks in Zambia |publisher=Footsteps on the Mountain blog |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}</ref>

The Muchinga Mountains, the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins, run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge, although they are almost everywhere below {{convert|1700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at {{convert|1892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region. The border of the [[Congo Pedicle]] was drawn around this mountain.

The southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]] and then, after the [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu Swamps]] as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]], which forms part of the border with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).

[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major [[hydrography|hydrographic]] feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the [[Kalambo River]], which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the [[Kalambo Falls]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}
Zambia is located on the plateau of [[Central Africa]], between 1000 and 1600 m above sea level. The average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}} generally has a moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation. In the [[Köppen climate classification]], most of the country is classified as [[humid subtropical]] or [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]], with small stretches of semi-arid [[steppe climate]] in the south-west and along the [[Zambezi valley]].

There are two main seasons, the [[rainy season]] (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the [[dry season]] (May/June to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August.<ref>''Spectrum Guide to Zambia''. Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996. {{ISBN|1874041148}}.</ref> However, average monthly temperatures remain above {{convert|20|°C}} over most of the country for eight or more months of the year.

An estimated 757 bird species have been seen in the country, of which 600 are either resident or Afrotropic migrants; 470 breed in the country; and 100 are non-breeding migrants. The [[Zambian barbet]] is a species endemic to Zambia.

Roughly 490 known fish species, belonging to 24 fish [[Family (biology)|families]], have been reported in Zambia, with [[Lake Tanganyika]] having the highest number of endemic species.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fish – arczambia.com|url=https://www.arczambia.com/conservation/wildlife/fish/|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

==Demographics==
{{Historical census population in Zambia}}
{{Main|Demographics of Zambia}}
As of the [[2010 Zambian census]], Zambia's population was 13,092,666. Zambia is ethnically diverse, with 73 distinct tribes. During its occupation by the British between 1911 and 1963, the country attracted immigrants from Europe and the Indian subcontinent, the latter of whom came as indentured workers. While most Europeans left after the collapse of white minority rule, many Asians remained.

[[File:Umutomboko ceremony.jpg|thumb|Chief [[Mwata Kazembe]] opens the Mutomboko ceremony]]
In the first census—conducted on 7 May 1911—there were a total of 1,497 Europeans; 39 Asiatics and an estimated 820,000 Africans. Black Africans were not counted in the six censuses conducted in 1911, 1921, 1931, 1946, 1951, and 1956, prior to independence. By 1956 there were 65,277 Europeans; 5,450 Asiatics; 5,450 Coloureds and an estimated 2,100,000 Africans.

In the 2010 population census, 99.2% were Black Africans and 0.8% consisted of major racial groups.

Zambia has a minority of [[coloureds]] of [[mixed race]]. During colonialism, [[Racial segregation|segregation]] separated [[coloureds]], blacks and whites in public places including schools, hospitals, and in housing. There has been an increase in interracial relationships due to Zambia's growing economy importing labor. Coloureds are not recorded on the census but are considered a minority in Zambia.

According to the ''World Refugee Survey 2009'' published by the [[US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], Zambia had a population of [[refugee]]s and asylum seekers numbering approximately 88,900.

===Religion===
{{Further|Religion in Zambia}}

{{Religious affiliation in Zambia}}

Zambia is a Christian nation according to the 1996 constitution,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3713564/Constitution-of-Zambia-1991Amended-to-1996 |title=Constitution of Zambia, 1991(Amended to 1996) |publisher=Scribd.com |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> but a wide variety of religious traditions exist. Traditional religious thoughts blend easily with Christian beliefs in many of the country's [[syncretism|syncretic]] churches. About three-fourths of the population is [[Protestant]] while about 20% follow [[Roman Catholicism]]. Christian denominations include Catholicism, [[Anglicanism]], [[Pentecostalism]], [[New Apostolic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Branhamites]], and a variety of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Zambia}}
{{Major language groups in Zambia}}
The official language of Zambia is [[English language|English]], which is used for official business and instruction in schools. The main local language, especially in Lusaka, is [[Nyanja|Nyanja (Chewa)]], followed by [[Bemba language|Bemba]]. In the Copperbelt [[Bemba language|Bemba]] is the main language and [[Nyanja]] second. [[Bemba language|Bemba]] and [[Nyanja]] are spoken in the urban areas in addition to other indigenous languages which are commonly spoken in Zambia. These include [[Lozi language|Lozi]], [[Kaonde]], [[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]], [[Lunda languages|Lunda]] and [[Luvale]], which feature on the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC) local languages section. The total number of languages spoken in Zambia is 73.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Britanica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zambia/People|date=2020-05-26|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

{{Dominant regional languages in Zambia}}
Urbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.

Most will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is dominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among&nbsp;– now common&nbsp;– interethnic families. This evolution of languages has led to [[Zambian slang]] heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities. The majority of Zambians usually speak more than one language, the official language, English, and the most spoken language in the town or area they live in. Portuguese has been introduced as a second language into the school curriculum due to the presence of a large Portuguese-speaking Angolan community.<ref>[http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html Zambia to introduce Portuguese into school curriculum]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208151924/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html |date=8 December 2012 }}</ref> French is commonly studied in private schools, while some secondary schools have it as an optional subject.

{{Annual Education Expenditure in Zambia}}
Fundamentally, the aim of education in Zambia is to promote the full and well-rounded development of the physical, intellectual, social, affective, moral, and spiritual qualities of all learners. The education system has three core structures: [[Early childhood education]] and [[Primary education|Primary education (Grades 1&nbsp;– 7)]], [[Secondary education|Secondary education (Grades 8&nbsp;– 12)]] and [[Tertiary education]]. Adult Literacy programs are available for semi-literate and illiterate individuals.

The government's annual expenditure on education has increased over the years, increasing from 16.1% in 2006 to 20.2% in 2015.

Zambia fell into poverty after international copper prices declined in the 1970s. The socialist regime made up for falling revenue with several abortive attempts at [[International Monetary Fund]] [[structural adjustment]] programs (SAPs). The policy of not trading through the main supply route and line of rail to the sea&nbsp;– the territory was known as Rhodesia (from 1965 to 1979), and now known as Zimbabwe&nbsp;– cost the economy greatly. After the Kaunda regime, (from 1991) successive governments began limited reforms. The economy stagnated until the late 1990s. In 2007 Zambia recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth. Inflation was 8.9%, down from 30% in 2000.<ref name="dos2009"/>

Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.

[[File:GDP per capita (current), % of world average, 1960-2012; Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique.png|thumb|upright=1.5|GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100)]]
In January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and [[World Bank]] that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing the number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724213759/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2108 The World Bank and IMF's long shadow in Zambia's copper mines]. eurodad.org. 20 February 2008</ref>

The Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia's rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power. In July 2018, Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] and Zambia's President Edgar Lungu signed 12 agreements in capital Lusaka on areas ranging from trade and investment to tourism and diplomacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/africa/turkey-and-zambia-sign-agreements-to-boost-bilateral-ties-19216|title=Turkey and Zambia sign agreements to boost bilateral ties|website=Turkey and Zambia sign agreements to boost bilateral ties|language=tr-TR|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/turkey-zambia-sign-12-deals-to-boost-bilateral-ties/1216679|title=Turkey, Zambia sign 12 deals to boost bilateral ties|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref>

===Mining===
The Zambian economy has historically been based on the [[copper mining]] industry. The output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 metric tons in 1998 after a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, low copper prices, and uncertainty over privatisation. In 2002, following the privatisation of the industry, copper production rebounded to 337,000 metric tons. Improvements in the world copper market have magnified the effect of this volume increase on revenues and foreign exchange earnings.

In 2003, exports of [[nonmetal]]s increased by 25% and accounted for 38% of all export earnings, previously 35%.

[[File:Nsima Relishes.JPG|thumb|''[[Nshima]]'' (top right corner) with three types of [[relish]].]]
Prior to the establishment of modern Zambia, the inhabitants lived in independent tribes, each with its own way of life. One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other as well as adopting a lot of the [[European culture]]. The original cultures have largely survived in rural areas with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced. In the urban setting, there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is now called "Zambian culture".

[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]
Traditional culture is very visible through colourful annual [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]]. Some of the more prominent are: [[Kuomboka]] and [[Kathanga]] (Western Province), [[Kazembe#Mutomboko Festival|Mutomboko]] (Luapula Province), [[Kulamba ceremony|Kulamba]] and [[Ncwala]] (Eastern Province), [[Lwiindi]] and [[Shimunenga]] (Southern Province), [[Lunda Lubanza]] (North Western), [[Likumbi Lyamize]] (North Western),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ellert|first=Henrik|title=The magic of the makishi: masks and traditions in Zambia|publisher=CBC publishing|year=2004|isbn=0951520997|location=Bath, UK|pages=38–63}}</ref> [[Mbunda Lukwakwa]] (North Western Province), [[Chibwela Kumushi]] (Central Province), [[Vinkhakanimba]] (Muchinga Province), [[Ukusefya Pa Ng'wena]] (Northern Province).

Popular traditional arts are mainly in pottery, basketry (such as [[Tonga baskets]]), stools, fabrics, mats, wooden carvings, ivory carvings, wire craft, and copper crafts. Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In the urban areas, foreign genres of music are popular, in particular Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae. Several psychedelic rock artists emerged in the 1970s to create a genre known as [[Zam-rock]], including WITCH, Musi-O-Tunya, Rikki Ililonga, Amanaz, the Peace, Chrissy Zebby Tembo, Blackfoot, and the Ngozi Family.

Zambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic game as one country, and leave it as another. In 2016, Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games. Two medals were won. The medals were won successively in boxing and on the track. In 1984 Keith Mwila won a bronze medal in the light flyweight. In 1996 Samuel Matete won a silver medal in the 400-metre hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter Olympics.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the [[Zambia national football team]] has had its triumphant moments in football history. At the [[Seoul Olympics]] in 1988, the national team defeated the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] with a score of 4–0. [[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player, and one of Africa's greatest football players in history scored a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville, Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice. They beat Côte d'Ivoire 8–7 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, which was played in Libreville, just a few kilometers away from the plane crash 19 years previously.<ref name="Africa Cup">{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/zambia-score-emotional-african-cup-win-20120213-1t0fb.html|title=Zambia score emotional African Cup win |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=11 February 2012|date=13 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, Zambia was due to host the [[2011 All-Africa Games|tenth All-Africa Games]], for which three stadiums were to be built in [[Lusaka]], [[Ndola]], and [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]].<ref name="games">{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200602/22/eng20060222_244775.html|title=Zambia to build three stadia for 2011 All-Africa Games|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=6 November 2007}}</ref> The Lusaka stadium would have a capacity of 70,000 spectators while the other two stadiums would hold 50,000 people each. The government was encouraging the private sector to get involved in the construction of the sports facilities because of a shortage of public funds for the project. Zambia later withdrew its bid to host the 2011 All-Africa Games, citing a lack of funds. Hence, Mozambique took Zambia's place as host.

Zambia also produced the first black African ([[Madalitso Muthiya]]) to play in the [[United States Golf Open]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-05/sports/0805040183_1_zambia-frederick-chiluba-nationwide-tour|title=Zambia's Madalitso Muthiya a pioneer|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> one of the four major golf tournaments.

In 1989, the country's [[Zambia national basketball team|basketball team]] had its best performance when it qualified for the [[FIBA Africa Championship]] and thus finished as one of Africa's top ten teams.<ref>[http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid//sid/2403/tid/0/_/1989_AfroBasket/index.html 1989 African Championship for Men], ARCHIVE.FIBA.COM.

In 2017, Zambia hosted and won the Pan-African football tournament [[2017 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations|U-20 African Cup of Nation]] for players age 20 and under.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/12/16/zambia-outsmart-south-africa-win-record-cosafa-u20-crown/|title=Zambia outsmart South Africa to win record Cosafa U20 crown|date=16 December 2016|work=Lusaka Times}}</ref>

===Music and dance===
Zambia's culture has been an integral part of their development post-independence such as the uprising of cultural villages and private museums. The music which introduced dance is part of their cultural expression and it embodies the beauty and spectacle of life in Zambia, from the intricacies of the talking drums to the ''Kamangu'' drum used to announce the beginning of ''Malaila'' traditional ceremony. Dance as a practice serves as a unifying factor bringing the people together as one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ayibamagazine.com/unrivaled-zambian-culture/|title=The Unrivaled Zambian Culture |website= Ayiba Magazine|date=14 June 2016}}</ref>

====Zamrock==== 
is a musical genre that emerged in the 1970s, and has developed a cult following in the West. [[Zamrock]] has been described as mixing traditional Zambian music with heavy repetitive riffs similar to groups such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[James Brown]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Deep Purple]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicinafrica.net/magazine/salt-thunder-mind-altering-rock-1970s-zambia|title=Salt & thunder: The mind-altering rock of 1970s Zambia|date=2015-12-11|work=Music In Africa|access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/zamrock-zambia-music-rerelease|title=Why Zamrock is back in play|last1=S|first1=Henning Goranson|last2=Press|first2=berg for Think Africa|date=2013-07-22|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|last3=Network|first3=part of the Guardian Africa}}</ref> Notable groups in the genre include [[Rikki Ililonga]] and his band [[Musi-O-Tunya]], [[Witch (Zamrock band)|WITCH]], [[Chrissy "Zebby" Tembo]], and [[Paul Ngozi|Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family]].<ref name="azambianband">{{cite web | url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/7/were-a-zambian-band | title=We're a Zambian Band | publisher= theappendix.net | accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=":2">[http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/5657 WITCH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914035049/http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/5657 |date=14 September 2017 }} on Dusted Magazine (Apr. 15, 2010)</ref>
