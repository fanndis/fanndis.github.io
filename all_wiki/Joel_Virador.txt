In 1995, after 8 years serving the TFDP, Virador was appointed secretary-general of [[Karapatan|KARAPATAN]].<ref name=":0" /> After 5 years in KARAPATAN, Virador joined Bayan Muna in 2000 becoming the party’s spokesperson in Southern Mindanao.

Virador, in 2002, was charged with rebellion by linking his name to the alias of a [[New People's Army]] commander. The case was later dismissed.

== Political career ==
Virador was nominated as Bayan Muna's 4th nominee for the [[2001 Philippine House of Representatives elections]].

On November 7, 2003, following the resignation of [[Crispin Beltran]], Virador assumed the vacated party-list seat. While in Congress, Virador stood up to deliver privilege speeches questioning the legality of joint RP-US [[Balikatan]] military exercises in Mindanao, the violation of human rights of the civilian populace during military operations, and the problems of landlessness and displacement of peasant tillers and rural workers.

On February 24, 2004, Virador was nominated as Bayan Muna's 3rd nominee for the [[2004 Philippine House of Representatives elections]] where he won a seat. During his stint in the [[13th Congress of the Philippines]], he was concerned mostly with issues of indigenous peoples, the [[Moro people|Moros]], and the environment. He also handled the party's issues on agriculture, women and privatization of water services. He was vice-chairperson of the House of Representatives' Mindanao Affairs Committee.

Bayan Muna opposed [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s presidency on claims of corruption due to the [[Hello Garci controversy]], the [[Fertilizer Fund Scam|fertilizer fund scam]], allegations over widespread human rights abuses, including the [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|State of Emergency]] in February 2006. During the suspension of freedoms, the 6 members were sought out with arrest warrants by the government and took refuge in Congress. Crispin Beltran was illegally arrested by state agents and was detained for more than a year. Virador was nabbed by state agents in [[Davao City]]. Thenceforth, the group of Bayan Muna, [[Anakpawis]] and [[Gabriela Women's Party|Gabriela]] representatives -- [[Satur Ocampo]], [[Teodoro Casiño]], Virador, [[Liza Maza]], Beltran and fellow Anakpawis [[Rafael Mariano]] became known as the [[Batasan 6]].

== Personal life ==
Virador was married to Imelda Lumayag-Virador, an activist and Bayan Muna member. They had two children, daughter Joanna Paula Vasig, and son Harvey Rafael Virador.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

== Death ==
Virador died on May 7, 2019 at Brokenshire Hospital in Davao City due to papillary carcinoma or thyroid cancer. He was first diagnosed sometime in 2013.<ref name=":1" />
