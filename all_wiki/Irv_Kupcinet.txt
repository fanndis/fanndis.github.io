'''Irving "Irv" Kupcinet''' (July 31, 1912 – November 10, 2003) was an American newspaper columnist for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', television talk-show host, and radio personality based in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  He was popularly known by the nickname "Kup".

His daily "Kup's Column" was launched in 1943 and remained a fixture in the ''Sun-Times'' for the next six decades.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilgoren |first=Jodi |title=For Chicago's 'Town Crier,' the Stories Linger |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D71E3AF937A2575BC0A9649C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=August 14, 2002 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>

His football career was cut short due to a shoulder injury, which led him to take a job as a sports writer for the ''Chicago Daily Times'' (now known as the ''Chicago Sun-Times'') in 1935.<ref name=chicago>{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Niel |title='Mr. Chicago' is dead at 91 Irv Kupcinet 1912-2003 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20031111/ai_n12529474/pg_2 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=November 11, 2003 |accessdate =2007-11-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
