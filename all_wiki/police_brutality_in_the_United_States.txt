[[Police brutality]] is the use of excessive or unnecessary force by personnel affiliated with [[law enforcement]] duties when dealing with suspects and civilians. The term is also applied to abuses by [[corrections]] personnel in municipal, state, and federal [[Prison|penal facilities]], including [[military prison]]s.

The term ''police brutality'' is usually applied in the context of causing physical [[harm]] to a person. It may also involve psychological harm through the use of intimidation tactics beyond the scope of officially sanctioned police procedure. From the 18th-20th centuries, those who engaged in police brutality may have acted with the implicit approval of the local legal system, such as during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era. In the contemporary era, individuals who engage in police brutality may do so with the tacit approval of their superiors or they may be rogue officers. In either case, they may perpetrate their actions under [[color of law]] and, more often than not, engage in a subsequent cover-up of their unlawful activity.

In the 2000s, the federal government attempted tracking the number of people [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|killed in interactions with US police]], but the program was defunded.<ref>March 18, 2015.

Since the 20th century, there have been many public, private, and community efforts to combat [[police corruption]] and brutality. These efforts have identified various core issues that contribute to police brutality, including the insular culture of police departments (including the [[blue wall of silence]]), the aggressive defense of police officers and resistance to change in [[police union]]s,<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Scheiber|first1=Noam|last2=Stockman|first2=Farah|last3=Goodman|first3=J.

Regarding solutions, activists and advocates have taken different approaches.

==History==

=== Slave patrols roots ===
In the [[Southern United States]], some of the earliest roots of policing can be found in [[slave patrol]]s. Beginning in the 18th century, white volunteers developed slave patrols (also known as "paddyrollers"), which were squadrons that acted as [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Hassett-Walker|first=Connie|title=George Floyd's death reflects the racist roots of American policing|url=https://theconversation.com/george-floyds-death-reflects-the-racist-roots-of-american-policing-139805|access-date=2020-06-11|work=The Conversation|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1704, the first slave patrol was established in [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Brief History of Slavery and the Origins of American Policing {{!}} Police Studies Online|url=https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing|access-date=2020-06-07|website=plsonline.eku.edu}}</ref> Eventually, all states with legal slavery had slave patrols, and they functioned as the first publicly funded police force in the South.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=The History of the Police|url=https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/50819_ch_1.pdf}}</ref> These patrols focused on enforcing discipline and policing of [[Slavery in the United States|African-American slaves]]. They captured and returned [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]], quashed [[slave rebellion]]s, [[Terrorism|terrorized]] slaves in order to prevent rebellions (including beatings and<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Slave Patrols and the Origins of Policing|url=https://ellabakercenter.org/blog/2015/11/slave-patrols-and-the-origins-of-policing|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Ella Baker Center|language=en}}</ref> searches of slave lodges), broke up slave meetings, and kept slaves off of roadways.<ref name=":3" /> The patrols also administered discipline of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref name=":3" /> The patrols had broad influence and powers; they could forcefully enter all people's homes, if there was any suspicion of sheltering fugitive slaves.<ref name=":2" /> During the [[American Civil War]], slave patrols remained in place. After the Civil War, in the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction period]], the former slave patrol groups joined with other white militias and groups, such as the [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan]]. Meanwhile, early police forces of the South began to take on the role of policing and regulating the movement of African-Americans who had gained their freedom. New laws were put in place to restrict their rights, which were known as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]].<ref name=":2" /> According to some historians, the transition from slave patrols to police forces in the South was a seamless one.<ref name=":3" />

=== Texas Rangers ===
{{See also|Texas Ranger Division}}In 1823, the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] was established by [[Stephen F. Austin]]. The Rangers used violence, harassment, and intimidation to protect the interests of white colonists. They worked in an area that was governed by [[Mexico]], which later became the [[Republic of Texas]], followed by the state of [[Texas]]. The Rangers were known to be particularly active across the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexico-United States border]]. Their work included capturing [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] who were accused of attacking white settlers, investigating crimes such as [[cattle raiding]], and raiding Mexican [[vaquero]] cattle ranches. They intimidated Mexican and Mexican-American people into leaving their land and homes, in support of white colonial expansion. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Texas Rangers supported and participated in [[Extrajudicial killing|extrajudicial killings]] and [[Lynching|lynch mobs]], such as [[La Matanza (1910–1920)|''La Matanza'' (1910–1920)]] and [[Porvenir massacre (1918)]].<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-04|title=A New History Tears Down the Myth of the Texas Rangers|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/a-new-history-tears-down-the-myth-of-the-texas-rangers/|access-date=2020-06-20|website=The Texas Observer|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Rosa |last=Flores |others=video by Lauren Cook|title=Their ancestors were slain a century ago along the US-Mexico border.

=== Early police departments ===
In 1838, the United States developed its first formal [[Police|police department]] in [[Boston]]. This was followed by [[New York City]] (1845), [[Albany, New York]] (1851), [[Chicago]] (1851), [[New Orleans]] (1853), [[Cincinnati]] (1853), [[Philadelphia]] (1855), [[Newark, New Jersey]] (1857), [[Baltimore]] (1857). By the 1880s, all major US cities had police departments.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The History Of Policing In The United States, Part 1 {{!}} Police Studies Online {{!}} Eastern Kentucky University|url=https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/history-policing-united-states-part-1#:~:text=In%201838,%20the%20city%20of,Lundman%201980;%20Lynch%201984).|access-date=2020-06-08|website=plsonline.eku.edu}}</ref> As written by Dr. Garry Potter, "Early American police departments shared two primary characteristics: they were notoriously corrupt and flagrantly brutal.

The chief would be expected to follow the orders and expectations of the ward leader, which often included intimidating voters, harassing political opponents, and ensuring that the ward's business interests remain intact.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Nodjimbadem|first=Katie|title=The Long, Painful History of Police Brutality in the U.S.|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/long-painful-history-police-brutality-in-the-us-180964098/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The police officers typically had little qualifications or training as law enforcement officers, and they often took bribes and kickbacks. If conflicts arose, it was common for police officers to use force and brutality.<ref name="plsonline.eku.edu"/>

In the 19th century, police brutality was often directed at European [[Immigration|immigrant]] communities,<ref name=":4" /> particularly those from [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=How the U.S. Got Its Police Force|url=https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Time|language=en}}</ref> The different cultures of these communities were often framed as "dangerous," which called for the enforcement of law and order.<ref name=":4" /> For example, Irish immigrants were considered a "dangerous" class, and they experienced discrimination by [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gershon|first=Livia|title=How Stereotypes of the Irish Evolved From 'Criminals' to Cops|url=https://www.history.com/news/how-stereotypes-of-the-irish-evolved-from-criminals-to-cops|access-date=2020-06-09|website=HISTORY|language=en}}</ref> Meanwhile, organized crime and political parties were often intertwined, and police typically cast a blind eye toward gambling and prostitution, if managed by politically influential figures.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|title=The History of Policing in the United States, Part 4 {{!}} Police Studies Online|url=https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/history-policing-united-states-part-4|access-date=2020-06-09|website=plsonline.eku.edu}}</ref>

=== Strike breaking ===
After the Civil War, [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] grew rapidly in the United States. This was accompanied by a rising organized [[Labour movement|labor movement]], in which workers formed [[Trade union|unions]] and joined in organized actions, such as [[Strike action|strikes]]. Between 1880 and 1900, New York City had 5,090 strikes and Chicago had 1,737 strikes. The economic elites of the era typically characterized these strikes as "[[riot]]s," and they encouraged the police to break the strikes. Consequently, the police broke up strikes through two primary methods: extreme violence and making "public order" arrests at a mass scale.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The History of Policing in the United States, Part 3|url=https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/history-policing-united-states-part-3}}</ref> Some state governments authorized privatized police forces to repress strikes, such as the [[Coal and Iron Police]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. Private detective agencies, such as [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]], often supervised these efforts. Violent confrontations came out of this system, such as the [[Lattimer massacre|Latimer Massacre]] (1897), in which 19 unarmed miners were killed, and the [[Coal strike of 1902|Coal Strike of 1902]], which involved a pitched battle for five months. Ultimately, state governments decided that it would be easier to police labor with public forces, leading to establishment of state police forces (such as the [[Pennsylvania State Police]], formed in 1905). <ref name=":7" />

=== Jim Crow South ===
{{Main|Jim Crow laws}}
By the late 19th century, local and state governments began to pass [[Jim Crow laws]]. These laws enforced strict [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in schools, parks, neighborhoods, restaurants, and other public places.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=Jim Crow Laws|url=https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws|access-date=2020-06-07|website=HISTORY|language=en}}</ref> This era saw a rise in [[lynching]]s and mob murders of African-Americans, with the police not arresting the perpetrators.<ref name=":2" /> It was estimated that "at least one-half of the lynchings are carried out with police officers participating, and that in nine-tenths of the others the officers either condone or wink at the mob action," as reported by [[Arthur F. Raper|Arthur F. Rapper]] in 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What was Jim Crow - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|url=https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm|access-date=2020-06-08|website=www.ferris.edu}}</ref> Meanwhile, African-Americans suffered police brutality, such as the 1946 beating of [[Isaac Woodard|Isaac Woodward]] in [[Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina|Batesburg, South Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Police Beating That Opened America's Eyes to Jim Crow's Brutality|url=https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/11/05/the-police-beating-that-opened-americas-eyes-to-jim-crows-brutality/|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Snopes.com|language=en-US}}</ref> Due to the brutality of Jim Crowe laws, many African-Americans fled to Northern cities, where they experienced police brutality, as well.<ref name=":4" />

=== Professionalization of police ===
In the United States, the passage of the [[Volstead Act]] (popularly known as the National Prohibition Act) in 1919 had a long-term negative impact on policing practices. During [[Prohibition]] (1919–33), the problem of police corruption was only worsened, as crime was growing dramatically in response to the demand for illegal alcohol. Many law enforcement agencies stepped up the use of unlawful practices. Police officers were commonly bribed so that bootlegging and [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] could continue, in addition to the flourishing organized crime underworlds of cities such as Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Prohibition: Unintended Consequences {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/unintended-consequences/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> Some police officers became employed by organized crime syndicates, and they helped perform duties, such as harassment and intimidation of rivals.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

By the time of the [[Herbert Clark Hoover|Hoover]] administration (1929–1933), the issue had risen to national concern and a National Committee on Law Observation and Enforcement (popularly known as the [[Wickersham Commission]]) was formed to look into the situation.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1931-02-02|title=Wicker shambles|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740911-3,00.html|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The resulting "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" (1931) concluded that "[t]he [[third degree (interrogation)|third degree]]—that is, the use of physical brutality, or other forms of cruelty, to obtain involuntary confessions or admissions—is widespread."<ref>{{cite web|author=University Publications of America|date=December 1997|title=Records of the Wickersham Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/academic/guides/jurisprudence/wickersham.asp|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=LexisNexis}}</ref> In the years following the report, landmark legal judgments such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'' helped cement a legal obligation to respect the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web|author=United States Supreme Court|author-link=United States Supreme Court|date=1936-02-17|title=BROWN et al. v.

The result was the beginning of a new era in law enforcement in the United States, which aimed to [[Professionalization|professionalize]] and [[Police reform in the United States|reform]] the industry. It was decided that police should function separately from political wards or leaders, and police precincts were altered to no longer overlap with political wards.<ref name=":5" /> Police departments became more [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] with a clear chain of command. New practices were put into place to recruit, train, and reward police officers. By the 1950s, police officers began to win [[collective bargaining]] rights and form [[Trade union|unions]], after a long period of not being allowed to form unions (particularly after the [[Boston Police Strike|Boston police strike]] in 1919).<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|last=Bekemeyer|first=Aaron|title=Perspective {{!}} The long tie between police unions and police violence — and what to do about it|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/09/limits-when-police-can-use-force-is-better-solution-than-banning-police-unions/|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Washington Post|language=en}}</ref>

However, these changes were not welcomed by all community members. Police departments adopted tactics that often antagonized people, such as aggressive [[Terry stop|stop and frisk]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The History of Policing in the United States, Part 5 {{!}} Police Studies Online|url=https://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/history-policing-united-states-part-5|access-date=2020-06-09|website=plsonline.eku.edu}}</ref> Police departments also became increasingly insular and "isolated from public life" as a result of these changes, according to crime historian Samuel Walker. For these reasons, among other reasons, they were particularly unequipped to handle the cultural and social upheaval of the 1960s.<ref name=":5" />

===Civil Rights Movement era===
The Civil Rights Movement was the target of numerous incidents of police brutality in its struggle for justice and [[racial equality]], notably during the [[Birmingham campaign]] of 1963–64 and during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965. Media coverage of the brutality sparked national outrage, and public sympathy for the movement grew rapidly as a result. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] criticized police brutality in his speeches. Furthermore, the period was marked by riots in response to police violence against African-Americans and Latinos, including the [[Harlem riot of 1964]], [[1964 Philadelphia race riot]], [[Watts riots]] (1965), [[Division Street riots]] (1966), and [[1967 Detroit riot]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=BlackPast|title=Racial Violence in the United States Since 1660 •|url=https://www.blackpast.org/special-features/racial-violence-united-states-1660/|access-date=2020-06-09|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1966, the [[Black Panther Party]] was formed by [[Huey P.

In 1968, the [[American Indian Movement]] was organized in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], in response to widespread [[Police brutality against Native Americans|police brutality used against urban Native Americans]]. Founded by [[Dennis Banks]], [[Clyde Bellecourt]], [[Vernon Bellecourt]], and [[Russell Means]], the movement grew while 75 percent of Native Americans had moved to urban areas, becoming [[Urban Indians]] as a result of federal [[Indian Termination Act]] and other policies. A.I.M. was later accepted by traditional Elders living at Native American reservations. 

The Civil Rights Movement and A.I.M. were also targeted by the [[FBI]] in a program called [[COINTELPRO]] (1956–79, and beyond). Under this program, the FBI would use undercover agents and police to create violence and chaos within political groups, such as the [[American Indian Movement]], [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Worker's Party]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=COINTELPRO|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro|access-date=2020-06-09|website=FBI|language=en-us}}</ref> The police and undercover agents would harm organizers and assassinate leaders. Black Panther leaders [[Mark Clark (activist)|Mark Clark]] and [[Fred Hampton]], were killed in a 1969 FBI raid at Hampton's apartment in Chicago.<ref name="Nelson" />

In the United States, race and accusations of police brutality continue to be closely linked, and the phenomenon has sparked a string of [[race riots]] over the years. Especially notable among these incidents was the uprising caused by the arrest and beating of [[Rodney King]] on March 3, 1991, by officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. The atmosphere was particularly volatile because the brutality had been videotaped by a civilian and widely broadcast afterwards. When the four law enforcement officers charged with assault and other violations were acquitted, the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]] broke out.

[[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|One notorious assault]] took place during the August [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]].

===War on drugs===
{{See also|War on drugs}}
In June 1971, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] declared a [[War on drugs|War on Drugs]]. This new "war" brought in stricter policing and criminal laws, including [[no-knock warrant]]s and [[mandatory sentencing]]. As was the case with [[Prohibition]], the War on Drugs was marked by increased [[police misconduct]]. War on drugs policing - notably [[stop and frisk]] and [[Special Weapons and Tactics]] (SWAT) teams - contributed to police brutality, especially targeting minority communities.<ref name="Cooper">{{Cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Hannah LF |date=2015 |title=War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality |journal=Substance Use & Misuse |volume=50 |issue=8–9 |pages=1188–1194 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2015.1007669 |issn=1082-6084 |pmc=4800748 |pmid=25775311}}</ref> Years later, Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]], explained: "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people...  We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either... but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news."<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Brief History of the Drug War|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/brief-history-drug-war|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en}}</ref>

The war on drugs has been seen as responsible for police misconduct towards African-Americans and Latinos. While white people and African-Americans both use and sell drugs at roughly similar rates, African-Americans are over six times as likely to be incarcerated for drug-related charges, according to 2015 data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rates of Drug Use and Sales, by Race; Rates of Drug Related Criminal Justice Measures, by Race {{!}} The Hamilton Project|url=https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice|access-date=2020-06-09|website=www.hamiltonproject.org}}</ref><ref name="Nelson">{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Jill|title=Police Brutality: An Anthology|url=https://archive.org/details/policebrutality00jill|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|location=New York}}</ref> Specifically, the use of stop and frisk tactics by police have targeted African-Americans and Latinos. In looking at data from New York in the early 2000s up to 2014, people who had committed no offense made up 82% to 90% of those who were stopped and frisked. Of those people stopped, only 9% to 12% were white. People who were stopped felt that they had experienced psychological violence, and the police sometimes used insults against them. Stop and frisk tactics caused people to experience anxiety about leaving their homes, due to fears of police harassment and abuse.<ref name="Cooper" />

With the militarization of the police, [[SWAT]] teams have been used more frequently in drug possession situations.<ref name=":6" /> SWAT teams can be armed with weapons like diversionary grenades. In cases where SWAT teams were used, only 35% of the time were drugs found in peoples' homes. African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately the targets of these raids,<ref name="Cooper" /> and according to the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], "Sending a heavily armed team of officers to perform 'normal' police work can dangerously escalate situations that need never have involved violence."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Police Militarization|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/police-militarization|access-date=2020-06-09|website=American Civil Liberties Union|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Millions March NYC (15990456536).jpg|thumb|Protest against police brutality in [[New York City]], December 2014]]
After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]], [[human rights]] observers raised concerns about increased police brutality in the U.S. An extensive report prepared for the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], published in 2006, stated that in the U.S. the [[War on Terror]] "created a generalized climate of impunity for law enforcement officers, and contributed to the erosion of what few accountability mechanisms exist for civilian control over law enforcement agencies. As a result, police brutality and abuse persist unabated and undeterred across the country."<ref name="War on Terror">{{cite web |title=In the Shadows of the War on Terror: Persistent Police Brutality and Abuse in the United States |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/usa/USHRN15.pdf |last1=Ritchie |first1=Andrea |last2=Mogul |first2=Joey |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215161444/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/usa/USHRN15.pdf |archive-date=December 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The culture of impunity for police is reinforced by law enforcement operations with the FBI's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]], which undertakes "disruption" actions against suspects instead of investigations and criminal charges. During the "war on terror," there has been noted increases in enforcement power for officers. By 2007, discussion on the appropriateness of using [[racial profiling]] and force against people of color has decreased since 9/11.<ref name="War on Terror"/> Racial profiling specifically increased for those of South Asian, Arab, Middle Eastern, and Muslim origins.<ref name="War on Terror" /> An example of increased use of police [[use of force]] has been in the use of [[taser]]s. From 2001 to 2007, at least 150 deaths were attributed to tasers and many injuries occurred. People of color have been the main people who have been targeted the most with regards to increased taser use.<ref name="War on Terror" />

A decision by the [[Hawaii's congressional districts|House]] and the [[Hawaii Senate|Senate]] in [[Hawaii]] was expected in May 2014 after police agreed in March 2014 not to oppose the revision of a law that was implemented in the 1970s, allowing [[Undercover operation|undercover police officers]] to engage in sexual relations with [[sex worker]]s during the course of investigations. (A similar program in the [[United Kingdom]] resulted in physical and emotional abuse of victims, and children born without fathers when the undercover operation ended; see [[UK undercover policing relationships scandal]]). Following initial protest from supporters of the legislation, all objections were retracted on March 25, 2014. A [[Honolulu]] police spokeswoman informed ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that, at the time of the court's decision, no reports had been made in regard to the abuse of the exemption by police, while a Hawaiian senator stated to journalists: "I suppose that in retrospect the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation." However, the Pacifica Alliance to Stop Slavery and other advocates affirmed their knowledge of police brutality in this area and explained that the fear of retribution is the main deterrent for sex workers who seek to report offending officers. At a Hawaiian Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, also in March 2014, an attorney testified that his client was raped three times by Hawaiian police before prostitution was cited as the reason for her subsequent arrest.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hawaii Police Won't Get to Have Sex With Prostitutes Anymore |url=http://time.com/38444/hawaii-police-prostitutes-sex/ |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 26, 2014 |last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405052452/http://time.com/38444/hawaii-police-prostitutes-sex/ |archive-date=April 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The prevalence of police brutality in the United States is not comprehensively documented, and the statistics on police brutality are much less available. The few statistics that exist include a 2006 Department of Justice report, which showed that out of 26,556 citizen complaints made in 2002 about excessive use of police force among large U.S. agencies (representing 5% of agencies and 59% of officers), about 2,000 were found to have merit.<ref>{{cite web | title = Citizen Complaints about Police Use of Force | url = http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ccpuf.htm | publisher = Bureau of Justice Statistics | last = Hickman | first = Matthew |date= 2006-06-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808080406/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ccpuf.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-08-08}}</ref>

Other studies have shown that most police brutality goes unreported. In 1982, the federal government funded a "Police Services Study," in which over 12,000 randomly selected citizens were interviewed in three metropolitan areas. The study found that 13.6 percent of those surveyed claimed to have had cause to complain about police service (including verbal abuse, discourtesy and physical abuse) in the previous year. Yet only 30 percent of those filed formal complaints.<ref>{{cite web | title = Fighting Police Abuse: A Community Action Manual | url = https://www.aclu.org/police/gen/14614pub19971201.html | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union | date = 1997-12-01 | accessdate = 2007-08-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091019064709/https://www.aclu.org/police/gen/14614pub19971201.html | archive-date = 2009-10-19 | url-status = live }}</ref> A 1998 [[Human Rights Watch]] report stated that in all 14 precincts it examined, the process of filing a complaint was "unnecessarily difficult and often intimidating."<ref>{{cite web | title = Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/uspo20.htm | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = June 1998 | accessdate = 2007-08-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818101143/http://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/uspo20.htm | archive-date = 2007-08-18 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Statistics on the use of physical force by law enforcement are available. For example, an extensive [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] report on police use of force released in 2001 indicated that in 1999, "approximately 422,000 people 16 years old and older were estimated to have had contact with police in which force or the threat of force was used."<ref>{{cite web | title = Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 1999 National Survey | url = http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/cpp99pr.htm | publisher = Bureau of Justice Statistics |date= 2001-03-21 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808130248/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/cpp99pr.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-08-08}}</ref> Research shows that measures of the presence of black and Hispanic people and majority/minority [[income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] are related positively to average annual civil rights criminal complaints.<ref>{{citation|volume=38|publisher=Criminology|pages=343|year=2000|title=Minority Threat and Police Brutality: Determinants of Civil Rights Criminal Complaints in U.S. Municipalities|author=Holmes, Malcolm D.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/crim38&section=21|access-date=2020-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427235018/http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals%2Fcrim38&section=21|archive-date=2014-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref>

Police brutality can be associated with [[racial profiling]]. Differences in [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[politics]], or [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic status]] often exist between police and the citizenry. Some police officers may view the population (or a particular subset thereof) as generally deserving of punishment. Portions of the population may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]]. In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, and the poor.<ref name="Powers 1995 56–60"/> According to a 2015 and 2016 project by ''The Guardian'', more white people are killed by police in raw numbers than black people are, but after adjusting this finding based on the fact that the black population is smaller than the white population, twice as many black people are killed by police [[per capita]] than white people are.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Counted: People killed by police in the US |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Young black men killed by US police at highest rate in year of 1,134 deaths|last1=Swaine|first1=John|last2=Laughland|first2=Oliver|last3=Lartey|first3=Jamiles|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ciara|date=December 31, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men#maincontent|access-date=June 5, 2020|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>{{Specify|reason=This stat based on mere population is inherently vague.

Race was suspected to play a role in the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in 2014. Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old African American who was shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The predominately black city erupted after the shooting. Riots following the shooting generated much debate about the treatment of African-Americans by law enforcement.

A 2006 Human Rights Watch report revealed that five state prison systems permit the use of aggressive, unmuzzled dogs on prisoners as part of cell removal procedures.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cruel and Degrading: The Use of Dogs for Cell Extractions in U.S. Prisons | url = http://hrw.org/reports/2006/us1006/ | publisher = Human Rights Watch | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-08-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707080131/http://hrw.org/reports/2006/us1006/ | archive-date = 2007-07-07 | url-status = live }}</ref>

In May 2020, the issue of police brutality saw a surge in public response following the [[killing of George Floyd]] in Minneapolis. [[George Floyd protests|Related protests]] occurred nationwide [[International George Floyd protests|and internationally]] beginning in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 26, 2020. In 2016, [[Dallas Police Department#Killing of Tony Timpa|Tony Timpa was killed]] in the same way in Dallas.

==Investigation==
In the United States, investigation of [[List of cases of police brutality|cases of police brutality]] has often been left to internal police commissions and/or [[district attorney]]s (DAs). Internal police commissions have often been criticized for a lack of accountability and for bias favoring officers, as they frequently declare upon review that the officer(s) acted within the department's rules, or according to their training. For instance, an April 2007 study of the [[Chicago Police Department]] found that out of more than 10,000 police abuse complaints filed between 2002 and 2003, only 19 (0.19%) resulted in meaningful disciplinary action. The study charges that the police department's oversight body allows officers with "criminal tendencies to operate with impunity," and argues that the [[Chicago Police Department]] should not be allowed to police itself.<ref>{{cite news | title = Study: Police abuse goes unpunished | url = http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=6125 | publisher = Medill School, Northwestern University, Alabama | last = Gallagher | first = Ryan | date = 2007-04-04 | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603175534/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=6125 | archive-date = 2008-06-03 }}</ref>

Investigations can be conducted by civilian complaint review board (CCRB), which act as an independent agency that can investigate, conduct hearings, and make recommendations in response to complaints of police brutality.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About - CCRB|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/about/about.page|access-date=2020-06-09|website=www1.nyc.gov}}</ref> However, only 19% of large municipal police forces have a CCRB, such as the [[Civilian Complaint Review Board]] (New York City), Civilian Office of Police Accountability (Chicago), Citizen Police Review Board (Pittsburgh), and Police Review Commission (Berkeley).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Police Oversight by Jurisdiction (USA)|url=https://www.nacole.org/police_oversight_by_jurisdiction_usa|access-date=2020-06-09|website=National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement}}</ref> Law enforcement jurisdictions that have a CCRB have an excessive force complaint rate against their officers of 11.9% verses 6.6% complaint rate for those without a CCRB. Of those forces without a CCRB, only 8% of the complaints were sustained.<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report |title=Citizen Complaints about Police Use of Force |url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/ccpuf.txt |accessdate=18 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812023457/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/ccpuf.txt |archive-date=August 12, 2007 }}</ref> Thus, for the year 2002, the rate at which police brutality complaints were sustained was 0.53% for the larger police municipalities nationwide.

The ability of district attorneys to investigate police brutality has also been called into question, as DAs depend on help from police departments to bring cases to trial. It was only in the 1990s that serious efforts began to transcend the difficulties of dealing with systemic patterns of police misconduct.

Beyond police departments and DAs, mechanisms of government oversight have gradually evolved. The [[Rodney King]] case triggered the creation of the [[Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department]], informally known as the [[Christopher Commission]], in 1991. The commission, mandated to investigate the practices of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], uncovered disturbing patterns of misconduct and abuse, but the reforms it recommended were put on hold. Meanwhile, media reports revealed a frustration in dealing with systemic abuse in other jurisdictions as well, such as New York and Pittsburgh. Selwyn Raab of the [[New York Times]] wrote about how the "[[Blue Code of Silence]] among police officers helped to conceal even the most outrageous examples of misconduct."<ref>{{cite news | title = The Dark Blue Code of Silence | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/08/home/15700.html | work = New York Times | last = Raab | first = Selwyn | date = 1993-05-02 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090410092716/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/08/home/15700.html | archive-date = 2009-04-10 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Within this climate, the police misconduct provision of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994 was created, which authorized the Attorney General to "file lawsuits seeking court orders to reform police departments engaging in a pattern or practice of violating citizens' federal rights."<ref>{{cite web | title = Conduct of Law Enforcement Agencies | url = http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/police.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice | author = Civil Rights Division | date = 2007-08-16 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807125555/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/police.htm | archive-date = 2007-08-07 }}</ref> As of January 31, 2003, the Department of Justice had used this provision to negotiate reforms in twelve jurisdictions across the U.S. ([[Pittsburgh Police|Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]], [[Steubenville]] Police Department, [[New Jersey State Police]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department]], [[Highland Park, Illinois]] Police Department, [[Cincinnati Police Department]], [[Columbus Division of Police|Columbus Police Department]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] Police Department, [[Mount Prospect, Illinois]] Police Department, [[Seattle]] Police Department, and the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] Police Department).<ref>{{cite web | title = Department of Justice Police Misconduct Pattern or Practice Program | url = http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/faq.htm#pppmp.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice | author = Civil Rights Division | date = 2003-01-01 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225062844/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/faq.htm#pppmp.htm | archive-date = 2007-12-25 | url-status = live }}</ref>

On 15 May 2020, the ''[[Amnesty International]]'' suggested that American authorities should avoid repressive measures that unduly restrict human rights in the name of “protecting” people from [[COVID-19]]. The videos verified by researchers and Amnesty's Crisis Evidence Lab claimed the use of detention as a first resort; excessive and unnecessary use of force in the enforcement of COVID-19 lockdowns; and the imposition of mandatory quarantines in inhumane conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/05/americas-authorities-must-protect-people-covid19-repressive-measures/|title=Americas: Authorities must protect people from COVID-19 instead of resorting to repressive measures|accessdate=15 May 2020|website=Amnesty International}}</ref>

On 22 June 2020, [[University of Chicago]] reported that the police departments in 20 largest American cities were failing to meet even the most basic international [[human rights]] standards governing the use of lethal force. The study revealed that America's biggest police forces lack legality, as they are not answerable to human rights compliant laws authorizing the use of lethal force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/us-police-human-rights-standards-report|title='State-sanctioned violence': US police fail to meet basic human rights standards|accessdate=22 June 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Causes==
Numerous doctrines, such as [[federalism]], [[separation of powers]], causation, deference, discretion, and [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] have been cited as partial explanations for the judiciaries' fragmented pursuit of police misconduct. However, there is also evidence that courts cannot or choose not to see systemic patterns in police brutality.<ref>{{citation|volume=47|publisher=Buff. L.

=== Legal protections ===
Police officers often still hold significant advantages in legal proceedings and in courts. Records of officer performance and misconduct are sometimes hidden from public view through laws, such as [[50-a]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] (repealed in 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-09|title=In a Historic Victory, NY Governor Cuomo Signs Repeal of 50-A Into Law|url=https://www.innocenceproject.org/in-a-historic-victory-the-new-york-legislature-repeals-50-a-requiring-full-disclosure-of-police-disciplinary-records/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Innocence Project|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wykstra|first=Stephanie|date=2020-06-16|title=The fight for transparency in police misconduct, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2020/6/16/21291595/new-york-section-50-a-police-misconduct|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref> The law of qualified immunity often shields police officers from prosecution, since it only permits lawsuits against government officials when they have violated a “clearly established” constitutional or statutory right.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Qualified immunity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity|access-date=2020-06-13|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en}}</ref> When cases of police are investigated for crimes, the collection of evidence is typically conducted by police officers, including [[Witness statement|witness statements]], and police may have been the only witnesses. [[Prosecutor|Prosecutors]] tend to have a close working relationship with police officers, which creates another conflict of interest, and they are often reluctant to aggressively pursue cases against law enforcement.<ref name=":7" /> Furthermore, courts tend to sympathize with police officers over civilians, who are often viewed as the "good party" in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-06|title=What Is Qualified Immunity, and What Does It Have to Do With Police Reform?|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-qualified-immunity-and-what-does-it-have-do-police-reform|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Lawfare|language=en}}</ref> In 2015, ''[[the Washington Post]]'' reported that, of the 54 officers who had been charged with fatally shooting someone while on duty in a decade period, 35 of the cases were resolved.

=== Blue wall of silence ===
{{Main|Blue wall of silence}}
Police departments in the United States typically follow an unofficial cultural code, known as the "blue wall of silence." This can also be referred to as the "curtain of silence", "cocoon of silence", "blue code", or "blue shield." According to this rule, police officers do not report misconduct or abuse committed by other officers, and they will not step in when their colleagues are engaging in illegal or abusive behavior. This is because police officers typically consider themselves as part of a larger "brotherhood" or family among other officers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dowd|first=Trone|date=2020-05-29|title=Police Chiefs Around the Country Are Breaking the Blue Wall of Silence for George Floyd|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/935yvp/police-chiefs-around-the-country-are-breaking-the-blue-wall-of-silence-for-george-floyd|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Vice|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Tom |last=Jackman |title=New Orleans police pioneer new way to stop misconduct, remove 'blue wall of silence'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/01/24/new-orleans-police-pioneer-new-way-stop-misconduct-remove-blue-wall-silence/|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Washington Post|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hayden|first=Philip|title=Why an ex-FBI agent decided to break through the blue wall of silence|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/01/31/blue-wall-of-silence-policing-the-usa-cops-community/2604929002/|access-date=2020-06-13|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=SKOLNICK|first=JEROME|title=Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence|date=September 2001|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15614260290011309|journal=Police Practice and Research|volume=3|pages=7–19|doi=10.1080/15614260290011309|s2cid=144512106|via=NYU School of Law}}</ref>

=== Racial profiling ===
{{Main|Racial profiling}}
Police brutality can be associated with [[racial profiling]]. Differences in [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[politics]], [[Disability|ability]], or [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic status]] sometimes exist between police and the citizenry.<ref name=":10" /> For example, in 2016, about 27% of sworn-in police officers were [[Person of color|people of color]].<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|last=Cobbina|first=Jennifer|title=Is hiring more black officers the key to reducing police violence?|url=http://theconversation.com/is-hiring-more-black-officers-the-key-to-reducing-police-violence-126075|access-date=2020-06-13|website=The Conversation|language=en}}</ref> The leadership of police department and police unions tend to be primarily white, as well.<ref name=":14">{{Cite news|last1=Hager|first1=Eli|last2=Project|first2=Weihua Li of the Marshall|date=2020-06-10|title=White US police union bosses protect officers accused of racism|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/police-unions-black-officers-white-leaders|access-date=2020-06-13|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Meanwhile, police officers often work in non-white communities.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last=Kight|first=Courtenay Brown,Stef W.|title=More black police officers, yet the killings persist|url=https://www.axios.com/police-diversity-george-floyd-5a712a37-9e43-4b24-985b-829abd76e56b.html|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Axios|language=en}}</ref> Portions of the population may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]].<ref name=":10">{{cite journal |last1=Donelson |first1=Raff |title=Blacks, Cops, and the State of Nature |journal=Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law |date=2017 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=183–192 |ssrn=2941467 }}</ref> In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as racial or cultural minorities, the disabled, and the poor.<ref name="Powers 1995 56–60">{{cite book | last = Powers | first = Mary D. | editor = Winters, Paul A. | title = Policing the Police | year = 1995 | publisher = Greenhaven Press | location = San Diego | isbn = 1-56510-262-2 | pages = 56–60 | chapter = Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality }}</ref>

Beginning in the 1960s, police departments began to offer cultural sensitivity and [[diversity training]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=192749|access-date=2020-06-13|website=www.ncjrs.gov|language=en}}</ref> However, these trainings are generally found to be ineffective and removed from the everyday reality of policing.<ref name=":7" />

Since the 1970s, police departments have increasingly hired more non-white officers, following a court order to diversify police departments.<ref name=":12" /> The percentage of non-white officers doubled (14% to 27%) between 1987 and 2016.<ref name=":11" /> However, according to studies, there is no evidence that non-white officers are less aggressive to non-white civilians.<ref name=":11" /> Furthermore, there is no correlation between non-white officers and lower rates of police brutality or community satisfaction with policing. For example, police forces in New York and Philadelphia have comparatively diverse police forces, but they have been criticized for their aggressive tactics and racial profiling. This is explained by the fact that police department priorities are set by politicians<ref name=":7" /> and the larger systematic issues of police culture and racism are still prevalent.<ref name=":11" />

=== Militarization of police ===
{{Main|Militarization of police}}
Police brutality is often linked to the "warrior mentality"  and militarization of police departments.<ref name=":7" /> Under this system, new recruits enter police academies, where they may be instructed in a manner similar to [[paramilitary]] training<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rosa|date=2020-06-10|title=Stop Training Police Like They're Joining the Military|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/police-academies-paramilitary/612859/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}</ref> or what is called a "warrior training." Some police academies even employ independent training companies, such as Close Quarters Battle, which has trained the [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy Seals]], and the [[special forces]] of other countries.<ref name=":7" /> These trainings focus on fear and defensive tactics, rather than community interaction and outreach. The recruits will focus on learning how to kill and aggressively manage crisis situations, as well as engaging in drill formations and standing at attention.<ref name=":8" /> Recruits will learn that any situation, including seemingly routine ones (such as traffic stops) can turn deadly, and they receive minimal training in how to manage complex social situations.<ref name=":7" /> As noted by [[Rosa Brooks]], "Many police recruits enter the academy as idealists, but this kind of training turns them into cynics."<ref name=":8" />

Once they are trained and working, police often think of crime as a war, in which they are "warriors," and some people are their enemies.<ref name="Above the Law">{{cite book|last1=Skolnick|first1=Jerome|last2=Fyfe|first2=James|title=Above the Law|url=https://archive.org/details/abovelawpoliceex00skol|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=":7" /> The police are provided with military equipment, such as [[tank]]s, and some work in militarized units, such as Special Weapons and Tactics ([[SWAT]]) teams. Their equipment partially comes from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], due to the [[Law Enforcement Support Office|1033 program]]. Established in 1990 by President George H. W.

=== Broken windows theory ===
{{Main|Broken windows theory}}
Since the 1980s, police departments have adopted the [[broken windows theory]], as advocated by criminologists like [[George L. Kelling]] and [[James Q. Wilson]]. This theory posits that signs of disorder or decay in neighborhoods (such as broken windows, [[graffiti]], [[loitering]], drug use, prostitution, etc.) create an impression that the area is neglected, thereby leading to further chaos and crime. Therefore, if police departments directly respond to smaller neighborhood issues, they can help prevent larger issues.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|last=Kelling|first=George|title=How A Theory Of Crime And Policing Was Born, And Went Terribly Wrong|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/01/500104506/broken-windows-policing-and-the-origins-of-stop-and-frisk-and-how-it-went-wrong|access-date=2020-06-12|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilson|first=George L.

Meanwhile, the problems associated with poor living standards were blamed on civilians, rather than political or economic forces. Consequently, police were given the ability to increase arrests, aggressive policing, and harassment of civilians, which further contributed to police brutality and racial profiling.<ref name=":7" />

=== Threat hypothesis ===
Academic theories such as the threat hypothesis and the community violence hypothesis have been used to explain police brutality. The threat hypothesis implies that "police use force in direct response to a perceived threat from racial and/or economic groups viewed as threatening to the existing social order."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Police Officer Diversity on Police-Caused Homicides|last = Smith|first = Brad W.|date = 2003|journal = The Policy Studies Journal|volume = 31|issue = 2|pages = 147–162|doi = 10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009|id = {{ProQuest|210572644}}}}</ref> According to the community violence hypothesis, "police use force in direct response to levels of violence in the community."<ref name=":0" /> This theory explains that force is used to control groups that threaten the community or police themselves with violence.

== Solutions ==

=== Body cameras ===
{{Main|Body worn video (police equipment)}}

According to a survey done by Vocativ in 2014, "41 cities use body cams on some of their officers, 25 have plans to implement body cams and 30 cities do not use or plan to use cams at this time."<ref name=":1" /> There are other issues that can occur from the use of body cameras as well. This includes downloading and maintenance of the data which can be expensive. There is also some worry that if video testimony becomes more relied upon in court cases, not having video evidence from body cameras would decrease the likelihood that the court system believes credible testimony from police officers and witnesses<ref name="Effects of Body Worn Cameras" />

=== Civilian review boards ===
{{Main|Civilian police oversight agency}}
Civilian review boards have been proposed as another solution to decreasing police brutality. Benefits of civilian review boards can include making sure police are doing their jobs and increasing the relationship the police have with the public.<ref name="Civilian Oversight">{{cite web|title=Is Civilian Oversight the Answer to Distrust of Police?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-civilian-oversight-the-answer-to-distrust-of-police/|website=FRONTLINE|accessdate=6 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307204318/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-civilian-oversight-the-answer-to-distrust-of-police/|archive-date=7 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Civilian review boards have gotten criticism though. They can be staffed with police who can weaken the effectiveness of the boards. Some boards do not have the authority to order investigations into police departments. They can also lack the funding to be an effective tool.<ref name="Civilian Oversight" />

=== Lawsuits and qualified immunity ===
{{See also|Qualified immunity}}
Excessive use of force is a [[tort]], and police officers may be held liable for damages should they take unconstitutional actions.<ref>42 USC section 1983</ref> The ability to sue in federal court was first introduced as a remedy for police brutality and misconduct in 1871 during the [[Reconstruction era]] as the [[Third Enforcement Act]]. The act allowed plaintiffs to sue directly in federal courts which was important as it allowed plaintiffs to bypass state courts during the Jim Crow era. The theory behind this solution to police brutality is that by taking the civil action to a federal court level, the case will be heard fairly and the financial judgments are intended to have a deterrent effect on future police misconduct in that department.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klan|first=Sina|date=June 3, 2020|title=Supreme Court's key choice on police wrongdoing|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/opinions/supreme-courts-key-choice-on-police-wrongdoing-kian/index.html|website=CNN}}</ref>

Since 1967, this remedy has been restricted by Supreme Court precedents through [[qualified immunity]] which grants police officers immunity from lawsuits unless their actions violated "clearly established" law.<ref>{{cite newspaper|author=New York Times Editorial Board|date=May 29, 2020|title=How the Supreme Court Lets Cops Get Away With Murder|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/Minneapolis-police-George-Floyd.html}}</ref> In practice, most jurisdictions rely on court precedent to define clearly established law, so to be successful plaintiffs often must show that a previous court case found the particular act at hand unlawful.<ref name="Tyler2019">{{cite journal|last=Finn|first=Tyler|year=2019|title=Qualified Immunity Formalism: "Clearly established law" and the right to record police activity|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=119|issue=2|jstor=26651845}}</ref>{{rp|45-4}} For example, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted immunity to an officer who shot a 14-year-old who dropped a BB gun as he raised his hands, because unlike a 2011 case where an officer was held liable for shooting a man who lowered a shotgun, the boy had pulled the BB gun from his waistband.<ref name="ReutersQI" /><ref>{{cite court |litigants=Nelson v.

==Legal and institutional controls==
Responsibility for investigating [[Police misconduct#United States|police misconduct in the United States]] has mainly fallen on local and state governments. The federal government does investigate misconduct but only does so when local and state governments fail to look into cases of misconduct.<ref name="Cooperative Federalism" />

Laws intended to protect against police abuse of authority include the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[searches and seizures]]; the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which protects individuals against [[self-incrimination]] and being deprived of life, liberty, or property without [[due process]]; the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which bans [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which includes the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]]s; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]]; and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]]. The Civil Rights Act has evolved into a key U.S. law in brutality cases.

In 1978, surveys of police officers found that police brutality, along with sleeping on duty, was viewed as one of the most common and least likely to be reported forms of police deviance other than [[Police corruption|corruption]].<ref>{{citation|title=An empirical study of police deviance other than corruption|last=Barker|first=T|publisher=Journal of Police Science and Administration|year=1978|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=50834}}</ref>

In ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment prevents police from [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|using deadly force]] on a fleeing suspect unless the police has good reason to believe that the suspect is a danger to others.<ref name="Tennessee v.Garner">{{cite web|title=Tennessee v.

The Supreme Court in ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) stated that the reasonableness of a police officer using force should be based on what the officer's viewpoint was when the crime occurred. Reasonableness should also factor in things like the suspect's threat level and if attempts were made to avoid being arrested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Graham v.

In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court introduced the legal doctrine of [[qualified immunity]], originally with the rationale of protecting law enforcement officials from frivolous lawsuits and financial liability in cases where they acted in good faith in an unclear legal situation.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|title=How Qualified ImmunityFails|url=https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/Schwartz_1ki1sac4.pdf|author=Schwartz, Joanna C.|date=2017|work=The Yale Law Journal|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=June 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":13"/> Starting in around 2005, courts increasingly applied this doctrine to cases involving use of excessive force, eventually leading to widespread criticism that it "has become a nearly failsafe tool to let police brutality go unpunished and deny victims their constitutional rights" (as summarized in a 2020 Reuters report).<ref name=":13" />
