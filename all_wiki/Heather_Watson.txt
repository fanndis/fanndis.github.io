Watson defeated [[CoCo Vandeweghe]], [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], [[Christina Mchale]] and [[Wang Xiyu]] to reach the final, where she faced Canadian qualifier [[Leylah Annie Fernandez]]. Watson won in three sets, clinching the match on her tenth championship point.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thebigracket.co.uk/2020/03/01/mexican-magic-heather-watson-breaks-top-50-with-acapulco-title/|title=Mexican Magic: Heather Watson breaks top 50 with Acapulco title
|date=2020-03-01|work=The Big Racket|access-date=2020-03-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The win propelled Watson back into the world’s top 50 (no. 49) for the first time since 2016.

Watson participated in the [https://www.lta.org.uk/major-tennis-events/british-major-events/battle-of-the-brits/ Battle of the Brits Team Tennis] event, held in London in late July, notching up a number of wins in singles and teaming up with [[Jamie Murray]] in mixed doubles.

When the WTA Tour resumed following the COVID-19 pause, Watson entered two hardcourt events leading up to the US Open, losing in the first round at both the [[Top Seed Open]] and [[Cincinnati Open]], before going on to lose in the first round at Flushing Meadows to British No. 1 and world No. 13, [[Johanna Konta]]. The tour’s move onto the European red clay courts brought two further opening round losses, including at the rescheduled [[French Open]] to world No. 49, [[Fiona Ferro]]. By 19 October, Watson’s ranking had slipped back to No. 60. 

==Playing style==
Watson is right-handed and plays with a two-handed [[backhand]]. Her game is often likened to that of [[Martina Hingis]] and she has been praised by [[Nick Bollettieri]] for her "amazing footwork".<ref>{{cite news|title=Watson into first round of AEGON International  – The National|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/watson-into-first-round-of-aegon-international/|work=The National|date=15 June 2010}}</ref> Her on-court intelligence, court sense and timing have been other talking points about her game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onthebaseline.com/2010/01/02/one-to-watch-heather-watson/ |title=One To Watch: Heather Watson – On the Baseline Tennis News |publisher=Onthebaseline.com |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> According to Nigel Sears, head of women's coaching at the [[Lawn Tennis Association]], Watson possesses "a complete game",<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/usopen/6188408/US-Open-2009-Heather-Watson-and-Laura-Robson-lead-new-era-of-Britistalent.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=US Open 2009: Heather Watson and Laura Robson lead new era of British talent | first=Andrew | last=Baker | date=14 September 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> with variety including a consistent one-handed [[backhand]] slice, volleys and angles. Her game has been described as similar to [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] player [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] due to her "big serve" and athleticism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/8536974/Brian-Moore-Heather-Watson-a-minority-figure-in-an-exclusive-British-club.html|title=Brian Moore: Heather Watson a minority figure in an exclusive British club |newspaper=Telegraph|date=26 May 2011}}</ref>

Upon Watson reaching the [[2011 French Open]] second round, [[Andy Murray]] commented "When I saw her for the first time, I thought she was good. I like the way she moves on the court. She's very balanced".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/events-tournaments/french-open-2011/top-stories/Happy-Murray-salutes-teen-compatriot-Watson/articleshow/8557667.cms|title='Happy' Murray salutes teen compatriot Watson |work=Times of India |date=25 May 2011|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> Bollettieri stated that Watson's "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/nick-bollettieri-take-it-from-me-feisty-watson-has-what-it-takes-2288486.html|title=Nick Bollettieri: Take it from me, feisty Watson has what it takes |work=The Independent |date=25 May 2011|accessdate=25 May 2011|location=London}}</ref>
