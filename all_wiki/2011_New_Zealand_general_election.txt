The '''2011 New Zealand general election''' on Saturday 26 November 2011<ref name="nzhdate">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10703639 |title= Key confirms election date |work= The New Zealand Herald|date= 2 February 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref> determined the membership of the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]].

One hundred and twenty-one MPs were elected to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]], 70 from single-member [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], and 51 from party lists including one [[overhang seat]]. New Zealand since 1996 has used the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) voting system, giving voters two votes: one for a political party and the other for their local electorate MP. A [[2011 New Zealand voting system referendum|referendum on the voting system]] was held at the same time as the election,<ref name="nzh_date">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10604317|title=MMP referendum to be held with 2011 election|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=20 October 2009}}</ref> with voters voting by majority to keep the MMP system.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/referendum.html |title= Overall Results - 2011 Referendum on the Voting System |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 10 December 2011 |accessdate= 10 December 2011}}</ref>

A total of 3,070,847 people were registered to vote in the election, with over 2.2 million votes cast and a [[voter turnout|turnout]] of 74.21%<ref name="electorate">{{cite web |url= http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/e9/html/e9_part9_1.html |title= Party Votes and Turnout by Electorate -- Statistics -- 2011 General Election |publisher=Electoral Commission (New Zealand) |accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> – the lowest turnout since 1887.<ref>[[Otago Daily Times]] "Decision 2011":Election Special Issue, 28 November 2011, p. 2.</ref> The incumbent [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by [[John Key]], gained the plurality with 47.3% of the party vote and 59 seats, two seats short of holding a majority. The opposing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], led by [[Phil Goff]], lost ground winning 27.5% of the vote and 34 seats, while the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] won 11.1% of the vote and 14 seats – the biggest share of the party vote for a minor party since 1996. [[New Zealand First]], having won no seats in 2008 due to its failure to either reach the 5% threshold or win an electorate, made a comeback with 6.6% of the vote entitling them to eight seats.

National's confidence and supply partners in the 49th Parliament meanwhile suffered losses. [[ACT New Zealand]] won less than a third of the party vote it received in 2008, reducing from five seats to one. The [[Māori Party]] was reduced from five seats to three, as the party vote split between the Māori Party and former Māori Party MP [[Hone Harawira]]'s [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana Party]]. [[United Future]] lost party votes, but retained their one seat in Parliament.

Following the election, National reentered into [[confidence and supply]] agreements with ACT and United Future on 5 December 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/dunne-banks-secure-ministerial-roles-in-coalition-deals-4589569 |title= Dunne, Banks secure ministerial roles in coalition deals |publisher=Television New Zealand |date= 5 December 2011 |accessdate= 5 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10771067 |title= Dunne, Banks get Govt roles |work= The New Zealand Herald|date= 5 December 2011 |accessdate= 5 December 2011}}</ref> and with the Māori Party on 11 December 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/key-finalises-maori-coalition-deal-4626361 |title= Key finalises Maori coalition deal |publisher=Television New Zealand |date= 11 December 2011 |accessdate= 11 December 2011}}</ref> to form a [[minority government]] with a seven-seat majority (64 seats to 57) and give the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] a second term in office.

==Background==

===Election date and other key dates===
The election date was set as Saturday 26 November 2011, as predicted by the media.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10697628 |title= Challenges ahead but first, a break |work= The New Zealand Herald|last1= Armstrong |first1= John |last2= Young |first2= Audrey |date= 3 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> Breaking with tradition, Prime Minister John Key announced the election date in February. Traditionally, the election date is a closely guarded secret, announced as late as possible. The date follows the tradition of holding the general election on the last Saturday of November unless the schedule is interrupted by a snap election or to circumvent holding a by-election.

The [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] must issue [[writ of election|writs]] for an election within seven days of the expiration or dissolution of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309425.html#DLM309425 |title=Electoral Act 1993, Sec. 125 |publisher=Legislation.co.nz |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000658/http://www.legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309425.html#DLM309425 |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Under section 17 of the [[Constitution Act 1986]], Parliament expires three years "from the day fixed for the return of the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer." The writs for the previous general election were returnable on 27 November 2008.<ref name="www.elections.org.nz/voting/key-dates">{{cite web |author=CEO |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voting/key-dates.html |title=2008 General Election Timetable |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2017-09-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604123736/http://www.elections.org.nz/voting/key-dates.html |archivedate=4 June 2010}}</ref> As a result, the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament]] would have expired, if not dissolved earlier, on 27 November 2011. As that day was a Sunday, the last available working day was 25 November 2011. Consequently, the last day for issuance of writs of election was 2 December 2011. Except in some circumstances (such a recount or the death/incapacitation of an electorate candidate), the writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance with the last possible working day being 20 January 2012.<ref name="sec139">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html#DLM309482 |title=Electoral Act 1993, Sec. 139 |publisher=Legislation.co.nz |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114123024/http://www.legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html#DLM309482 |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Because polling day must be a Saturday,<ref name="sec139"/> the last possible polling date for the election was 7 January 2012, allowing time for the counting of special votes.<ref name="last_date">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/system-of-government.html|title=New Zealand's system of government - an overview|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|The New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514042908/http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/system-of-government.html|archivedate=14 May 2010}}</ref> The Christmas/New Year holiday period made the last realistic date for the election Saturday 10 December 2011. The [[Rugby World Cup 2011]] was hosted by New Zealand between 9 September and 23 October 2011, and ruled out all the possible election dates in this period. This left two possible windows for the general election: on or before 2 September and 29 October to 10 December.

However, as the recount of the [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] was not completed in time for the writ to be returned on 15 December, the return of the writ was delayed to 17 December 2011.

===49th Parliament, 2008–2011===
Following the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] leader and Prime Minister [[John Key]] announced a confidence and supply agreement with [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], the [[Māori Party]] and [[United Future]] to form the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]]. These arrangements gave the National-led government a majority of 16 seats, with 69 on confidence-and-supply in the 122-seat Parliament.

[[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] and the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]] are all in opposition, although only the Labour and Progressive parties formally constitute the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|formal Opposition]]; the Greens have a minor agreement with the government but are not committed to ''[[confidence and supply]]'' support.

At the 2008 election, the National Party had 58 seats, the Labour Party 43 seats, Green Party 9 seats, ACT and Māori Party five each, and Progressive and United Future one each. During the Parliament session, two members defected from their parties – [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] was expelled from Labour in August 2010, and [[Hone Harawira]] left the Māori Party in February 2011. Carter continued as an [[Independent politician|independent]], while Harawira resigned from parliament to recontest his [[Te Tai Tokerau]] electorate in [[2011 Te Tai Tokerau by-election|a by-election]] under his newly formed [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana Party]]. Two MPs resigned from Parliament before the end of the session, [[John Carter (New Zealand politician)|John Carter]] of National and Chris Carter, but as they resigned within 6 months of an election, their seats remained vacant.

At the dissolution of the 49th parliament on 20 October 2011, National held 57 seats, Labour 42 seats, Green 9 seats, ACT 5 seats, Māori 4 seats, and Progressive, United Future and Mana one each.

===Marginal seats in 2008===
At the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]], the following seats were won by a majority of less than 1000 votes:

===MPs retiring in 2011===
Nineteen MPs, including all five ACT MPs and the sole Progressive MP, intended to retire at the end of the 49th Parliament. One of the ACT MPs, John Boscawen, contested [[Tāmaki (New Zealand electorate)|Tāmaki]], but did not expect to win and was not on the party list. National MP Allan Peachey died three weeks before the election.

===Electorate boundaries===
[[File:Christchurch polling place 01.jpg|thumb|Advance voting in campervans in Christchurch. Campervans were used as many of the polling stations used at previous elections are unavailable due to the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011]] earthquakes.]]
[[New Zealand electorates|Electorates]] in the election were the same as at the 2008 election.

Electorates and their boundaries in New Zealand are reviewed every five years after the [[New Zealand census]]. The last review took place in 2007, following the [[2006 New Zealand census|2006 census]]. The next review is not due until 2014, following the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]] (the 2011 census was cancelled due to the 22 February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]).

===Election procedures===
On 17 September 2010, Justice Minister [[Simon Power]] announced the government was introducing legislation making this the first election where voters would be able to re-enrol completely on-line. Enrolments on-line beforehand still required the election form to be printed, signed, and sent by post.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government to allow voters to enrol via Internet|url= http://beehive.govt.nz/release/government+allow+voters+enrol+internet |publisher=New Zealand Government|date=17 September 2010}}</ref>

Voters in the [[Christchurch]] region were encouraged to cast their votes before election day if they had doubt about being able to get to a polling booth on election day or to avoid long queues, as many traditional polling booths are unavailable due to the earthquakes. Nineteen advance voting stations were made available, with three of them campervans, which are usually only used in rural areas of New Zealand. The [[Christchurch Central]] electorate, for example, has 33 polling stations in 2011 compared to 45 in 2008.<ref name="Camper vans">{{cite news|last=Gamble|first=Warren|title=Campervans collect early votes in Christchurch|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/campaign-trail/5989769/Campervans-collect-early-votes-in-Christchurch|accessdate=26 November 2011|work=[[The Press]]|date=18 November 2011}}</ref>

==Contesting parties and candidates==
{{Main|Candidates in the New Zealand general election 2011 by electorate|Party lists in the 2011 New Zealand general election}}

At the close of nominations, 544 individuals had been nominated to contest the election, down from 682 at the 2008 election. Of those, 91 were list-only, 73 were electorate-only (43 from registered parties, 17 independents, and 13 from non-registered parties), and 380 contested both list and electorate.<ref name="candidates-locked">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10763396 |title= Candidates locked in for election |work= The New Zealand Herald|date= 2 November 2011 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref>

Political parties registered with the Electoral Commission on Writ Day can contest the general election as a party, allowing it to submit a party list to contend the party vote, and have a party election expenses limit in addition to individual candidate limits. At Writ Day, sixteen political parties were registered to contend the general election.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/registers/registered-political-parties.html |title= Registered political parties - overview & register |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 7 October 2011 |accessdate= 23 October 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111110025930/http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/registers/registered-political-parties.html |archivedate= 10 November 2011}}</ref> At the close of nominations, thirteen registered parties had put forward a party list to the commission to contest the party vote, down from nineteen in 2008.<ref name="candidates-locked"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/candidates-and-parties/party-lists.html |title= Party lists for the 2011 General Election |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 2 November 2011 |accessdate= 2 November 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111110033910/http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/candidates-and-parties/party-lists.html |archivedate= 10 November 2011}}</ref>

In addition to the registered parties and their candidates, thirteen candidates from nine non-registered parties contested electorates. The [[Human Rights Party (New Zealand)|Human Rights Party]] contested Auckland Central, the [[Communist League (New Zealand)|Communist League]] Manukau East and Mount Roskill, the [[Nga Iwi Morehu Movement]] contested Hauraki-Waikato and Te Tai Hauauru, the [[Pirate Party of New Zealand|Pirate Party]] contested Hamilton East and Wellington Central, the [[New Zealand Sovereignty Party|Sovereignty Party]] contested Clutha-Southland and Te Tai Hauauru, Economic Euthenics contested Wigram, [[New Economics Party|New Economics]] contested Wellington Central, [[Restore All Things In Christ]] contested Dunedin South, and the [[Aotearoa NZ Youth Party|Youth Party]] contested West Coast-Tasman.

Seventeen [[Independent politician|independent]] candidates also contested the electorates in thirteen electorates: Christchurch Central, Coromandel, Epsom (two), Hamilton West (two), New Plymouth, Ōtaki, Rangitikei (two), Rongotai, Tāmaki (two), Tauranga, Waitaki, Wellington Central, and Ikaroa-Rawhiti

==Campaigning==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}

===Epsom and the Tea Tape scandal===
{{main|Tea Tape scandal}}
On 11 November, National Party leader John Key met with [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]], the ACT candidate for [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]], over a cup of tea at a cafe in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] to send a signal to Epsom voters about voting tactically.<ref>{{cite web |last= McMahon |first= Lyle |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5948536/PM-and-Banks-have-their-Epsom-cup-of-tea |title= PM and Banks have their Epsom cup of tea |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= 11 November 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> The National Party passively campaigned for Epsom voters to give their electorate vote to ACT while giving their party vote to National. This would allow ACT to bypass the 5% party vote threshold and enter Parliament by winning an electorate seat, thereby providing a coalition partner for National. However, in October and November 2011, [[Opinion polling for the 2011 New Zealand general election#Epsom electorate vote|polls of the Epsom electorate vote]] taken by various companies showed that the National candidate for Epsom, Paul Goldsmith,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.national.org.nz/Candidate.aspx?Id=13160 |title= Paul Goldsmith - Candidate profile |publisher=New Zealand National Party |accessdate= 20 November 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> was leading in the polls and likely to win the seat. During the meeting, the two politicians' discussion was recorded by a device left on the table in a black pouch. The recording tapes were leaked to ''[[The Herald on Sunday]]'' newspaper, and subsequently created a media frenzy over the content of the unreleased tapes.<ref name="3 News">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-may-face-more-teapot-tape-accusations/tabid/419/articleID/232874/Default.aspx |title=Key may face more teapot tape accusations |author=Wilson, Peter |date=16 November 2011 |work=[[3 News]] |location=New Zealand |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201110834/http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-may-face-more-teapot-tape-accusations/tabid/419/articleID/232874/Default.aspx |archive-date=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Labour Party leader [[Phil Goff]] ruled out a coalition agreement with Hone Harawira's new [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana Party]], but left open the possibility of reaching an agreement with New Zealand First.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goff rules out deal with Hone Harawira|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/4767365/Goff-rules-out-deal-with-Hone-Harawira|date=14 March 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref>

In the 16 November minor parties debate, leaders from the minor parties stated their preferences:<ref name="TVNZ-multi-debate" />
* The Green's preference was it would work in a coalition government with Labour, but wouldn't completely rule out working with National.
* Mana would not work in a coalition government with National and/or ACT
* Māori would not work in a coalition government with ACT.
* No preference was stated for New Zealand First, but later said it would not work with National or Labour.
* United Future ruled out working with Labour

===Media bias===
A Massey University study released in November 2012 suggested newspaper coverage was favourable towards National and John Key. In the month leading up to the election, the big four newspapers in New Zealand – ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', ''The Herald on Sunday'', ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]'' – printed 72 percent more photos of Key than his opponent, Phil Goff, and devoted twice as many column inches of text coverage.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Election-coverage-biased-towards-Key-National---study/tabid/1607/articleID/278232/Default.aspx | work= 3 News NZ | title= Election coverage biased towards Key, National - study | date= 27 November 2012 | access-date= 26 November 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130222133625/http://www.3news.co.nz/Election-coverage-biased-towards-Key-National---study/tabid/1607/articleID/278232/Default.aspx | archive-date= 22 February 2013 | url-status= dead }}</ref>

==Opinion polling==
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2011 New Zealand general election}}
[[File:NZ opinion polls 2009-2011 -parties.png|thumb|350px|Graphical representation of poll results]]

The nature of the Mixed Member Proportional voting system, whereby the share of seats in Parliament a party gets is determined by its share of the nationwide party vote, means aside from normal polling bias and error, opinion polling in New Zealand is fairly accurate in predicting the outcome of an election compared with other countries.

Opinion polls were undertaken periodically since the 2008 election by [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] ([[3 News]] Reid Research), [[The New Zealand Herald]] (Herald Digipoll), [[Roy Morgan Research]], and [[Television New Zealand]] (''[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]'' [[Colmar Brunton]]), with polls having also being conducted by [[Fairfax Media]] (Fairfax Media Research International) since July 2011. The graph on the right shows the collated results of all five polls for parties that have polled above the 5% electoral threshold.

After the 2008 election, National gained in popularity, and since 2009 has regularly polled in the 50-55% range, peaking at 55% in August 2009 and October 2011, before falling to 51% in the week before the election. Labour and Green meanwhile kept steady after the election at 31-34% and 7-8% respectively until July 2011, when Labour started to lose support, falling to just 26% before the election. The majority of Labour's loss was the Green's gain, rising to 13% in the same period. No other party peaked on average above 5% in the period.

Prior to the election, the National Party held the majority of the electorate seats with 41. Labour held 20 seats, Māori held four seats, and ACT, Mana, Progressive, United Future and an ex-Labour independent held one seat each.

After the election, National gained one seat to hold 42 seats, Labour gained three seats to hold 23 electorates, Māori lost one seat to hold three, and ACT, Mana, and United Future held steady with one seat each.<ref name="electorate-status">{{cite web |url= http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/electoratestatus.html |title= Official Count Results -- Electorate Status |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 10 December 2011 |accessdate= 10 December 2011}}</ref> A National or Labour candidate took second place in all the general electorates except [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]], where it was Conservative Party leader [[Colin Craig]].<ref>{{cite news |title=10 things you didn't know about the election results |first=Audrey |last=Young |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/election-2011/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503012&objectid=10769537 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

In eleven electorates, the incumbents did not seek re-election, and new MPs were elected. In [[Coromandel (New Zealand electorate)|Coromandel]], [[North Shore (New Zealand electorate)|North Shore]], [[Northland (New Zealand electorate)|Northland]], [[Rangitīkei (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitikei]], Rodney and [[Tāmaki (New Zealand electorate)|Tāmaki]], the seats were passed from incumbent National MPs to new National MPs; in [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]], the seat was passed from the incumbent ACT MP to the new ACT MP; and in [[Dunedin North (New Zealand electorate)|Dunedin North]] and [[Manurewa (New Zealand electorate)|Manurewa]], the seats were passed from incumbent Labour MPs to new Labour MPs. Labour also won [[Te Atatū (New Zealand electorate)|Te Atatū]] from the retiring ex-Labour independent, and [[Wigram (New Zealand electorate)|Wigram]] from the retiring Progressive MP.

Of the 59 seats where the incumbent sought re-election, four changed hands. In [[West Coast-Tasman]], Labour's Damien O'Connor regained the seat from National's Chris Auchinvole, who defeated him for the seat in 2008. In [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]], National's Kate Wilkinson defeated Labour MP Clayton Cosgrove, and in [[Te Tai Tonga]], Labour's Rino Tirikatene defeated Maori Party MP Rahui Katene. [[Christchurch Central]] on election night ended with incumbent Labour MP [[Brendon Burns (politician)|Brendon Burns]] and National's [[Nicky Wagner]] [[tie (draw)|tied]] on 10,493 votes each, and on official counts, swung to Nicky Wagner with a 45-vote majority, increasing to 47 votes on a [[judicial recount]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/study/news/christchurch-central-judicial-recount-official-results.html |title= Christchurch Central Judicial Recount Official Results |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 14 December 2011 |accessdate= 16 December 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120209195846/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/news/christchurch-central-judicial-recount-official-results.html |archivedate= 9 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6137499/Recount-confirms-Christchurch-central-seat |accessdate= 14 December 2011 |title= Recount confirms Christchurch Central seat |first= Kate |last= Chapman |date= 14 December 2011 |publisher=Fairfax Media (via Stuff.co.nz)}}</ref> Despite losing their electorate seats, Chris Auchinvole and Clayton Cosgrove were re-elected into parliament via the party list.

===Election expenses===

The Electoral Commission released party electoral expense returns on 21 March 2012, stating how much each party spent on campaigning between 26 August and 25 November 2011. Candidate only expenses were excluded.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/rules/parties/party-expenses-returns/party-expense-returns.html |title= Party expense returns - Election '11 |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 21 March 2012 |accessdate= 24 March 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120604053452/http://www.elections.org.nz/rules/parties/party-expenses-returns/party-expense-returns.html |archivedate= 4 June 2012}}</ref>

Of note in the party expenses was the $1.88 million spent by the Conservative Party, spending more than but gaining less than one-tenth of the votes of the Labour Party. Translated into dollars spent per party vote gained, the Conservatives spent $31.71 per vote, compared to Labour's $2.91 and National's $2.19.
