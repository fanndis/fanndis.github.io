One billion can also be written as '''b''' or '''bn'''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |date=2015 |publisher=[[The Economist]] |edition=11th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enIZBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT70 |chapter=figures}}</ref><ref name="EUStyleGuide">{{cite book |chapter=6.5 Abbreviating ‘million’ and ‘billion’ |title=English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf |edition=8th |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=3 November 2017 |page=32}}</ref>

In [[scientific notation]], it is written as '''1 × 10<sup>9</sup>'''. The [[metric prefix]] [[giga]] indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit. Its symbol is '''[[Giga-|G]]'''.

One billion years may be called an ''[[aeon|eon]]'' in astronomy or geology.

Previously in [[British English]] (but not in [[Comparison of American and British English#Numbers|American English]]), the word "billion" referred exclusively to a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). However, this is no longer common, and the word has been used to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000) for several decades.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-is-a-billion |title=How many is a billion? |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref>

The term '''''milliard''''' can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; whereas "milliard" is rarely used in English,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=billion%2Cthousand+million%2Cmilliard&year_start=1808&year_end=2008&corpus=18&smoothing=3 |title=billion,thousand million,milliard |website=[[Google Ngram Viewer]] |access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref> variations on this name often appear in [[:wikt:milliard#Translations|other languages]].

In the [[South Asian numbering system]], it is known as 100 [[crore]] or 1 [[South Asian numbering system|arab]].

==Sense of scale==
The facts below give a sense of how large 1,000,000,000 (10<sup>9</sup>) is in the context of time according to current scientific evidence:

===Time===
* 10<sup>9</sup> seconds (1 gigasecond) equal 11,574 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes and 40 seconds (approximately 31.7 years, or 31 years, 8 months, 8 days).<!--
A Gregorian calendar mean year is 365.2425 days; a gigasecond is 31 mean years plus ~251.56 days. Assuming an average month length of 30 5/12 days, this is 31 mean years, 8 months, and ~8.22 days. Using a less precise Julian year or a more precise average month changes this value by less than a day; because of the ambiguity, do not add a more precise value to the article text here. -->
* About 10<sup>9</sup> minutes ago, the [[Roman Empire]] was flourishing and Christianity was emerging. (10<sup>9</sup> minutes is roughly 1,901 years.)
* About 10<sup>9</sup> hours ago, modern human beings and their ancestors were living in the [[Stone Age]] (more precisely, the [[Middle Paleolithic]]). (10<sup>9</sup> hours is roughly 114,080 years.)
* About 10<sup>9</sup> days ago, ''[[Australopithecus]]'', an ape-like creature related to an ancestor of modern humans, roamed the African [[savanna]]s. (10<sup>9</sup> days is roughly {{Nowrap|2.738 million}} years.)
* About 10<sup>9</sup> months ago, [[dinosaur]]s walked the Earth during the late [[Cretaceous]]. (10<sup>9</sup> months is roughly {{Nowrap|83.3 million}} years.)
* About 10<sup>9</sup> years&mdash;a [[gigaannus]]&mdash;ago, the first [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[eukaryote]]s appeared on Earth.
* About 10<sup>9</sup> decades ago, [[galaxies]] began to appear in the early [[Universe]] which was then 3.799 billion years old. (10<sup>9</sup> decades is exactly {{Nowrap|10 billion}} years.)
* The [[universe]] is thought to be about [[Age of the universe|13.8 × 10<sup>9</sup> years old.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cosmic_detectives |title=Cosmic Detectives |date=2 April 2013 |website=[[European Space Agency]]}}</ref>

===Distance===
* 10<sup>9</sup> inches is {{convert|15783|mi|km}}, more than halfway around the world and thus sufficient to reach any point on the globe from any other point.
* 10<sup>9</sup> [[metre]]s (called a [[gigametre]]) is almost three times the distance from the [[Earth]] to the [[Moon]].
* 10<sup>9</sup> [[kilometre]]s (called a [[terametre]]) is over six times the distance from the Earth to the [[Sun]].

===Area===
* A billion square inches would be a square about one half mile on a side.
* A bolt of finely woven [[Thread count|1000-TC]] bed sheet linen with a billion thread crossings would have an area of {{convert|40|m2|sqyd}}, comparable to the floor area of a motel unit.

===Volume===
* There are a billion cubic [[millimetres]] in a [[cubic metre]], and a billion cubic metres in a [[cubic kilometre]].
* A billion grains of table salt or granulated sugar would occupy a volume of about {{convert|2.5|cuft}}.
* A billion [[cubic inch]]es would be a volume comparable to a large commercial building slightly larger than a typical supermarket.

===Weight===
* Any object that weighs {{convert|1000000000|kg|lbs|spell=in}} would weigh about as much as 5,525 empty [[Boeing 747-400]]s.
* A cube of iron that weighs {{convert|1000000000|lbs|kg|spell=in}} would be {{convert|38.62|m|ft}} on each side.

===Products===
* As of July 2016, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has sold one billion [[iPhone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/apple-announces-it-has-sold-one-billion-iphones-n618171 |title=Apple Announces It Has Sold One Billion iPhones |last=Panken |first=Eli |date=27 July 2016 |website=[[NBCNews.com]] |access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref> This makes the iPhone one of the most successful product lines in history, surpassing the [[PlayStation]] and the [[Rubik's Cube]].
* As of July 2016, [[Facebook]] has 1.71 billion users.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-posts-strong-profit-and-revenue-growth-1469650289 |title=Facebook Posts Strong Profit and Revenue Growth |last=Seethamaram |first=Deep |date=27 July 2016 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref>

===Nature===
* A small mountain, slightly larger than [[Stone Mountain]] in Georgia, United States, would weigh (have a mass of) a billion tons.
* There are billions of worker ants in the largest ant colony in the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-the-world-became-a-giant-ant-colony |title=How the World Became A Giant Ant Colony |last=Burke |first=Jeremy |date=16 June 2015 |website=[[Atlas Obscura]] |access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref> which covers almost {{convert|4,000|mi|km}} of the Mediterranean coast.
* In 1804, the [[world population]] was one billion.

===Count===
'''A''' is a cube; '''B''' consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube ''A'', '''C''' consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube ''B''; and '''D''' consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube ''C''. Thus there are {{Nowrap|1 million}} ''A''-sized cubes in ''C''; and 1,000,000,000 ''A''-sized cubes in ''D''.
