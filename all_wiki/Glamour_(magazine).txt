Founded in 1939 and first published in April 1939 in the United States, it was originally called '''''Glamour of Hollywood'''''.<ref name=kat>{{cite web|author=Katie Heimer|title=The Early Years of Glamour Magazine: Changing Constructions of Glamour, Fame and Femininity|url=http://katieheimer.com/academic%20works%20and%20clips/CelebrityHistoricalAnalysis.pdf|work=Katie Heimer Academic Works|access-date=August 15, 2015|date=April 14, 2009}}</ref> 

==History==
In August 1943, the magazine changed its name to ''Glamour'', with the subtitle ''for the girl with the job''.<ref name=kat/> The magazine was published in a larger format than many of its contemporaries.

It targets women 18–49 (with the median age of 33.5) and reaches a subscription audience of 1,411,061 readers in the United States. Its circulation on newsstands was 986,447, making the total average paid circulation 2,397,508.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

''Glamour'' was the first women's magazine to feature an African-American cover girl when it included [[Katiti Kironde]] on the cover of its college issue in August 1968.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://style.time.com/2013/01/03/13-groundbreaking-fashion-magazine-covers/slide/katiti-kironde-1968/|title=11 Groundbreaking Fashion Magazine Covers|last=Pous|first=Terri|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

Since 1990, the magazine has held an annual "[[Women Of The Year 2010 awards|Women of the Year]]" awards ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women of the Year Turns 20: A Look Back at the Honorees|url=https://www.glamour.com/gallery/women-of-the-year-turns-20-a-look-back-at-the-honorees|website=Glamour |access-date=May 31, 2020|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>
