== Background ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, "an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution".<ref name="scotus-opinion" /> Section 5 of the Act contains a "preclearance" requirement that requires certain states and local governments to obtain a determination by the [[United States Attorney General]] or a three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] that changes to their voting laws or practices do not "deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group", before those changes may be enforced.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php|work=DOJ Civil Rights Division|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> Section 4(b) contains the coverage formula that determines which states and local governments are subject to preclearance under Section 5. The formula covers jurisdictions that, as of November 1964, November 1968, or November 1972, maintained a prohibited "test or device" as a condition of registering to vote or voting and had a voting-age population of which less than 50 percent either were registered to vote or actually voted in that year's presidential election.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/misc/sec_4.php|work=DOJ Civil Rights Division|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=7 July 2013|ref=name=Section4DOJ}}</ref> Section 4(a) allows covered jurisdictions that have made sufficient progress in ending discriminatory voting practices to "bail out" of the preclearance requirement.<ref name=":0" />

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the preclearance requirement and coverage formula as constitutional [[Congressional power of enforcement|enforcement legislation]] under Section 2 of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966).<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0383_0301_ZO.html ''South Carolina v. Katzenbach''], 383 U.S. 301 (1966).</ref> The preclearance requirement initially was set to expire five years after enactment, but amendments to the Act in 1970, 1975, and 1982 reauthorized Section 5; the 1970 and 1975 amendments also updated the coverage formula.<ref name="scotus-opinion" /><ref name="Democracy">{{cite book|last=Issacharoff|first=Samuel|title=The Law of Democracy: Legal Structure of the Political Process|year=2012|publisher=Foundation Press|isbn=978-1599419350|edition=4th|author2=Karlan, Pamela S. |author3=Pildes, Richard H.}}</ref>{{rp|571}} The Supreme Court upheld these reauthorizations as constitutional in ''Georgia v.

Shortly after the 2006 reauthorization, a [[Texas]] utility district sought to bail out from Section 5 preclearance and, in the alternative, challenged the constitutionality of Section 5. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in ''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'' that government entities that did not register voters, such as the utility district, had the right to file suit to bail out of coverage. Because this decision resolved the issue, the Court invoked [[constitutional avoidance]] and declined to address the constitutionality of Section 5. Justice Thomas dissented from this portion of the opinion and would have declared Section 5 unconstitutional.<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf ''Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder''], 557 U.S. 193 (2009).</ref>

==History==

=== District Court ===
[[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]], in the covered jurisdiction of [[Alabama]], sued the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for D.C.]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that sections 4(b) and 5 are [[Facial challenge|facially unconstitutional]] and a permanent [[injunction]] against their enforcement. On September 21, 2011, Judge [[John D. Bates]] upheld the provisions, finding that the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing Section 5 and continuing Section 4(b)'s coverage formula.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Shelby County v. Holder |vol=811 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=424 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.D.C.]] |date=2011 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20110922a91 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |quote=}}</ref>

Arguing before Judge Bates included [[Kristen Clarke]], who argued that it was reasonable for Congress to "stay the course" in renewing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in order to root out discrimination. Bert Rein, a lawyer for Shelby County, argued that the environment in the country was "totally different" when Section 5 was first enacted.

=== Court of Appeals ===
On May 18, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] affirmed the decision of the District Court upholding the constitutionality of Section 4(b) and Section 5. After surveying the evidence in the Congressional record associated with the 2006 reauthorization of Section 5, the appellate court accepted Congress's conclusion that Section 2 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, that Section 5 was therefore still justified, and that the coverage formula continued to pass constitutional muster.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Shelby County v. Holder |vol=679 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=848 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.C. Cir.]] |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120518150 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |quote=}}</ref>

=== Supreme Court ===
The Supreme Court granted ''[[writ of certiorari|certiorari]]'' to hear the case on the limited question of "whether Congress' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendments]] and thus violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] and [[Article IV of the United States Constitution]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110912zr_d18e.pdf|title=Certiorari granted, November 9, 2012}}</ref> The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on February 27, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-96.pdf|title=Transcript of Oral Argument from Feb 27, 2013}}</ref> Media coverage of the Justices' comments during oral arguments portrayed the Court as appearing likely to hold Section 5 or Section 4(b) unconstitutional.<ref name="oral-1">{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|title=Voting Rights Act Supreme Court Case: Scalia Condemns The 'Perpetuation Of Racial Entitlement'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/voting-rights-act-supreme-court_n_2768942.html|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=27 Feb 2013}}</ref><ref name="oral-2">{{cite news|last=Lengell|first=Sean|title=Scalia ‘racial’ comment on voting rights law draws fire|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/28/scalia-racial-comment-draws-fire|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=Feb 28, 2013}}</ref> Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] drew criticism from civil rights leaders, after expressing his belief during oral arguments that Congress reauthorized Section 5, not because the legislation was necessary, but because it constituted a "racial entitlement" that Congress was unlikely to end.<ref name="oral-1" /><ref name="oral-2" /><ref name="oral-3">{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Liz|title=Civil rights leaders outraged over Scalia’s ‘racial entitlement’ argument|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/civil-rights-leaders-outraged-over-scalia-racial-entitlement-172338534--election.html|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=Yahoo!

Roberts wrote that the Act was immensely successful "at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process” and noted that the U.S. has made great progress thanks to the Act.<ref name="NBC20130625" /> But he added: “If Congress had started from scratch in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula.”<ref name="NBC20130625">{{cite news|title=Supreme Court strikes down part of Voting Rights Act|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/25/19132385-supreme-court-strikes-down-part-of-voting-rights-act?lite|accessdate=27 August 2013|newspaper=NBCNews|date=25 June 2013|author=Pete Williams and Erin McClam}}</ref> According to the Court, "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation."<ref name="NYT20130625">{{cite news|title=Between the Lines of the Voting Rights Act Opinion|author=Schwartz, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html?ref=us&_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/opinion-recap-voting-law-in-deep-peril/|title=Open recap: Voting law in deep peril|last=Lyle|first=Denniston|date=June 25, 2013|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref>

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote a [[dissenting opinion]] that was joined by Justices [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Elana Kagan|Elena Kagan]]. The dissent would have held that Congress had sufficient evidence before it to determine that the coverage formula remained responsive to current needs. The dissent acknowledged that discrimination in voting has decreased in the covered jurisdictions since the Voting Rights Act's enactment, but it attributed much of that decrease to the Act itself, noting that "[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."<ref name="scotus-opinion" /><ref name="oyez" /><ref name="NYT20130625"/>

==Impact==
Since the ruling, several states once covered under preclearance have passed laws that removed provisions such as online voting registration, early voting, "Souls to the Polls" Sunday voting, same-day registration, and pre-registration for teens about to turn 18.

A 2017 study in the ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'' by Boston University political scientist Sophie Schuit and Harvard University political scientist Jon C.

The authors of the study note that this finding is contrary to the "majority's opinion in ''Shelby County v.

In February 2014, the Ohio House approved a bill that eliminated the so-called "Golden Week" during which Ohio voters could register and vote on the same day.

This bill ends a program that mailed absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. Under the new law, Ohio's secretary of state would have to get lawmaker approval to mail these absentee ballot applications.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Higgs |first1=Robert |title=Kasich signs voting bills that end Golden Week and limit distribution of absentee ballots |url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/02/kasich_signs_voting_bills_that.html|accessdate=2 July 2015 |work=www.cleveland.com|publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Texas===
While its voter ID law was passed in 2011, Texas did not enact the law until 2013 after the ''Shelby'' ruling, when the state was no longer subject to federal preclearance for changes to its voting laws. Under the law, Texas voters must show a photo ID to vote. While there are some exemptions, such as for voters with disabilities, most are required to produce a Texas driver's license or state ID card. Other forms of acceptable ID include concealed handgun licenses, military ID, U.S. citizenship papers with photo and a U.S. passport.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Langford|first1=Terri|title=Criminal Appeals Court Judge Files Suit Over Voter ID |url=http://www.texastribune.org/2014/10/02/criminal-appeals-court-judge-files-voter-id-lawsui/|accessdate=July 2, 2015|work=The Texas Tribune|date=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

If the voter does not possess one of the forms of acceptable photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may present one of the following, after which he or she must execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pol-sub/reasonable-impediment-declaration.pdf |title=Impediment declaration |website=www.sos.state.tx.us|format=PDF|access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref> a copy or original of a government document that shows the voter's name and an address, including the voter's voter registration certificate; a current utility bill; a bank statement; a government check; a paycheck; or (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter's identity (which may include a foreign birth document).<ref>{{cite web | title=VoteTexas.gov » Required Identification for Voting in Person | website=VoteTexas.gov » Required Identification for Voting in Person | date=2019-11-05 | url=http://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/need-id.html | access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>

Critics of the law{{who|date=September 2018}} charge that it is unconstitutional. They also say that it will bar legitimate voters from voting and discourage citizens. Examples of problems under the new law involved public figures: Texas judge, Sandra Watts, was unable to vote because the name on her photo ID did not match the name on the voter rolls. Also, State Senator Wendy Davis and then-Attorney General Greg Abbott were delayed in voting under the new law. They were all able to vote after signing affidavits attesting that they were who they claimed to be.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Rick|title=Texas' Stringent Voter ID Law Makes a Dent at Polls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/us/politics/texas-stringent-voter-id-law-makes-a-dent-at-polls.html|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

== Legislative responses ==
On January 16, 2014, a bipartisan group of members of Congress, consisting of Representatives [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] and [[John Conyers]] and Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], introduced H.R.3899/S.R.1945,<ref name="20140428VRAFORTODAY">{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Tyler|title=Bill Summary: Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014|url=http://vrafortoday.org/?attachment_id=252|work=VRA for Today|accessdate=July 4, 2015|date=April 28, 2014|archive-date=7 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707095901/http://vrafortoday.org/?attachment_id=252}} See also http://vrafortoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-07-VRAA-Bill-Summary_c4.pdf</ref> entitled the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014. The bill was introduced to strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) and vital protections of it following the 2013 Supreme Court's decision in ''Shelby County v. Holder''.<ref name="TheNation20150116" /> The proposed Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014 consists of five components:<ref name="20140428VRAFORTODAY" /><ref name="TheNation20150116">{{cite news |last1=Berman |first1=Ari |title=Members of Congress Introduce a New Fix for the Voting Rights Act |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/177962/members-congress-introduce-new-fix-voting-rights-act#|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=[[The Nation]]|date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

# Based on empirical conditions and current data there is a new coverage formula for Section 4 based on a rolling calendar, updated with a current fifteen-year time period to exempt states who are no longer discriminating or add new ones who are. The last part is designed to create a deterrent against future voting rights violations. Under the new formula states with five violations of federal law to their voting changes over the past fifteen years will have to submit future election changes for federal approval. Local jurisdictions would be covered if they commit three or more violations or have one violation and "persistent, extremely low minority turnout" over the past fifteen years. While Voter ID laws can still be blocked by the Department of Justice in the new states covered under Section 4, objections to voter ID laws by the department will not count as a new violation.
# Section 3 of the bill makes it possible that a court may order jurisdictions not covered by Section 4 to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government after plaintiffs file a corresponding application with the court. Plaintiffs have to show evidence of intentional voting discrimination to enable such a bail-in. Any violation of the VRA or of federal voting rights law—whether intentional or not—can be under the new section 3 proposal grounds for a bail-in, but court objections to voter ID laws that are not found to be intentionally discriminatory cannot be used as grounds for "bail-in" under Section 3.
# Jurisdictions in all U.S. states have to provide notice in the local media and online of any election procedures related to redistricting, changes within 180 days of a federal election and the moving of a polling place. Citizens can thus easier identify potentially harmful voting changes in states not subject to Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA.
# Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially discriminatory voting law must only show that the hardship to them outweighs the hardship to the state if a law is blocked in court pending a full trial.
# Affirming the attorney general's authority to send federal observers in states subject to Section 4 to monitor elections in these states the proposal expands the attorney general's authority to send observers to jurisdictions with a history of discriminating against language minority groups.

New York Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] proposed to make online voter registration universal. Under her proposal states with existing online access would expand their system beyond those with state-issued IDs to allow more young people, seniors, minorities and the poor access and update their own voter records online.

The proliferation of threats to the right to vote in the wake of ''Shelby County'' makes it unmistakably clear why we need the full protections of the Voting Rights Act.
