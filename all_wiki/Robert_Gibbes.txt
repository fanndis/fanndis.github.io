'''Robert Gibbes''' (January 9, 1644 &ndash; June 24, 1715) was an English [[Landgrave]], [[chairman]] and [[acting governor]] of the province of [[South Carolina]] between 1710-1712. Although he was elected acting governor by the Executive Council between the three proprietary deputies of former governor, Edward Tynte, after his death, received one vote more than his opponent Thomas Broughton, getting it through bribery. This sparked a conflict between both the oppositions and their supporters which finished with the [[Lords Proprietors]] declaring the election of Gibbes illegal (although they allowed them to rule for almost a year) and the appointment of [[Charles Craven]] as governor of South Carolina in 1711, who didn't arrive until 1712.

Robert Gibbes began his political career in 1684 when he became a [[Sheriff]] of Carolina.<ref name=" halseymap"/> He was an elected member of the First Commons House of [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] in 1692, representing the [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton County]].<ref name=" Johnhargene"/> In 1698,<ref name="halseymap" /> he was appointed a [[Lords Proprietor|Proprietor's]] Deputy<ref name=":0" /> and a member of the Grand Council, as well as [[Chief Justice]] later the same year.<ref name=" halseymap"/>

=== Government in South Carolina ===
After the death of governor Edward Tynte in June 1710,<ref name=" halseymap"/> Robert Gibbes was elected acting governor<ref name=" Johnhargene"/><ref name=" halseymap"/> by the Executive Council,<ref name=" Johnhargene"/> between the three proprietary deputies of Tynte.<ref name=" halseymap"/> Gibbes won the position of governor after receiving only one vote more than his opponent, [[Thomas Broughton (Acting Governor)|Thomas Broughton]], which was achieved through bribery.

Both Broughton and Gibbes claimed their personal rights to rule the [[Council]], with a majority of the people supporting Gibbes. 
In one incident, Broughton took gunmen and a group of slaves from his plantation and went to [[Charles Town, Carolina|Charles Town]] in order to assert his right to access the government council. After running a short parliament, the party of Broughton demanded admission. Gibbes was interested in why Broughton came with a number of gunmen if he recognized himself as governor.
Broughton responded that they had come to the city because they were aware of the concerns in the province that indicated the likelihood of a negative event and the fact that the inhabitants did not favor Gibbes to rule the province.
Gibbes was subsequently refused entry to the city to Broughton. As a consequence, many of the men of Broughton galloped around the walls of the city. These included many sailors that favored Broughton, who gathered on ships in the local port with the intention of destroying the drawbridge. Gibbes's and his followers opposed them, but were forbidden from shooting them.

As a consequence, there was an armed confrontation between the two candidates for the city government and the men who supported them in militias. There were wounded men on both sides. They lowered the drawbridge, entered, and exercised the guard house on Broad Street. Some of the sailors of Broughton were captured.
Some militia fired their weapons, despite their leaders not having given firing orders. Despite this, no one was injured.

Broughton proceeded with his march for a short while longer. Broughton then proclaimed as governor, followed by a series of cheers. They approached the door of the city fortress and forced their entry.
 
Many [[knights]] were then presented to the door and tried to prevent them from entreating, resulting in a retreat to the bay. 
After much altercation and several discussions between both parties, the [[Lords Proprietors]] decided not to support any of them, nor Gibbes or Broughton, although the former acted as governor in meantime.
  
[[Charles Craven]] was soon appointed to take the place of Robert Gibbes in 1711.

Lords Proprietors declared that the election of Gibbes was illegal because it was established through bribery. However, they allowed Gibbes to rule for almost a year.
 
During the government of Robert Gibbes in South Carolina, the [[Tuscarora War]] began in [[North Carolina]]. Gibbes sent [[Colonels]] [[James Moore (colonel)|James Moore]] and [[John Barnwell (colonist)|John Barnwell]] to help in the [[Albemarle, North Carolina|Albemarle]] region.

Many of the local Native Americans abandoned the area shortly after the war began, taking all [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] captive, except for one girl who was sold into slavery in the province of South Carolina. As a result, Colonel John Barnwell received rapid success throughout the wartime period.

Barnwell wrote to the acting governor Robert Gibbes in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]] that they had won the war and now had many provisions at their disposal, including fruit trees.<ref name=" Johnhargene"/>

Gibbes ruled South Carolina until March 19, 1712. He was replaced upon the arrival to the province of the new governor (elected in 1711), [[Charles Craven]].<ref name=" halseymap"/>

Gibbes died on June 24, 1715,<ref name=" Johnhargene"/><ref name=" halseymap"/> in South Carolina.<ref name=" halseymap"/>

== Personal life ==
Gibbes married three times, the first two in Barbados. His first marriage was with Jane Davis (on October 24, 1678), with whom he had two children, namely Mary and Robert Gibbes. The second was with Mary Davis (on January 12, 1688), with whom he had three children: William, Elizabeth and John Gibbes. His third and final marriage was with Elizabeth Rixam (in 1710, in South Carolina).<ref name=" genealogy.com"/>
