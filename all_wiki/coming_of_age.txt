'''Coming of age''' is a [[young person]]'s transition from being a [[child]] to being an [[adult]]. It continues through [[adolescence]]. The specific age at which this transition takes place varies between societies, as does the nature of the change.{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/books/20newly.html|title=Newly Released Books|date=20 May 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref> It can be a simple legal convention or can be part of a [[ritual]] or spiritual event, as practiced by many societies. In the past, and in some societies today, such a change is associated with the age of [[sexual maturity]] ([[puberty]]), especially [[menarche]] and [[spermarche]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Suad|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediawome00jose_042|url-access=limited|date=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediawome00jose_042/page/n96 68]}}</ref> In others, it is associated with an age of religious responsibility. Particularly in western societies, modern legal conventions which stipulate points in late adolescence or [[early adulthood]] (most commonly 17-21 when adolescents are generally no longer considered [[Minor (law)|minor]]s and are granted the full rights and responsibilities of an adult) are the focus of the transition. In either case, many cultures retain [[rite of passage|ceremonies]] to confirm the coming of age, and [[coming-of-age story|coming-of-age stories]] are a well established sub genre in [[Bildungsroman|literature]], [[teen film|film industry]] and even comics.

==Religious==

===Baha'i===
Turning 15, the "age of maturity", as the Baha'i faith terms it, is a time when a child is considered spiritually mature. Declared Baha'is that have reached the age of maturity are expected to begin observing certain [[Baha'i laws]], such as obligatory prayer and fasting.<ref name="tests were not going ">{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.us/turning-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228172243/http://www.bahai.us/turning-15|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-12-28|title=For Baha'is, turning 15 means more than a birthday - Bahai Faith - Baha'i Faith}}</ref>

===Buddhism===
[[Theravada]] boys, typically just under the age of 20 years, undergo a [[Shinbyu]] ceremony, where they are [[initiated]] into the Temple as Novice Monks ([[Samanera]]). They will typically stay in the monastery for between 3 days and 3 years, most commonly for one 3-month "rainy season retreat" ([[vassa]]), held annually from late July to early October. During this period the boys experience the rigors of an orthodox Buddhist monastic lifestyle &ndash; a lifestyle that involves [[celibacy]], formal voluntary [[poverty]], absolute [[nonviolence]], and daily [[fasting]] between noon and the following day's sunrise.

Depending on how long they stay, the boys will learn various chants and recitations in the canonical language ([[Pali]]) &ndash; typically the Buddha's more famous discourses ([[Suttas]]) and verses ([[Gathas]]) &ndash; as well as Buddhist ethics and higher monastic discipline ([[Vinaya]]). If they stay long enough and conditions permit, they may be tutored in the meditative practices ([[bhavana]], or [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]) that are at the heart of Buddhism's program for the self-development of alert tranquillity ([[samadhi]]), wisdom ([[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]), and divine mental states ([[brahmavihara]]).

After living the novitiate monastic life for some time, the boy, now considered to have "come of age", will either take higher ordination as a fully ordained monk (a [[bhikkhu]]) or will (more often) return to lay life. In Southeast Asian countries, where most practitioners of [[Theravada]] Buddhism reside, women will often refuse to marry a man who has not ordained temporarily as a [[Samanera]] in this way at some point in his life. Men who have completed this [[Samanera]] ordination and have returned to lay life are considered primed for adult married life and are described in the [[Thai language]] and the [[Khmer language]] by terms which roughly translate as "cooked", "finished", or "cooled off" in English, as in meal preparation/consumption. Thus, one's monastic training is seen to have prepared one properly for familial, social, and civic duty and/or one's passions and unruliness of the boy are seen to have "cooled down" enough for him to be of use to a woman as a proper man.

===Christianity===
{{redirect|Age of accountability|the exclusion from criminal liability|defense of infancy}}

In many [[Western Christian]] churches (those deriving from Rome after the [[East-West Schism]]), a young person celebrates his/her Coming of Age with the [[Sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]]. (In [[Eastern Christianity]] the baptising priest confirms infants directly after [[baptism]].) This is usually done by the [[Bishop]] laying their hands upon the foreheads of the young person (usually between the ages of 12 to 15 years), and marking them with the seal of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In some denominations during this sacrament, the child (now an adult in the eyes of [[Yahweh (Christianity)|God]]) adopts a confirmation name which is added onto their Christian name.

In Christian denominations that practice [[Believer's Baptism]] (baptism by voluntary decision, as opposed to baptism in early infancy), the ritual can be carried out after the age of accountability has arrived. Some traditions withhold the rite of Holy Communion from those not yet at the age of accountability, on the grounds that children do not understand what the sacrament means. In the 20th century, Roman Catholic children began to be admitted to communion some years before confirmation, with an annual [[First Communion]] service - a practice that was extended to some [[Paedobaptism|paedobaptist]] Protestant groups - but since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the withholding of confirmation to a later age, e.g. mid-teens in the United States, early teens in Ireland and Britain, has in some areas been abandoned in favour of restoring the traditional order of the three [[sacraments of initiation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/BISHOPS/ordsacinit.htm|title=The Restored Order of Sacraments of Initiation|work=ewtn.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=24839|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726221554/http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=24839|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-26|title=Confirmation before communion, Liverpool decides - CathNews}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interchurchfamilies.org/journal/firs_com.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020080632/http://www.interchurchfamilies.org/journal/firs_com.shtm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-20|title=First Communion|author=Association of Interchurch Families - England}}</ref>

In some denominations, full membership in the Church, if not bestowed at birth, often must wait until the age of accountability and frequently is granted only after a period of preparation known as [[Catechism|catechesis]]. The time of innocence before one has the ability to understand truly the laws of God and that God sees one as innocent is also seen as applying to individuals who suffer from a mental disability which prevents them from ever reaching a time when they are capable of understanding the laws of God. These individuals are thus seen, according to some Christians, as existing in a perpetual state of innocence.

====Catholicism====

{{See also|Person (canon law)#Age of reason}}

In 1910, [[Pope Pius X]] issued the decree ''[[Quam singulari]]'', which changed the eligibility age for receiving [[First Communion]] to 7 years old. Previously, local standards had been 10 or 12 or even 14 years old.<ref>See [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10quam.htm Quam Singulari].</ref> Together with the sacraments of [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], the sacrament of [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church|Confirmation]] completes the sacraments of Christian initiation. Historically, the sacrament of Confirmation has been administered to youth who have reached the "age of discretion" but it can be administered earlier.<ref>[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] CCC 1306-13007</ref> Indeed, in [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, infants receive confirmation and communion immediately after baptism.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) sets the age of accountability and minimum age for baptism at 8 years of age. All persons younger than 8 are considered innocent and incapable of sinning.<ref>Book of Mormon: Moroni 8:5-26, Doctrine and Covenants 68:27</ref> The LDS Church considers mentally challenged individuals whose mental age is under 8 to be in a perpetual state of innocence, while other doctrines teach that no one is 'without sin', both believe that those at a certain age are considered innocent. (Note: Other denominations of Christian believe the age is not set at 8 and cannot be specified biblically.)

===Confucianism===
According to the [[The Grand Historian|Grand Historian]], Zhou Gongdan or the [[Duke of Zhou]] wrote the Rite of Zhou in about 3000 years ago, which documented  fundamental ceremonies in ancient China, the Coming of Age rite was included.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grand Historian|last=Sima|first=Qian}}</ref> Then [[Confucius]] and his students wrote the Book of Rites, which introduced and further explained important ceremonies in Confucianism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grand Historian|last=Sima|first=Qian}}</ref> When a man turned 20, his parents would hold a [[Guan Li]] (also named the capping ceremony); if a girl turns to 15, she would receive a [[Guan Li|Ji Li]] (also the Hairpin Ceremony).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Book of Rites|last=Confucius}}</ref> These rites were considered the representatives of a person being mature and was prepared to get married and start a family; therefore, they were the beginning of all the moral rites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Book of Rites|last=Confucius}}</ref> The main dates, participants and procedures may differ in different historical periods or geology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinafetching.com/coming-of-age|title=Coming of Age Ceremony in Chinese Culture}}</ref> 

During this rite of passage, the young person receives his/her [[style name]].

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism coming of age generally signifies that a boy or girl is mature enough to understand his responsibility towards family and society. Some Casts in Hinduism also has the sacred thread ceremony, called [[Upanayana]] for ''[[Dvija]]'' (twice-born) boys that mark their coming of age to do religious ceremonies. A rite of passage males have to go through is Bhrataman (or Chudakarma) that marks adulthood. 

===Ifá===
In the [[Yoruba religion|traditional Ifá faith]] of the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]] and the many New World religions that it subsequently gave birth to, men and women are often [[initiation|initiated]] to the service of one of the hundreds of subsidiary spirits that serve the Orisha Olodumare, the group's conception of the [[Almighty God]]. The mystic links that are forged by way of these initiations, which typically occur at puberty, are the conduits that are used by adherents to attempt to achieve what can be seen as the equivalent of the Buddhist ''enlightenment'' by way of a combination of personalized [[meditation]]s, [[reincarnation]]s and [[spirit possession]]s.

===Islam===
Children are not required to perform any obligatory religious obligations prior to reaching the age of puberty, although they are encouraged to begin [[salat|praying]] at the age of seven. Once a person begins puberty, they are required to perform salat and other obligations of Islam.<ref>{{cite web | title = Islamic obligations at puberty | publisher = IslamWeb | date = October 25, 2001 | url = http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=E&Id=83431&Option=FatwaId | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120802144936/http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=E&Id=83431&Option=FatwaId | url-status = dead | archive-date = August 2, 2012 | accessdate = October 12, 2009 }}</ref>

A girl is considered an adult at the age of nine-to-twelve, while a boy is considered an adult at twelve-to-fifteen years old. The evidence for this is the narration of Ibn Umar that he said: "Allah's Apostle called me to present myself in front of him on the eve of the battle of Uhud, while I was fourteen years of age at that time and he did not allow me to take part in that battle but he called me in front of him on the eve of the battle of the Trench when I was fifteen years old, and he allowed me to join the battle." (Reported by Bukhari and Muslim). When Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz heard this Hadith he made this age the evidence to differentiate between a mature and an immature person.

===Judaism===
In the Jewish faith, boys reach religious maturity at the age of thirteen and become a ''[[bar mitzvah]]'' ("bar mitzvah" means "son of the commandment" literally, and "subject to commandments" figuratively). Girls mature a year earlier, and become a ''[[bat mitzvah]]'' ("bat mitzvah" means "daughter of the commandment") at twelve. The new men and women are looked upon as adults and are expected to uphold the Jewish commandments and laws. Also, in religious court they are adults and can marry with their new title of an adult. Nonetheless in the Talmud; Pirkei Avot (5:25), Rabbi Yehuda ben Teime gives the age of 18 as the appropriate age to get married. At the end of the bar or bat mitzvah, the boy or girl is showered with candies, which act as "sweet blessings". Besides the actual ceremony, there usually is a bar or bat mitzvah party.

====Chassidim====

In various Chassidic sects when boys turn 3 years of age, they have an ''[[upsherin]]'' ceremony, when they receive their first haircut. Until then, their parents allow their hair to grow long, until they undergo this rite. Little girls light their first ''[[Shabbat]]'' candles, also when they turn 3 years of age.

===Shinto===
In the Shinto faith, boys were taken to the shrine of their patron deity at approximately 12–14 years old. They were then given adult clothes and a new haircut. This was called [[Genpuku]].

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], when one reaches the age of maturity{{clarify|reason=How old?|date=September 2020}}, Amrit is consumed in a ceremony called Amrit Sanchar.

==Cultural==

===Ancient Greek===
In certain states in Ancient Greece, such as [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]], adolescent boys were expected to enter into a [[mentoring]] relationship with an adult man, in which they would be taught skills pertaining to adult life, such as [[hunting]], [[martial arts]] and fine arts.

===Ancient Rome===
The puberty ritual for the young Roman male involved shaving his beard and taking off his ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', an amulet worn to mark and protect underage youth, which he then dedicated to his household gods, the [[Lares]].<ref>[[Persius]] 5.30–31.</ref> He assumed the ''[[toga virilis]]'' ("toga of manhood"), was enrolled as a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]] on the [[Roman census|census]], and soon began his military service.<ref>Larissa Bonfante, introduction to ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 7; Shelley Stone, "The Toga: From National to Ceremonial Costume," in ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 41; Lynn Sebesta, "Women's Costume and Feminine Civic Morality in Augustan Rome," ''Gender & History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 533. After the [[Augustus|Augustan]] building program, the rites were held at the new Temple of [[Mars Ultor]] in the [[Forum Augustum]]: Dominic Montserrat, "Reading Gender in the Roman World," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity, and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 170.</ref> Traditionally, the ceremony was held on the [[Liberalia]], the festival in honor of the god [[Liber]], who embodied both political and sexual liberty, but other dates could be chosen for individual reasons.<ref>Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), p. 89; Michelle George, "The 'Dark Side' of the Toga," in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 55; [[Propertius]] 3.15.3–6; [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 3.777–778.</ref>

Rome lacked the elaborate female puberty rituals of ancient Greece, and for girls the wedding ceremony was in part a rite of passage for the bride. Girls coming of age [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|dedicated]] their dolls to [[Artemis (mythology)|Artemis]], the goddess most concerned with virginity, or to [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]] when they were preparing for marriage.<ref>Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 48 on Diana; p. 128, citing [[Persius]] 2.70 and the related [[scholion]]; p. 145 on comparison with Greece.</ref> All adolescents in ritual preparation to transition to adult status wore the ''tunica recta'', the "upright tunic", but girls wove their own. The garment was called ''recta'' because it was woven by tradition on a type of upright loom that had become archaic in later periods.<ref>Sebesta, "Women's Costume," pp. 533–534.</ref>

Roman girls were expected to remain virgins until [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]], but boys were often introduced to heterosexual behaviors by a [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].<ref>Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 533, citing as example [[Martial]] 12.96.</ref> The higher the [[Social class in ancient Rome|social rank]] of a girl, the sooner she was likely to become [[betrothal|betrothed]] and married.<ref>Judith P. Hallett, ''Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family'' (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142; Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family in Italy" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21.</ref> The general age of betrothal for women of the upper classes was fourteen, but for [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] as early as twelve. Weddings, however, were often postponed until the girl was considered mature enough. Males typically postponed marriage till they had served in the military for some time and were beginning their political career, around age 25. Patrician males, however, might marry considerably earlier; [[Julius Caesar]] was married for the first time by the age of 18.

On the night before the wedding, the bride bound up her hair with a yellow hairnet she had woven. The confining of her hair signifies the harnessing of her sexuality within marriage. Her weaving of the ''tunica recta'' and the hairnet demonstrated her skill and her capacity for acting in the traditional matron's role as ''custos [[domus|domi]]'', "guardian of the house".<ref>Sebesta, "Women's Costume," pp. 529, 534, 538.</ref> On her wedding day, she belted her tunic with the ''cingulum'', made from the wool of a ewe to symbolize fertility and tied with the "[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>Sebesta, "Women's Costume," pp. 534–535; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay) on the ''nodus Herculaneus'', which was used for its apotropaic powers on jewelry as well. The [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Roman Hercules]] was a giver of fertility and a great scatterer of seed: he fathered, according to [[Verrius Flaccus]], seventy children.</ref> The knot symbolized wifely chastity, in that it was to be untied only by her husband, but the ''cingulum'' also symbolized that the bridegroom "was belted and bound" to his wife.<ref>''Cinctus vinctusque'', according to Festus; Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211 .</ref> The bride's hair was ritually styled in "six tresses" ''(seni crines)'', and she was veiled until uncovered by her husband at the end of the ceremony, a ritual of surrendering her virginity to him.<ref>Sebesta, "Women's Costume," p. 535.</ref>

===Anglo-Celtic===
In [[Anglo-Celtic]] cultures, (such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) when a female reaches 16 years of age, she may have a [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteenth]] birthday party. However, the legal age of majority is 18 in most of these countries. At 18, one is legally enabled to vote, purchase tobacco and alcohol, marry without parental consent (although one can wed at 16 in [[Scotland]] and [[New Zealand]]) and sign contracts. But in the early twentieth century, the age of legal majority was 21, although the [[marriageable age]] was typically lower. Even though turning 21 now has few, if any, legal effects in most of these countries, its former legal status as the age of majority has caused it to continue to be celebrated.

====Canada====
In Canada, a person aged 16 and over can legally drive a car and work, but are only considered to be an adult at age 18 like in the US. In most provinces, the legal age to purchase alcohol and cigarettes is 19, except in [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Quebec]] where it is 18 years old.

====United States====
In the United States, people are allowed to drive at 16 in all states except New Jersey, which requires drivers to be 17 and older, and sometimes receive the responsibility of owning their own car. People may drive at age 15 in Idaho and Montana. At 16, people are also legally allowed to donate blood and work in most establishments. In spite of all this, it is not until the age of 18 that a person is legally considered an adult and can vote and join the military. The legal age for purchasing and consuming alcohol, tobacco, and recreational marijuana, the latter of which is only legal in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Colorado]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nevada]], [[Michigan]], and [[Alaska]], is 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oregon-raises-cigarette-buying-age-to-21/2017/08/18/83366b7a-811e-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html|title=Oregon raises cigarette-buying age to 21|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865621073/Utah-lawmaker-proposes-raising-legal-smoking-age-to-21.html|title=Utah lawmaker proposes raising legal smoking age to 21|first=Dennis|last=Romboy|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> Multiple localities have also raised the minimum purchase age independent of state laws. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/content/what_we_do/state_local_issues/sales_21/states_localities_MLSA_21.pdf |title=What we do |website=www.tobaccofreekids.org |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Humanist===
{{Main article|Secular coming-of-age ceremony}}
In some countries [[humanism|Humanist]] or [[Freethought|freethinker]] organisations have arranged courses or camps for non-religious adolescents, in which they can study or work on ethical, social and personal topics important for adult life, followed by a formal rite of passage comparable to the Christian Confirmation. Some of these ceremonies are even called "civil confirmations". The purpose of these ceremonies is to offer a festive ritual for those youngsters, who do not believe in any religion, but nevertheless want to mark their transition from childhood to adulthood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jugendweihe.de/Geschichte-der-Jugendweihe.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526085247/http://www.jugendweihe.de/Geschichte-der-Jugendweihe.html |archive-date=2008-05-26 |title=Geschichte der Jugendweihe |author=Krause, Klaus-Peter  |publisher=Jugendweihe Deutschland e.V. |accessdate=2007-11-15|language=de}}</ref>

===Indonesia===
In Bali, the coming of age ceremony is supposed to take place after a girl's first menstrual period or a boy's voice breaks. However, due to expense, it is often delayed until later. The upper canines are filed down slightly to symbolize the effacing of the individual's "wild" nature.
While in [[Nias island]], a young man must jump up over a stone (normally about 1 or 2 meters) as a part of the coming of age ceremony.

===Japan===
{{Main article|Coming of Age Day}}

Since 1948, the [[age of majority]] in [[Japan]] has been 20; persons under 20 are not permitted to smoke or drink. Until June 2016, people under 20 were not permitted to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/17/national/politics-diplomacy/diet-enacts-law-lowering-voting-age-18-20|title=Diet enacts law lowering voting age to 18 from 20|date=17 June 2015|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref> The government of Japan plans to lower the age of majority to 18, coming into effect in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/11/14/national/japan-preparing-bill-cut-adult-age-18/#.WGIQGRvhAUE|title=Article expired - The Japan Times}}</ref> Coming-of-age ceremonies, known as ''[[seijin shiki]]'', are held on the second Monday of January. At the ceremony, all of the men and women participating are brought to a government building and listen to many speakers, similar to a graduation ceremony. At the conclusion of the ceremony Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the new adults.

===Korea===
In Korea, citizens are permitted to marry, vote, drive, drink alcohol, and smoke at age 19.{{clarify|date=September 2020 |reason=Is this according to Western age or [[East_Asian_age_reckoning#Korea|Korean age]] reckoning?}}

The Monday of the third week of May is "coming-of-age day". There has been a traditional coming of age ceremony since before the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, but it has mostly disappeared. In the traditional way, when boys or girls were between the ages of fifteen and twenty, boys wore [[gat (hat)|gat]], a Korean traditional hat made of bamboo and horsehair, and girls did their hair in chignon with [[binyeo]], a Korean traditional ornamental hairpin. Both of them wore [[hanbok]], and wearing hanbok on the coming of age ceremony can be sometimes seen even now.

===Latin America===
In some{{which|date=September 2020}} Latin American countries, when a female reaches the age of 15, her relatives organize a very expensive celebration. It is usually a large party, called a [[Quinceañera]] in Spanish speaking countries and [[Débutante|Baile de Debutantes]] in Brazil. This culture discriminates against males by forbidding them any formal coming-of-age ritual. However, the legally age of [[adulthood]] varies by country.

===Papua New Guinea===
Kovave is a ceremony to initiate Papua New Guinea boys into adult society. It involves dressing up in a conical hat which has long strands of leaves hanging from the edge, down to below the waist. The name ''Kovave'' is also used to describe the head-dress.

===Philippines===
{{Main article|Philippine debut}}

In  the  Philippines, a  popular coming  of  age  celebration  for 18-year-old women is the ''debut''. It is normally a formal affair, with a strict dress code such as a coat and tie for the upper-middle and upper classes, and usually has a theme or color scheme that is related to the dress code. The débutante traditionally chooses for her entourage "18 Roses",  who are 18 special men or boys in the girl's life such as boyfriends, relatives and brothers, and "18 Candles", who are the Roses' female counterparts. Each presents a rose or candle then delivers a short  speech about the debutante. The Roses sometimes dance with the débutante before presenting their flower and speech, with the last being her father or boyfriend. Other variations exist, such as 18 Treasures (of any gender; gives a present instead of a candle or flower) or other types of flowers aside from roses being given, but the significance of "18" is almost always retained.

Filipino men, on the other hand, celebrate their ''debut'' on their 21st birthday. There is no traditionally set program marking this event, and celebrations differ from family to family. Both men and women may opt not to hold a debut at all.

===Pygmy===
In the rite of [[initiation]] of [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] [[Pygmies]], the Spirit of the Forest ritually kills the boys to propitiate their rebirth as men.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Romani===
In the [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]], males are called ''Shave'' when they come of age at 20, and females ''Sheya''. Males are then taught to drive and work in their family's line of trade, while females are taught the women's line of work.

===Scandinavian and Slavic===
In [[Ukraine]], [[Poland]] and the Scandinavian Countries, the legal coming of age of a person is celebrated at either 18 or 21.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the Xhosa [[Ulwaluko]] and the Sotho [[Lebollo la banna]] circumcision and manhood ceremonies are still undertaken by the majority of males.

===Spain===
In Spain during the 19th century, there was a civilian coming of age bound to the compulsory [[Conscription|military service]]. The ''quintos'' were the boys of the village that reached the age of eligibility for military service (18 years), thus forming the ''quinta'' of a year. In rural Spain, the ''mili'' was the first and sometimes the only experience of life away from family. In the days before their departure, the ''quintos'' knocked every door to ask for food and drink. They held a common festive meal with what they gathered and sometimes painted some graffiti reading "''Vivan los quintos del año''" as a memorial of their leaving their youth. Years later, the ''quintos'' of the same year could still hold yearly meals to remember times past. By the end of the 20th century, the [[rural exodus]], the diffusion of city customs and the loss of prestige of military service changed the relevance of ''quintos'' parties. In some places, the party included the village girls of the same age, thus becoming less directly relevant to military service. In others, the tradition was simply lost.

In 2002, [[conscription]] was abolished in Spain in favor of an [[Spanish Armed Forces|all-professional military]]. As a result, the ''quintos'' disappeared except for a few rural areas where it is kept as coming of age traditional party without further consequences.
