{{Video Games}}
A '''mobile game''' is a [[video game]] that is played on a [[mobile phone]] ([[feature phone]] or [[smartphone]]), [[tablet computer|tablet]], [[smartwatch]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], [[portable media player]] or [[graphing calculator]].
The earliest known game on a mobile phone was a [[Tetris]] variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=This was the world's first cell phone with a game loaded on it |url=https://www.phonearena.com/news/This-was-the-worlds-first-cell-phone-with-a-game-loaded-on-it_id62920 |website=Phone Arena |date=16 November 2014 |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522004814/https://www.phonearena.com/news/This-was-the-worlds-first-cell-phone-with-a-game-loaded-on-it_id62920 |archive-date=22 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|author=Andreas Elmenthaler (Elmi) |url=http://www.handy-sammler.de/Handys/Hagenuk_MT-2000.htm |title=Hagenuk MT-2000 with Tetris |publisher=Handy-sammler.de |accessdate=2013-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617124048/http://www.handy-sammler.de/Handys/Hagenuk_MT-2000.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2013 }}</ref>

In 1997, [[Nokia]] launched the very successful ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/A4303014 |title=Snake is born:a mobile gaming classic |language=nl |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=2013-08-12 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209232201/http://www.nokia.com/A4303014 |archivedate=February 9, 2009 }}</ref>  Snake (and its variants), that was preinstalled in most mobile devices manufactured by Nokia, has since become one of the most played games and is found on more than 350 million devices worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nokiaconnects.com/2011/02/15/7-nokia-world-records-that-will-blow-your-mind/ |title=7 Nokia World Records That Will Blow Your Mind |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |accessdate=2013-08-12 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330201321/http://nokiaconnects.com/2011/02/15/7-nokia-world-records-that-will-blow-your-mind/ |archivedate=March 30, 2012 }}</ref> A variant of the ''Snake'' game for the [[Nokia 6110]], using the [[infrared]] port, was also the first two-player game for mobile phones.

Today, mobile games are usually downloaded from an [[app store]] as well as from mobile operator's portals, but in some cases are also preloaded in the handheld devices by the [[OEM]] or by the mobile operator when purchased, via infrared connection, [[Bluetooth]], or memory card, or [[side load]]ed onto the handset with a cable.

Downloadable mobile games were first commercialised in Japan circa the launch of NTT DoCoMo's [[I-mode]] platform in 1999, and by the early 2000s were available through a variety of platforms throughout Asia, Europe, North America and ultimately most territories where modern carrier networks and handsets were available by the mid-2000s. However, mobile games distributed by [[Mobile network operator|mobile operators]] and third party portals (channels initially developed to monetise downloadable ringtones, wallpapers and other small pieces of content using premium SMS or direct carrier charges as a billing mechanism) remained a marginal form of gaming until [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was launched in 2008. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a [[Mobile operating system|mobile platform holder]], the App Store significantly changed the consumer behaviour and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as almost every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps.<ref name="MGA_SoA">{{cite web|vauthors=Behrmann M, Noyons M, Johnstone B, MacQueen D, Robertson E, Palm T, Point J |url=http://www.mobilegamearch.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mobile-Game-Arch_D3.1_06122012_PU.pdf |title=State of the Art of the European Mobile Games Industry |publisher= Mobile GameArch Project |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505184626/http://www.mobilegamearch.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mobile-Game-Arch_D3.1_06122012_PU.pdf |archivedate=2017-05-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of mobile games}}
Towards the end of the 20th century, mobile phone ownership became ubiquitous in the industrialised world - due to the establishment of industry standards, and the rapid fall in cost of handset ownership, and use driven by economies of scale. As a result of this explosion, technological advancement by handset manufacturers became rapid. With these technological advances, mobile phone games also became increasingly sophisticated, taking advantage of exponential improvements in display, processing, storage, interfaces, network bandwidth and operating system functionality. The first such game that demonstrated the desire for handset games was a version of ''[[Snake (video game genre)|Snake]]'' that [[Nokia]] had included on its devices since 1997.<ref name="pg history">{{cite web | url = https://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/10619/a-brief-history-of-mobile-games-in-the-beginning-there-was-snake/ | title = A Brief History of Mobile Games: In the beginning, there was Snake | first = Chris | last = Wright | date = March 14, 2016 | accessdate = August 18, 2020 | work = [[PocketGamer]] }}</ref> 

The launch of Apple's [[iPhone]] in 2007 and the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in 2008 radically changed the market. The iPhone's focus on larger memory, multitasks, and additional sensing devices, including the [[touchscreen]] in later model, made it ideal for [[casual game]]s, while the App Store made it easy for developers to create and post apps to publish, and for users to search for and obtain new games.<ref name=MGA_SoA /> With several games released at launch of the App Store featured as [[rags to riches]] stories, developers drove to the iPhone and App Store. Further, the App Store added the ability to support [[microtransaction|in-app purchase]]s in October 2009. This allowed games like ''[[Angry Birds]]'' and ''[[Cut the Rope]]'' to find new monetization models away from the traditional premium "pay once" model. Meanwhile, Apple's disruption caused the market to stabilized around iPhone devices and Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based phones which offered a similar app store through [[Google Play]].

A further major shift game with 2012's ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]'', games that used a stamina-like gameplay feature found in [[social-network game]]s like ''[[FarmVille]]'' to limit the number of times one could play it in a single period, but allowed optional in-app purchases to restore that stamina immediately and continue playing. This new monetization brought in millions of players to both games and million of dollars in revenue, establishing the [[freemium]] model that would be a common approach for many mobile game going forward. Mobile gaming grew rapidly over the next several years, buoyed by rapid expansion in China. By 2016, top mobile games were earning over {{USD|100 million}} a year, and the total revenue for the mobile games sector had surpassed that of other video game areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/13/mobile-game-revenue-finally-surpasses-pc-and-consoles/ | title = Mobile game revenue finally surpasses PC and consoles | first = Stephanie | last = Chan | date = July 13, 2017 | accessdate = January 8, 2018 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref>

Other major trends in mobile games have include the [[hyper-casual game]] such as ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' and ''[[Crossy Road]]'' and [[location-based game]]s like ''[[Pokémon Go]]''.

===Calculator games===
[[File:TI83tris.JPG|thumb|right|Clone of ''[[Tetris]]'' being played on a [[TI-83 Plus]]]]
[[File:TI-84 Portal.jpg|thumb|A fan-made game similar to the game ''[[Portal (game)|Portal]]'']]
Calculator gaming is a form of gaming in which [[Video game|games]] are played on [[programmable calculator]]s, especially [[graphing calculator]]s.

An early example is the [[type-in program]] ''Darth Vader's Force Battle'' for the [[TI-59]], published in ''[[BYTE]]'' in October 1980.<ref name="jackson198010">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-10/1980_10_BYTE_05-10_Software#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Darth Vader's Force Battle | work=BYTE | date=October 1980 | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Jackson, Clete | pages=50–54}}</ref> The magazine also published a version of ''[[Hunt the Wumpus]]'' for the [[HP-41C]].<ref name="librach198102">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n231/mode/2up | title=Hunt the Wumpus with Your HP-41C | work=BYTE | date=February 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Librach, Hank | pages=230, 232}}</ref> Few other games exist for the earliest of programmable calculators (including the [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A]], one of the first scientific calculators), such as the long-popular ''[[Lunar Lander (video game series)|Lunar Lander]]'' game often used as an early programming exercise. However, limited program address space and lack of easy program storage made calculator gaming a rarity even as programmables became cheap and relatively easy to obtain. It was not until the early 1990s when [[graphing calculator]]s became more powerful and cheap enough to be common among [[high school]] students for use in mathematics. The new graphing calculators, with their ability to transfer files to one another and from a computer for backup, could double as game consoles.

Calculators such as [[HP-48]] and [[TI-82]] could be programmed in proprietary [[programming language]]s such as [[RPL programming language]] or [[TI-BASIC (calculators)|TI-BASIC]] directly on the calculator; programs could also be written in [[assembly language]] or (less often) [[C (programming language)|C]] on a desktop computer and transferred to the calculator.  As calculators became more powerful and memory sizes increased, games increased in complexity.

By the 1990s, programmable calculators were able to run implementations by hobbyists of games such as ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (Lemmings for HP-48 was released in 1993;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xeye.org/1995-2000/LemmGames.html |title=Lemming Games |publisher=Xeye.org |date=1997-04-06 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Doom for HP-48 was created in 1995<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpfool.free.fr/doom/images/index.html |title=Le projet Doom |publisher=Hpfool.free.fr |date=2001-01-07 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>).  Some games such as [[Dope Wars]] caused controversy when students played them in school.

The look and feel of these games on an HP-48 class calculator, due to the lack of dedicated audio and video circuitry providing hardware acceleration, can at most be compared to the one offered by 8-bit handheld consoles such as the early [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] or the [[Gameking]] (low resolution, monochrome or grayscale graphics), or to the built-in games of non-[[Java virtual machine|Java]] or [[Qualcomm Brew|BREW]] enabled [[cell phone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Rechlin |url=http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/games/arcade/ |title=HP 48 Arcade Games |publisher=Hpcalc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>

Games continue to be programmed on graphing calculators with increasing complexity.  A wave of games appeared after the release of the TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus series, among TI's first graphing calculators to natively support assembly.  TI-BASIC programming also rose in popularity after the release of third-party libraries.  Assembly remained the language of choice for these calculators, which run on a [[Zilog Z80]] processor, although some assembly implements have been created to ease the difficulty of learning assembly language.  For those running on a [[Motorola 68000]] processor (like the TI-89), C programming (possible using [[TIGCC]]) has begun to displace assembly.

Because they are easy to program without outside tools, calculator games have survived despite the proliferation of [[Handheld device|mobile device]]s such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s.

==Industry structure==
Total global revenue from mobile games was estimated at $2.6 billion in 2005 by ''Informa Telecoms'' and ''Media''. Total revenue in 2008 was $5.8 billion. The largest mobile gaming markets were in the [[Asia-Pacific]] nations [[Japan]] and [[China]], followed by the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/May2005/1459.htm |title=Global mobile game industry turnover reaches $2.6 billion by 2005 |publisher=3g.co.uk |date=2005-05-19 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231447/http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/May2005/1459.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, the market had already reached $7.8 billion<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-11-28-the-state-of-mobile-game-development |title= The State of Mobile Game Development |publisher=gamesindustry.biz |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> A new report was released in November 2015 showing that 1887 app developers would make more than one million dollars on the Google and iOS app stores in 2015.<ref name="Salz-4-November-2015">{{cite web|last1=Salz|first1=Peggy Anne|title=The Changing Economics of App Development|url=https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-changing-economics-of-app-development|website=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Hank Boye|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=4 November 2015}}</ref>

==Different platforms==
{{main|Mobile software}}
[[File:AppfloodFullScreenInterstitial.png|thumb|A mobile game displaying a full-screen interstitial ad for a different game]]

Mobile games have been developed to run on a wide variety of platforms and technologies. These include the (today largely defunct) [[Palm OS]], [[Symbian]], [[Adobe Flash Lite]], [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[DoJa]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Qualcomm]]'s [[Qualcomm Brew|BREW]], [[WIPI]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Nook]] and early incarnations of [[Windows Mobile]]. Today, the most widely supported platforms are [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The mobile version of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows 10]] (formerly [[Windows Phone]]) is also actively supported, although in terms of market share remains marginal compared to iOS and Android.

[[Java (programming language)|Java]] was at one time the most common platform for mobile games, however its performance limits led to the adoption of various native binary formats for more sophisticated games.

Due to its ease of porting between mobile operating systems and extensive developer community, [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] is one of the most widely used engines used by modern mobile games. Apple provide a number of proprietary technologies (such as [[Metal (API)|Metal]]) intended to allow developers to make more effective use of their hardware in iOS-native games.

==Monetization==
{{seealso|Video game monetization}}
With the introduction of the iOS App Store and support for in-app purchases by October 2009, the methods through which mobile games earn revenue have diverged significantly away from traditional game models on consoles or computers. Since 2009, a number of models have developed, and a mobile game developer/publisher may use one or a combination of these models to make revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/191931/the-phenomenal-growth-of-the-mobile-games-industry-in-charts/|title=This simple pricing strategy has driven the phenomenal growth of mobile gaming|first=John|last=McDuling|publisher=}}</ref>

;Premium
:The premium model is akin to the traditional model where the user pays for the full game upfront. Additional [[downloadable content]] may be available which can be purchased separately. Initial games released to the App Store before in-app purchases were available used this approach, and still common for many types of games.

;[[Freemium]]
:The freemium or "free to try" model offers a small portion of the game for free, comparable to a [[game demo]]. After completing this, the player is given the option to make a one-time in-app purchase to unlock the rest of the game. Early games shortly after the introduction of the in-app purchase feature used this approach such as ''[[Cut the Rope]]'' and ''[[Fruit Ninja]]''.

;[[Free-to-play]]
:A free-to-play game requires no cost at all to play, and generally is designed to be playable from start to finish without having to spend any money into the game. However, the game will include gameplay mechanics which may slow progress towards completing the game. Commonly in mobile games, this is some form of energy or stamina that limits how many turns or actions a player can take each day. By using in-app purchases, the player can immediately restore their energy or stamina and continue on. In-app purchases can also be used to buy power-ups and other items to give the player a limited-time advantage to help complete the game. While free-to-play games had been common on computers prior to mobile, the method was popularized in mobile gaming with ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]''.

;[[Adware|Advertising-supported]]
:A ad-supported game will be free to download and play, but periodically or persistently, the game will show an ad to the user which they will have to watch through before they can continue with the game. The developer earns revenue from the advertising network. In some cases, an in-app purchase allows the player to fully disable ads in these games.

;[[Subscription business model|Subscription model]]
:A subscription-based game will offer a base version with limited features that can be played for free, but additional premium features can be obtained if the user pays a monthly subscription fee. If they terminate their subscription, they lose access to those features, though typically not any game progression related to those features, and can pick up those features later by restarting their subscription.

Many game apps are free to play through a combination of these models. Over time, mobile developers of these types of apps have observed that the bulk of their players do not spend any funds on their game, but instead revenues are generated from a small fraction, typically under 10% of their total players. Further, most of the revenue is generated by a very small fraction, about 2%, of the total players, who routinely spend large amounts of money on the game. A similar split on revenue had been seen in [[social-network game]]s played in browsers. These players are known as "whales", inspired by [[High roller|same term used for high rolling gamblers]]. The social nature of a mobile game has also been found to affect its revenue, as games that encourage players to work in teams or clans will lead to increased spending from engaged players.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/view-all/ | title = What it means to be a ‘whale’ — and why social gamers are just gamers |first =Stephanie | last= Carmichael | date = March 14, 2013 | accessdate = August 21, 2020 | work = [[VentureBeat]] }}</ref>

==Common limits of mobile games==
Mobile games tend to be small in scope (in relation to mainstream PC and console games) and many prioritise innovative design and ease of play over visual spectacle. Storage and memory limitations (sometimes dictated at the platform level) place constraints on file size that presently rule out the direct migration of many modern PC and console games to mobile. One major problem for developers and publishers of mobile games is describing a game in such detail that it gives the customer enough information to make a purchasing decision.

==Location-based mobile games==
Games played on a mobile device using localization technology like [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] are called [[location-based game]]s or [[location-based mobile game]]s.<ref name="spacetimeplay">{{Citation

In other words, while it does not matter for a normal mobile game where exactly the player is (play them anywhere at any time), the player's coordinate and movement are the main elements in a location-based mobile game.

A well known example is the treasure hunt game ''Geocaching'', which can be played on any mobile device with integrated or external GPS receiver.<ref name="spacetimeplay"/> External GPS receivers are usually connected via [[Bluetooth]].{{clarify|date=October 2013}} More and more mobile phones with integrated [[GPS]] are expected to come.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Several other [[Location-based mobile game]]s, such as ''[[BotFighters]]'', are in the stage of research prototypes rather than being commercial successes.

==Augmented reality games==
[[Augmented reality]] games, while not limited to mobile devices, are also common on newer mobile platforms where the device includes a reverse-facing camera. While playing the game, the player aims the device's camera at a location and through the device's screen, sees the area captured by the camera plus computer-generated graphics atop it, augmenting the display and then allowing the player to interact that way. The graphics are generally drawn as to make the generated image appear to be part of the captured background, and will be rendered appropriate as the player moves the device around. The starting location may be a special marker that is picked up by the camera and recognized by the software to determine what to present, or may be based on the location through GPS. While other augmented reality examples exist, one of the most successful is ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' where the player, using the game app, travels to locations marked on their GPS map and then uses the augmented reality mode to find Pokémon to capture.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/technology/pokemon-go-brings-augmented-reality-to-a-mass-audience.html | title = Pokémon Go Brings Augmented Reality to a Mass Audience | first1 = Nick | last1 = Wingfield | first2 = Mike | last2=  Isaac | date = July 11, 2016 | accessdate = February 16, 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

== Multipurpose games ==
Since mobile devices have become present in the majority of households at least in the developed countries, there are more and more games created with educational or lifestyle- and health-improvement purposes. For example, mobile games can be used in [[speech-language pathology]], children's rehabilitation in hospitals (Finnish startup Rehaboo!), acquiring new useful or healthy habits (Habitica app), memorising things and learning languages (Memrise).

There are also apps with similar purposes which are not games per se, in this case they are called gamified apps. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a line between multipurpose games and gamified apps.

==Multiplayer mobile games==

Many mobile games support multiple players, either remotely over a network or locally via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or similar technology.

There are several options for playing multiplayer games on mobile phones: live synchronous tournaments and turn-based asynchronous tournaments. In live tournaments random players from around the world are matched together to compete. This is done using different networks such as [[Game Center]], [[Google+]], and [[Facebook]].

In asynchronous tournaments, there are two methods used by game developers centered around the idea that players matches are recorded and then broadcast at a later time to other players in the same tournament. Asynchronous gameplay resolves the issue of needing players to have a continuous live connection. This gameplay is different since players take individual turns in the game, therefore allowing players to continue playing against human opponents.

This is done using different networks including [[OpenFeint]] (now defunct) and [[Facebook]]. Some companies use a regular turn-based system where the end results are posted so all the players can see who won the tournament. Other companies take screen recordings of live players and broadcast them to other players at a later point in time to allow players to feel that they are always interacting with another human opponent.

==Distribution==
Mobile games can be distributed in one of four ways:
* Over the Air (OTA) - a game [[binary file]] is delivered to the mobile device via wireless carrier networks.
* Sideloaded - a game binary file is loaded onto the phone while connected to a PC, either via [[USB]] cable or [[Bluetooth]].
* Pre-installed - a game binary file is preloaded onto the device by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM).
* Mobile browser download - a game file is downloaded directly from a mobile website.

Until the launch of Apple App Store, in the US, the majority of mobile games were sold by the US wireless carriers, such as [[AT&T Mobility]], [[Verizon Wireless]], [[Sprint Corporation]] and [[T-Mobile US]]. In Europe, games were distributed equally between carriers and off-deck, third-party stores.

After the launch of Apple App Store, the mobile OS platforms like Apple [[iOS]], Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and Microsoft [[Windows Phone]], the mobile OS developers themselves have launched digital download storefronts that can be run on the devices using the OS or from software used on PCs.  These storefronts (like Apple's iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]) act as centralized digital download services from which a variety of entertainment media and software can be downloaded, including games and nowadays majority of games are distributed through them.

The popularity of mobile games has increased in the 2000s, as over US$3 billion worth of games were sold in 2007 internationally, and projected annual growth of over 40%. Ownership of a smartphone alone increases the likelihood that a consumer will play mobile games. Over 90% of smartphone users play a mobile game at least once a week.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kathy Crosett |url=http://www.marketingforecast.com/archives/10608 |title=Mobile Game Marketing to Increase &#124; Marketing Forecast from Ad-ology |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321162003/http://www.marketingforecast.com/archives/10608 |archivedate=March 21, 2012 }}</ref>

Many mobile games are distributed free to the end user, but carry paid advertising: examples are ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' and ''[[Doodle Jump]]''. The latter follows the "[[freemium]]" model, in which the base game is free but additional items for the game can be purchased separately.
