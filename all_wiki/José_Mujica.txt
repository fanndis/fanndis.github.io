'''José Alberto "Pepe" Mujica Cordano''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse muˈxika}}; born 20 May 1935) is a Uruguayan farmer and retired politician who served as the 40th [[President of Uruguay]] from 2010 to 2015. A former guerrilla with the [[Tupamaros]], he was imprisoned for 12 years during the [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|military dictatorship]] in the 1970s and 1980s. A member of the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] coalition of left-wing parties, Mujica was [[List of Ministers of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries (Uruguay)|Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries]] from 2005 to 2008 and a [[Senate of Uruguay|Senator]] afterwards. As the candidate of the Broad Front, he won the [[2009 Uruguayan general election|2009 presidential election]] and took office as President on 1 March 2010.

He has been described as "the world's humblest head of state" due to his austere lifestyle and his donation of around 90 percent of his $12,000 monthly salary to charities that benefit poor people and small entrepreneurs.<ref name=vlad>{{cite news |last = Hernandez |first = Vladimir |title = Jose Mujica: The World's 'Poorest' President |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20243493 |newspaper = BBC News Magazine |date = 14 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>Jonathan Watts (13 December 2013).

== Early life ==
Mujica was born on 20 May 1935, to Demetrio Mujica, of [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Basques|Basque]] ancestry,<ref>[http://diariolarepublica.net/de-paseo-por-muxika/ Mujica paseará por Muxika, la tierra de sus antepasados], Diario La República</ref><ref>[http://diariolarepublica.net/mujica-recibio-las-llaves-de-la-ciudad-de-muxika/ Mujica recibió las llaves de la ciudad de Muxika], Diario La República</ref> and Lucy Cordano, a daughter of [[Italian Uruguayans|Italian immigrants]]. Mujica's father was a small farmer who went bankrupt shortly before his death in 1940, when his son was five. His mother's parents were very poor immigrants from [[Liguria]]. Lucy Cordano was born in [[Carmelo, Uruguay|Carmelo]], where her parents had bought {{convert|2|ha|acre}} in Colonia Jose to cultivate [[vineyard]]s. Between the ages of 13 and 17, Mujica cycled for several clubs in different categories. He was also active in the [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]], where he became close to [[Enrique Erro]].

[[File:Pepe-mujica-tupamaro-251x300.jpg|thumb|left|Mujica with his various alias in a Police wanted photo.]]
In the mid-1960s, he joined the newly formed [[Tupamaros|MLN-Tupamaros]] movement, an armed political group inspired by the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://ojs.c3sl.ufpr.br/ojs2/index.php/historia/article/viewFile/4635/3597 |title = Tupamaros revolution – La revolución imposible |author = Maria Ximena Alvarez |language=es}}</ref> He participated in the brief 1969 takeover of [[Pando, Uruguay|Pando]], a town close to [[Montevideo]], leading one of six squads assaulting strategic points in the city. Mujica's team was charged with taking over the telephone exchange and was the only one to complete the operation without any mishaps.<ref>{{sp}}{{cite book|title=Pablo Brum's "The Robin Hood Guerrillas: The Epic Journey of Uruguay's Tupamaros (CreateSpace, 2014).

The surgeon on call at the hospital saved his life. Tupamaros claimed that the surgeon was secretly Tupamaro and this is why his life was saved. In reality the doctor was simply following ordinary medical ethics.<ref>Brum, The Robin Hood Guerrillas, Pages 122-123</ref> At the time, the president of Uruguay was the controversial [[Jorge Pacheco Areco]], who had suspended certain constitutional guarantees in response to MLN and Communist unrest.<ref>{{cite journal |ssrn = 1387362 |title = Uruguay's Evolving Experience of Amnesty and Civil Society's Response |author = Mallinder, Louise |date = 2009-03-16 }}</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}}{{cite web |url=http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=124426&sts=1 |title=El 13 de junio de 1968: hace 40 años nació el Pachequismo |publisher=[[Espectador.com]] |date=13 June 2008 |access-date=12 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225140520/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=124426&sts=1 |archive-date=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In total Mujica was captured by the authorities on four occasions. He was among the more than 100 Tupamaros who escaped Punta Carretas Prison in September 1971 by digging from inside the prison a tunnel that opened up at the living room of a nearby home.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/20thcenturylatinamerica/a/tupamaro.htm |title = The Tupamaros }}</ref> Mujica was re-captured less than a month after escaping, but escaped Punta Carretas once more in April 1972. On that occasion he and about a dozen other escapees fled riding improvised wheeled planks down the tunnel dug by Tupamaros from outside the prison.<ref>Brum, The Robin Hood Guerrillas, Pages 201-229 and 250-254</ref> He was re-apprehended for the last time in 1972, unable to resist arrest. In the months that followed, the country underwent the [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|military coup in 1973]]. In the meantime, Mujica and eight other Tupamaros were especially chosen to remain under military custody and in squalid conditions. In all, he spent 13 years in captivity. During the 1970s and 1980s, this included being confined to the bottom of an old, emptied horse-watering trough for more than two years.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/entrevistas/m/mujica.php |title = Entrevista a José "Pepe" Mujica|author = Lucho Soria |publisher = www.elhistoriador.com.ar |access-date = 7 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Vice-bio">{{cite web|last1=Andavolu|first1=Krishna|title=Uruguay and Its Ex-Terrorist Head of State May Hold the Key to Ending the Global Drug War|url=https://www.vice.com/read/president-chill-jose-pepe-mujica-uruguay-0000323-v21n5|website=Vice|access-date=23 February 2016|date=May 9, 2014}}</ref> During his time in prison, Mujica suffered a number of health crises, particularly mental issues. Although his two closest cellmates, [[Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro]] and [[Mauricio Rosencof]], often managed to communicate with each other, they rarely managed to bring Mujica into the conversation. According to Mujica himself, at the time he was suffering from auditory hallucinations and related forms of paranoia.<ref>Brum, The Robin Hood Guerrillas, Pages 331-336</ref>

In 1985, when constitutional democracy was restored, Mujica was freed under an amnesty law that covered political and related military crimes committed since 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www0.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15737 |title = Ley 15.737 |publisher = .parlamento.gub.uy |access-date = 12 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130709021744/http://www0.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15737 |archive-date = 9 July 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

Several years after the restoration of democracy, Mujica and many Tupamaros joined other left-wing organisations to create the [[Movement of Popular Participation]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/71.htm |title = Uruguay – Broad Front |publisher = Countrystudies.us |access-date = 12 November 2012 }}</ref> a political party that was accepted within the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] coalition.

In the [[1994 Uruguayan general election|1994 general elections]], Mujica was elected [[Deputy (legislator)|deputy]] and in the [[1999 Uruguayan general election|elections of 1999]] he was elected [[Senate of Uruguay|senator]].<ref name="Gregory2016">{{cite book|author=Stephen Gregory|title=José 'Pepe' Mujica: Warrior, Philosopher, President|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVp8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81|date=1 February 2016|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-78284-304-7|pages=81–}}</ref> Due in part to Mujica's charisma, the MPP continued to grow in popularity and votes, and by 2004, it had become the largest of any faction within the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]].<ref name="Gregory2016" /> In the [[2004 Uruguayan general election|elections]] of that year, Mujica was re-elected to the Senate, and the MPP obtained over 300,000 votes, thus consolidating its position as the top political force within the coalition and a major force behind the victory of presidential candidate [[Tabaré Vázquez]]. Mujica was then elected in 2009 as president in the following elections.

== Minister of Agriculture ==
On 1 March 2005, President Tabaré Vázquez designated Mujica as the Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (Mujica's own professional background was in the agricultural sector).<ref name="Gregory2016" /> Upon becoming minister, Mujica resigned his position as senator. He held this position until a cabinet change in 2008, when he resigned and was replaced by [[Ernesto Agazzi]]. Mujica then returned to his seat in the Senate.

== Political positions ==
[[File:LulaMujica.JPG|thumb|right|Mujica with the President of Brazil, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], in 2010]]
Mujica's political ideology has evolved over the years from orthodox to [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]]. In recent times he has expressed a desire for a more flexible political left.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2010382377_aplturuguayelections.html |title = Ballot box gives ex-terrorist Uruguay's presidency |date = 29 November 2009 |newspaper = The Seattle Times |first = Michael |last = Warren }}</ref>
His speaking style and manner is credited as part of his growing popularity since the late 1990s, especially among rural and poor sectors of the population.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/25/jose-mujica-favourite-uruguay-election |title = Former terrorist Jose Mujica favourite in Uruguay election |date = 25 October 2009 |publisher = TheGuardian |location = London |first = Rory |last = Carroll |access-date = 7 May 2010 }}</ref> He has been variously described as an "antipolitician"<ref>{{cite news |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/29/uruguay.election/index.html |title = Ex-guerrilla wins Uruguay presidency |date = 30 November 2009 |publisher = cnn.com |access-date = 7 May 2010 }}</ref> and a man who "speaks the language of the people" while also receiving criticism for untimely or inappropriate remarks.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.as-coa.org/articles/runoff-forced-uruguays-election |title = Runoff forced in Uruguay's election |date = 21 October 2009 |publisher = AS/COA online }}</ref> Unlike president Vázquez, who vetoed a bill put forward by parliament that would make abortions legal, Mujica has stated that should it come before him in the future, he would not veto such a bill.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jH4dgU0Cbivk_tABQ5JDvTckAYjwD9C7B34G1 |title = Mujica headed for presidential victory in Uruguay }}</ref> In the sphere of international relations, he hopes to further negotiations and agreements between the [[European Union]] and the regional trade bloc [[Mercosur]], of which Uruguay is a founding member.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/9/20091128/twl-el-acuerdo-entre-la-ue-mercosur-sera-e1e34ad.html |title = El acuerdo entre la UE y el Mercosur es prioritario para Mujica. |date = 29 November 2009 |language=es}} {{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>

On the [[Uruguay River pulp mill dispute]] between Argentina and Uruguay, Mujica was more conciliatory toward the Argentine government than the previous administration, and in 2010 the two nations ended their long-running dispute and signed an agreement detailing an [[environmental monitoring]] plan of the river and the setting up of a binational commission. Good personal relations between Mujica and Argentinian counterpart [[Cristina Kirchner]] helped lead to the accord, although several bilateral issues remain unresolved, including the dredging of the shared Martin Garcia access channel of the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11764947 Argentina and Uruguay settle seven-year pulp mill row], BBC News, 16 November 2010.</ref><ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2010/08/31/uruguay-argentina-implement-the-end-of-the-pulp-mill-dispute Uruguay/Argentina implement the end of the pulp mill dispute], Mercopress, 31 August 2010.</ref>

He was close to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, whom he considered to be "the most generous ruler I have ever known." In 2011, he spoke out against the military operations launched by several Western countries against Libya.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/03/28/la-guerre-de-libye-revelatrice-de-la-geopolitique-latino-americaine_1499425_3232.html|title=La guerre de Libye révélatrice de la géopolitique latino-américaine|date=2011-03-28|work=[[Le Monde]]|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112221302/https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/03/28/la-guerre-de-libye-revelatrice-de-la-geopolitique-latino-americaine_1499425_3232.html|archive-date=2012-01-12}}</ref>

Asked about Brazilian President [[Lula da Silva]]'s decision to receive [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], he answered it was a "genius move" because "The more [[Iran]] is fenced in, the worse it will be for the rest of the world."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://en.mercopress.com/2009/11/27/mujica-supports-lula-da-silva-government-style-and-his-iran-policy |title = Mujica supports Lula da Silva's Iran policy |date = 27 November 2009 |publisher = en.mercopress.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1205210-mujica-elogio-a-lula-por-recibir-a-ahmadinejad |title = Mujica elogió a Lula por recibir a Ahmadinejad |date = 28 November 2009 |publisher = lanacion.com.ar }}</ref>

Even though President Vázquez favored his Finance Minister [[Danilo Astori]] as presidential candidate of the then unified Broad Front to succeed him in 2010, Mujica's broad appeal and growing support within the party posed a challenge to the president. On 14 December 2008, The Extraordinary Congress "Zelmar Michelini" (a party convention) proclaimed Mujica as the official candidate of the Broad Front for primary elections of 2009, but four more precandidates were allowed to participate, including Astori. On 28 June 2009, Mujica won the primary elections becoming the presidential candidate of the Broad Front for the [[2009 Uruguayan general election|2009 general election]]. After that, Astori agreed to be his running mate. Their campaign was centered on the concept of continuing and deepening the policies of the highly popular administration of Vázquez, using the slogan ''“Un gobierno honrado, un país de primera"'' (An honest government, a first-class country) – indirectly referencing cases of administrative corruption within the former government of the major opposition candidate, conservative [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]]. During the campaign, Mujica distanced himself from the governing style of presidents like [[Hugo Chávez]] ([[Venezuela]]) or [[Evo Morales]] ([[Bolivia]]), claiming the center-left governments of Brazilian [[Luis Inácio Lula da Silva]] or Chilean socialist [[Michelle Bachelet]] as regional examples upon which he would model his administration. Known for his informal style of dress, Mujica donned a suit (without a tie) for some stops in the presidential campaign, notably during visits to regional heads of state.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mercopress.info/index.php/uruguay/68-politica/1620-mujica-se-compra-traje-para-ver-a-lula |title = Mujica se compra para traje para ver a Lula |date = 29 July 2009 |language = es |access-date = 2 December 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224226/http://www.mercopress.info/index.php/uruguay/68-politica/1620-mujica-se-compra-traje-para-ver-a-lula |archive-date = 21 July 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In October 2009, Mujica won a plurality of over 48 percent of the votes compared to 30 percent for former president Lacalle, falling short of the majority required by the [[Constitution of Uruguay|constitution]], while at the same time renewing the Broad Front's [[General Assembly of Uruguay|parliamentary]] majority for the next legislature (2010–2015). A runoff was then held on 29 November to determine the winner; on 30 November Mujica emerged as the victor, with more than 52% of the vote over Lacalle's 43%.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Mujica/invita/oposicion/forjar/pacto/unidad/elpepiint/20091201elpepiint_4/Tes |title = Mujica invites opposition to a unity pact. |language=es|newspaper = El País |date = December 2009 }}</ref> In his first speech as president-elect before a crowd of supporters, Mujica acknowledged his political adversaries and called for unity, stating that there would be no winners or losers (''"Ni vencidos, ni vencedores"''). He added that "it is a mistake to think that power comes from above, when it comes from within the hearts of the masses (...) it has taken me a lifetime to learn this".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/9/20091130/twl-el-poder-no-esta-arriba-sino-en-el-c-e1e34ad.html |title="El poder no está arriba sino en el corazón de las grandes masas", dice Mujica" |language=es}}</ref>

== Government ==
Mujica formed a cabinet made up of politicians from the different components of the Broad Front, conceding the area of economics to aides of his vice president [[Danilo Astori]].

In June 2012, Mujica's government made a controversial move to [[Legality of cannabis|legalize state-controlled sales]] of [[Cannabis in Uruguay|marijuana in Uruguay]] in order to fight drug-related crimes and health issues, and stated that they would ask global leaders to do the same.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18529993 |title = BBC News – Uruguay government aims to legalise marijuana |publisher = Bbc.co.uk |date = 21 June 2012 |access-date = 12 November 2012 |work = BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://world.time.com/2012/06/26/uruguay-wants-to-legalize-marijuana-sales-should-the-rest-of-the-world-follow/#ixzz1z0z02xqa |title = Should the world follow Uruguay's legalization of marijuana? |journal = Time |date = 26 June 2012 }}</ref> Mujica said that by regulating Uruguay's estimated $40 million-a-year marijuana business, the state would take it away from drug traffickers, and weaken the drug cartels. The state would also be able to keep track of all marijuana consumers in the country and provide treatment to the most serious abusers, much like that which is done with alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120823001028&cpv=0 |title = Uruguay's plan to sell pot may not be that crazy |date = 23 August 2012 |first = Andres |last = Oppenheimer |newspaper = The Korea Herald }}</ref> 
Mujica passed same-sex marriage law<ref>{{cite web|title=Uruguay:Homosexuales podran casarse desde agosto|url=https://peru21.pe/mundo/uruguay-homosexuales-podran-casarse-agosto-105173-noticia/|publisher=peru21.pe|access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref> and legalised [[abortion]] for women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uruguay legalises abortion|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19986107|publisher=www.bbc.com|access-date=17 October 2012}}</ref>

In September 2013, Mujica addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]], with a very long speech devoted to humanity and globalization.<ref name="ONU">{{cite news |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/260945/el-de-siempre-pero-globalizado/ |title = Mujica addressing the UN |date = 25 September 2013 |newspaper = [[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]] |language = es |access-date = 25 September 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928214953/http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/260945/el-de-siempre-pero-globalizado/ |archive-date = 28 September 2013 |url-status = dead }}
* [https://gadebate.un.org/68/uruguay Documentation] of the address.</ref> The speech called on the international community to strengthen efforts to preserve the planet for future generations and highlighted the power of the financial systems and the impact of economic fallout on ordinary people. He urged a return to [[simple living|simplicity]], with lives founded on human relationships, love, friendship, adventure, solidarity and family, instead of lives shackled to the economy and the markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uruguayan President focuses on climate change, environment in UN Assembly speech|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45989#.U60CJPlnVJI|publisher=UN News Centre|access-date=2014-06-27}}</ref>

In general terms, its policy was in line with the previous mandate. The share of social expenditure in total public expenditure thus rose from 60.9% to 75.5% between 2004 and 2013. During this period, the unemployment rate fell from 13% to 7%, the national poverty rate from 40% to 11% and the minimum wage was raised by 250%. It also supports the strengthening of trade unions. According to the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], Uruguay has become the most advanced country in the Americas in terms of respect for "fundamental labour rights, in particular freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medelu.org/En-el-pais-de-las-conquistas|title=En el país de las conquistas sindicales|first=Christophe|last=Ventura|website=Mémoire des luttes}}</ref>

During the last months of 2013, the Serbian film director [[Emir Kusturica]] started shooting a documentary on the life of Mujica, ''[[El Pepe, una vida suprema]]'' released in 2018, whom he considers "the last hero of politics".<ref name="docukusturica">{{cite news |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/275329/documental-de-kusturica-tiene--sus-primeras-imagenes-locales-/ |title = Local images of Kusturica's documentary |date = 2 April 2014 |newspaper = El Observador (Uruguay) |language = es |access-date = 2 April 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141029161749/http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/275329/documental-de-kusturica-tiene--sus-primeras-imagenes-locales-/ |archive-date = 29 October 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref> In 2014 Italian author [[Frank Iodice]] wrote the book ''Breve dialogo sulla felicità'', which centers on the life of Mujica.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.articolo21.org/2019/03/breve-dialogo-sulla-felicita-di-frank-iodice/|title=“Breve Dialogo sulla felicità” – di Frank Iodice|date=20 March 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.sanremonews.it/2015/01/16/leggi-notizia/argomenti/eventi-1/articolo/breve-dialogo-sulla-felicita-gli-incontri-di-frank-iodice-approdano-al-liceo-cassini-di-sanrem.html</ref> Ten thousand copies of the book were printed and distributed for free to local school children.<ref name=”Union”>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unionesarda.it/articolo/cultura/2018/10/18/l-incapacit-agrave-dell-essere-umano-di-amare-8-785871.html|title=L'incapacità dell'essere umano di amare|date=18 October 2018|website=L'Unione Sarda.it}}</ref> In June 2016, Mujica received the Order of the Flag of Republika Srpska from the president of [[Republika Srpska]], [[Milorad Dodik]].

Uruguayan film director [[Álvaro Brechner]]'s 2018 film ''[[A Twelve-Year Night]]'' (''La noche de 12 años'') based Mujica's 12 year long prison life under military dictatorship. It premiered in official selection at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]], and it was selected as the Uruguayan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the [[91st Academy Awards]]. The film won the Golden Pyramid Award at the 40th [[Cairo International Film Festival]].

During a talk at the 28th [[Guadalajara International Book Fair]] (Mexico), on Sunday 7 December 2014, Mujica was interviewed by Mexican journalist Ricardo Rocha. Uruguay's President addressed several topics, such as drug trafficking, drug legalization, poverty and [[social injustice]]. "We live on the most unjust continent in the world, probably the richest, but with the worst distribution [of wealth]." On Latin America, José Mujica stated that he was "passionate about bringing Latin Americans together, about what defines us as belonging to a great nation that is to be created. There are multinational states, like China, like India, like what Europe is doing after a history of wars." Mujica also addressed the question of the shared linguistic heritage of Latin Americans, remarking with respect to the region's two major languages that "Portuguese is a sweet Spanish, if you speak it slowly... and even more so if it has a feminine sweetness." And he pointed out another element that unites the countries in Latin America: "We have another identity: the Christian and Catholic tradition." He concluded his talk by adding: "I see that there are many young people here; as an old man, a little advice... Life can set us a lot of snares, a lot of bumps, we can fail a thousand times, in life, in love, in the social struggle, but if we search for it we'll have the strength to get up again and start over. The most beautiful thing about the day is that it dawns. There is always a dawn after the night has passed. Don't forget it, kids. The only losers are the ones who stop fighting."<ref>{{cite web |author = Jorge Pérez |url = http://www.informador.com.mx/fil/2014/563927/6/no-quiero-que-esten-de-acuerdo-les-pido-que-piensen-jose-mujica.html |title =No quiero que estén de acuerdo, les pido que piensen: José Mujica|trans-title=I do not want you agree, I ask you to think: José Mujica |date = 8 December 2014 |newspaper = [[El Informador (Mexico)|El Informador]]|location=Guadalajara|language=es|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>
