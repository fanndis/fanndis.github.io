'''Bahlsen''' is a [[Germany|German]] food company based in [[Hanover]]. It was founded in July 1889 by [[Hermann Bahlsen]] as the "Hannoversche Cakesfabrik H. Bahlsen". German politician [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]] was CEO of Bahlsen in the 1970s and the press gave him the [[nickname]] "[[Cookie Monster]]".

Bahlsen produces a range of [[biscuit]]s and cakes. Its best-known product is the [[Leibniz-Keks]] (butter biscuit), introduced in 1891. It also makes products such as chocolate-dipped Pick Up! snack bars. Bahlsen operates five production facilities in Europe and exports products to about 55 countries. It also does [[private-label]] production.

It remains funded by private capital.<ref name=ibc>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4469435 businessweek.com: "Company Overview of Bahlsen GmbH & Co.

In February 2013, a gilded bronze sign in the form of a biscuit that hung outside the corporate headquarters in Hanover was stolen overnight. A ransom demand was received asking for donations to a local children's hospital. The sign was returned without payment of the ransom.<ref name=dt>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9850266/Cookie-Monsters-golden-biscuit-found-hanging-from-horse.html telegraph.co.uk: "Cookie Monster's 'golden biscuit' found hanging from horse", 5 Feb 2013]</ref>
