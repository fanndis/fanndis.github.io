In November 2016, a group of computer scientists and election lawyers including [[J.

They wanted a full audit or recount of the presidential election votes in three states key to [[Donald Trump]]'s electoral college win—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—but needed a candidate on the presidential ballot to file the petition to state authorities. After unsuccessfully lobbying [[Hillary Clinton]] and her team, the group approached Stein and she agreed to spearhead the recount effort.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Swaine|first1=John|last2=Chalabi|first2=Mona|title=US election recount: how it began – and what effect it could have|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/28/election-recount-jill-stein-hillary-clinton-donald-trump |access-date=December 2, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 28, 2016}}</ref>

When asked in a ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' interview about Russian military policy in Crimea and Ukraine, Stein answered, "These are highly questionable situations.

=== GMOs and pesticides ===
{{see also|Genetically modified food controversies|Alzheimer's disease#Cause}}
Stein supports [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] labeling, a moratorium on new GMOs, and the phasing out of existing GMO foods, unless independent research "shows decisively that GMOs are not harmful to human health or ecosystems".<ref name="Watkins">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/politics/jill-stein-vaccine-gmo-science/index.html|title=Anti-science claims dog Green Party's Jill Stein|author=Eli Watkins|website=CNN|access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="jill2016.comSCI">{{cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/jill_stein_answers_science_questions|title=Jill Stein answers science questions|website=Jill Stein 2016|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref> Speaking of the health effects of foods derived from GM crops, she has said: "And I can tell you as a physician with special interest and long history in environmental health, the quality of studies that we have are not what you need. We should have a moratorium until they are proven safe, and they have not been proven safe in the way that they are used."<ref name=Watkins/>

Commentators have criticized Stein's statements about GMOs, writing that they contradict the [[scientific consensus]], which is that existing GM foods are no less safe than foods made from conventional crops.<ref name=GMO_critics>

In ''Environmental Threats to Healthy Aging'' (2008), Stein concludes her section on [[Pesticides in the United States|pesticides]] by saying: "[M]any but not all studies find that acute high-dose and chronic lower-dose occupational exposures to some neurotoxic pesticides are linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline, dementia or Alzheimer's disease."<ref name="HealthyAging:chap7">{{cite web|url=http://action.psr.org/site/DocServer/chap7_0926.pdf?docID=5924|title=Environmental Factors in the Development of Dementia: Focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline|display-authors=etal|author=Jill Stein|work=Environmental Threats to Healthy Aging|access-date=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

In 2000, Stein and her coauthors wrote, "Twenty million American children five and under eat an average of eight pesticides every day through food consumption. Thirty-seven pesticides registered for use on foods are neurotoxic organophosphate insecticides, chemically related to more toxic nerve warfare agent developed earlier this century." They further noted the ubiquity of these pesticides in the home and at schools, citing Schettler ''et al.''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/generations-risk|title=Generations at Risk: Reproductive Health and the Environment|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262692472|page=225|last1=Schettler|display-authors=etal|year=2000}}</ref> for the claim that "the trend is toward increasingly common exposures to organophosphates.

=== Health effects of Wi-Fi ===
{{See also|Electromagnetic radiation and health}}
In a question-and-answer session, Stein voiced concern about [[Wi-Fi|wireless internet (Wi-Fi)]] in schools, saying, "We should not be subjecting kids' brains especially to that ... and we don't follow this issue in our country, but in Europe, where they do, you know, they have good precautions about wireless.

Stein is in favor of replacing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)]] with a "Medicare-for-All" healthcare system<ref name=":10" /> and has said that it is an "illusion" that [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]] is a "step in the right direction" toward [[single-payer healthcare]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Health_Care.htm|title=Jill Stein on Health Care|website=www.ontheissues.org |access-date=June 9, 2016}}</ref> When asked in August 2016 whether she supported a ballot measure in Colorado to create the first universal healthcare system in the nation ([[ColoradoCare]]), Stein said she was not ready to endorse the plan, citing concerns about gaps and loopholes in the ballot measure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/160913/jill-stein-coloradocare|title=In Colorado, Green Party's Jill Stein won't endorse the ColoradoCare universal healthcare ballot measure|date=August 27, 2016 |language=en-US|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, Vote Smart reported that Stein wanted to "slightly decrease" spending on space exploration. She favored maintaining current levels of spending on scientific and medical research.<ref name=":10" /> In 2016, Stein said NASA funding should be increased, arguing that by halving the military budget, more money could be directed towards "exploring space instead of destroying planet Earth."<ref name="spaceReddit" >{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jill|title=I am Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President, AMA!|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31z6ir|website=Reddit|access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref>

{{see also|Vaccine controversies|MMR vaccine controversy}}
In an interview with ''The Washington Post'', Stein stated that "[[vaccine]]s have been absolutely critical in ridding us of the scourge of many diseases," and said that "[t]here were concerns among physicians about what the vaccination schedule meant, the toxic substances like [[Thiomersal|mercury]] which used to be rampant in vaccines.

In an October 21, 2016, interview, producer Bec Gill with the ScIQ [[YouTube]] channel asked Stein: "You talk extensively on your concern about corporate influence over U.S. vaccine regulations.
