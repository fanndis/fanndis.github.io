The '''Wilmès II Government''' was a temporary minority [[Federal Government of Belgium]], led by [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Sophie Wilmès]], the first female Prime Minister of Belgium.

The creation of the Wilmès II Government occurred on 17 March 2020 and was an exact continuation of the Wilmès I Government, with the exception that the government now had full legislative powers rather than being just a [[caretaker government]]. Opposition parties [[Socialistische Partij Anders|sp.a]], [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]], [[Groen (political party)|Groen]], [[Ecolo]], [[Centre démocrate humaniste|cdH]] and [[DéFI]] were giving support for a three-month period to the government to handle the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium|coronavirus outbreak]] in Belgium, later extended by a further three months until mid-September and extended once more until 1 October 2020 to allow completion of the [[2019–20 Belgian government formation]]. While a minority, the government as such had certain plenary powers to be able to deal with the pandemic quickly and effectively.<ref name=psw>{{cite web|title=Premier Sophie Wilmès (MR) vraagt morgen het vertrouwen in de Kamer|url=https://vrtnws.be/p.NqGMjWNNk|author=VRT NWS|work=vrtnws.be|date=2020-03-16|accessdate=2020-03-17|language=nl}}</ref> 

On 1 October 2020, the Wilmès II Government was replaced by the [[De Croo Government]].<ref>{{cite web|title=7 partijen hebben een inhoudelijk akkoord om samen te regeren: dit weten we daar al over|trans-title=7 parties have an internal agreement to govern: this is what we know already|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/09/30/7-partijen-hebben-een-inhoudelijk-akkoord-om-samen-te-regeren-d/|author=VRT NWS|work=vrtnws.be|date=2020-09-30|accessdate=2020-09-30|language=nl}}</ref>
