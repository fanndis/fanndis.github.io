'''Kevin Owen McCarthy''' (born January 26, 1965) is an American politician serving as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] since 2019. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] under Speakers [[John Boehner]] and [[Paul Ryan]] from 2014 to 2019. He has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[California's 23rd congressional district]] since 2007.

He was formerly chairman of the California [[Young Republicans]] and the [[Young Republican National Federation]]. McCarthy worked as district director for U.S. Representative [[Bill Thomas]], and in 2000 was elected as a trustee to the [[Kern Community College District]]. He then served in the [[California State Assembly]] from 2002 to 2006, the last two years as Minority Leader. When Thomas retired from the U.S. House in 2006, McCarthy ran to succeed him and won the election. California's 23rd district, numbered as the [[California's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] from 2007 to 2013, is based in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and includes large sections of [[Kern County]] and [[Tulare County]], as well as part of the [[Quartz Hill]] neighborhood in northwest [[Los Angeles County]].

McCarthy was elected to House leadership as the Republican Chief Deputy Whip, from 2009 to 2011, and House Majority Whip, from 2011 until August 2014, when he was elected House Majority Leader to replace the outgoing [[Eric Cantor]], who was defeated in his primary election.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/peter-roskam-steve-scalise-house-whip-race-108057.html|title=Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise vault into GOP leadership|access-date=June 19, 2014|publisher=Politico}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/gop-rep-mccarthy-elected-house-majority-leader-191518947--politics.html|work=AP via Yahoo news|title=GOP Rep.

=====Early leadership posts=====
As a freshman congressman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican steering committee. Republican leader John Boehner appointed him chairman of the Republican platform committee during the committee's meetings in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] in August 2008, which produced the Republican Party Platform for 2008. He was also one of the three founding members of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee#Young Guns Program|GOP Young Guns Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gopyoungguns.com/about/ |title=Young Guns – About |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=gopyoungguns.com/ |publisher=National Republican Congressional Committee }}</ref>

After the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 elections]], he was chosen as chief deputy minority whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]]. His predecessor, [[Eric Cantor]], was named minority whip. 

=====House majority whip=====
On November 17, 2010, he was selected by the House Republican Conference to be the [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|House majority whip]] in the [[112th Congress]]. In this post, he was the third-ranking House Republican, behind [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] [[John Boehner]] and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|majority leader]] [[Eric Cantor]].

[[File:RR Centennial Celebration.jpg|thumb|[[Norman L. Eisen]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] and McCarthy in Prague, Czech Republic, 2011]]
In August 2011, McCarthy and Cantor led a group of 30 Republican members of Congress to [[Israel]], where some members took part in a late-night swim in the [[Sea of Galilee]], including one member—Representative [[Kevin Yoder]] of Kansas—who swam nude.<ref name="BashWalsh">Dana Bash & Deirdre Walsh, [http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/20/gop-lawmakers-reprimanded-after-swim-in-sea-of-galilee/ GOP lawmakers reprimanded after swim in Sea of Galilee], CNN (August 20, 2012).</ref> When McCarthy and Cantor later found out about the swim, they "were furious" and worried about negative news coverage, and "called a members-only meeting the next morning to reprimand the group – both those who swam and those who abstained."<ref name="BashWalsh"/>

In 2012, McCarthy's office reported spending $99,000 on pastries, bottled water, and other food items, making him the highest-spending member of the House in this category.<ref>Nikki Schwab, [https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/06/13/kevin-mccarthys-expensive-doughnut-habit-comes-back-to-bite-him McCarthy's Doughnut Habit Bites Back], ''U.S. News & World Report'' (June 13, 2014).</ref>

=====House majority leader=====
Cantor lost the June 2014 primary for his seat in Congress, and announced he would step down from House leadership at the end of July. McCarthy sought to succeed Cantor, and after some speculation that representatives [[Pete Sessions]] and [[Jeb Hensarling]] would challenge him, both dropped out leaving a clear path for McCarthy to become House majority leader.<ref name="RollCall612">{{cite news| url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/petesessions-drops-out-of-majority-leader-race/?dcz=| title=Pete Sessions Drops Out of Majority Leader Race, Clearing Way for Kevin McCarthy| last=Fuller|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2014|work=[[Roll Call]]|access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> On June 13, representative [[Raul Labrador]] announced he would also seek the leadership position.<ref name="ReutersLabrador">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/13/us-usa-congress-cantor-labrador-idUSKBN0EO21820140613|title=Republican Rep.

According to the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], McCarthy is the least-tenured majority leader in the history of the House of Representatives. When he assumed the majority leadership position in July 2014, he had served only seven years, six months and 29 days, the least experience of any floor leader in the House's history by more than a year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bobic |first=Igor |date=June 20, 2014 |title=Kevin McCarthy Is The Least Tenured House Majority Leader Ever |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/20/kevin-mccarthy-tenured_n_5514788.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location=New York |publisher=AOL |access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

McCarthy kept four of his predecessor's staff members on his staff when he took over as majority leader, including deputy chief of staff Neil Bradley, who now has served in that role for three majority leaders.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dumain|first1=Emma|title=Majority Leader-Elect McCarthy Inherits Top Cantor Aides|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/kevin-mccarthy-staff-neil-bradley/?dcz=|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref>

=====House minority leader=====
After the Republicans lost their majority in the 2018 elections, McCarthy was elected as House Minority Leader, fending off a challenge to his right from [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] of [[Ohio]], 159–43. While as House Majority Leader he was second-in-command to the Speaker, as [[Minority leader|Minority Leader]] he is the leader of the House Republicans.<ref name=MinorityLeader/><ref>Lindsey McPherson, [https://www.rollcall.com/2018/11/14/kevin-mccarthy-elected-house-minority-leader-over-jim-jordan/ Kevin McCarthy Elected House Minority Leader Over Jim Jordan], ''Roll Call'' (November 14, 2018).</ref>

Like Trump, McCarthy supported [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]], a Republican candidate in 2020 for a U.S. House seat from [[northwest Georgia]]; Greene's past racist, anti-Semitic comments and her promotion of [[QAnon]] (a far-right [[conspiracy theory]]) led other Republicans to distance themselves from her.<ref name=Zanona/><ref>Clare Foran, Manu Raju and Haley Byrd, [https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/12/politics/qanon-marjorie-taylor-greene-house-republicans/index.html Trump and top House Republican embrace candidate who promoted QAnon conspiracy theory], CNN (August 12, 2020).</ref> McCarthy did not take steps to thwart Greene's candidacy, and did not endorse her opponent in the Republican primary runoff election.<ref name=Zanona/> After Greene was nominated, McCarthy denounced the fringe conspiracy&mdash;saying "There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party"&mdash;and said that Greene had distanced herself from her earlier statements.<ref>Juliegrace Brufke, [https://thehill.com/homenews/house/513101-gop-leader-there-is-no-place-for-qanon-in-the-republican-party GOP leader: 'There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party'], ''The Hill'' (Aguust 21, 2020).</ref> In 2020, McCarthy was asked about Trump's false claims that [[Joe Scarborough]] (an MSNBC host and former Republican congressman) was linked to the death of a staff member; while a few House Republicans criticized Trump for his use of inflammatory and false rhetoric, McCarthy declined to take a position.<ref>John Wagner & Paul Kane, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/romney-criticizes-trump-for-promoting-conspiracy-theory-standing-out-among-republicans/2020/05/27/88101922-a022-11ea-b5c9-570a91917d8d_story.html McCarthy sidesteps questions on Trump’s baseless conspiracy theory involving ex-congressman Scarborough], ''Washington Post'' (May 27, 2020).</ref>

In May 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]], McCarthy and House Republicans filed a lawsuit to stop the House of Representatives from allowing remote [[proxy voting]] by representatives, a measure that had been introduced under Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the Capitol.<ref>{{Cite web|title=House GOP sues to stop remote voting rule change|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/politics/house-republicans-remote-voting/index.html|last=Raju|first=Manu|website=CNN|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref><ref name=JudgeDismisses>{{Cite web|work=Axios|date=August 6, 2020|title=Judge dismisses House GOP lawsuit against Pelosi's proxy voting system|url=https://www.axios.com/house-proxy-voting-lawsuit-bb4f5d0a-2320-471e-964c-a33a6ee92f91.html}}</ref> McCarthy and the other plaintiffs claimed that a quorum of members had to be physically present in the chamber to Conduct business; Pelosi defended the rule as a critical public health measure and pointed to the provision of the Constitution authorizing each chamber of Congress to establish its own procedural rules.<ref name=JudgeDismisses/> In August 2020, a federal judge dismissed McCarthy's lawsuit against Pelosi, ruling that the House has "absolute immunity from civil suit" under the Constitution's [[Speech or Debate Clause]].<ref name=JudgeDismisses/>

In November 2020, in the aftermath of the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], McCarthy falsely insisted on [[The Ingraham Angle|Laura Ingraham's television show]] that "President Trump won this election"&mdash;echoing Trump's own claim&mdash;even as vote-counting was ongoing in several states.<ref>Matthew Daly, [https://apnews.com/article/mitt-romney-no-evidence-vote-fraud-0ac291da7ab09f6336d24290ef81f53b Romney: Trump's election fraud claim wrong, 'reckless'], Associated Press (November 6, 2020).</ref><ref>Kelsey Vlamis, [https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-mccarthy-trumps-false-claim-that-he-won-the-election-2020-11 Kevin McCarthy echoed Trump's false claim that he won the election, saying Republicans 'will not back down'], ''Business Insider'' (November 6, 2020).</ref> McCarthy insinuated that large-scale voter fraud would lead Trump to lose, saying "Everyone who is listening: Do not be quiet.

After the 2018 mid-term elections, in which Democrats won a majority in the House, McCarthy said that Democrats should not investigate President Donald Trump. He described investigations of Trump as a "small agenda", and that "America's too great of a nation to have such a small agenda." He said that Trump had already been investigated "for a long period of time." McCarthy and other House Republicans investigated Hillary Clinton for years over the [[Timeline of the investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|2012 Benghazi attack]].

More recently, as House minority leader, McCarthy proposed several environmental bills designed to address [[climate change]], which have been described as "narrow" and "modest". They include provisions to extend a tax credit for [[carbon capture]] technologies, and to plant [[trees]]. Responses from Republican representatives were mixed. Conservative groups including the [[Club for Growth]], the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], and the [[American Energy Alliance]] opposed the measures, while others such as ClearPath supported them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/gop-climate-change-kevin-mccarthy-115025|title=Kevin McCarthy faces uneasy right flank over climate push|publisher=Politico}}</ref> McCarthy believes that younger voters are worried about climate change and cautioned that Republicans are risking their viability in elections over the long term by ignoring or denying the issue.<ref name = "CaughtBetween">{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/26/climate-change-trump-republicans-104665|title=House Republicans caught between Trump and young voters on climate change|website=POLITICO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-republican-leader-kevin-mccarthy-predicts-gop-takeover|title=House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy predicts GOP takeover|date=October 25, 2019|website=Washington Examiner}}</ref>

=== Finance ===
In 2014, McCarthy opposed the renewal of the charter of the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], as he expects the private sector to take over the role.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Gillian |date=June 23, 2014 |title=Boeing May Lose Exports If Ex-Im Bank Charter Revoked |url=http://news.investors.com/062314-705809-boeing-may-take-hit-bank-charter-revoked.htm |newspaper=[[Investor's Business Daily]] |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[William O'Neil]] |access-date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

On June 15, 2016, McCarthy told a group of Republicans, "There's two people I think [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] pays: [[Dana Rohrabacher|Rohrabacher]] and Trump. Swear to God." [[Paul Ryan]] reminded colleagues the meeting was off the record, saying, "No leaks.

After a tape of the comment was made public in May 2017, McCarthy claimed it was "a bad attempt at a joke".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/kevin-mccarthy-putin-joke/|title=McCarthy's "bad attempt at a joke" takes on new resonance with Russia news|last1=Herb|first1=Jeremy|last2=Fox|first2=Lauren|date=May 18, 2017|work=CNN|access-date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>

In 2019, McCarthy had threatened to take "action" against two new [[Islam in the United States|Muslim]] congresswomen, [[Rashida Tlaib]] and [[Ilhan Omar]], who have sharply criticized the [[Israel]]i government's policies in the [[Palestinian territories]] and embraced the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement.

McCarthy voiced support for [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|Hong Kong protesters]]. He wrote that "the NBA seems more worried about losing business than standing up for freedom."<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA's reaction to Morey tweet differs in English, Chinese |url=https://apnews.com/9c3df9a26a464a86990b59f89602b854 |agency=Associated Press |date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>

In January 2020, after the United States [[Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|assassinated]] a top Iranian General [[Qasem Soleimani]], McCarthy criticized his Democratic counterpart in the House, [[Nancy Pelosi]], for "defending" Soleimani.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/pelosi-did-not-defend-soleimani/|title=Pelosi Did Not 'Defend' Soleimani|last=Farley|first=Robert|date=2020-01-10|website=FactCheck.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref>

=== Hate crimes ===
McCarthy opposed the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] of 2009, which added perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disabilities as protected classes under existing federal hate crimes law.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll223.xml HR 1913: QUESTION:  On Passage: BILL TITLE: Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act], Clerk of the United States House of Representatives (April 29, 2009).</ref> He has voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll299.xml HR 1592: QUESTION:  On Passage: BILL TITLE: To provide Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes to prosecute hate crimes], Clerk of the United States House of Representatives (May 3, 2007).</ref>

=== Immigration ===
Throughout 2018, McCarthy opposed efforts to codify the legal status of DREAMers after Trump suspended [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) which provided temporary stay for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors. McCarthy opposed efforts to codify the DACA protection because he thought it would depress turnout among the Republican base in the upcoming 2018 midterms elections. According to ''[[Politico]]'', it was thought a DACA-type bill could have also undermined McCarthy's chances of becoming House Speaker after [[Paul Ryan]] retired from Congress, as it would have made it harder for McCarthy to attract the support of hard-line conservatives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/17/ryan-mccarthy-immigration-dreamers-clash-597381|title=Ryan and McCarthy split on Dreamers|work=POLITICO|access-date=May 18, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2018, House Democrats called for a floor vote that sought to abolish [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE). House GOP leaders scrapped the latter and called for the House to vote on a resolution authored by McCarthy and [[Clay Higgins]] to support ICE. House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]]'s spokeswoman said Democrats "will now have the chance to stand with the majority of Americans who support ICE and vote for this resolution", or otherwise follow "extreme voices on the far left calling for abolishment of an agency that protects us."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Scott |last2=Brufke |first2=Julie Grace |title=House GOP reverses, cancels vote on Dem bill to abolish ICE |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/397331-house-gop-reverses-canceling-vote-on-dem-bill-to-abolish-ice |website=The Hill |access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

In June 2019, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], compared the holding centers for undocumented immigrants at the [[Mexico–United States border]] to "concentration camps". McCarthy strongly criticized her words, saying they showed disrespect for [[Holocaust]] victims.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yad Vashem to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Learn about concentration camps |url=https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/Yad-Vashem-to-AOC-Learn-about-concentration-camps-593059 |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>

=== LGBT rights ===
McCarthy was a supporter of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which barred federal recognition of [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and banned same-sex couples from receiving federal spousal benefits; after President [[Barack Obama]] instructed the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] not to defend the law in court, McCarthy supported House Republicans' legal defense of the law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/09/AR2011030906188.html House to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court], ''Washington Post'' (March 10, 2011).</ref><ref>[[Jennifer Bendery]], Kevin McCarthy: [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/kevin-mccarthy-doma_n_1728303.html ''DOMA Defense Is Our 'Responsibility''], Huffington Post (August 1, 2012).</ref> When the [[Windsor v.

===Cannabis===
McCarthy has a "D-" rating from [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He voted against allowing veterans' access to [[medical marijuana]], if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.<ref name="NORML">{{cite web|title=Smoke the Vote|url=https://vote.norml.org/politicians/28918|website=norml.org|access-date=October 25, 2020|language=en-us}}</ref>

===Other issues===
In August 2018, McCarthy co-signed a letter spearheaded by [[John Garamendi]], [[Jared Huffman]] and [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]], calling for Trump to "send more federal aid to fight" the wildfires across the state of California. The letter, in effect requests a "major disaster declaration" across several counties affected by the fires; such a designation would "free up more federal relief" aimed at local governments and individuals affected.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lillis |first1=Mike |title=McCarthy joins push asking Trump for more wildfire aid in California |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/400802-mccarthy-joins-push-asking-trump-for-more-wildfire-aid-in-california |website=The Hill |access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

McCarthy introduced the FORWARD Act in 2018, which "would provide $95 million in research funding for [[valley fever]] and other fungal diseases". The bill provides $5 million for a "blockchain pilot program", facilitating sharing data between doctors and scientists researching such diseases. It would also fund $8 million in matching grant money to be awarded every year for five years to local groups applying for research grants, as well as $10 million each year for five years to [[CARB-X]], a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public-private partnership.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morgen |first1=Sam |title=McCarthy's $95 million valley fever bill would boost research, drug development |url=https://www.bakersfield.com/news/mccarthy-s-million-valley-fever-bill-would-boost-research-drug/article_2948f9f0-969b-11e8-9d72-f31f0294a174.html |website=The Bakersfield Californian |access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref>
