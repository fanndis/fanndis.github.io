The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Акт проголошення незалежності України}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Akt proholoshennya nezalezhnosti Ukrayiny'') was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on 24 August 1991.<ref name=Magocsi>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&pg=PA722&dq=16+July+1991+Ukrainian+state+sovereignty.&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ejEVUc-7G-Xa0QX4-4HgBg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=16%20July%201991%20Ukrainian%20state%20sovereignty.&f=false A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples] by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1442610212}} (page 722/723)</ref> The Act reestablished [[Ukraine]]'s state independence.<ref>[[Volodymyr Vasylenko]].

==Adoption==
The Act was adopted in the aftermath of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt on 19 August]] when hardline [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] tried to restore [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|central Communist party]] control over the USSR.<ref name=Magocsi/>  In response (during a tense 11-hour extraordinary session<ref name=UKrW191991/>), the [[Verkhovna Rada#Soviet period (1938–1990)|Supreme Soviet]] (parliament) of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in a special Saturday session overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration.<ref name=Magocsi/> The Act passed with 321 votes in favor, 2 votes against, and 6 [[abstention]]s (out of 360 attendants).<ref name=UKrW191991>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359102.shtml Historic vote for independence], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (1 September 1991)</ref> The text was largely composed during the night of 23 August–24 August mainly by [[Levko Lukyanenko]], [[Serhiy Holovatyi]], [[Mykhailo Horyn]], [[Ivan Zayets]] and [[Viacheslav Chornovil|Vyacheslav Chornovil]].<ref name="ukrainianweek222470">[https://ukrainianweek.com/History/222470 A reform that ruined the Soviet Union], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (10 November 2018)</ref>

The [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communists]] (CPU), being persuaded behind the scenes by their fellow Party member and [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|Supreme Soviet Chairman]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]],<ref name="ukrainianweek222470"/> felt compelled to support the act in order to distance themselves from the coup.<ref name=UKrW191991/> CPU [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|First Secretary]] [[Stanislav Hurenko]] argued that "it will be a disaster" if the CPU didn't support independence.<ref name=UKrW191991/> CPU members had been unnerved by the news of former party leader [[Vladimir Ivashko]]'s arrest in Moscow, the re-subordination of the [[Soviet Army]] under the leaders of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and the sealing of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party Central Committee]]'s premises.<ref name="ukrainianweek222470"/>

[[File:Проголошення незалежності України.pdf|thumb|The front page of the parliamentary newspaper ''[[Holos Ukrayiny]]'' with the text of the declaration printed on the lower half (27 August 1991)]]
The same day (24 August), the parliament called for a [[referendum]] on support for the Declaration of Independence.<ref name=Magocsi/><ref name=UKrW191991/> The proposal for calling the national referendum came jointly from [[Democratic Bloc (Ukraine)|opposition leaders]] [[Ihor Yukhnovsky]] and [[Dmytro Pavlychko]].<ref name=UKrW191991/> The Parliament also voted for the creation of a [[National Guard of Ukraine#History|national guard of Ukraine]] and turned jurisdiction over all the armed forces located on Ukrainian territory over to itself.<ref name=UKrW191991/>

Other than a noisy crowd that had gathered at the Parliament building, the streets of [[Kyiv]] were quiet that day, with few signs of open celebration.<ref name=UKrW191991/>

In the days that followed a number of resolutions and decrees were passed: nationalizing all CPU property and handing it over to the Supreme Soviet and local councils; issuing an amnesty for all political prisoners; suspending all CPU activities and freezing CPU assets and bank accounts pending official investigations into possible collaboration with the Moscow coup plotters; setting up a committee of inquiry into official behavior during the coup; and establishing a committee on military matters related to the creation of a [[Ministry of Defense of Ukraine]].<ref name=UKrW191991/>

On 26 August 1991 the Permanent Representative of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] to the [[United Nations]] (the Ukrainian SSR was a [[Member states of the United Nations|founding member of the United Nations]]<ref name=tellUN>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/ukraine.shtml |title=Activities of the Member States - Ukraine |accessdate=2011-01-17 |publisher=[[United Nations]]}}</ref>) [[Hennadiy Udovenko]] informed the office of the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] that his permanent mission to this international assembly would officially be designated as representing Ukraine.<ref name=tellUN/><ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359104.shtml U.N. Mission stresses statehood of Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] (1 September 1991)</ref> That same day, the [[Ispolkom|executive committee]] of Kyiv also voted to remove all the [[List of Communist monuments in Ukraine|monuments of Communist heroes]] from public places, including the Lenin monument on the central October Revolution Square.<ref name=UKrW191991/> The large square would be renamed [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (Independence Square) as would the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Kyiv Metro)|central Metro station below it]], the executive committee decided.<ref name=UKrW191991/>

Two days later, more than 200,000 [[Lviv]] and [[Lviv oblast]] residents declared their readiness to serve in the [[National Guard of Ukraine#Pre-2000|national guard]].<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359106.shtml NEWSBRIEFS FROM UKRAINE], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (1 September 1991)</ref>

In the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|independence referendum on 1 December 1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% voting in favor, and 82% of the electorate participating.<ref name=Magocsi/> The referendum took place on the same day as Ukraine's [[1991 Ukrainian presidential election|first direct presidential election]]; all six presidential candidates supported independence and campaigned for a "yes" vote. The referendum's passage ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale; Ukraine had long been second only to Russia in economic and political power.

A week after the election, newly elected president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] joined his [[Boris Yeltsin|Russian]] and [[Stanislav Shushkevich|Belarusian]] counterparts in signing the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_uAoNJiOMwC&pg=PA75 Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation] by [[Robert A.
