[[File:Occupy Wall Street sign in Queens, NYC.jpg|thumb|right|With its rhetoric of "the 99%" (the people) against "the 1%" (the elite), the international [[Occupy movement]] was an example of a populist social movement]]

'''Populism''' refers to a range of political stances that emphasise the idea of "the people" and often juxtapose this group against "the elite". The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although it has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.

A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation (creative process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents "the people" as a morally good force and contrasts them against "the elite", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how "the people" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present "the elite" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups—such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants—above the interests of "the people". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the "voice of the people". According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left–right political spectrum]], and there exist both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].

Other scholars of the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to [[Civic engagement|popular engagement]] of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant [[Power (social and political)|power structures]]. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial [[Government spending|public spending]] financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse—where the term has often been used [[pejorative]]ly—it has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.

The term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the [[Russian Empire]] it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among [[social science|social scientists]] in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly common in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties.
==Etymology and terminology==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Although frequently used by historians, social scientists, and political commentators, the term [''populism''] is exceptionally vague and refers in different contexts to a bewildering variety of phenomena.|source=Margaret Canovan on how the term ''populism'' was used, 1981{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=3}} }}

The word ''populism'' has become a contested term that has been used in reference to a diverse variety of movements and beliefs.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=3|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2p=544|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2|5a1=Anselmi|5y=2018|5p=5|6a1=Hawkins|6a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|6y=2019|6p=3}} The political scientist Will Brett characterised it as "a classic example of a stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse",{{sfn|Brett|2013|p=410}} while the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is "one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time".{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=162}}

The term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=5|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148}} In the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period, a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2pp=5–6}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=14}} In the 1920s, the term entered the [[French language]], where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} Following 2016, the year which saw the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union]]—both events linked to populism—the word ''populism'' became one of the most widely used terms by international political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}} In 2017, the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] declared it the [[Word of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/populism-revealed-as-2017-word-of-the-year-by-cambridge-university-press |title='Populism' revealed as 2017 Word of the Year by Cambridge University Press |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |access-date=9 August 2018 |archive-date=9 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809090852/https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/populism-revealed-as-2017-word-of-the-year-by-cambridge-university-press |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as "populists".{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], "there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings."{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like "[[socialism]]" or "[[conservatism]]", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Tormey|3y=2018|3p=260}} Instead it shares similarities with terms such as "[[Far-left politics|far left]]", "[[Far-right politics|far right]]", or "[[Extremism|extremist]]", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}}
 
In popular discourse, the term "populism" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]],{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=1}} and generally presented as something to be "feared and discredited".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to [[democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2p=260}} The political scientists Yves Mény and Yves Surel noted that "populism" had become "a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy."{{sfn|Mény|Surel|2002|p=3}} Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=243|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as "populists" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that "Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Labour Party]] declared: "we are and will be called populists."{{sfn|March|2007|pp=68–69}}

===Use in academia===

Until the 1950s, use of the term ''populism'' remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the U.S. sociologist [[Edward Shils]] published an article proposing ''populism'' as a term to describe anti-elite trends in U.S. society more broadly.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|pp=372–373}} Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term "populism" became increasingly popular among [[sociology|sociologists]] and other academics in the [[social sciences]].{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the [[London School of Economics]], the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|p=378}} As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as "populism studies" emerged.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} From 2000&ndash;2015, about 95 papers and books including the term "populism" were catalogued each year by [[Web of Science]]. In 2016, it grew to 266; in 2017, it was 488, and in 2018, it was 615.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Noury|first1=Abdul|last2=Roland|first2=Gerard|date=11 May 2020|title=Identity Politics and Populism in Europe|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033542|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=421–439|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033542|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref> Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in "bursts" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=63}}

Canovan noted that "if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} From examining how the term "populism" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of "agrarian populism"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of "political populism", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=13|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2pp=550–551}} She noted that these were "analytical constructs" and that "real-life examples may well overlap several categories",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}} In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=6}}

The confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that "while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with."{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Similarly, Canovan noted that the term "does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas" and that it "provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that "if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that "although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas.".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=100}} Political scientist David Art argues that the concept of populism brings together disparate phenomena in an unhelpful manner, and ultimately obscures and legitimizes figures who are more comprehensively defined as nativists and authoritarians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Art|first=David|date=2020|title=The Myth of Global Populism|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/myth-of-global-populism/4768B361D346DADE91D3C150011CB999?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=PPS_Nov20|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|pages=1–13|doi=10.1017/S1537592720003552|issn=1537-5927}}</ref>

Although academic definitions of ''populism'' have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between "the people" and "the elite",{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=2}} Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=3}} These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=149}} varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and different historical periods.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=v}}
==Ideational definition==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=A thin-centred ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic camps, "the pure people" versus "the corrupt elite," and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale ([[general will]]) of the people.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1pp=149–150|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=Abi-Hassan|3y=2017|3p=427}} }}

A common approach to defining populism is known as the ideational approach.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=5|3a1=Hawkins|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2019|3pp=2, 3}} This emphasises the notion that populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In this definition, the term ''populism'' is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to "the people" and then contrast this group against "the elite".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=487}}

Adopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that "pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as "a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block."{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}}

In this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, "populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of "an antagonistic relationship" between "the people" and "the elite", and is "latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a "homogenous community-people" which "perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty" and "expresses an anti-establishment attitude."{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=8}} This understanding conceives of populism as a [[discourse]], [[ideology]], or [[worldview]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}

According to this approach, populism is viewed as a "thin ideology" or "thin-centred ideology" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the "thick-centred" or "full" ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[liberalism]], and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=64|3a1=Stanley|3y=2008|3pp=95, 99–100, 106|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=6|5a1=Hawkins|5a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|5y=2019|5pp=4–5}} Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of [[nationalism]], liberalism, socialism, [[federalism]], or conservatism.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} According to Stanley, "the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}

Populism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, "a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}}
Mudde noted that populism is "moralistic rather than programmatic".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into "friends and foes", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have "different priorities and values" but as being fundamentally "evil".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of "the elite", from which "the people" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}}

===Right and left-wing===

As a result of the various different ideologies which populism can be paired with, the forms that populism can take vary widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=6|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=4}} Populism itself cannot be positioned on the [[left–right political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=294|2a1=Brett|2y=2013|2p=410|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=8}} and both right and left-wing populisms exist.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=65|2a1=Abi-Hassan|2y=2017|2p=428|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Populist movements can also mix divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the far-right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=vi}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=[Populism's] core consists of four distinct but interrelated concepts:
* The existence of two homogeneous units of analysis: 'the people' and 'the elite'.
* The antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite.
* The idea of popular sovereignty.
* The positive valorisation of 'the people' and denigration of 'the elite'.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Ben Stanley{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} }}

The ideologies with which populism can be paired can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's [[Alberto Fujimori]] who promoted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] who promoted socialist programs.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=8–9}} As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy's [[Beppe Grillo]] have been characterised as [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]],{{sfn|Brett|2013|pp=410–411}} while groups like Turkey's [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] have been described as combining populism with [[Islamism]],{{sfn|Park|2018|p=170}} and India's [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been seen as mixing populism with [[Hindu nationalism]].{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=495}} Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist [[Syriza]] and the right-wing populist [[Independent Greeks]] in 2015.{{sfn|Aslanidis|Rovira Kaltwasser|2016|p=1078}}

Adherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists. The latter are presented as juxtaposing "the people" against both "the elite" and an additional group who are also regarded as being separate from "the people" and whom "the elite" is seen to favour, such as immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or communists.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|pp=487–488}}
Populist leaders thus "come in many different shades and sizes" but, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, share one common element: "a carefully crafted image of the ''vox populi''".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=20}} Stanley expressed the view that although there are "certain family resemblances" that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was "no coherent tradition" unifying all of them.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}
While many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the [[vanguard of the proletariat]], by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the "voice of the people" more widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=549–50|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=67}} On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with "the people" and "the nation" becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}}
Some political scientists have also argued that populism can be divided into "inclusionary" and "exclusionary" forms.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=147}}

==="The people"===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Populists (claim to) speak in the name of the 'oppressed people', and they want to emancipate them by making them aware of their oppression. However, they do not want to change their values or their 'way of life.' This is fundamentally different from, for example, the (early) socialists, who want(ed) to 'uplift the workers' by re-educating them, thereby liberating them from their 'false consciousness'. For populists, on the other hand, the consciousness of the people, generally referred to as common sense, is the basis of all good (politics).|source=Political scientist Cas Mudde{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=546–47}} }}

For populists, "the people" are presented as being homogeneous,{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=6|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=202|3a1=Tormey|3y=2018|3p=262|4a1=Bang|4a2=Marsh|4y=2018|4p=353}} and also virtuous.{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=6|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=202}} In simplifying the complexities of reality, the concept of "the people" is vague and flexible,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=9}} with this plasticity benefitting populists who are thus able to "expand or contract" the concept "to suit the chosen criteria of inclusion or exclusion" at any given time.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}} In employing the concept of "the people", populists can encourage a sense of shared identity among different groups within a society and facilitate their mobilisation toward a common cause.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=9}} One of the ways that populists employ the understanding of "the people" is in the idea that "the people are sovereign", that in a democratic state governmental decisions should rest with the population and that if they are ignored then they might mobilise or revolt.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} This is the sense of "the people" employed in the late 19th century United States by the People's Party and which has also been used by later populist movements in that country.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}}

A second way in which "the people" is conceived by populists combines a socioeconomic or class based category with one that refers to certain cultural traditions and popular values.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} The concept seeks to vindicate the dignity of a social group who regard themselves as being oppressed by a dominant "elite" who are accused of treating "the people's" values, judgements, and tastes with suspicion or contempt.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} A third use of "the people" by populists employs it as a synonym for "the nation", whether that national community be conceived in either [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic]] or [[Civic nationalism|civic]] terms. In such a framework, all individuals regarded as being "native" to a particular state, either by birth or by ethnicity, could be considered part of "the people".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=11}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Left and right populists[…] both regard representative democracy as being captivated by political elites and powerful interest groups. However, populists of the right tend to express envy for those low on the social ladder, identifying 'special interests' with ethnic or other minorities. Progressive populists, on the other hand, envy those high on the social ladder, identifying 'special interests' with powerful groups such as large corporations.|source=Political scientist Tjitske Akkerman{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=158}} }}

Populism typically entails "celebrating them ''as'' the people", in Stanley's words.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}
The political scientist Paul Taggart proposed the term "the heartland" to better reflect what populists often mean in their rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2y=2004|2p=545|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=3}} According to Taggart, "the heartland" was the place "in which, in the populist imagination, a virtuous and unified population resides".{{sfn|Taggart|2000|p=95}} Who this "heartland" is can vary between populists, even within the same country. For instance, in Britain, the centre-right [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conceived of "[[Middle England]]" as its heartland, while the far-right [[British National Party]] conceived of the "native British people" as its heartland.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}}
Mudde noted that for populists, "the people" "are neither real nor all-inclusive, but are in fact a mythical and constructed sub-set of the whole population".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}} They are an [[imagined community]], much like the imagined communities embraced and promoted by nationalists.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}}

Populism often entails presenting "the people" as the [[underdog]].{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}} Populists typically seek to reveal to "the people" how they are oppressed.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}} In doing so, they do not seek to change "the people", but rather seek to preserve the latter's "way of life" as it presently exists, regarding it as a source of good.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=546–47}} For populists, the way of life of "the people" is presented as being rooted in history and tradition and regarded as being conducive to public good.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=6}}  Although populist leaders often present themselves as representatives of "the people", they often come from elite strata in society; examples like Berlusconi, Fortuyn, and Haider were all well-connected to their country's political and economic elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=560}}

Populism can also be subdivided into "inclusionary" and "exclusionary" forms, which differ in their conceptions of who "the people" are. Inclusionary populism tends to define "the people" more broadly, accepting and advocating for minority and marginalised groups, while exclusionary populism defines "the people" in a much stricter sense, generally being focused on a particular sociocultural group and antagonistic against minority groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=147|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=5}} However, this is not exactly a pure dichotomy – exclusive populists can still give voice to those who feel marginalised by the political status quo and include minorities if it is advantageous, while inclusive populists can vary significantly in how inclusive they actually are. In addition, all populisms are implicitly exclusionary, since they define "the people" against "the elite", thus some scholars argue that the difference between populisms is not whether a particular populism excludes but whom it excludes from its conception of "the people".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=168|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=5}}<ref>Gagnon, Jean-Paul; Beausoleil, Emily; Son, Kyong-Min; Arguelles, Cleve; Chalaye, Pierrick; and Johnston, Callum.

}}

Anti-elitism is widely considered the central characteristic feature of populism,{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=295}} although Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that anti-elitism alone was not evidence of populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=151}} Rather, according to Stanley, in populist discourse the "fundamental distinguishing feature" of "the elite" is that it is in an "adversarial relationship" with "the people".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}} In defining "the elite", populists often condemn not only the political establishment, but also the economic elite, cultural elite, academic elite, and the media elite, which they present as one homogeneous, corrupt group.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=11–12}} In early 21st century India, the populist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] for instance accused the dominant [[Indian National Congress]] party, the [[Communist Party of India]], NGOs, academia, and the English-language media of all being part of "the elite".{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|pp=489–490}}

When operating in liberal democracies, populists often condemn dominant political parties as part of "the elite" but at the same time do not reject the party political system altogether, instead either calling for or claiming to be a new kind of party different from the others.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}} Although condemning almost all those in positions of power within a given society, populists often exclude both themselves and those sympathetic to their cause even when they too are in positions of power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}} For instance, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), a right-wing populist group, regularly condemned "the media" in Austria for defending "the elite", but excluded from that the ''[[Kronen Zeitung]]'', a widely read [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] that supported the FPÖ and its leader [[Jörg Haider]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}}

When populists take governmental power, they are faced with a challenge in that they now represent a new elite. In such cases—like Chávez in Venezuela and [[Vladimír Mečiar]] in Slovakia—populists retain their anti-establishment rhetoric by making changes to their concept of "the elite" to suit their new circumstances, alleging that real power is not held by the government but other powerful forces who continue to undermine the populist government and the will of "the people" itself.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}} In these instances, populist governments often conceptualise "the elite" as those holding [[economic power]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In Venezuela, for example, Chávez blamed the economic elite for frustrating his reforms, while in Greece, the left-wing populist Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] accused "the lobbyists and oligarchs of Greece" of undermining his administration.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In populist instances like these, the claims made have some basis in reality, as business interests seek to undermine leftist-oriented economic reform.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}}

[[File:Evo Morales 2017.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Bolivian government of left-wing populist [[Evo Morales]] and his [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] has been described as the "prototypical case" of ethnopopulism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} ]]

Although left-wing populists who combine populist ideas with forms of socialism most commonly present "the elite" in economic terms, the same strategy is also employed by some right-wing populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the United States during the late 2000s, the [[Tea Party movement]]—which presented itself as a defender of the capitalist [[free market]]—argued that big business, and its allies in [[United States Congress|Congress]], seeks to undermine the free market and kill competition by stifling small business.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Among some 21st century right-wing populists, "the elite" are presented as being political [[Progressivism|progressives]] committed to [[political correctness]].{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}} The Dutch right-wing populist leader [[Pim Fortuyn]] referred to this as the "Church of the Left".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}}

In some instances, particularly in Latin America and Africa, "the elites" are conceived not just in economic but also in ethnic terms, representing what political scientists have termed [[ethnopopulism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=14, 72|2a1=Resnick|2y=2017|2p=114|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=207}} In Bolivia, for example, the left-wing populist leader [[Evo Morales]] juxtaposed the [[mestizo]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous]] "people" against an overwhelmingly [[White Bolivians|European]] "elite",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} declaring that "We Indians [i.e. indigenous people] are Latin America's moral reserve".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} In the Bolivian case, this was not accompanied by a racially exclusionary approach, but with an attempt to build a pan-ethnic coalition which included European Bolivians against the largely European Bolivian elite.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=72–73}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] has presented black South Africans as the "people" whom he claims to represent, calling for the expropriation of land owned by the white minority without compensation.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=112–113}} In areas like Europe where nation-states are more ethnically homogenous, this ethnopopulist approach is rare given that the "people" and "elite" are typically of the same ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}}

For some populist leaders and movements, the term "the elite" also refers to an academic or intellectual establishment and, as such, entails scholars, intellectuals, experts, or organized science as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mede|first=Niels G.|date=10 June 2020|title="The people have had enough of experts!"

In various instances, populists claim that "the elite" is working against the interests of the country.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the [[European Union]] (EU), for instance, various populist groups allege that their national political elites put the interests of the EU itself over those of their own nation-states.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Similarly, in Latin America populists often charge political elites with championing the interests of the United States over those of their own countries.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=13–14}}

Another common tactic among populists, particularly in Europe, is the accusation that "the elites" place the interests of immigrants above those of the native population;{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} [[Finns Party]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richard |first1=Milne |title=Finland's populists find favour with anti-green agenda |url=https://www.ft.com/content/564d00c2-5c61-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a |website=ft.com |publisher=Financial Times |access-date=28 September 2020 |archive-date=23 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423224849/https://www.ft.com/content/564d00c2-5c61-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a |url-status=live }}</ref> for example, interprets things this way. Such approaches are also found elsewhere; the Zambian populist [[Michael Sata]] for instance adopted a xenophobic stance during his campaigns by focusing his criticism on the country's Asian minority, decrying Chinese and Indian ownership of businesses and mines.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=112}} In India, the right-wing populist leader [[Narendra Modi]] rallied supporters against Muslim Bangladeshi migrants, promising to deport them.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=486}} In instances where populists are also [[antisemitic]] (such as [[Jobbik]] in Hungary and [[Attack (political party)|Attack]] in Bulgaria) the elites are accused of favouring Israeli and wider Jewish interests above those of the national group.  Antisemitic populists often accuse "the elite" of being made up of many Jews as well.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, "the elite" can sometimes be presented as "ethnic traitors".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}

===General will===

A third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or ''volonté générale''.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=16}} An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Chávez's 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that "All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence. Because of that its judgement is pure, its will is strong, and none can corrupt or even threaten it."{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=16–17}} For populists, the general will of "the people" is something that should take precedence over the preferences of "the elite".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}

As noted by Stanley, the populist idea of the general will is connected to ideas of majoritarianism and authenticity.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}} Highlighting how populists appeal to the ideals of "authenticity and ordinariness", he noted that what was most important to populists was "to appeal to the ''idea'' of an authentic people" and to cultivate the idea that they are the "genuine" representatives of "the people".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}} In doing so they often emphasise their physical proximity to "the people" and their distance from "the elites".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}

In emphasising the general will, many populists share the critique of representative democratic government previously espoused by the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=16–17}} This approach regards representative governance as an aristocratic and elitist system in which a country's citizens are regarded as passive entities. Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referendum]]s and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that "it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that "support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}
Populist notions of the "general will" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of "[[common sense]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=18}}

===Versus elitism and pluralism===

[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]

Stanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to "the people" had become "an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice", with elections and referendums predicated on the notion that "the people" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a "non-populism" in the form of both [[elitism]] and [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=543|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7}}

Elitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view "the people" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and "the elites" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=543–44|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some—such as Spain's [[Francisco Franco]] and Chile's [[Augusto Pinochet]]—reject democracy altogether, while others—like Spain's [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and Austria's [[Joseph Schumpeter]]—support a limited model of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=7}}

Pluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7|3a1=Hawkins|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2019|3p=4}} Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group—whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership—and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=7–8}} Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a "general will" exists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=152}} Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}

==Other definitions==

The popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} For example early rural populists in the US were some of the strongest supporters of an unnecessary war with Spain in 1898.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Sign In|doi=10.1111/hisn.13023|s2cid=149477675}}</ref>

The Laclauan definition of populism, so called after the Argentinian political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] who developed it, uses the term in reference to what proponents regard as an emancipatory force that is the essence of politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} In this concept of populism, it is believed to mobilise excluded sectors of society against dominant elites and changing the status quo.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Laclau's initial emphasis was on class antagonisms arising between different classes, although he later altered his perspective to claim that populist discourses could arise from any part of the socio-institutional structure.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} For Laclau, socialism was "the highest form of populism".{{sfn|March|2007|p=65}} His understandings of the topic derived in large part from his focus on politics in Latin America.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=262}} This definition is popular among critics of [[liberal democracy]] and is widely used in critical studies and in studies of West European and Latin American politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Harry C. Boyte for example defined populism as "a politics of civic agency" which "develops the power of 'the people' to shape their destiny", as examples citing both the Russian narodniks and the South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]].{{sfn|Boyte|2012|p=173}}

The socioeconomic definition of populism applies the term to what it regards as an irresponsible form of economic policy by which a government engages in a period of massive public spending financed by foreign loans, after which the country falls into [[hyperinflation]] and harsh economic adjustments are then imposed.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=3–4|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} This use of the term was used by economists like [[Rudiger Dornbusch]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and was particularly popular among scholars of Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Since that time, this definition continued to be used by some economists and journalists, particularly in the US, but was uncommon among other [[social sciences]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} This definition relies on focusing on socialist and other left-wing forms of populism; it does not apply to other groups commonly understood as populist which adopted right-wing stances on economic issues.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}}

An additional framework has been described as the "political-strategic" approach.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}} This applies the term ''populism'' to a political strategy in which a charismatic leader seeks to govern based on direct and unmediated connection with their followers.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=4|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} [[Kurt Weyland]] defined this conception of ''populism'' as "a political strategy through which a personalist leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1pp=153-154|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} This is a definition of the term that is popular among scholars of non-Western societies.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} By focusing on leadership, this concept of ''populism'' does not allow for the existence of populist parties or populist social movements;{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}} under this definition, for instance, the U.S. People's Party which first invented the term ''populism'' could not be considered populist.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=154}} Mudde suggested that although the idea of a leader having direct access to "the people" was a common element among populists, it is best regarded as a feature which facilitates rather than defines populism.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=545}}

In popular discourse, ''populism'' is sometimes used in a negative sense in reference to politics which involves promoting extremely simple solutions to complex problems in a highly emotional manner.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde suggested that this definition "seems to have instinctive value" but was difficult to employ empirically because almost all political groups engage in sloganeering and because it can be difficult to differentiate an argument made emotionally from one made rationally.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde thought that this phenomenon was better termed ''[[demagogy]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} Another use of the term in popular discourse is to describe opportunistic policies designed to quickly please voters rather than deciding a more rational course of action.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Examples of this would include a governing political party lowering taxes before an election or promising to provide things to the electorate which the state cannot afford to pay for.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=542–43}} Mudde suggested that this phenomenon is better described as ''[[political opportunism|opportunism]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}}

== Demand-side factors ==
The factors which make it more likely for individuals to support populist ideas are referred to as the demand-side of populism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-49203-7|location=Cambridge|pages=202|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492037}}</ref> Various factors have been claimed to increase the demand for populism:

=== Modernisation ===
The [[modernisation losers thesis]] argues that certain aspects of transition to modernity has caused demand for populism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-49203-7|location=Cambridge|pages=203|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492037}}</ref> Some arguments rely on the belief that the [[anomie]] which has followed [[industrialisation]] has resulting in a "dissolution, fragmentation and differentiation", weakening the traditional ties of [[civil society]], and increasing [[individualism|individualization]].<ref>Betz, Hans Georg & Johnson, Carol (2004) Against the current – stemming the tide: the nostalgic ideology of the contemporary radical populist right Journal of political ideologies..

=== Economic grievance ===
The economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors, such as [[Deindustrialization|deindustrialisation]], [[Economic liberalization|economic liberalisation]], and [[deregulation]], are causing the formation of a 'left-behind' precariat with low [[job security]], high [[Economic inequality|inequality]], and wage stagnation who then support populism.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Pippa|title=Cultural Backlash|last2=Inglehart|first2=Ronald|date=11 February 2019|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-59584-1|pages=134–139|doi=10.1017/9781108595841}}</ref> Some populist parties have offered [[welfare chauvinism]] in response to this.<ref name=":2" /> However, the evidence is for this claim is mixed.<ref name=":2" /> Some theories only focus on the effect of [[Recession|economic crises]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-49203-7|location=Cambridge|pages=205–206|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492037}}</ref>

=== Cultural backlash ===
The cultural backlash thesis argues that right-wing populism is reaction to the rise of [[postmaterialism]] in many [[Developed country|developed countries]], including the spread of [[feminism]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[environmentalism]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Pippa|title=Cultural Backlash|last2=Inglehart|first2=Ronald|date=11 February 2019|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-59584-1|pages=32–35|doi=10.1017/9781108595841}}</ref> As such ideas and values have spread through societies, they have reached a 'tipping point' which has caused a reaction in the form of right-wing populism.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Pippa|title=Cultural Backlash|last2=Inglehart|first2=Ronald|date=11 February 2019|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-59584-1|pages=44|doi=10.1017/9781108595841}}</ref> Some theories limit this argument to being a reaction to just the increase of ethnic diversity from [[immigration]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-49203-7|location=Cambridge|pages=210|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492037}}</ref> However, the empiric studies testing this theory have produced highly contradicting results.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-49203-7|location=Cambridge|pages=211–212|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492037}}</ref>

=== Recent democratization ===
The length of time since a country has been [[Democratization|democratized]] has also been linked to its potential for populist success. This is claimed to be because younger democracies have less established political parties and weaker liberal democratic norms.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins, Kirk Andrew, 1969- editor.

==Mobilisation==

There are three forms of political mobilisation which populists have adopted: that of the populist leader, the populist political party, and the populist social movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=42–43|2a1=Gagnon|2a2=Beausoleil|2a3=Son|2a4=Arguelles|2y=2018|2p=vi}} The reasons why voters are attracted to populists differ, but common catalysts for the rise of populists include dramatic economic decline or a systematic corruption scandal that damages established political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} For instance, the [[Great Recession]] of 2007 and its impact on the economies of southern Europe was a catalyst for the rise of [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' corruption scandal of the early 1990s played a significant part in the rise of the Italian populist [[Silvio Berlusconi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} Another catalyst for the growth of populism is a widespread perception among voters that the political system is unresponsive to them.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=101}} This can arise when elected governments introduce policies that are unpopular with their voters but which are implemented because they are considered to be "responsible" or imposed by supranational organisations; in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many [[Member state of the European Union|countries in the European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic [[austerity]] measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101–102}} Decentralisation of political power is a very useful tool for populists to use to their benefit, this is because it allows them to speak more directly to the people which they seek to gain the attention and votes of.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sign In|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/populism-and-patronage-9780198807872?cc=ch&lang=en&|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref>

===Leaders===
{{See also|Demagogue}}
Populism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders,{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=268}} and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, "the quintessential form of populist mobilization".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with "the people",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of "the people" themselves,{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=43|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=197}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or "voice of the people".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=62|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=204}} Chavez for instance stated: "I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people."{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=202}} Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded "enemies of the people".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=7}}

The overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Perón]] was the wife of [[Juan Perón]], [[Marine Le Pen]] the daughter of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of [[Alberto Fujimori]], and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}

}}

Canovan noted that populists often used "colourful and undiplomatic language" to distinguish themselves from the governing elite.{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} In Africa, several populist leaders have distinguished themselves by speaking in indigenous languages rather than either French or English.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} Populist leaders often present themselves as men of action rather than men of words, talking of the need for "bold action" and "common sense solutions" to issues which they call "crises".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} Male populist leaders often express themselves using simple and sometimes vulgar language in an attempt to present themselves as "the common man" or "one of the boys" to add to their populist appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=64, 66}}

An example of this is [[Umberto Bossi]], the leader of the right-wing populist Italian [[Lega Nord]], who at rallies would state "the League has a hard-on" while [[The finger|putting his middle-finger]] up as a sign of disrespect to the government in Rome.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=66}} Another recurring feature of male populist leaders is the emphasis that they place on their own virility.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} An example of this is the Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who bragged about his [[bunga bunga]] sex parties and his ability to seduce young women.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} Among female populist leaders, it is more common for them to emphasise their role as a wife and mother.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}} The US right-wing populist [[Sarah Palin]] for instance referred to herself as a "hockey mom" and a "mama grizzly",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}} while Australian right-wing populist [[Pauline Hanson]] stated that "I care so passionately about this country, it's like I'm its mother. Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children."{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}}

Populist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the "elite". Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant "old boys' club",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=69–70}} while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=72–73|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Other populists have used clothing to set them apart.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] and members of his [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as [[Ross Perot]], Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=70–71}}
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that "in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=73–74}}

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that "true outsiders" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Chávez and Peru's Fujimori.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=74–75}} More common is that they are "insider-outsiders", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=75}} The Dutch right-wing populist [[Geert Wilders]] had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist [[Party for Freedom]],{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}} while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing [[African National Congress]] (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=111}} Only a few populist leaders are "insiders", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75–76}} One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party;{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75–76}} another is [[Rafael Correa]], who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}

Populist leaders are sometimes also characterised as [[strongman (politics)|strongmen]] or—in Latin American countries—as [[caudillo]]s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} In a number of cases, such as Argentina's Perón or Venezuela's Chávez, these leaders have military backgrounds which contribute to their strongman image.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}
Other populist leaders have also evoked the strongman image without having a military background; these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Mečiar, and Thailand's [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}
Populism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, "only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} Rather than being populists, many strongmen—such as Spain's Francisco Franco—were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}

In most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=43–44}} These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like [[Fortuynism]] in the Netherlands, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, [[Berlusconism]] in Italy and [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=42}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}} Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}}

In the 21st century, populists have increasingly used [[social media]] to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences.{{sfn|Stier|Posch|Bleier|Strohmaier|2017|p=1365}} It has been claimed that while traditional media, acting as so-called ‘gatekeepers’, filter the messages that they broadcast through journalistic norms, social media permits a ‘direct linkage’ from political actors to potential audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Engesser|first1=Sven|last2=Ernst|first2=Nicole|last3=Esser|first3=Frank|last4=Büchel|first4=Florin|date=8 July 2016|title=Populism and social media: how politicians spread a fragmented ideology|journal=Information, Communication & Society|volume=20|issue=8|pages=1109–1126|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2016.1207697|s2cid=147799675|issn=1369-118X}}</ref> It has been claimed that the use of [[Twitter]] helped Donald Trump win the US presidency,<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|last3=Confessore|first3=Nicholas|last4=Yourish|first4=Karen|last5=Buchanan|first5=Larry|last6=Collins|first6=Keith|date=2 November 2019|title=How Trump Reshaped the Presidency in Over 11,000 Tweets|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html|access-date=6 May 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=1 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501184836/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html|url-status=live}}</ref> while the same has been claimed regarding the use of [[YouTube]] by the [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Max|last2=Taub|first2=Amanda|date=11 August 2019|title=How YouTube Radicalized Brazil|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html|access-date=6 May 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=16 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516131617/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Presidential systems ====
Populist leaders have been claimed to be more successful in [[Presidential system|presidential systems.]] This is because such systems give advantage to charismatic populist leaders, especially when institutionalized parties are weak.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins, Kirk Andrew, 1969- editor.

===Political parties===

[[File:Acto de Posesion del Gobernador Arias Cardenas.jpg|thumb|right|A 2012 rally by members of the left-wing populist United Socialist Party of Venezuela in [[Maracaibo]]]]

Another form of mobilisation is through populist political parties.
Populists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of "the people", in power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54–55|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=10}} the elitist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a Marxist-Leninist group which governed [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54–55}} In other instances, such as the Austrian FPÖ and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=55}}

In some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's [[Justicialist Party]] after Juan Perón's death in 1974, or the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] after Chávez's death in 2013.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when [[Marine Le Pen]] replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=55–56}}

Many populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}

===Social movements===

[[File:Madrid - Acampada Sol 2011 43.JPG|"Hear the wrath of the people," a member of the Indignados, a Spanish left-wing populist movement, in [[Puerta del Sol]]|thumb|right|170px]]

An additional form is that of the populist social movement.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=10}} Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with "the people" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the [[Occupy movement]], which originated in the US and used the slogan "We are the 99%", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: "real democracy now – we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}

Few populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] ("Common Man Party").{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=56–57|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2pp=266–67}} These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the U.S. during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and [[Bernie Sanders]] as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=11}}

Some populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}} These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}}

==Other themes==

===Democracy===

Populism is a flexible term as it can be seen to exist in both democracies as well as authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sign In|url=https://www.academia.edu/31603803|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref> There have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only "true" form of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=79}} Populists often present themselves as "true democrats".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} It could be argued that populism is democratic as it allows voters to remove governments they don’t approve via the ballot box because voting is an essential value for a state to be considered a democracy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sign In|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001/oso-9780198837886|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref> Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were "inextricably linked",{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=10}} the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being "deeply connected with democracy",{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=2}} and March suggested that populism represented a "critique of democracy, not an alternative to it".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that "In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism."{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}}

Populism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=72|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=83, 84}} It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=72–73}} When some populists have taken power—most notably, Chávez in Venezuela—they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referendums.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93–94}} For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: [[René Cuperus]] of the [[Dutch Labour Party]] for instance called for [[social democracy]] to become "more 'populist' in a leftist way" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}

[[File:Referendum 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been cited as a populist leader who has undermined liberal democracy upon taking power{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}]]

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that "populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy," since populism is based on putting into effect "the will of the people". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90–81}} Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the "general will" of "the people".{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=73|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=81|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=493}} In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] described as the "[[tyranny of the majority]]".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}

Populists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating,{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=56}} and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances—such as Orban in Hungary—the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}} A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause [[democratic backsliding]] and attack individual rights than non-populists.<ref>Jordan Kyle, Yascha Mounk, [https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy "The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329150725/https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy |date=29 March 2019 }}, Institute for Global Change, 26 December 2018, accessed 29 March 2019</ref>

Even when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}

===Mainstream responses===
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who "claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented "them" as "evil" or "foolish", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, "the best way to deal with populism is to engage—as difficult as it is—in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters" in order to "better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In trying to win over populist supporters, and perhaps even some elites, liberal democrats should avoid both simplistic solutions that pander to "the people" and elitist discourses that dismiss the moral and intellectual competence of ordinary citizens – both will only strengthen the populists. Most importantly, given that populism often asks the right questions but provides the wrong answers, the ultimate goal should be not just the destruction of populist supply, but also the weakening of populist demand. Only the latter will actually strengthen liberal democracy.|source=Political scientists Mudde and Rovira Kaltwaasser{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}} }}

Mainstream politicians have sometimes sought to co-operate or build alliances with populists. In the United States, for example, various Republican Party figures aligned themselves with the Tea Party movement, while in countries such as Finland and Austria populist parties have taken part in governing coalitions.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}} In other instances, mainstream politicians have adopted elements of a populist political style while competing against populist opponents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=28 June 2017|title=Fighting fire with fire: Mainstream adoption of the populist political style in the 2014 Europe debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|issue=4|pages=715–734|doi=10.1177/1369148117715646|s2cid=149175911|issn=1369-1481|url=https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/fighting-fire-with-fire(3bd11a1b-816b-4442-8b26-e133dab177e0).html|access-date=19 September 2018|archive-date=25 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125074038/https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/fighting-fire-with-fire(3bd11a1b-816b-4442-8b26-e133dab177e0).html|url-status=live}}</ref> Various mainstream centrist figures, such as [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Tony Blair]], have argued that governments needed to restrict migration to hinder the appeal of right-wing populists utilising anti-immigrant sentiment in elections.<ref>{{cite news|last= Wintour|first= Patrick|date= 22 November 2018|title= Hillary Clinton: Europe Must Curb Immigration to Stop Rightwing Populists|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit|work= The Guardian|access-date= 25 November 2018|archive-date= 24 November 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181124214558/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Wintour|first= Patrick|date= 22 November 2018|title= Clinton, Blair, Renzi: Why we Lost, How to Fight Back|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/clinton-blair-renzi-why-we-lost-populists-how-fight-back-rightwing-populism-centrist|work= The Guardian|access-date= 28 November 2018|archive-date= 28 November 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181128072941/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/clinton-blair-renzi-why-we-lost-populists-how-fight-back-rightwing-populism-centrist|url-status= live}}</ref>

A more common approach has been for mainstream parties to openly attack the populists and construct a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (politics)|cordon sanitaire]]'' to prevent them from gaining political office {{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}} Once populists are in political office in liberal democracies, the judiciary can play a key role in blocking some of their more illiberal policies, as has been the case in Slovakia and Poland.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}} The mainstream media can play an important role in blocking populist growth; in a country like Germany, the mainstream media is for instant resolutely anti-populist, opposing populist groups whether left or right.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}}
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that there was an "odd love-hate relationship between populist media and politicians, sharing a discourse but not a struggle".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=115}} In certain countries, certain mainstream media outlets have supported populist groups; in Austria, the ''Kronen Zeitung'' played a prominent role in endorsing Haider, in the United Kingdom the ''[[Daily Express]]'' supported the [[UK Independence Party]], while in the United States, [[Fox News]] gave much positive coverage and encouragement to the Tea Party movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}} In some cases, when the populists have taken power, their political rivals have sought to violently overthrow them; this was seen in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], when mainstream groups worked with sectors of the military to unseat Hugo Chávez's government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}}

===Authoritarianism===
Scholars have argued that populist elements have sometimes appeared in [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] movements.<ref>Ferkiss 1957.</ref><ref>Dobratz and Shanks–Meile 1988</ref><ref>Berlet and Lyons, 2000</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Peter | last=Fritzsche |title=Rehearsals for fascism: populism and political mobilization in Weimar Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf5nAAAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195057805 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006022046/https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf5nAAAAMAAJ |archive-date=6 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Catherine | last=Fieschi |title=Fascism, Populism and the French Fifth Republic: In the Shadow of Democracy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWOyLUZfRT0C |year=2004 |publisher=Manchester UP |isbn=9780719062094 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084111/https://books.google.com/books?id=yWOyLUZfRT0C |archive-date=17 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Gino | last=Germani |title=Authoritarianism, Fascism, and National Populism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6CMlIY0e0C |year=1978 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=9781412817714 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084111/https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6CMlIY0e0C |archive-date=17 October 2015 }}</ref> The scholar Luke March argued that the populist [[Narodnik]] movement of late 19th-century Russia influenced the radical rejection on the constitutional limits of the state found in [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfn|March|2007|p=65}} Although the Marxist–Leninist movement often used populist rhetoric—in the 1960s, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] called itself the "party of the Soviet people"—in practice its emphasis on an elite vanguard is anti-populist in basis.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=65–66}}

The historian [[Roger Eatwell]] noted that although fascism and populism "differ notably ideologically", fascist politicians have "borrowed aspects of populist discourse and style".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=363}} Some fascists have for instance used the terms "people" and "nation" synonymously.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=369}} However, fascism generally distinguishes itself from populism by not recognising the democratic rights of the people or believing that they are capable of governing, instead maintaining that a vanguard should take charge.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=369}} According to Eatwell, "major ideological differences [...] lie at the core" of fascism and populism, the former being anti-democratic and latter being rooted in democracy, "albeit not liberal democracy".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=381}} The historian Peter Fritzsche nevertheless argued that populist movements active in [[Weimar Germany]] helped to facilitate the environment in which the fascist [[Nazi Party]] could rise to power.{{sfn|Fritzsche|1990|pp=149–150}} Fritzsche also noted that the Nazis utilised, "at least rhetorically", the "populist ideal of the people's community.{{sfn|Fritzsche|1990|pp=233–235}}

==History==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Although the term "populist" can be traced back to ''populares'' (courting the people) Senators in Ancient Rome, the first political movements emerged during the late nineteenth century. However, some of the movements that have been portrayed as progenitors of modern populism did not develop a truly populist ideology. It was only with the coming of Boulangism in France and the American People's Party, which was also known as the Populist Party, that the foundational forms of populism can fully be discerned. In particular, it was during this era that terms such as "people" and "popular sovereignty" became a major part of the vocabulary of insurgent political movements that courted mass support among an expanding electorate by claiming that they uniquely embodied their interests[.]|source=Political historian Roger Eatwell{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=365–366}}}}

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argue that populism is a modern phenomenon.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=21}} Eatwell noted that although the actual term ''populism'' parallels that of the ''[[Populares]]'' who were active in the [[Roman Republic]], these and other pre-modern groups "did not develop a truly populist ideology."{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=365}} The origins of populism are often traced to the late nineteenth century, when movements calling themselves ''populist'' arose in both the United States and the Russian Empire.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1y=2017|1p=365|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=21}} Populism has often been linked to the spread of [[democracy]], both as an idea and as a framework for governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=21}}

Conversely, the historian [[Barry S. Strauss]] argued that populism could also be seen in the ancient world, citing the examples of the fifth-century B.C. Athens and [[Populares]], a political faction active in the [[Roman Republic]] from the second century BCE.<ref>{{cite news |title=Historian offers lessons from antiquity for today's democracy |last=Glaser |first=Linda B. |date=1 January 2017 |website=Cornell University Department of History |url=https://history.cornell.edu/news/historian-offers-lessons-antiquity-today%25E2%2580%2599s-democracy |access-date=26 April 2019 |archive-date=25 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425150407/https://history.cornell.edu/news/historian-offers-lessons-antiquity-today%2525E2%252580%252599s-democracy |url-status=live }}</ref> The historian Rachel Foxley argued that the [[Levellers]] of 17th-century England could also be labelled "populists", meaning that they believed "equal natural rights [...] must shape political life"{{sfn|Foxley|2013|p=207}}{{clarify|date=June 2019}} while the historian Peter Blickle linked populism to the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Andrew Pettegree |title= The Reformation: Critical Concepts in Historical Studies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HDC_veJaoQ8C&pg=PA153 |year= 2004 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |page= 153 |isbn= 978-0-4153-1668-2 |access-date= 15 June 2018 |archive-date= 28 August 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190828224336/https://books.google.com/books?id=HDC_veJaoQ8C&pg=PA153 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Carter Lindberg|title=The European Reformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cTb-zKfjS8C&pg=PA21|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=21|isbn=9781444360868|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-date=28 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828224339/https://books.google.com/books?id=4cTb-zKfjS8C&pg=PA21|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{main|Populism in Europe}}

====19th and 20th centuries====

In the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the ''[[narodnichestvo]]'' movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}} The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals "going to the people", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} According to Eatwell, the narodniks "are often seen as the first populist movement".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}}

[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]

In German-speaking Europe, the [[völkisch movement]] has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} In France, the [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|Boulangist movement]] also utilised populist rhetoric and themes.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=366–367}} In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}

In the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33–34}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=548|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=66}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became "a relevant political force in Europe", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}

Following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of "the people" against the "elite", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan "Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a "real" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} The collapse of Marxism-Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the [[Dutch Socialist Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and German's [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party.{{sfn|March|2007|p=67}} Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of [[José María Ruiz Mateos]], [[Jesús Gil]] and [[Mario Conde]], businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ultrapatriotas.

====21st century====

[[File:Jean Marie LePen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], founder and leader of the [[French National Front]], the "prototypical radical right party" which used populism to advance its cause.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=34–35}}]]

At the turn of the 21st century, populist rhetoric and movements became increasingly apparent in Western Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=550|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=2}} Populist rhetoric was often used by opposition parties. For example, in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the 2001 electoral campaign]], the Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] accused [[Tony Blair]]'s governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of representing "the condescending liberal elite". Hague repeatedly referring to it as "metropolitan", implying that it was out of touch with "the people", who in Conservative discourse are represented by "Middle England".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.{{sfn|Bang|Marsh|2018|p=354}}

By the 21st century, European populism<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Zienkowski|first1=Jan|title=Imagining the peoples of Europe. Populist discourses across the political spectrum|last2=Breeze|first2=Ruth|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2019|isbn=9789027203489|location=Amsterdam}}</ref> was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like Jörg Haider's FPÖ in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}<ref>See: Breeze, R. 2019.

In North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with [[agrarianism]] and often known as "prairie populism".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} For these groups, "the people" were yeomen—small, independent farmers —while the "elite" were the bankers and politicians of the northeast.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} In some cases, populist activists called for alliances with labor (the first national platform of the National People's Party in 1892 calling for protecting the rights of "urban workmen".{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=90}} In the state of Georgia in the early 1890s, [[Thomas E. Watson]] (later the Populist candidate for Vice-President) led a major effort to unite white and African-American farmers.{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=118}}{{sfn|Woodward|1938}}

The [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] of the late 19th century United States is considered to be "one of the defining populist movements";{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} its members were often referred to as the Populists at the time.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referendums.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=17}} The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge. In the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]], the People's Party supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]; after his defeat, the People's Party's support declined.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1pp=17–18, 44–46|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=23}} Other early populist political parties in the United States included the [[United States Greenback Party|Greenback Party]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party of 1912]] led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party of 1924]] led by [[Robert M.

By the mid-20th century, US populism had moved from a largely [[progressivism|progressive]] to a largely [[reactionary]] stance, being closely intertwined with the [[anti-communist]] politics of the period.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=24}} In this period, the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] and sociologist [[Daniel Bell]] compared the anti-elitism of the 1890s Populists with that of [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref name="mkazin1">{{cite web |last1=Kazin |first1=Michael |title=How Can Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Both Be 'Populist'? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |access-date=13 July 2016 |website=The New York Times |date=22 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209061534/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |archive-date=9 February 2017 }}</ref> Although not all academics accepted the comparison between the left-wing, anti-[[big business]] Populists and the right-wing, anti-communist McCarthyites, the term "populist" nonetheless came to be applied to both left-wing and right-wing groups that blamed elites for the problems facing the country.<ref name="mkazin1"/> Some mainstream politicians in the Republican Party recognised the utility of such a tactic and adopted it; Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] for instance popularised the term "[[silent majority]]" when appealing to voters.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=24}} Right-wing populist rhetoric was also at the base of two of the most successful third-party presidential campaigns in the late 20th century, that of [[George C.

In the first decade of the 21st century, two populist movements appeared in the US, both in response to the [[Great Recession]]: the [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Tea Party movement]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=26}} The populist approach of the Occupy movement was broader, with its "people" being what it called "[[We are the 99%|the 99%]]", while the "elite" it challenged was presented as both the economic and political elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26–27}} The Tea Party's populism was [[producerist|Producerism]], while "the elite" it presented was more party partisan than that of Occupy, being defined largely—although not exclusively—as the Democratic administration of President [[Barack Obama]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26–27}}
The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kazin |first1=Michael |title=How Can Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Both Be 'Populist'? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |access-date=25 May 2016 |date=22 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209061534/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |archive-date=9 February 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> Both campaigns criticised free trade deals such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Litvan |first1=Laura |title=Trump and Sanders Shift Mood in Congress Against Trade Deals |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-17/trump-and-sanders-shift-mood-in-congress-against-trade-deals |access-date=25 May 2016 |agency=Bloomberg |date=17 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521215110/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-17/trump-and-sanders-shift-mood-in-congress-against-trade-deals |archive-date=21 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Brodwin |first1=David |title=Nobody Wins a Trade War |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-14/the-economic-danger-of-trumps-and-sanders-trade-proctectionism |access-date=25 May 2016 |website=U.S. News & World Report |date=14 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513050239/http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-14/the-economic-danger-of-trumps-and-sanders-trade-proctectionism |archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fontaine |first1=Richard |last2=Kaplan |first2=Robert D. |title=How Populism Will Change Foreign Policy |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-05-23/how-populism-will-change-foreign-policy |access-date=25 May 2016 |website=Foreign Affairs |date=23 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524105923/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-05-23/how-populism-will-change-foreign-policy |archive-date=24 May 2016 }}</ref>

=== Latin America ===
{{Main|Populism in Latin America}}
[[File:2019 Encontro Bilateral com o Presidente dos EUA.jpg|thumb|Brazilian President [[Jair Bolsonaro]], sometimes called a "Tropical Trump", with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]]]
Populism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s,{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}} being far more prevalent here than in Europe.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's "most enduring and prevalent populist tradition".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27–28}} March instead thought that it was the important role of "catch-all parties and prominent personalities" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}}

The first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising "the people": these included [[Getúlio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Perón]] in Argentina, and [[José María Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=28–29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=196}} These relied on the ''[[Americanismo]]'' ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from [[imperialism|imperialist]] powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} The second wave took place in the early 1990s;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} de la Torre called it "neoliberal populism".{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=198}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), stabilizing the economy and ending hyperinflation.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=29–30|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=199}} Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}}

The third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} It overlapped in part with the [[pink tide]] of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=31|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty "back to the people", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=32|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=200}} In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=201}}

{{Further|Populism in New Zealand}}

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

In much of Africa, populism has been a rare phenomenon.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} The political scientist Danielle Resnick argued that populism first became apparent in Africa during the 1980s, when a series of coups brought military leaders to power in various countries.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=102}} In Ghana, for example, [[Jerry Rawlings]] took control, professing that he would involve "the people" in "the decision-making process", something he claimed had previously been denied to them.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=102}} A similar process took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso under the military leader [[Thomas Sankara]], who professed to "take power out of the hands of our national
bourgeoisie and their imperialist allies and put it in the hands of the people".{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=103}} Such military leaders claimed to represent "the voice of the people", utilised an anti-establishment discourse, and established participatory organisations through which to maintain links with the broader population.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=103–104}}

In the 21st century, with the establishment of multi-party democratic systems in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, new populist politicians have appeared. These have included Kenya's [[Raila Odinga]], Senegal's [[Abdoulaye Wade]], South Africa's [[Julius Malema]], and Zambia's [[Michael Sata]].{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=106}} These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=106–107}}

===Asia and the Arab world===

[[File:President Rodrigo Roa Duterte poses for a photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the start of the bilateral meeting at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] of [[Philippines]] and [[Narendra Modi]] of [[India]]. They are both considered populist leaders]]

In North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=39–40}} Although the [[Arab Spring]] was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=40}}

In southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38–39}}
In India, the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=484}} Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=485}}

===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===
In the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the "New Populism".{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} The UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=260}} By 2016, "populism" was regularly used by political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}}

A 2017 review of votes for populistic parties in all developed countries discovered them spiking in 2015 and reaching highest levels since WWII. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Populism: The Phenomenon|url=https://www.economicprinciples.org/downloads/bw-populism-the-phenomenon.pdf}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The rise of populism in Western Europe is, in large part, a reaction to the failure of traditional parties to respond adequately in the eyes of the electorate to a series of phenomena such as [[economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalisation]], the speed and direction of [[European integration]], immigration, the decline of ideologies and class politics, exposure of elite corruption, etc. It is also the product of a much-cited, but rarely defined, "political malaise", manifested in steadily falling [[voter turnout]] across Western Europe, declining [[political party]] membership, and ever-greater numbers of citizens in surveys citing a lack of interest and distrust in politics and politicians.|source=Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=1}} }}

Mudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103–104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the "[[high culture]]" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}

Mudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, "More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better."{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}

Another factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555–56}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}

Peter Wilkins argued that "The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements."<ref>Wilkins, Peter (2018) [http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 "Rip It Up and Start Again: The Challenge of Populism in the 21st Century"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607063959/http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 |date=7 June 2019 }} in ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]''. v.24, no.22, p.317</ref> Pippa Norris and Ronald F. Inglehart examine two theories on the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in [[post-industrial economy|post-industrial economies]]. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking stronger authoritarian populist leaders such as [[Donald Trump]] and [[Nigel Farage]].  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.{{sfn|Inglehart|Norris|2016|p=1-2|pp=29-30|loc=Bibliography}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 |title=Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash |access-date=1 January 2020 |archive-date=26 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226191559/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 |url-status=live }}</ref>
