{{History of Poland}}

The '''history of Jews in Poland''' dates back at least 1,000 years. For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], because of the long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended after the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the [[German occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945, called the [[Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and the opening of [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].

From the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 until the early years of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], Poland was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name="Hugh"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for "[[Paradise]] of the Jews").<ref name="Engel2009">Engel, David.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name="Hagen-1"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The Polish state also supported Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Haganah]], [[Betar]], and [[Irgun]], providing them with weapons and training.<ref>"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the [[League of Nations]] as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]].11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organising and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Jewish members of the [[Sejm]] who protested against the heightened [[antisemitism]] in Poland took pains to thank Beck for furthering the cause of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine."

Patterson]], ''Between Hitler and Stalin: The Quick Life and Secret Death of [[Edward Smigły]]'', p. 101.</ref>

In 1939 at the start of [[World War II]], Poland was partitioned between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]). One-fifth of the Polish population perished during World War II; the 3,000,000 Polish Jews murdered in [[The Holocaust]], who constituted 90% of Polish Jewry, made up half of all Poles killed during the war.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Hidden Jews of Poland | website=Shavei Israel | date=22 November 2015 | url=https://shavei.org/communities/hidden-jews-poland/ | access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="YV-archive1"/> Although the Holocaust occurred largely in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German-occupied Poland]], there was little collaboration with the Nazis by its citizens.

In the summer of 965 or 966, Jacob made a trade and diplomatic journey from his native [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in Muslim Spain to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and then to the Slavic countries.<ref name=polishjews.org>{{cite web |title = The Polish Jews Heritage – Genealogy Research Photos Translation |website = polishjews.org |date = 2009 |url = http://polishjews.org/history1.htm |accessdate = 30 September 2015}}</ref> The first actual mention of Jews in Polish chronicles occurs in the 11th century, where it appears that Jews then lived in [[Gniezno]], at that time the capital of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish kingdom]] of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Among the first Jews to arrive in Poland in 1097 or 1098 were those banished from [[Prague]].<ref name=polishjews.org/> The first permanent Jewish community is mentioned in 1085 by a Jewish scholar [[Yehuda ben Meir|Jehuda ha-Kohen]] in the city of [[Przemyśl]].<ref name="PMH-1"/>

As elsewhere in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the principal activity of Jews in [[medieval Poland]] was commerce and trade, including the export and import of goods such as cloth, linen, furs, hides, wax, metal objects, and slaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2 July 2018}}</ref>
[[File:PolishHebrewCoins1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early-medieval Polish coins with Hebrew inscriptions]]

The first extensive Jewish migration from [[Western Europe]] to Poland occurred at the time of the [[First Crusade]] in 1098. Under [[Boleslaus III of Poland|Bolesław III]] (1102–1139), Jews, encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler, settled throughout Poland, including over the border in [[Lithuania]]n territory as far as [[Kiev]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Friedman |first = Jonathan C |title = Routledge History of the Holocaust |chapter = Jewish Communities of Europe on the Eve of World War II |orig-year = 2011 |year = 2012 |publisher = Routledge |location = Abingdon; New York |isbn = 978-0-415-52087-4 |page = 9}}</ref> Bolesław III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the [[commerce|commercial interests]] of his country. Jews came to form the backbone of the Polish economy. [[Mieszko III of Poland|Mieszko III]] employed Jews in his mint as engravers and technical supervisors, and the [[Bracteates|coins]] minted during that period even bear [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebraic markings]].<ref name=polishjews.org/> Jews worked on commission for the mints of other contemporary Polish princes, including [[Casimir the Just]], [[Bolesław I the Tall]] and [[Władysław III Spindleshanks]].<ref name=polishjews.org/> Jews enjoyed undisturbed peace and prosperity in the many principalities into which the country was then divided; they formed the middle class in a country where the general population consisted of [[landlord]]s (developing into ''[[szlachta]]'', the unique Polish nobility) and peasants, and they were instrumental in promoting the commercial interests of the land.

Another factor for the Jews to emigrate to Poland were the [[Magdeburg rights]] (or Magdeburg Law), a charter given to Jews, among others, that specifically outlined the rights and privileges that Jews had in Poland. For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities to pick up and move to Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://henryabramson.com/2013/12/05/origins-of-polish-jewry-this-week-in-jewish-history/|title=Origins of Polish Jewry (This Week in Jewish History)|date=5 December 2013|website=Henry Abramson}}</ref>

The first mention of Jewish settlers in [[Płock]] dates from 1237, in Kalisz from 1287 and a Żydowska (Jewish) street in Kraków in 1304.<ref name=polishjews.org/>

The tolerant situation was gradually altered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the one hand, and by the neighboring German states on the other.<ref name="Dubnow-1"/> There were, however, among the reigning princes some determined protectors of the Jewish inhabitants, who considered the presence of the latter most desirable as far as the economic development of the country was concerned. Prominent among such rulers was [[Bolesław the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties (commonly called the [[Statute of Kalisz]]), which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wrocław in 1273–90, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 – 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wrocław in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Statute of Kalisz tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: “Accusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited. If despite this a Jew should be accused of murdering a Christian child, such charge must be sustained by testimony of three Christians and three Jews.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/poland|title=The Jews of Poland|website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project, The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>

During the next hundred years, the Church pushed for the persecution of Jews while the rulers of Poland usually protected them.<ref name="Dubnow-2"/> The Councils of Wrocław (1267), Buda (1279), and Łęczyca (1285) each segregated Jews, ordered them to wear a special emblem, banned them from holding offices where Christians would be subordinated to them, and forbade them from building more than one prayer house in each town. However, those church decrees required the cooperation of the Polish princes for enforcement, which was generally not forthcoming, due to the profits which the Jews' economic activity yielded to the princes.<ref name=polishjews.org/>
[[File:Wojciech Gerson, Przyjęcie Żydów.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Casimir the Great]] and the Jews'', by [[Wojciech Gerson]], 1874]]
In 1332, King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]] (1303–1370) amplified and expanded Bolesław's old charter with the [[Wiślicki Statute]]. Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Kraków (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name="opoczno-1"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries "King of the [[serf]]s and Jews." Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir’s reign Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]]. In 1348, the first [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in [[Poznań]] (Posen).<ref name="Poznan-1"/><!-- 2008 {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited out --> Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in [[Western Europe]], however, Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the Jewish masses of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.

===The early Jagiellon era: 1385–1505===
{{main|History of Poland (1385–1569)}}
As a result of the marriage of [[Jogaila|Wladislaus II]] (Jagiełło) to [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary]], Lithuania was [[Polish–Lithuanian Union|united with the kingdom of Poland]]. In {{nowrap|1388–1389}}, broad privileges were extended to [[Lithuanian Jews]] including freedom of religion and commerce on equal terms with the Christians.<ref name="Dubnow-3"/> Under the rule of Wladislaus II, Polish Jews had increased in numbers and attained prosperity. However, religious persecution gradually increased, as the dogmatic clergy pushed for less official tolerance, pressured by the [[Jan Hus#Council of Constance|Synod of Constance]]. In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Poznań in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Kraków]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name="Dubnow-3"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Kraków and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Kraków in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>
[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]

In 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wrocław]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Kraków and several other cities, to lesser effect. 

The decline in the status of the Jews was briefly checked by [[Casimir IV the Jagiellonian]] (1447–1492), but soon the nobility forced him to issue the [[Statute of Nieszawa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228175637/http://www.bartleby.com/67/556.html|url-status=dead|title=Homework Help and Textbook Solutions &#124; bartleby|archive-date=28 February 2008|website=www.bartleby.com}}</ref> which, among other things, abolished the ancient privileges of the Jews "as contrary to divine right and the law of the land." Nevertheless, the king continued to offer his protection to the Jews. Two years later Casimir issued another document announcing that he could not deprive the Jews of his benevolence on the basis of "the principle of tolerance which in conformity with God's laws obliged him to protect them".<ref name="bdw50"/> The policy of the government toward the Jews of Poland oscillated under Casimir's sons and successors, [[John I Albert]] (1492–1501) and [[Alexander the Jagiellonian]] (1501–1506). In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Kraków and allowed to settle in the "Jewish town" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander, when he was the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], followed the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]] and banished Jews from Lithuania. For several years they took shelter in Poland until he reversed his decision eight years later in 1503 after becoming King of Poland and allowed them back to Lithuania.<ref name=polishjews.org/> The next year he issued a proclamation in which he stated that a policy of tolerance befitted "kings and rulers".<ref name=bdw50/>

===Center of the Jewish world: 1505–1572===
[[File:Zugmunt August crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sigismund II Augustus]] followed his [[Sigismund I the Old|father]]'s tolerant policy and also granted autonomy to the Jews.]]
Poland became more tolerant just as the [[Alhambra Decree|Jews were expelled from Spain]] in 1492, as well as from [[Jews in Austria|Austria]], [[Hungarian Jews|Hungary]] and [[Jews in Germany|Germany]], thus stimulating Jewish immigration to the much more accessible Poland. Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.

The most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506–1548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548–1572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a "heaven for the Jews". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name="relations"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.

[[Moses Isserles]] (1520–1572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Kraków]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. The [[Remuh Synagogue]] was built for him in 1557. ''Rema'' (רמ״א) is the Hebrew acronym for his name.<ref name="Remuh">{{cite web|url=http://www.cracow-life.com/guide/Krakow_Kazimierz/Remuh_Synagogue.php|title=Remuh Synagogue.

After the childless death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], Polish and Lithuanian nobles ([[szlachta]]) gathered at [[Warsaw]] in 1573 and signed a document in which representatives of all major religions pledged mutual support and tolerance. The following eight or nine decades of material prosperity and relative security experienced by Polish Jews – wrote Professor [[Gershon Hundert]] – witnessed the appearance of "a virtual galaxy of sparkling intellectual figures." Jewish academies were established in Lublin, Kraków, Brześć (Brisk), Lwów, Ostróg and other towns.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=11}} Poland-Lithuania was the only country in Europe where the Jews cultivated their own farmer's fields.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=19}}

===Decline===
In 1648, the multi-ethnic Commonwealth was devastated by several conflicts, in which the country lost over a third of its population (over three million people). The Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these large-scale atrocities was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], in which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s Ukrainian [[Cossack]]s massacred tens of thousands of Jews and Catholic Poles in the eastern and southern areas of Polish-occupied Ukraine.<ref>Herman Rosenthal, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&letter=C "Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' 1901.</ref> The precise number of dead is not known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during this period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and ''[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|jasyr]]'' (captivity in the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility and landlords. The Jews, perceived as allies of the Poles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.

Ruled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Kraków and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Kraków (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered. The Polish general [[Stefan Czarniecki]] defeated the Swedes in 1660.

As soon as the disturbances had ceased, the Jews began to return and to rebuild their destroyed homes; and while it is true that the Jewish population of Poland had decreased, it still was more numerous than that of the Jewish colonies in Western Europe. Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population — approximately three million of its citizens.

The environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51–52}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. "Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant." Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51–52}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The worldwide Jewish population at that time was estimated at 1.2 million.

In 1768, the [[Koliyivshchyna]] rebellion west of the [[Dnieper]] river in [[Volhynia]] led to ferocious murders of Polish noblemen, Catholic priests and thousands of Jews by the Ukrainian [[Haidamaka]] Cossacks.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=17–18}} Four years later, in 1772, the military [[Partitions of Poland]] had begun between Russia, Prussia and Austria.<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/timeline_jewish_life_in_poland_from_1098_20070608/ "Timeline: Jewish life in Poland from 1098"], Jewish Journal, 7 June 2007.</ref>

==The development of Judaism in Poland and the Commonwealth==
The culture and intellectual output of the Jewish community in Poland had a profound impact on Judaism as a whole. Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as "good omens" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' ("here"), ''lan'' ("dwells"), ''ya'' ("[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' ("here") ''lin'' ("[you should] dwell"). The "message" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu’el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where "most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], "Divre ̄ David Ture ̄ Zahav" (1689) in Hebrew.

===Jewish learning===
[[File:Synagoga Zamość VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamość Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamość]], Poland, 1610–20]]
''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Kraków, Poznań, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Kraków; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.

In the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' ("sharp reasoning"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500–1558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520–1572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the "Code of Jewish Law"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510–1573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].

===The rise of Hasidism===
[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]
{{main|Hasidic Judaism in Poland}}
The decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648–1658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false "Messianic" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].

In this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698–1760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.

==The Partitions of Poland==
[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]
In 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764. His election was bought by [[Catherine the Great]] for 2.5 million rubles, with the Russian army stationing only {{convert|3|mi|km|0|order=flip}} away from Warsaw.<ref name="Szyndler-64">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KpBxHzAB1gC&pg=PA64 |title=Racławice 1794 |publisher=Bellona |year=2009 |accessdate=26 September 2014 |author=Bartłomiej Szyndler |pages=64–65 |isbn=9788311116061}}</ref> Eight years later, triggered by the [[Confederation of Bar]] against Russian influence and the pro-Russian king, the outlying provinces of Poland were overrun from all sides by different military forces and divided for the first time by the three neighboring empires, Russia, [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]].<ref name="Szyndler-64"/> The Commonwealth lost 30% of its land during the [[First Partition of Poland|annexations of 1772]], and even more of its peoples.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=18}} Jews were most numerous in the territories that fell under the military control of Austria and Russia.

The permanent council established at the instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of a plan that would make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.
[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764–1809)]]
A second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815–1831).

Under foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence. However, most Polonized Jews supported the revolutionary activities of Polish patriots and participated in national uprisings.<ref name="OB">Olaf Bergmann (2015), ''Narodowa demokracja wobec problematyki żydowskiej w latach 1918–1929'', Poznań: Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, page 16. {{ISBN|978-83-7976-222-4}}.</ref> Polish Jews took part in the November Insurrection of 1830–1831, the January Insurrection of 1863, as well as in the revolutionary movement of 1905.

Official Russian policy would eventually prove to be substantially harsher to the Jews than that under independent Polish rule. The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.

Tsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] issued a "Statute Concerning Jews",<ref name="Alexander_I">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&q=%22Alexander+issued+a%22+%22Statute+Concerning+Jews%22&pg=PA11 |title= The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar |publisher=Devora Publishing |year=2003 |accessdate=11 March 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |page=11 |isbn=1-930143-85-0}}</ref> meant to accelerate the process of assimilation of the Empire's new Jewish population. The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name="Alexander_I"/>

During the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as "[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name="Nicholas_I"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas – while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service – made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 "souls" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion. Thus between 1827 and 1857 over 30,000 children were placed in the so-called [[Cantonist]] schools, where they were pressured to convert.<ref>{{cite book |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NoMdyNVtBYC |title=Jews in the Russian Army, 1827–1917: Drafted Into Modernity |author=Ĭokhanan Petrovskiĭ-Shtern |publisher=Cambridge University Press |via=Books.google.com |accessdate=26 March 2013|isbn = 9780521515733}}</ref> "Many children were smuggled to Poland, where the conscription of Jews did not take effect until 1844."<ref name="Nicholas_I">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&q=%22Tsar+Nicholas+enacted+hundreds+of+anti-Jewish+measures.%22&pg=PA13 |title=''The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar'' |year=2003 |accessdate=11 March 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |pages=12–15|isbn=9781930143852 }}</ref>

===Pale of Settlement===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Map showing the percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1905).jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pale of Settlement]], showing Jewish population densities]]
The ''[[Pale of Settlement]]'' ({{lang-ru|Черта́ осе́длости}}, {{transl|ru|chertá osédlosti}}, {{lang-yi|תּחום-המושבֿ}}, {{transl|yi|tkhum-ha-moyshəv}}, {{lang-he|תְּחוּם הַמּוֹשָב}}, {{transl|he|tḥùm ha-mosháv}}) was the term given to a region of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in which permanent residency by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] was allowed and beyond which Jewish permanent residency was generally prohibited.  It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].
The archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.

With its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].

From 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.

Although the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 – an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.

===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===
[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Białystok pogrom]]]]
The assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|погро́м}};) throughout 1881–1884. In the 1881 outbreak, pogroms were primarily limited to Russia, although in a riot in Warsaw two Jews were killed, 24 others were wounded, women were raped and over two million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] worth of property was destroyed.<ref>Brian Porter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_g0ldP92ucC&pg=PA162 When Nationalism Began to Hate: Imagining Modern Politics in Nineteenth-Century Poland]'', Oxford University Press (2000), p. 162.</ref><ref>[[Simon Dubnow]], ''History of the Jews in Russia and Poland'', Varda Books (2001 reprint), Vol. 2, p. 282.</ref> The new czar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], blamed the Jews for the riots and issued a series of harsh restrictions on Jewish movements. Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. The pogroms prompted a great wave of Jewish emigration to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russia/Russian_Empire|title=Russian Empire|last=Stanislawski|first=Michael|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}</ref>

An even bloodier wave of pogroms broke out from 1903 to 1906, at least some of them believed to have been organized by the Tsarist Russian secret police, the ''[[Okhrana]]''. They included the [[Białystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded. According to Jewish survivors, ethnic Poles did not participate in the pogrom and instead sheltered Jewish families.<ref name="Bender16">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSkendQVMbcC&q=%22Poles+refused+to+participate%22+%22they+had+actually+sheltered+Jews%22 |title=Introduction: "Bialystock-upon-Tiktin" |publisher=UPNE |work=The Jews of Białystok During World War II and the Holocaust |date=2008 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |author=Sara Bender |page=16 |isbn=978-1584657293}}</ref>

===Haskalah and Halakha===
{{main|Haskalah}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The Jewish Enlightenment, ''[[Haskalah]]'', began to take hold in Poland during the 19th century, stressing secular ideas and values. Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] ("rabbis's law") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.

===Politics in Polish territory===
[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]
By the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.

Many Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Kościuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830–31), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.

During the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.

In addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.

In 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

In the aftermath of the Great War localized conflicts engulfed Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1919. Many attacks were launched against Jews during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] ending with the [[Treaty of Riga]].

The number of Jews immigrating to Poland from Ukraine and Soviet Russia during the interwar period grew rapidly. Jewish population in the area of former [[Congress of Poland]] increased sevenfold between 1816 and 1921, from around 213,000 to roughly 1,500,000.<ref>Gershon David Hundert.

The average rate of permanent settlement was about 30,000 per annum. At the same time, every year around 100,000 Jews were passing through Poland in unofficial emigration overseas.

===Jewish and Polish culture===
{{main|Jewish culture|Polish culture}}
[[File:Wielka Synagoga w Warszawie.JPG|thumb|[[Great Synagogue (Warsaw)|Warsaw Great Synagogue]]]]
The newly independent [[Second Polish Republic]] had a large and vibrant Jewish minority. By the time [[World War II]] began, Poland had the largest concentration of Jews in Europe although many Polish Jews had a separate culture and ethnic identity from Catholic Poles. Some authors have stated that only about 10% of Polish Jews during the interwar period could be considered "assimilated" while more than 80% could be readily recognized as Jews.<ref>Nechama Tec, "When Light Pierced the Darkness: Christian Rescue of Jews in Nazi-Occupied Poland", Oxford University Press US, 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kg0L3L0kImUC&pg=PA12 p. 12]</ref>

According to the [[Polish census of 1931|1931 National Census]] there were 3,130,581 Polish Jews measured by the declaration of their religion. Estimating the population increase and the emigration from Poland between 1931 and 1939, there were probably 3,474,000 Jews in Poland as of 1 September 1939 (approximately 10% of the total population) primarily centered in large and smaller cities: 77% lived in cities and 23% in the villages. They made up about 50%, and in some cases even 70% of the population of smaller towns, especially in Eastern Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.kalisz.pl/Statut/JewsWar2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006072443/http://www.info.kalisz.pl/statut/jewswar2.htm|url-status=dead|title=Jews in Poland – Polish Jews in World War II|archive-date=6 October 2008}}</ref> Prior to World War II, the Jewish population of [[Łódź]] numbered about 233,000, roughly one-third of the city’s population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/lodz-poland-jewish-history-tour|title=Lodz, Poland Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref> The city of [[Lwów]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) had the third largest Jewish population in Poland, numbering 110,000 in 1939 (42%).

Only New York City had more Jewish residents than Warsaw.

The major industries in which Polish Jews were employed were manufacturing and commerce. In many areas of the country, the majority of retail businesses were owned by Jews, who were sometimes among the wealthiest members of their communities.<ref>[[Peter D. Stachura]], ''Poland, 1918–1945: An Interpretive and Documentary History of the Second Republic'', Routledge (2004), p. 84.</ref>
Many Jews also worked as shoemakers and tailors, as well as in the liberal professions; doctors (56% of all doctors in Poland), teachers (43%), journalists (22%) and lawyers (33%).<ref>Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski, ''Jews in Poland: A Documentary History'', Hippocrene Books (1993), pp. 27–28.</ref>

Jewish youth and religious groups, diverse political parties and Zionist organizations, newspapers and theatre flourished. Jews owned land and real estate, participated in retail and manufacturing and in the export industry. Their religious beliefs spanned the range from Orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism]] to [[Reform Judaism|Liberal Judaism]].

The Polish language, rather than [[Yiddish]], was increasingly used by the young Warsaw Jews who did not have a problem in identifying themselves fully as Jews, Varsovians and Poles. Jews such as [[Bruno Schulz]] were entering the mainstream of Polish society, though many thought of themselves as a separate nationality within Poland. Most children were enrolled in Jewish religious schools, which used to limit their ability to speak Polish. As a result, according to the 1931 census, 79% of the Jews declared Yiddish as their first language, and only 12% listed Polish, with the remaining 9% being Hebrew.<ref name="GUS1931">{{cite book |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a22_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |title=Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludności z dn. 9.XII.1931 r.

Jewish political parties, both the [[Socialist]] [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), as well as parties of the Zionist right and left wing and religious conservative movements, were represented in the ''[[Sejm]]'' (the Polish Parliament) as well as in the regional councils.<ref>Yad Vashem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013543/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=7694&lang=EN&type_id=&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F7694.JPG The Bund Council in August 1937, Warsaw, Poland.] Film and Photo Archive.</ref>
[[File:Isaac Bashevis Singer (upright).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (Polish: Izaak Zynger), achieved international acclaim as a classic Jewish writer and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978]]

The Jewish cultural scene <ref>Aleksander Hertz, Lucjan Dobroszycki [https://books.google.com/books?id=APRYwrQWy-AC&dq=jews+in+polish+culture&printsec=frontcover The Jews in Polish culture], Northwestern University Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-8101-0758-9}}</ref> was particularly vibrant in pre–World War II Poland, with numerous Jewish publications and more than one hundred periodicals. Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Bolesław Leśmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Białostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.

Many Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Michał Waszyński]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').

[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]

Scientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term "[[genocide]]" was coined by [[Rafał Lemkin]] (1900–1959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].

There also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Kraków]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[Józef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]]. Another athlete, [[Alojzy Ehrlich]], won several medals in the table-tennis tournaments. Many of these clubs belonged to the [[Maccabi World Union]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Between antisemitism and support for Zionism and Jewish state in Palestine===
An ever-increasing proportion of Jews in [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] lived separate lives from the Polish majority. In 1921, 74.2% of Polish Jews listed [[Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their native language; the number rose to 87% by 1931,<ref name="GUS1931"/> contributing to growing tensions between Jews and Poles.<ref>Ilya Prizel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fE2quB852jcC&pg=PA65 ''National identity and foreign policy''], Cambridge University Press 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-57697-0}} p. 65.</ref> Jews were often not identified as Polish nationals, a problem caused not only by the reversal of assimilation shown in national censuses between 1921 and 1931, but also by the influx of Russian Jews escaping persecution{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}—especially in Ukraine, where up to 2,000 pogroms took place during the Civil War, an estimated 30,000 Jews were massacred directly, and a total of 150,000 died.<ref>Sharman Kadish, Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain, and the Russian Revolution.

Matters improved for a time under the rule of [[Józef Piłsudski]] (1926–1935).

With the influence of the ''Endecja'' ([[National Democracy]]) party growing, antisemitism gathered new momentum in Poland and was most felt in smaller towns and in spheres in which Jews came into direct contact with Poles, such as in Polish schools or on the sports field. Further academic harassment, such as the introduction of [[ghetto benches]], which forced Jewish students to sit in sections of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them, anti-Jewish riots, and semi-official or unofficial quotas (''[[Numerus clausus]]'') introduced in 1937 in some universities, halved the number of Jews in Polish universities between independence (1918) and the late 1930s. The restrictions were so inclusive that – while the Jews made up 20.4% of the student body in 1928 – by 1937 their share was down to only 7.5%,<ref>Leo Cooper, ''In the Shadow of the Polish Eagle: The Poles, the Holocaust and Beyond'', Palgrave (2000), p. 60.</ref> out of the total population of 9.75% Jews in the country according to [[Polish census of 1931|1931 census]].<ref name="PolishCensus1931">{{cite web |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a18_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317212240/http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a18_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |archive-date=17 March 2014 |title=Główny Urząd Statystyczny Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej, drugi powszechny spis ludności z dn. 9.XII 1931 r. – Mieszkania i gospodarstwa domowe ludność |trans-title=Central Statistical Office the Polish Republic, the second census dated 9.XII 1931 – Abodes and household populace |language=pl |publisher=Central Statistical office of the Polish Republic |year=1938 |page=15}}</ref>

The national boycott of Jewish businesses and advocacy for their confiscation was promoted by the [[Endecja]] party, which introduced the term "Christian shop". A national movement to prevent the Jews from kosher slaughter of animals, with animal rights as the stated motivation, was also organized.<ref>Celia Stopnicka Heller.

The main strain of antisemitism in Poland during this time was motivated by Catholic religious beliefs and centuries-old myths such as the [[blood libel]]. This religious-based antisemitism was sometimes joined with an ultra-nationalistic stereotype of Jews as disloyal to the Polish nation.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GmVt-O3AR34C&pg=PA133 On the Edge of Destruction: Jews of Poland Between the Two World Wars]. Wayne State University Press, 1993.</ref> On the eve of World War II, many typical Polish Christians believed that there were far too many Jews in the country, and the Polish government became increasingly concerned with the "Jewish question". Some politicians favored mass Jewish emigration from Poland. The Polish government condemned wanton violence against the Jewish minority, fearing international repercussions, but shared the view that the Jewish minority hindered Poland's development; in January 1937 Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]] declared that Poland could house 500,000 Jews, and hoped that over the next 30 years 80,000-100,000 Jews a year would leave Poland.<ref>In January 1937, "Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]] announced to the [[Sejm]] that Poland had room for 500,000 Jews.

In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the League of Nations as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister Józef Beck.11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organizing and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Jewish members of the [[Sejm]] who protested against the heightened [[antisemitism]] in Poland took pains to thank Beck for furthering the cause of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.13" [[Szymon Rudnicki]], [[Marek Karliner]] & [[Laurence Weinbaum]], "Linking the Vistula and the Jordan: The Genesis of Relations between Poland and the State of Israel", ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'', 8:1, 2014, pp. 103-114.</ref> The common goals of the Polish state and of the Zionist movement, of increased Jewish population flow to Palestine, resulted in their overt and covert cooperation.

According to Irgun activists, the Polish state supplied the organisation with 25,000 rifles, additional material and weapons, and by summer 1939 Irgun's Warsaw warehouses held 5,000 rifles and 1,000 machine guns. The training and support by Poland would allow the organisation to mobilise 30,000-40,000 men.<ref>[[Yitshaq Ben-Ami]], "The Irgun and the Destruction of European Jewry", ''Perspectives on the Holocaust'', pp. 75-76.</ref>  ??? pp.&nbsp;71–91 ???

By the time of the German invasion in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government ''[[Gazeta Polska (1929–1939)|Gazeta Polska]]'' wrote, "The fact that our relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich."<ref>Edward D.

===Territories annexed by the USSR (1939–1941)===
{{Main|Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union}}
The Soviet Union signed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Pact with Nazi Germany]] on 23 August 1939 containing a protocol about partition of Poland (generally known but denied by the Soviet Union for the next 50 years).<ref name="chatham2011">{{cite journal |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/ia/archive/view/164427 |title=The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact |journal=Chatham House |publisher=Chatham House, The Royal Institute of International Affairs |year=2011|last1=Benn |first1=David Wedgwood }}</ref> The German army attacked Poland on 1 September 1939. The Soviet Union followed suit by invading eastern Poland on 17 September 1939. Within weeks, 61.2% of Polish Jews found themselves [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|under the German occupation]], while 38.8% were trapped in the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. Based on population migration from West to East during and after the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]] the percentage of Jews under the Soviet-occupation was substantially higher than that of the national census.<ref name="ushmm-1939"/>

The [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet annexation]] was accompanied by the widespread arrests of government officials, police, military personnel, border guards, teachers, priests, judges etc., followed by the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] and massive deportation of 320,000 Polish nationals to the Soviet interior and the [[List of Gulag camps|Gulag slave labor camps]] where, as a result of the inhuman conditions, about half of them died before the end of war.<ref name="AFP">{{cite web |title=Polish nation's WWII death toll |publisher=AFP / Expatica |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2015 |url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-news/Polish-experts-lower-nation_s-WWII-death-toll--_55843.html}}</ref>

Many people from Western Poland registered for repatriation back to the German zone, including wealthier Jews, as well as some political and social activists from the [[interwar period]]. Instead, they were labelled "class enemies" by the [[NKVD]] and deported to Siberia with the others. Jews caught at border crossings, or engaged in trade and other "illegal" activities were also arrested and deported. Several thousand, mostly captured Polish soldiers, were executed; some of them Jewish.<ref name="geni/Lutsk"/>

All private property and – crucial to Jewish economic life – private businesses were nationalized; political activity was delegalized and thousands of people were jailed, many of whom were later executed. Zionism, which was designated by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary was also forbidden. In just one day all Polish and Jewish media were shut down and replaced by the new Soviet press,<ref name="geni/Lutsk">Dr Pawel Goldstein, [http://www.geni.com/projects/Lutsk-Luck-Ghetto/11424 Lutsk (Luck) Ghetto.] Geni.com.</ref> which conducted political propaganda attacking religion including the Jewish faith. Synagogues and churches were not yet closed but heavily taxed. The Soviet ruble of little value was immediately equalized to the much higher Polish zloty and by the end of 1939, zloty was abolished.<ref name="LJW"/> Most economic activity became subject to central planning and the NKVD restrictions. Since the Jewish communities tended to rely more on commerce and small scale businesses, the confiscations of property affected them to a greater degree than the general populace. The Soviet rule resulted in near collapse of the local economy, characterized by insufficient wages and general shortage of goods and materials. The Jews, like other inhabitants of the region, saw a fall in their living standards.<ref name="ushmm-1939">{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005593 |title=Jewish Refugees, 1939 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |work=German Invasion of Poland |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=21 March 2015 |author=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="LJW"/>

The issue of Jewish collaboration with the Soviet occupation remains controversial. Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D. Kassow.

Even though only a small percentage of the Jewish community had been members of the [[Communist Party of Poland]] during the interwar era, they had occupied an influential and conspicuous place in the party's leadership and in the rank and file in major centres, such as Warsaw, Łódź and Lwów. A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions. The concept of "Judeo-communism" was reinforced during the period of the Soviet occupation (see [[Żydokomuna]]).<ref>Joanna Michlic.

There were also Jews who assisted Poles during the Soviet occupation. Among the thousands of Polish officers killed by the Soviet [[NKVD]] in the [[Katyń massacre]] there were 500–600 Jews. From 1939 to 1941 between 100,000 and 300,000 Polish Jews were deported from [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet-occupied Polish territory]] into the [[Soviet Union]]. Some of them, especially Polish [[Communism|Communists]] (e.g. [[Jakub Berman]]), moved voluntarily; however, most of them were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forcibly deported or imprisoned]] in a ''[[Gulag]]''. Small numbers of Polish Jews (about 6,000) were able to leave the Soviet Union in 1942 with the [[Władysław Anders]] army, among them the future [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Menachem Begin]]. During the Polish army's [[Polish II Corps|II Corps]]' stay in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], 67% (2,972) of the Jewish soldiers deserted to settle in Palestine, and many joined the ''[[Irgun]]''. General Anders decided not to prosecute the deserters and emphasized that the Jewish soldiers who remained in the Force fought bravely.<ref>Yisrael Gutman [http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206564.pdf Jews in General Anders’ Army In the Soviet Union]</ref> The [[Polish cemetery at Monte Cassino|Cemetery of Polish soldiers]] who died during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] includes headstones bearing a [[Star of David]].

Following [[Operation Barbarossa]], many Jews in what was then Eastern Poland fell victim to Nazi [[death squad]]s called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', which massacred Jews, especially in 1941. Some of these German-inspired massacres were carried out with help from, or active participation of Poles themselves: for example, the [[Jedwabne pogrom]], in which between 300 ([[Institute of National Remembrance]]'s Final Findings<ref>[http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/J/final.html Summary of IPN's final findings on Jedwabne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201535/http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/J/final.html |date=3 March 2016 }} (English)</ref>) and 1,600 Jews ([[Jan T. Gross]]) were tortured and beaten to death by members of the local population. The full extent of Polish participation in the massacres of the Polish Jewish community remains a controversial subject, in part due to Jewish leaders' refusal to allow the remains of the Jewish victims to be exhumed and their cause of death to be properly established. The Polish Institute for National Remembrance identified twenty-two other towns that had [[pogrom]]s similar to Jedwabne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polands-jewish-secret-unearthed/a-669067|title=Poland's Jewish Secret Unearthed - DW - 05.11.2002|website=DW.COM}}</ref> The reasons for these massacres are still debated, but they included [[antisemitism]], resentment over alleged cooperation with the Soviet invaders in the Polish-Soviet War and during the 1939 invasion of the [[Kresy]] regions, greed for the possessions of the Jews, and of course coercion by the Nazis to participate in such massacres.

[[Holocaust survivors]]' views of Polish behavior during the War span a wide range, depending on their personal experiences. Some are very negative, based on the view of Christian Poles as passive witnesses who failed to act and aid the Jews as they were being persecuted or liquidated by the Nazis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaustsurvivors.org/data.show.php?di=record&da=encyclopedia&ke=107|title=Holocaust Survivors: Encyclopedia - "Polish-Jewish Relations"|website=www.holocaustsurvivors.org}}</ref> Poles, who were also victims of [[Nazi crimes]],<ref name="lukas"/> were often afraid for their own and their family's lives and this fear prevented many of them from giving aid and assistance, even if some of them felt sympathy for the Jews. [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], a Polish-Jewish historian of the Warsaw Ghetto, wrote critically of the indifferent and sometimes joyful responses in Warsaw to the destruction of Polish Jews in the Ghetto.<ref name="P-M"/> However, [[Gunnar S. Paulsson]] stated that Polish citizens of Warsaw managed to support and hide the same percentage of Jews as did the citizens of cities in Western European countries.<ref name="hnetradz"/> Paulsson's research shows that at least as far as [[Warsaw]] is concerned, the number of Poles aiding Jews far outnumbered those who sold out their Jewish neighbors to the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation of Warsaw 70,000–90,000 Polish gentiles aided Jews, while 3,000–4,000 were [[szmalcownik]]s, or blackmailers who collaborated with the Nazis in persecuting the Jews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marci Shore |url=http://www.aapjstudies.org/index.php?id=36 |title= Gunnar S.

===Ghettos and death camps===
The German Nazis established six [[extermination camp]]s throughout [[German occupied Poland|occupied Poland]] by 1942. All of these – at [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chełmno (Kulmhof)]], [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]], [[Treblinka]], [[Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz]] (Oświęcim) – were located near the rail network so that the victims could be easily transported. The system of the camps was expanded over the course of the German occupation of Poland and their purposes were diversified; some served as transit camps, some as [[forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor camps]] and the majority as death camps. While in the death camps, the victims were usually killed shortly after arrival, in the other camps able-bodied Jews were worked and beaten to death.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/history.html History of the Holocaust – An Introduction].

[[File:Ghettos Eastern Europe 1941-1942.gif|left|thumb|Jewish Ghettos in German occupied Poland and Eastern Europe]]

Between October 1939 and July 1942 a system of ghettos was imposed for the confinement of Jews. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest in all of World War II, with 380,000 people crammed into an area of {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}}. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000 prisoners. Other large Jewish ghettos in leading Polish cities included [[Białystok Ghetto]] in [[Białystok]], [[Częstochowa Ghetto]], [[Kielce Ghetto]], [[Kraków Ghetto]] in [[Kraków]], [[Lublin Ghetto]], [[Lwów Ghetto]] in present-day [[Lviv]], [[Stanisławów Ghetto]] also in present-day Ukraine, [[Brześć Ghetto]] in presend-day Belarus, and [[Radom Ghetto]] among others. Ghettos were also established in hundreds of smaller settlements and villages around the country. The overcrowding, dirt, lice, lethal epidemics such as [[typhoid]] and hunger all resulted in countless deaths.

During the occupation of Poland, the Germans used various laws to separate ethnic Poles from Jewish ones. In the ghettos the population was separated by putting the Poles into the "Aryan Side" and the Polish Jews into the "Jewish Side". Any Pole found giving any help to a Jewish Pole was subject to the death penalty.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Donald L. Niewyk|author2= Francis R. Nicosia|author-link2= Francis R.

Since the Nazi terror reigned throughout the Aryan districts, the chances of remaining successfully hidden depended on a fluent knowledge of the language and on having close ties with the community. Many Poles were not willing to hide Jews who might have escaped the ghettos or who might have been in hiding due to fear for their own lives and that of their families.

While the German policy towards Jews was ruthless and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews was very much the same. The Germans would often murder non-Jewish Poles for small misdemeanors. Execution for help rendered to Jews, even the most basic kinds, was automatic. In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, everybody in the house would be immediately shot by the Germans. For this thousands of non-Jewish Poles were executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.core.com/~mikerose/waryears.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609193411/http://members.core.com/~mikerose/waryears.htm|url-status=dead|title=Jewish History in Poland during the years 1939–1945|archive-date=9 June 2009}}</ref>

Hiding in a Christian society to which the Jews were only partially assimilated was a daunting task.<ref name="hiding"/> They needed to quickly acquire not only a new identity, but a new body of knowledge.<ref name=hiding/> Many Jews spoke Polish with a distinguished Yiddish or Hebrew accent, used a different nonverbal language, different gestures and facial expressions.

Some individuals blackmailed [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews and non-Jewish Poles hiding them]], and took advantage of their desperation by collecting money, or worse, turning them over to the Germans for a reward. The [[Gestapo]] provided a standard prize to those who informed on Jews hidden on the 'Aryan' side, consisting of cash, liquor, sugar, and cigarettes. Jews were robbed and handed over to the Germans by "[[szmalcownik]]s" (the 'shmalts' people: from ''shmalts'' or ''szmalec'', Yiddish and Polish for 'grease').

To discourage Poles from giving shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland was the only occupied country during World War II where the [[Nazism|Nazis]] formally imposed the [[death penalty]] for anybody found sheltering and helping Jews.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081030094647/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=2743&lang=EN&type_id=&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F2743.JPG Poland, Execution of Poles by a German Police Firing Squad.] Film and Photo Archive, [[Yad Vashem]].</ref><ref name="Nie-Nic"/><ref name="Polonsky"/> The penalty applied not only to the person who did the helping, but also extended to his or her family, neighbors and sometimes to entire villages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isurvived.org/Frameset4References-3/-PolishRighteous.html|title=Referenced Material - Isurvived.org|website=isurvived.org}}</ref> In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.

Food rations for the Poles were small (669 kcal per day in 1941) compared to other occupied nations throughout Europe and [[black market]] prices of necessary goods were high, factors which made it difficult to hide people and almost impossible to hide entire families, especially in the cities. Despite these draconian measures imposed by the Nazis, Poland has the highest number of [[Righteous Among The Nations]] awards at the [[Yad Vashem]] Museum (6,339).<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/righteous_new/statistics.html The Righteous Among the Nations]. .yadvashem.org.

The ghetto was established by the German [[General Gouvernment|Governor-General]] [[Hans Frank]] on 16 October 1940. Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area.

The population of the ghetto reached 380,000 people by the end of 1940, about 30% of the population of Warsaw. However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On 22 July 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10–14}} During the next fifty-two days (until 12 September 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. The [[Jewish Ghetto Police]] were ordered to escort the ghetto inhabitants to the [[Umschlagplatz (Warsaw Ghetto)|Umschlagplatz]] train station. They were spared from the deportations until September 1942 in return for their cooperation, but afterwards shared their fate with families and relatives.

The Jewish fighters also received support from the Polish Underground ([[Armia Krajowa]]). The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the ŻOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.

It took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[Jürgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on Tłomackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.

A group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish "People's Guard" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.

Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland. Many Jews were found alive in the ruins of the former Warsaw Ghetto during the 1944 general [[Warsaw Uprising]] when the Poles themselves rose up against the Germans. Some of the survivors of 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, still held in camps at or near Warsaw, were freed during 1944 Warsaw Uprising, led by the Polish [[resistance movement]] [[Armia Krajowa]], and immediately joined Polish fighters. Only a few of them survived. The Polish commander of one Jewish unit, [[Waclaw Micuta]], described them as some of the best fighters, always at the front line. It is estimated that over 2,000 Polish Jews, some as well known as [[Marek Edelman]] or [[Icchak Cukierman]], and several dozen Greek,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=8301&lang=EN&type_id=2&addr=/IMAGE_TYPE/8301.JPG|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121220914/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=8301&lang=EN&type_id=2&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F8301.JPG|archive-date=21 January 2008|title=מידע נוסף על הפריט|date=21 January 2008|access-date=20 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Hungarian or even German Jews freed by [[Armia Krajowa]] from [[Gesiowka]] concentration camp in Warsaw, men and women, took part in combat against Nazis during 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. Some 166,000 people lost their lives in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, including perhaps as many as 17,000 Polish Jews who had either fought with the [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] or had been discovered in hiding (''see:'' [[Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński]] and [[Stanisław Aronson]]). Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Germans and more than 150,000 Poles were sent to labor or concentration camps. On 17 January 1945, the [[Soviet Army]] entered a destroyed and nearly uninhabited Warsaw. Some 300 Jews were found hiding in the ruins in the Polish part of the city (''see:'' [[Wladyslaw Szpilman]]).
[[File:Ghetto Uprising Warsaw2.jpg|thumb|The [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 saw the destruction of what remained of the Ghetto]]

The fate of the Warsaw Ghetto was similar to that of the other ghettos in which Jews were concentrated. With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name="Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.

====The Białystok Ghetto and its uprising====
{{main|Białystok Ghetto}}
{{further|Białystok Ghetto Uprising}}
In August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Białystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Białystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Biała River (Supraśl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Białystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.

In February 1943, approximately 10,000 Białystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.

In August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Białystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.

On 15 August 1943, the [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie białostockim. Samoobrona-zagłada-powstanie |author=Mark, B |year=1952 |location=Warsaw|language=pl}}</ref> The guerrillas were armed with only one [[machine gun]], several dozen pistols, [[Molotov cocktail]]s and bottles filled with acid. The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Białystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Białystok where they joined the partisan units of [[Armia Krajowa]] and other organisations and survived the war.

===Number of Holocaust survivors===
The estimates of Polish Jews before the war vary from slightly under 3 million to almost 3.5 million ([[Polish census of 1931|the last nationwide census was conducted in 1931]]).<ref name=":32" />

The number of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust is difficult to ascertain. The majority of Polish Jewish survivors were individuals who were able to find refuge in the territories of Soviet Union that were not overrun by Germans and thus safe from the Holocaust. It is estimated that between 250,000 and 800,000 Polish Jews survived the war, out of which between 50,000 and 100,000 were survivors from occupied Poland, and the remainder, survivors who made it abroad (mostly to the Soviet Union).<ref name=":32" />

===The Jewish community in post-war Poland===
Following World War II Poland became a [[Polish People's Republic|satellite state of the Soviet Union]], with its [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern regions]] annexed to the Union, and its western borders expanded to include [[Recovered Territories|formerly German territories]] east of the [[Oder]] and [[Neisse]] rivers.

Jewish communities and Jewish life as it had existed was gone, and Jews who somehow survived the Holocaust often discovered that their homes had been looted or destroyed.<ref name="USHMM-archive1"/>

====Anti-Jewish violence and discrimination====
{{main|Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946}}
Some returning Jews were met with antisemitic bias in Polish employment and education administrations. Post-war labor certificates contained markings distinguishing Jews from non-Jews. The Jewish community in Szczecin reported a lengthy report of complaints regarding job discrimination. Although Jewish schools were created in the few towns containing a relatively large Jewish population, many Jewish children were enrolled in Polish state schools. Some state schools, as in the town of Otwock, forbade Jewish children to enroll. In the state schools that did allow Jewish children, there were numerous accounts of beatings and persecution targeting these children.<ref name=":0" />

The anti-Jewish violence in Poland refers to a series of violent incidents in [[Poland]] that immediately followed the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. It occurred amid a period of violence and anarchy across the country, caused by lawlessness and [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)|anti-communist resistance]] against the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Consolidation of communist power|Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland]].<ref name="Cich2014">{{cite book |pages=26, 47, 114, 143 |title=Beyond Violence: Jewish Survivors in Poland and Slovakia, 1944-48 |first=Anna |last=Cichopek-Gajraj |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDezAwAAQBAJ&q=civil+war |work=Introduction |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2014 |isbn=978-1107036666 |quote=The most intense battles took place in the east but the fighting was not limited to this region; all over the country, partisans clashed with communist security forces.

In a number of other instances, returning Jews still met with threats, violence, and murder from their Polish neighbors, occasionally in a deliberate and organized manner. People of the community frequently had knowledge of these murders and turned a blind eye or held no sympathy for the victims. Jewish communities responded to this violence by reporting the violence to the Ministry of Public Administration, but were granted little assistance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Fear : Anti-Semitism in Poland After Auschwitz|first=Jan|last=Gross|date=2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780307430960|pages=60–68|oclc=841327982}}</ref> As many as 1500 Jewish heirs were often murdered when attempting to reclaim property.<ref name="Beker">[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6B_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA101 The Plunder of Jewish Property during the Holocaust], Palgrave, page 101</ref>

Several causes led to the anti-Jewish violence of 1944–1947. One cause was traditional Christian anti-semitism; the [[Kraków pogrom|pogrom in Cracow]] (11 August 1945) and in Kielce followed accusations of ritual murder. Another cause was the gentile Polish hostility to the Communist takeover. Even though very few Jews lived in postwar Poland, many Poles believed they dominated the Communist authorities, a belief expressed in the term ''[[Żydokomuna]]'' (Judeo-Communist), a popular anti-Jewish stereotype. Yet another reason for Polish violence towards Jews stemmed from the fear that survivors would recover their property.<ref name="N-A" /><ref name=":0" />

==== Jewish property ====

After the war ended, Poland's Communist government enacted a broad program of nationalization and land reform, taking over large numbers of properties, both Polish- and Jewish-owned.<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/c47fcb02-749d-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201] Polish nationalists protest at law on restitution of Jewish property 12.05.19</ref> As part of the reform the [[Polish People's Republic]] enacted legislation on "abandoned property", placing severe limitations on inheritance that were not present in prewar inheritance law, for example limiting restitution to the original owners or their immediate heirs.<ref name="AJYB 1947">Under these limitations, restitution seemed to proceed well, at least for a time (see ''The American Jewish Year Book'', vol. 49, 1947, p. 390).</ref> According to [[Dariusz Stola]], the 1945 and 1946 laws governing restitution were enacted with the intention of restricting Jewish restitution claims as one of their main goals.<ref name="Stola 2008">{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-306-54603-4| pages = 240–255| editor1 = Martin Dean| editor2 = Constantin Goschler| editor3 = Philipp Ther| last = Stola| first = Dariusz| title = Robbery and restitution: the conflict over Jewish property in Europe| chapter = The polish debate on the holocaust and the restitution of property| accessdate = 14 May 2019| date = 2008| chapter-url = http://site.ebrary.com/id/10856066}}</ref><ref name="Weizman">{{cite journal|title=Unsettled possession: the question of ownership of Jewish sites in Poland after the Holocaust from a local perspective|first=Yechiel|last=Weizman|date=2 January 2017|journal=Jewish Culture and History|volume=18|issue=1|pages=34–53|doi=10.1080/1462169X.2016.1267853|s2cid=151471207}}</ref> The 1946 law<ref name="CG 2014" /> carried a deadline of 31 December 1947 (later extended to 31 December 1948), after which unclaimed property devolved to the Polish state; many survivors residing in the USSR or in [[Displaced persons|displaced-persons camps]] were repatriated only after the deadline had passed.<ref name="Beker"/> All other properties that had been confiscated by the Nazi regime were deemed "abandoned"; however, as Yechiel Weizman notes, the fact most of Poland's Jewry had died, in conjunction with the fact that only Jewish property was officially confiscated by the Nazis, suggest "abandoned property" was equivalent to "Jewish property".<ref name="Weizman"/> According to {{ill|Łukasz Krzyżanowski|pl|Łukasz Krzyżanowski}}, the state actively sought to gain control over a large number of "abandoned" properties.<ref name="Krzyżanowski 2014">{{cite book|author1=Jan Grabowski|author2=Dariusz Libionka|title=Klucze i kasa: O mieniu żydowskim w Polsce pod okupacją niemiecką i we wczesnych latach powojennych 1939–1950|publisher=Stowarzyszenie Centrum Badań nad Zagładą|location=Warsaw|year=2014|language=pl|pages=605–607}}</ref> According to Krzyżanowski, this declaration of "abandoned" property can be seen as the last stage of the expropriation process that began during the German wartime occupation; by approving the status-quo shaped by the German occupation authorities, the Polish authorities became "the beneficiary of the murder of millions of its Jewish citizens, who were deprived of all their property before death".<ref name="Krzyżanowski 2014" /> A 1945 memorandum by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|Joint]] states that "the new economic tendency of the Polish government... is against, or at least makes difficulties in, getting back the Jewish property robbed by the German authorities."<ref name="CG 2014">{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-107-03666-6| last = Cichopek-Gajraj| first = Anna| title = Beyond violence: Jewish survivors in Poland and Slovakia, 1944-48| location = New York| series = New studies in European history| date = 2014}}</ref> Later laws, while more generous, remained mainly on paper, with an "uneven" implementation.<ref name="CG 2014" />

====Emigration to Palestine and Israel====
{{main|Aliyah Bet}}
For a variety of reasons, the vast majority of returning Jewish survivors left Poland soon after the war ended.<ref name="jcpa.org"/> Many left for the West because they did not want to live under a Communist regime. Some left because of the persecution they faced in postwar Poland,<ref name="N-A" /> and because they did not want to live where their family members had been murdered, and instead have arranged to live with relatives or friends in different western democracies. Others wanted to go to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] soon to be the new state of [[Israel]], especially after General [[Marian Spychalski]] signed a decree allowing Jews to leave Poland without visas or exit permits.<ref name="Kochavi-175"/> In 1946–1947 Poland was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country to allow free Jewish [[aliyah]] to Israel,<ref name="D-H" />  without visas or exit permits.<ref name="Kochavi-175" /><ref name="Marrus" /> Britain demanded Poland to halt the exodus, but their pressure was largely unsuccessful.<ref name="Kochavi-xi" />

Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland. Their departure was largely organized by the [[Zionism|Zionist]] activists including [[Adolf Berman]] and [[Icchak Cukierman]], under the umbrella of a semi-clandestine ''[[Berihah]]'' ("Flight") organization.<ref name="YV-archive3" /> ''Berihah'' was also responsible for the organized [[Aliyah]] emigration of Jews from [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], and Poland, totaling 250,000 survivors. In 1947, a military training camp for young Jewish volunteers to [[Hagana]] was established in [[Bolków]], Poland. The camp trained 7,000 soldiers who then traveled to Palestine to fight for Israel. The boot-camp existed until the end of 1948.<ref>[https://sztetl.org.pl/en/towns/b/1744-bolkow/101-organizations-and-associations/80234-haganas-training-camp-bolkow Hagana's training camp in Bolkow.] Sztetl.org.pl.</ref>

A second wave of Jewish emigration (50,000) took place during the liberalization of the Communist regime between 1957 and 1959. After 1967's [[Six-Day War]], in which the Soviet Union supported the Arab side, the Polish communist party adopted an anti-Jewish course of action which in the years 1968–1969 provoked the last mass migration of Jews from Poland.<ref name="jcpa.org"/>

The Bund took part in the post-war [[Polish legislative election, 1947|elections of 1947]] on a common ticket with the (non-communist) [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) and gained its first and only parliamentary seat in its Polish history, plus several seats in municipal councils.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Under pressure from Soviet-installed communist authorities, the Bund's leaders 'voluntarily' disbanded the party in 1948–1949 against the opposition of many activists.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Stalinist Poland was basically governed by the Soviet [[NKVD]] which was against the renewal of Jewish religious and cultural life.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In the years 1948–49, all remaining Jewish schools were nationalized by the communists and Yiddish was replaced with Polish as a language of teaching.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

====Rebuilding Jewish communities====
For those Polish Jews who remained, the rebuilding of Jewish life in Poland was carried out between October 1944 and 1950 by the [[Central Committee of Polish Jews]] (''Centralny Komitet Żydów Polskich'', CKŻP) which provided legal, educational, social care, cultural, and propaganda services. A countrywide Jewish Religious Community, led by [[Dawid Kahane]], who served as [[chief rabbi]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces#After 1945|Polish Armed Forces]], functioned between 1945 and 1948 until it was absorbed by the CKŻP. Eleven independent political Jewish parties, of which eight were legal, existed until their dissolution during 1949–50. Hospitals and schools were opened in Poland by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and ORT to provide service to Jewish communities.<ref name="JVL" /> Some Jewish cultural institutions were established including the [[Yiddish theater|Yiddish State Theater]] founded in 1950 and directed by [[Ida Kaminska]], the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], an academic institution specializing in the research of the history and culture of the Jews in Poland, and the Yiddish newspaper ''Folks-Shtime'' ("People's Voice"). Following liberalization after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, in this 1958–59 period, 50,000 Jews emigrated to Israel.<ref name="relations"/>

Some Polish Communists of Jewish descent actively participated in the establishment of the communist regime in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] between 1944 and 1956. Hand-picked by Joseph Stalin, prominent Jews held posts in the [[Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party]] including [[Jakub Berman]], head of state security apparatus ''[[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa]]'' (UB),{{r|hoover}} and [[Hilary Minc]] responsible for establishing a Communist-style economy. Together with hardliner [[Bolesław Bierut]], Berman and Minc formed a triumvirate of the Stalinist leaders in postwar Poland.<ref name="hoover">{{cite journal |title=Jakub Berman's Papers Received at the Hoover Institution Archives |url=http://www.hoover.org/library-and-archives/acquisitions/28981 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130192558/http://www.hoover.org/library-and-archives/acquisitions/28981 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 November 2010 |date=11 August 2008 |publisher=The Board of Trustees of [[Leland Stanford Junior University]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] |author=Hoover Institution |journal=Library and Archives Recent Acquisitions|author-link=Hoover Institution }}</ref> After 1956, during the process of [[destalinisation]] in the [[Polish People's Republic|People's Republic]] under [[Władysław Gomułka]], some Jewish officials from ''Urząd Bezpieczeństwa'' including [[Roman Romkowski]], [[Jacek Różański]], and [[Anatol Fejgin]], were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms for "power abuses" including the torture of Polish anti-fascists including [[Witold Pilecki]] among others. Yet another Jewish official, [[Józef Światło]], after escaping to the West in 1953, exposed through [[Radio Free Europe]] the interrogation methods used the UB which led to its restructuring in 1954. [[Solomon Morel]] a member of the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]] and commandant of the Stalinist era [[Zgoda labour camp]], fled Poland for Israel in 1992 to escape prosecution.

====The March 1968 events and their aftermath====
In 1967, following the [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Arab]] states, Poland's Communist government, following the Soviet lead, broke off diplomatic relations with Israel and launched an antisemitic campaign under the guise of "anti-Zionism". However, the campaign did not resonate well with the Polish public, as most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence. Many Poles also felt pride in the success of the Israeli military, which was dominated by Polish Jews. The slogan "our Jews beat the Soviet Arabs" (Nasi Żydzi pobili sowieckich Arabów) became popular in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wprost.pl/tygodnik/13189/Wojna-zastepcza.html|title=Wojna zastępcza|first=Łukasz|last=Kamiński|date=9 June 2002|website=WPROST.pl}}</ref><ref>[http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=37395&subdz=] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602202347/http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=37395&subdz=|date=2 June 2009}}</ref>

The vast majority of the 40,000 Jews in Poland by the late 1960s were completely assimilated into the broader society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, this did not prevent them from becoming victims of a campaign, centrally organized by the Polish Communist Party, with Soviet backing, which equated Jewish origins with "Zionism" and disloyalty to a Socialist Poland.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kunicki|first=Mikolaj|date=1 May 2015|title=The Red and the Brown: Bolesław Piasecki, the Polish Communists, and the Anti-Zionist Campaign in Poland, 1967-68|journal=East European Politics and Societies|volume=19|issue=2|pages=185–225|via=SAGE|doi=10.1177/0888325404270673|s2cid=145804324}}</ref>

In March 1968 student-led demonstrations in Warsaw (''see [[Polish 1968 political crisis]]'') gave Gomułka's government an excuse to try and channel public anti-government sentiment into another avenue. Thus his security chief, [[Mieczysław Moczar]], used the situation as a pretext to launch an antisemitic press campaign (although the expression "Zionist" was officially used). The state-sponsored "anti-Zionist" campaign resulted in the removal of Jews from the [[Polish United Worker's Party]] and from teaching positions in schools and universities. In 1967–1971 under economic, political and secret police pressure, over 14,000 Polish Jews chose to leave Poland and relinquish their Polish citizenship.<ref name="Steinman2013">{{cite book|author=Louise Steinman|title=The Crooked Mirror: A Memoir of Polish-Jewish Reconciliation|url=https://archive.org/details/crookedmirrormem0000stei|url-access=registration|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-5056-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/crookedmirrormem0000stei/page/134 134]}}</ref> Officially, it was said that they chose to go to Israel. However, only about 4,000 actually went there; most settled throughout [[Europe]] and in the [[United States]]. The leaders of the Communist party tried to stifle the ongoing protests and unrest by scapegoating the Jews. At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called "Partisan" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.<ref>AP Online, "Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week", 3 October 1998, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812044919/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]</ref>

There were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''. The campaign damaged Poland's reputation abroad, particularly in the U.S. Many Polish intellectuals, however, were disgusted at the promotion of official antisemitism and opposed the campaign. Some of the people who emigrated to the West at this time founded organizations which encouraged anti-Communist opposition inside Poland.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

First attempts to improve Polish-Israeli relations began in the mid-1970s. Poland was the first of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to restore diplomatic relations with Israel after these have been broken off right after the Six-Day's War.<ref name="relations"/> In 1986 [[Israel–Poland relations|partial diplomatic relations with Israel]] were restored,<ref name=relations/> and full relations were restored in 1990 as soon as communism fell.

During the late 1970s some Jewish activists were engaged in the anti-Communist opposition groups. Most prominent among them, [[Adam Michnik]] (founder of ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'') was one of the founders of the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR). By the time of the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, only 5,000–10,000 Jews remained in the country, many of them preferring to conceal their Jewish origin.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Since 1989==
{{main|History of Poland (1989–present)}}
{{Details|Jewish Polish history (1989–present)}}
With the fall of communism in Poland, Jewish cultural, social, and religious life has been undergoing a revival. Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944–89 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).

[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]
[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]

Jewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.

A large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Kraków, [[Zamość]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Kielce]], or [[Góra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga ("Old Synagogue") in Kraków, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.

There are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and "Sztendlach" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Kraków has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw. The building was designed by the Finnish architect Rainer Mahlamäki.<ref name="JVL" />

[[File:March of the living-in-auschwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|2005 [[March of the Living]]]]

Former extermination camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek and Treblinka are open to visitors. At Auschwitz the Oświęcim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. [[Jewish Cemetery, Łódź]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in Góra Kalwaria and [[Leżajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name="JVL"/>

The Great Synagogue in [[Oświęcim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town. Candelabras, chandeliers, a menorah and a [[Ner Tamid|ner tamid]] were found and can now be seen at the Auschwitz Jewish Center.<ref name="JVL"/>

The [[Warsaw Ghetto Memorial]] was unveiled on 19 April 1948—the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].

A memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].

Polish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland. Notable among them are the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]'s [[Holocaust studies]] journal {{ill|Zagłada Żydów. Studia i Materiały|pl|Zagłada Żydów. Studia i Materiały}} as well as other publications from the [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. Recent scholarship has primarily focused on three topics: post-war anti-Semitism; emigration and the creation of the State of Israel, and the restitution of property.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quest-cdecjournal.it/focus.php?id=211|title=The Jews in Poland after the Second World War.

There have been a number of Holocaust remembrance activities in Poland in recent years. The [[United States Department of State]] documents that:
<blockquote>In September 2000, dignitaries from Poland, Israel, the United States, and other countries (including [[Prince Hassan of Jordan]]) gathered in the city of Oświęcim (Auschwitz) to commemorate the opening of the refurbished [[Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot synagogue]] and the [[Auschwitz Jewish Center]]. The synagogue, the sole synagogue in Oświęcim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to pray and to learn about the active pre–World War II Jewish community that existed in Oświęcim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.<ref name="Poland, International Religious Freedom Report"/></blockquote>
The [[March of the Living]] is an annual event in April held since 1988 to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. It takes place from Auschwitz to [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] and is attended by many people from Israel, Poland and other countries. The marchers honor [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]] as well as [[Israel Independence Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motl.org/about/|title=ABOUT THE MARCH|website=motl.org|language=en-US|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>
