===Alex Salmond case controversy===
In 2020 former Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] alleged serious misconduct by Evans in her handling of accusations of sexual misconduct against him. Salmond won a civil action against the Scottish Government over its complaints process, which was ruled to be "unlawful", "procedurally unfair" and "tainted by apparent bias", and Salmond called for Evans to quit following the ruling. This court case cost the Scottish Government more than £600,000. After a [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]] case in which Salmond was cleared of allegations of rape, details of memos sent by Evans emerged. She stated "We may lose the battle, but we will win the war.”, in relation to the case against Salmond, which he argued did not "seem the words of an impartial public servant", and he suggested it was evidence she had been responsible for the unlawful and biased complaints process.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/salmond-set-to-reveal-conspiracy-allegations-in-evidence-to-inquiry-gtc77xmpv |url-access=subscription |title=Salmond set to reveal conspiracy allegations in evidence to inquiry |date=March 25, 2020 |first=Kieran |last=Andrews |work=[[The Times]]}}</ref>

Noel Dolan, who was Nicola Sturgeon's senior special adviser when she was deputy first minister under Salmond, also said Evans had to go for the "good" of the Scottish civil service, adding: "The original inquiry was a mess. Leslie Evans should stand down. As she cost the Scottish taxpayer a large amount of money, she should have gone in 2019."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Call for top civil servant to quit as fall-out continues from Alex Salmond trial |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/call-top-civil-servant-quit-fall-out-continues-alex-salmond-trial-2517541 |access-date=2020-06-23 |website=[[The Scotsman]] |language=en |first=Chris |last=McCall |date=25 March 2020}}</ref>
