The '''Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino''' (''Partner of the Free Filipino'',  abbreviated '''KAMPI''', Tagalog for "ally"), formerly the '''Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino''' (''Partner of the Filipino Citizen''), was a [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is the mother party of former Philippine [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. In May 2009, Kampi [[merger|merged]] into the [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas-CMD]].

==History==

KAMPI was formed during the run up to the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 presidential elections]] as the vehicle for then Senator Arroyo's presidential campaign, after she defected from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]], the party she had been with since she was first elected in 1995. [[Vicente Sotto III]] was picked to be her running mate. Before the filing of candidacies, she decided to be the running mate of then [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas-NUCD-UMDP]] presidential hopeful [[Jose de Venecia]].  As a result, KAMPI coalesced with [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas-NUCD-UMDP]] during the 1998 presidential elections.

There were no results available of the last [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], but according to the website of the House, the party holds 26 out of 235 seats (''State of the Parties, June 2005''). The party was at the 2004 elections member of the [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan]] (''K-4, Coalition of Truth and Experience for Tomorrow''), the coalition that supported president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who won the 2004 presidential elections. Many legislators of the [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] defected to Kampi.

Currently, KAMPI is actively recruiting members to bolster its chances to be the biggest party in the country jeopardizing its alliance with [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas CMD]] because they are raiding local officials allied with Lakas CMD or they are fielding candidates against incumbent administration officials.

As of March 24, 2007 KAMPI is said to have 67 members of the House of Representatives, 23 provincial [[governors]], and 650 out of the 1610 mayors all over the country. In the 14 May 2007 [[2007 Philippine general election|election]], the party won 47 seats.<ref>See [[2007 Philippine general election]].</ref>

On January 31, 2008, Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI) announced that 134 congressman signed a [[manifesto]] of "loss of confidence" versus Speaker [[Jose de Venecia]], Jr. [[Camarines Sur]] 2nd District Rep. Luis Villafuerte, KAMPI president, said the successor should be [[Davao City]] 4th district Rep. [[Prospero Nograles]].<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107520  Abs-Cbn Interactive, KAMPI expecting new speaker by Monday]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the Lakas Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) and the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (Kampi) parties. Both parties adopted the “equity of the incumbent” principle, as the merger will account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas President and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008  manilastandardtoday.com,  Lakas, Kampi merge; see victory in 2010 polls]</ref><ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge   GMA NEWS.TV,  Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge]</ref>
