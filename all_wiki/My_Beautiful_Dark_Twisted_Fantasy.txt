'''''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy''''' is the fifth studio album by American rapper and producer [[Kanye West]]. It was released on November 22, 2010, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. It follows a period of public and legal controversy for West, who retreated to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009 and recorded at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians and producers. Additional recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at [[Electric Lady Studios]] and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.

The album was produced primarily by West, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[No I.D.]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[RZA]], [[Symbolyc One|S1]], [[Bink (record producer)|Bink]], and [[DJ Frank E]]. Music journalists have noted the album features a [[Maximalism|maximalist]] aesthetic and opulent production quality with elements of West's previous works, including [[soul music|soul]], [[baroque pop|baroque]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and symphonic styles, as well as [[progressive rock]] influences. Thematically, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' explores West's status as a celebrity, [[Media culture|consumer culture]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and the idealism of the [[American Dream]]. Guest vocalists on the album include [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Pusha T]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[John Legend]], and [[Raekwon]].

To help market the album, West released free songs through his weekly [[GOOD Fridays]] series and four singles – "[[Power (Kanye West song)|Power]]", "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]", "[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]", and "[[All of the Lights]]" – all of which were top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. West also released a [[Musical film|musical]] [[short film]], ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'' (2010), set to music from the album. In its first week of release, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 496,000 copies, eventually reaching three million for a [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). 

''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, and was named the best album of 2010 in many publications' year-end lists, including the annual [[Pazz & Jop]] poll of American critics nationwide. The album also won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|2012 Grammy Awards]] but was not nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], which was viewed as a "snub" by several media outlets. The album's [[Hit song|hit single]] "All of the Lights" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. Widely considered West's best album, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' has ranked in several professionally curated lists as the best album of the 2010s and among the greatest of all time according to ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[George Condo]]'s accompanying artwork – illustrating West straddled by an armless winged female (a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) – has been ranked among the greatest album covers.

West, who had previously recorded ''808s & Heartbreak'' at Avex, block-booked the studio's three session rooms simultaneously for 24 hours a day to work on ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy''.<ref name="Bever" /> According to Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, "when he hits a creative wall&nbsp;... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song".<ref name="Bever" /> West never slept a full night at the "glass-enclosed mansion" he had rented, opting instead to take [[power nap]]s in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced from room to room. This assiduous work ethic led to him employing two private chefs, one for hot and one for cold food.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=15 Albums That Cost a Fortune to Make|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/57656/15-albums-cost-fortune-make|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=July 8, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709232453/http://mentalfloss.com/article/57656/15-albums-cost-fortune-make|archive-date=July 9, 2014}}</ref> Before recording in the afternoon, West and most of his crew played games of [[Twenty-one (basketball)|21]] against locals at the Honolulu [[YMCA]] for leisure.<ref name="Bever" /> Kid Cudi smoked [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the [[Weight training|weight room]].<ref name="Bever" /><ref>Paine, Jake (November 22, 2010).

Throughout the album's development, West solicited other producers and musicians to weigh in on its music with conversations and contributions at the studio.<ref name="Bever" /> Observing discussions among them during his visit, Callahan-Bever noted: "Despite the heavyweights assembled, the egos rarely clash; talks are sprawling, enlightening, and productive&nbsp;... we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire".<ref name="Bever" /> In an interview with Callahan-Bever, Q-Tip described the process as "music by committee" and elaborated on its significance to the sessions and West's work ethic:

{{cquote|He'll go, 'Check this out, tell me what you think.' Which speaks volumes about who he is and how he sees and views people. Every person has a voice and an idea, so he's sincerely looking to hear what you have to say—good, bad, or whatever&nbsp;... When he has his beats or his rhymes, he offers them to the committee and we're all invited to dissect, strip, or add on to what he's already started. By the end of the sessions, you see how he integrates and transforms everyone's contributions, so the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. He's a real wizard at it. What he does is alchemy, really.<ref name="Bever" />}}

Pete Rock said of his studio experience with West, "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints&nbsp;... He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real.

[[Jon Brion]] on ''Late Registration'') and "adapt[ing] [[DJ Toomp]]'s oozing menace" (from ''Graduation'') while "Cudi's moaning melodies became elemental" (cf. ''808s & Heartbreak'').<ref name="Fennessey" />

The album is viewed as a culmination of West's past albums. Ryan Dombal of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' says, "Musically, [the album] largely continues where 2007's ''Graduation'' left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of ''The College Dropout''{{'}}s comfort-food sampling and ''Late Registration''{{'}}s [[baroque music|baroque]] instrumentation weaved in seamlessly".<ref name="Dombal" /> Andy Kellman echoes this sentiment, but adds that "it does not merely draw characteristics from each one of them. The 13 tracks&nbsp;... sometimes fuse them together simultaneously. Consequently, the sonic and emotional layers are often difficult to pry apart and enumerate".<ref name="Kellman" /> Kellman feels "[[All of the Lights]]" denotes the album's "contrasting elements and maniacal extravagance".<ref name="Kellman" /> Conversely, [[Robert Christgau]] comments that the music abandons the "grace" of ''The College Dropout'' and ''Late Registration'' in favor of "grandiosity" and "sonic luxuries".<ref name="Christgau" />

{{Quote box

| quote = [West is] the pop star for our morally implicated times; an instinctive consumer with a mouthful of diamonds and furtive bad conscience, a performer who lives the [[American Dream]] to its fullest with a creeping sense of the spiritual void at its heart. ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' captures that essence in full. It's an utterly dazzling portrait of a 21st-century schizoid man that is by turns sickeningly egocentric, contrite, wise, stupid and self-mocking.

In October 2010, a month before the album's release, West [[Twitter|tweet]]ed: "Yoooo they banned my album cover!!!!! Banned in the USA!!! They don't want me chilling on the couch with my Phoenix!" He also suggested [[Walmart]] had rejected the cover and cited the case of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'', which featured a photo of a naked baby. "So Nirvana can have a naked human being on their cover, but I can't have a PAINTING of a monster with no arms and a polka dot tail and wings," he said.

And it sold well, over 1.2&nbsp;million so far. So what happened? How is it Grammy overlooked Kanye's magnum opus and gave noms to four sonic widgets and [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]''?"<ref name="Touré" /> He explored possible reasons for the Academy to snub West, including split votes between ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' and ''Watch the Throne'', concerns over West's past controversies, and more commercially appealing nominees, but ultimately stated:

{{cquote|What I think may be going on is a lack of respect for hip hop and its complexity from people who care about music but don't know much about hip hop&nbsp;... Predictably, Grammy tends toward pop-friendly hip hop that's easily understood by those who don't understand hip hop. Pop in this regard is not meant as an insult, it's merely music palatable to non-aficionados of the genre&nbsp;... But now that he's released his most mature work, [West is] being ignored.<ref name="Touré">{{cite web|author=Touré|author-link=Touré (journalist)|url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/|title=Touré: Why The Grammys Snubbed Kanye West's Twisted Fantasy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-31|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207085952/http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/|archive-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref>}}

In the ''Los Angeles Times'', Randall Roberts was critical of the nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards, particularly for the Album of the Year category, noting the exclusion of ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' – "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record" – as a snub in favor of nominating less substantial albums.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/critics-notebook-your-grannys-awards.html|title=Critic's Notebook: Grammy Awards?
