'''Dreghorn''' is a village in [[North Ayrshire]], Scotland, {{convert|3.5|km|mi}} to the east of [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] town centre, on the old main road from Irvine to [[Kilmarnock]]. It is sited on a ridge between two rivers. As archaeological excavations near the village centre have found a significant [[neolithic]] settlement provisionally dated to around 3500BC, as well as [[medieval]] structures, scholars have suggested that Dreghorn could be Britain's oldest continuously inhabited village. Both Irvine and Dreghorn have grown in size and they are now separated by the Annick Valley Park, which incorporates a footpath and [[National Cycle Route 73]] on the route of the disused [[Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway#Irvine to Busby line|Irvine to Busby railway line]].

The [[Church of Scotland]] Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church, at the centre of the village, dates from 1780. Its octagonal plan which is unusual in Scotland was produced by the church's principal benefactor, [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton]]. The village's most famous inhabitant, [[John Boyd Dunlop]], was born at a Dreghorn farm in 1840. When practicing as a [[veterinary surgeon]] in [[Belfast]], in 1887 he invented [[pneumatic tyre]]s for bicycles.

==Location==
[[File:Dreghorn Main St.jpg|thumb|Main Street, looking east along the B7081 from the B730 crossroads]]
The village of Dreghorn lies {{convert|3.5|km|mi}} east of the centre of [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]], on a ridge between [[Annick Water]] to its immediate north, and the [[River Irvine]] further to the south. The old main road from Irvine to [[Kilmarnock]] (now the B7081) formed the original village street along the ridge.<ref name="Ordnance Survey Six-inch 2nd and later editions, Scotland, 1892-1960 2015">{{cite web | title=View: Ayrshire Sheet XVII.SW (includes: Dreghorn; Dundonald; Irvine; Kilwinning) | website=Ordnance Survey Six-inch 2nd and later editions|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]| date=1897 | url=http://maps.nls.uk/view/75494384 | accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref> As Townfoot, it rises to the high point of the ridge at the Parish Church in the centre of the village, then continues as Main Street east along the ridge, down to the nearby village of [[Springside, Ayrshire|Springside]] which is also in Dreghorn Parish.

[[File:Dreghorn from Annick Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Ridge seen across Annick Valley Park and the [[Annick Water]] ]]
The Annick Water runs close to the north of the village, along the edge of the Annick Valley Park. Woodland and open green spaces, including playing fields, separate Dreghorn from Irvine New Town, with the district of [[Broomlands]] adjoining the park. The disused [[Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway#Irvine to Busby line|Irvine to Busby railway line]], which runs along this park, has been converted to a footpath, and forms [[National Cycle Route 73]] as part of the [[Irvine New Town Trail]].<ref name="Ayrshire Paths NTT">{{cite web | title=Walking and Cycling around Irvine and Kilwinning New Town Trails - North Ayrshire Urban Woodland Project | website=Ayrshire Paths | url=http://www.ayrshirepaths.org.uk/walkirvinentt.htm | accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Holmsford Bridge, Dreghorn.jpg|thumb|Holmsford Bridge which replaced a fording point of the River Irvine, looking south along the B730 towards Drybridge.]]
At a crossroads immediately to the east of the church, Station Brae runs north down the hill to the former [[Dreghorn railway station]], and the B730 runs south towards [[Drybridge]], crossing the River Irvine at Holmsford Bridge. Here it crosses under the [[A71 road]], which runs as a modern bypass along the Irvine Valley to the south of the village. A link from the B730 joins the A71 at a roundabout at Corsehill, providing expressway access from Dreghorn to Irvine town centre, and eastwards to Kilmarnock.

==History==
Dreghorn was the site of a significant [[neolithic]] settlement, and subsequently a [[medieval]] village: archaeological evidence has been provisionally dated to around 3500BC, suggesting that Dreghorn could be Britain's oldest continuously inhabited village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000608.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Britain's oldest continuously inhabited village |publisher=Stonepages.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref> In advance of a development of new housing to the north of properties on the current Main Street, preliminary testing found features including an ancient well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000688.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Prehistoric finds at a housing site in Scotland |publisher=Stonepages.com |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>

The excavations were carried out between November 2003 and April 2004 at a site on the slope from the ridge down towards [[Annick Water]]. The housing development has since been completed, as Station Brae Gardens. Neolithic features included pits and post holes with remains including fragments of some Early Neolithic [[Carinate |carinated bowls]] and larger amounts of Late Neolithic [[Grooved ware]]. Stone items were made from local and imported materials including [[flint]], [[pitchstone|Arran pitchstone]] and [[chert]], and included scrapers, arrowheads and cutting tools.<ref name="Canmore Station Brae" />

[[Image:Johnboyddunlop.JPG|thumb|150px|A memorial plaque to John Boyd Dunlop at Dreghorn village hall.]]
Three parallel rows of post holes indicated a rectangular structure {{convert|23.5|m|ft}} by {{convert|5|m|ft}}, probably a timber hall similar to the Neolithic long house found at [[Balbridie]]. Smaller post holes and stake holes define eight to twelve round or oval structures, possibly round houses, as well as six gully-defined structures with numerous stake-holes. A large oval feature, approximately {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} by {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}, contained heavily retired pottery shards and is thought likely to have been a [[kiln]]. Possible ritualistic landscape features include a massive post-pit and post holes or pits forming arcs. At the west edge of the site, adjacent to Station Brae, part of a probable palisade was found. Medieval finds included a trackway, ditches, pits and remains of numerous structures including kilns and a {{convert|4|m|ft}} diameter [[wattle and daub]] walled [[granary]].<ref name="Canmore Station Brae">{{cite web | title=Dreghorn, Station Brae | website=Canmore | url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/273864/dreghorn-station-brae | accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] was born at a Dreghorn farm on 5 February 1840. He qualified as a [[veterinary surgeon]] at the [[Dick Vet]] in Edinburgh and set up practice in [[Belfast]], where he also invented a [[pneumatic tyre]]s for bicycles in October 1887. The principle had been patented by [[Robert William Thomson]] in 1847, but it was Dunlop's invention that made a success of the idea.<ref name="Virtual Scotland 1921">{{cite web | title=John Dunlop | website=Virtual Scotland | date=23 October 1921 | url=http://www.virtualscotland.co.uk/scotland_articles/famous-scots/dunlop.htm | accessdate=22 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720155050/http://www.virtualscotland.co.uk/scotland_articles/famous-scots/dunlop.htm | archive-date=20 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Maid Morville's mound===
[[Perceton|Maid Morville's mound]] was located to the east of the B730, just north of Holmsford Bridge before it crosses the [[River Irvine]]. The name commemorated the tragic drowning of a member of the [[Richard de Morville|de Morville]] family, who were the overlords of the baillerie of Cunninghame. The mound was destroyed by construction of the earthworks of the expressway. 'Maid Morville Avenue' still exists to commemorate the event. Locally the mound was known as 'Marble Hill',  a corruption of 'Morville's Hill'.  There is also a 'Marble Avenue' nearby.

===Railway Station===
[[Dreghorn railway station|Dreghorn Station]], at the foot of Station Brae by the River Annick, provided access to rail services between Irvine and Kilmarnock. It closed in 1964 and the railway is now a public footpath and woodland.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==The Churches==
Excavations of the Neolithic site suggest ritualistic features, and early Christians including the [[Culdees]] often took over pagan religious sites for their churches. Saint [[Brendan]] influenced the area in the 6th century. It seems that relics of his fellow monk Barrintus were venerated at Dreghorn church, though this could date from a much later period. When [[Kilwinning Abbey]] was established around 1171, fourteen parishes including Dreghorn came under its control. One of the monks would have been given charge of Dreghorn parish and the church lands.<ref name="beginnings Parish Church">{{cite web | title=The beginnings | website=Dreghorn and Srpingside Parish Church | date=10 May 2011 | url=http://www.dreghornspringsidechurch.co.uk/the-beginnings.html | accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>

===Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church===
[[File:Dreghorn Parish Kirk.jpg|thumb|left|The unusual octagonal Kirk of Dreghorn]]
The [[Church of Scotland]] parish church at the top of Station Brae, dating from 1780, has an unusual octagonal plan.<ref name="Canmore Kirk">{{cite web | title=Dreghorn, Station Brae, Dreghorn And Perceton Parish Church | website=Canmore | date=25 May 1982 | url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/41905/dreghorn-station-brae-dreghorn-and-perceton-parish-church | accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> At one time, the church was known locally as the "Threepenny" after the 12-sided [[Threepence (British coin)#Brass vs silver threepences|Threepence coin]].<ref name="Ayrshire Paths NTT" />

Following the [[Scottish Reformation]], maintenance of the small rectangular church, the manse and churchyard, as well as payment of the minister's [[stipend]], was vested in local landowners, the Heritors of the Parish. After years of complaints over repairs, in February 1777 the minister, Mr Tod. petitioned the [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries#Synod of Ayr|Presbytery in Irvine]] that "a visitation be made with assistance of skilled tradesmen that the church (in Dreghorn) be pulled down and a new one built" on the same site. The Presbytery agreed in March 1777, then in 1779 they petitioned the principal Heritor, and patron of the church, [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton]], to "give in a plan of  a New Kirk". The heritors agreed in March 1780 to commence building work on the basis of his plan, in the shape of an octagon: he may have seen similar churches during his recent years spent in Europe.<ref name="Dreghorn New Church">{{cite web | title=The New Church | website=Dreghorn and Srpingside Parish Church | date=10 May 2011 | url=http://www.dreghornspringsidechurch.co.uk/the-new-church.html | accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>

Built as a school in 1774 the small building on the right of the entrance to the churchyard was in the 19th century used as a [[morthouse]] and a mortuary, with a room for each, later becoming the kirk session house.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Clow, Rob|year=2012|title=The Buildings of Scotland.

When the Parishes of Dreghorn and [[Perceton]] were united, Dreghorn and Perceton church owned the land surrounding the church (called 'The [[Glebe]]').  A current circular cul-de-sac called The Glebe commemorates this fact.<ref>The Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume 4 by [[Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet|Sir John Sinclair, Bart.]]</ref> The kirk is now called Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church.

===Perceton and Dreghorn Free Church===
In the [[Disruption of 1843]], the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] broke away. The entry for Dreghorn in [[Francis Hindes Groome|Groome's]] ''Ordnance Gazetteer'' for 1882-4 describes the village as having "a Free Church mission station and an Evangelical Union chapel; and Dreghorn Free church is at Perceton village."<ref name="A Vision of Britain through Time">{{cite web | title=Dreghorn – As described in F.H.

It later became the Church of Scotland's Perceton and Dreghorn Parish Church, but eventually congregation numbers fell, so the parishes merged and the church closed in 1992.<ref name="Kirk move 1999">{{cite web | title=Spiritually Uplifting; Scots kirk moved to Japan, brick by brick: 1999 Scottish Daily Record & Sunday | website=Free Online Library | date=1 January 2015 | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SPIRITUALLY+UPLIFTING;+Scots+kirk+moved+to+Japan,+brick+by+brick.-a060417375 | accessdate=23 February 2016}}<br>{{cite web | title=North Ayrshire | website=The Churches of Britain and Ireland | date=3 November 2015 | url=http://www.churches-uk-ireland.org/n_ayr.html | accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref> A Threatened Building Survey recorded photographs of the building in 1996.<ref name="Canmore Perceton And Dreghorn" />

The Sun Life Corporation of Japan bought the building for £50,000. In 1996 they demolished it carefully and shipped the materials to [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]], for reconstruction, at a cost of £250,000. This included the pulpit and church organ, and every block of masonry was numbered for rebuilding. The Hotel ''Sunlife Garden'' wedding complex, incorporating the reconstructed church as its central feature, was opened with a ceremony on 2 July 1999.<ref name="Kirk move 1999" /><ref name="Sunlife Garden">{{cite web | title=Hotel ''Sunlife Garden'', Hiratsuka | website=湘南のリバーサイドホテル｜ホテルサンライフガーデン【公式】 | date=31 October 2015 | url=http://www.sunlife-garden.com | language=ja | accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>

==Employment==
Dreghorn's historical main industries were farming and coal mining.  All of the coal mines around Dreghorn were closed by the early 1980s.  Dreghorn is still surrounded on two sides by farm land.  The new communities of Broomlands and Bourtreehill cover the sites of some former mines.

Dreghorn Primary School, on Main Street, had a school roll of 270 pupils in 2013, with 21 teachers.<ref name="Dreghorn Primary School">{{cite web | title=Dreghorn Primary School - North Ayrshire | website=Education Scotland | date=3 September 2015 | url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/myschool/findaschool/schools/dreghornprimaryschoolnorthayrshire.asp | accessdate=23 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303054030/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/myschool/findaschool/schools/dreghornprimaryschoolnorthayrshire.asp | archive-date=3 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Greenwood Academy, Dreghorn|Greenwood Academy]] secondary school at the west end of the village serves several areas of Irvine as well as Dreghorn.
