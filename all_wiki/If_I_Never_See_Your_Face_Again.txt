Jerome Blakeney for BBC wrote that "If I Never See Your Face Again", along with another ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long'' track "[[Makes Me Wonder]]", were "monster weapons of mass-marketing aimed at the feet and riding on swathes of string-drenched, synth-crunching disco."<ref name="BBC"/> A reviewer for IGN was complimentary of 'If I Never See Your Face Again', writing that it is hard to resist listening to the song.<ref name="IGN"/> The reviewer also noted that Levine appeared to adopt a vocal style reminiscent of techniques employed by [[Justin Timberlake]], writing "Like Justin Timberlake it's all about the high pitched tenor falsetto and some sinewy grooves."<ref name="IGN"/>

Bill Lamb for [[About.com]] noted that "If I Never See Your Face Again" and "Makes Me Wonder" appeared to be inspired by British [[jazz funk]] and [[acid jazz]] [[musical ensemble|band]] [[Jamiroquai]], writing "Any Jamiroquai fan may call foul if they listen to 'If I Never See Your Face Again' or 'Makes Me Wonder'."<ref name="Lamb">{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/maroon5soonlong.htm|title=Maroon 5 - ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long''|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani was critical of the song, labeling it as "nasty."<ref name="Slant">{{cite news|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/maroon-5-it-wont-be-soon-before-long/1117|title=Maroon 5 - ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long''|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2007-05-19|accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> Alex Fletcher for Digital Spy disapproved of the collaboration between the band and Rihanna, with specific thoughts on Levine and Rihanna's pairing.<ref name="DS"/> Fletcher was critical of their vocal performance, writing that their voices clashed with one another and that "the sexual chemistry radar for the pairing registers at zero."<ref name="DS"/> Fletcher commented about the song further, writing that it should never have left the recording studio.<ref name="DS"/>

It's really stylish and really beautiful&nbsp;... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just get up there and screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." In response, Rihanna continued to say that "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video&nbsp;... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it."<ref name="GuardianVideo"/>

===Synopsis===

The video begins with the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting opposite each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one another. Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first [[Verse (popular music)#Verse|verse]] and [[Refrain|chorus]]. In the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lies suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to temptation. He walks to the end of the table where Rihanna sits and caresses her neck, causing her to lean towards him seductively. The two nearly kiss as the video ends.
