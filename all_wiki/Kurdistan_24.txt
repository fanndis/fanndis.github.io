==Controversies==
The [[2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum]] created a high level of political and military tension between the autonomous [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] and the governments of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey.  In the aftermath of this referendum, Kurdistan 24 became a political target.

Turkey removed three television channels based in [[Southern Kurdistan]], including Kurdish news agency Kurdistan 24, from its [[Turksat (satellite)|TurkSat]] satellite, allegedly over broadcasting violations during the Kurdistan Region's independence referendum.<ref>{{cite web|title=3 TV channels, to be removed from TurkSat over broadcasting violations|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2017/09/25/3-tv-channels-including-krgs-rudaw-to-be-removed-from-turksat-over-broadcasting-violations|website=DailySabah}}</ref>

The audio/visual media office of the Iraqi government’s Media and Communications Commission issued a decree ordering the shutdown of Kurdistan 24 TV broadcast, the banning of its crew and seizure of their equipment across Iraq. The decree claimed the grounds for the move was that Kurdistan 24 is not licensed, and for programs “that incite violence and hate and target social peace and security.” However, Kurdistan 24 is licensed by the Ministry of Culture of the Kurdistan Regional Government, which under the Iraqi Constitution is empowered to run its own affairs.<ref>{{cite news|website=Rudaw|title=Iraq’s Media and Communications Commission bans Rudaw|url=https://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/281020173|date=28 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|website=Kurdistan 24|title=Journalist organizations in Iraq, Kurdistan criticize Baghdad’s banning of Kurdistan 24|url=https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/06a8ec75-2574-49a4-8f6e-8f64f33583ca|date=28 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|website=Rudaw|title=Kurdistan Parliament: Decision to ban Kurdish media 'contrary' to Iraqi law|url=https://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/311020176|date=31 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|website=Kurdistan 24|title=Efforts on the way to lift ban on Kurdistan 24 in Iraq: Iraqi Deputy Parliament Speaker|url=https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/724154f0-1d14-4bd9-a797-2c43a63fc89a|date=14 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
Kurdistan 24 is sometimes considered as propaganda machine, of Nechirvan Barzani (Massoud barzani's eldest son), and to counter Nechirvan Barzani’s Rudaw, which is also considered a propaganda machine of [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] by several international and local sources.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kurda|first=Ahmed|date=2016-05-21|title=Iraqi Kurdish Media: Truth, lies & the Kurdistan24 TV channel|url=https://ekurd.net/kurdish-media-truth-lies-kurdistan24-2016-05-21|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Kurd Net - Ekurd.net Daily News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Chomani|first=Kamal|date=2014-08-01|title=Independent media fades in Iraqi Kurdistan|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/iraq-kurdistan-free-independent-media-krg-rudaw.html|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Al-Monitor|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-06-04|title=Nechirvan Barzani’s association with media corruption … the Rudaw Company as an example|url=https://kurdistantribune.com/nechirvan-barzanis-association-media-corruption-rudaw-company-as-example/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=The Kurdistan Tribune|language=en-GB}}</ref>
