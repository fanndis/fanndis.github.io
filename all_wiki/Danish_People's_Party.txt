The DPP's stated goals are to protect the freedom and cultural heritage of the Danish people, including the family, the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Monarchy]] and the [[Church of Denmark|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark]], to enforce a strict [[rule of law]], to work against Denmark becoming a multi-cultural society by limiting [[immigration]] and promoting [[cultural assimilation]] of admitted immigrants, to maintain a strong welfare system for those in need, and to promote [[entrepreneurship]] and [[economic growth]] by strengthening education and encouraging people to work, to protect the environment and natural resources, and to protect Danish sovereignty against the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/The_Party_Program_of_the_Danish_Peoples_Party.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318100937/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/The_Party_Program_of_the_Danish_Peoples_Party.asp |archive-date=18 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In comparison to its predecessor, the [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]], the DPP focuses more on immigration, while at the same time being more pragmatic on other topics.<ref name="Topaloff"/><ref>Christoffer Green-Pedersen, Pontus Odmalm (2013).

In 2014 the party won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Denmark|European Parliament election in Denmark]] by a wide margin, securing 27% of the vote.

==History==
The party's popularity has grown since its inception, taking 25 seats in the 179-member [[Folketing]] in the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]] (13.8% of the vote, remaining the third largest party in Denmark).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7091941.stm|work=BBC News| title=Danish centre-right wins election|date=14 November 2007}}</ref> In the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 parliamentary election]], while maintaining its position as the third largest party, DPP received 12.3% of the vote, marking its first electoral decline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dst.dk/valg/Valg1204271/valgopg/valgopgHL.htm |title=Folketingsvalg torsdag 15. september 2011 |work=dst.dk |publisher=[[Statistics Denmark]] |access-date=22 October 2011}}</ref>

===Early years (1995–2001)===
The Danish People's Party was founded on 6 October 1995, after [[Pia Kjærsgaard]], [[Kristian Thulesen Dahl]], broke out from the [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]].<ref name=dfes>{{cite journal |url=http://rudar.ruc.dk/handle/1800/710 |publisher=Roskilde University Digital Archive |title=Dansk Folkeparti - en succes (The Danish people's party - a success) |year=2004 |page=9 |last1=Richter-Jørgensen |first1=Christian Bjerre |last2=Frøstrup |first2=Freja |last3=Abel Lytken |first3=Louise |last4=Gerion Johansen |first4=Christina |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715083100/http://rudar.ruc.dk/handle/1800/710 |archive-date=15 July 2012 }}</ref> Its first national convention was held in [[Vissenbjerg]] on 1 June 1996, where Pia Kjærsgaard was unanimously elected as the party's chairman.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Historie_.asp |work=Dansk Folkeparti |title=Historie |access-date=15 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725110723/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Historie_.asp |archive-date=25 July 2010 }}</ref> The party was established in protest over the "[[anarchism|anarchistic]] conditions" of the Progress Party, and its "all or nothing" policies. It was initially seen by many as a "clone" of the Progress Party, but this was soon proved false.<ref name=dfes/> In a struggle to be respected as a responsible party able to cooperate with others and distance it from the conditions in the Progress Party, the leadership of the party struck down criticism from its members by means of expulsions.<ref name=dsd>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Danske_politiske_partier_og_bev%C3%A6gelser/Dansk_Folkeparti|work=Den store dansk|title=Dansk Folkeparti|access-date=15 July 2010}}</ref> The party saw a highly centralized party leadership as necessary, as it would not tolerate internal conflicts and disagreements with the official strategy.<ref name=m99b>Meret, 2009, p. 99.</ref>

The party was the first successful parliamentary party in the Nordic countries to relate philosophically more closely to the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'', than to the previous Nordic form of right-wing populism. DPP represented a synthesis of several political currents: the Lutheran movement ''[[Tidehverv]]'' and its related journal, an intellectual nationalist right from the ''Danish Association'' (''Den Danske Forening'') and conservative populists from the Progress Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.culcom.uio.no/english/news/2008/simonsen.html|work=CULCOM|title=- A symptom of large societal changes|first=Lorenz|last=Khazaleh|date=29 March 2008}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Hervik, Peter. 2011. The Annoying Difference: The Emergence of Danish Neonationalism, Neoracism, and Populism in the Post-1989 World. Berghahn Books. p. 25.</ref>

In 1997, the party won about 7% in the municipal elections, and did very well in traditional left-wing municipalities, potentially rivaling the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].<ref name=m99>Meret, 2009, p. 98.</ref> By 1998, the party had 2,500 registered members.<ref name=m99/> The party made its electoral debut in the [[1998 Danish parliamentary election]], winning 13 seats and 7.4% of the vote. The party was, however, left with no influence in the formation of a government; it was shut out in large part due to the perception that it was not ''[[wikt:stueren|stueren]]t'' (i.e. not acceptable or "housebroken").<ref name=dsd/>

===Conservative-Liberal coalition (2001–2011)===
In the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|2001 election]], the party won 12% of the vote and 22 seats in [[Folketinget|parliament]]. It became the third largest party in the parliament, giving them a key position, as they would have a parliamentary majority together with the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]. DPP was favoured by these parties, as it had supported the Venstre candidate for Prime Minister, [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], during the election campaign.<ref name=m99b/> Eventually, it gave its parliamentary support for a Conservative-Liberal coalition government, headed by Prime Minister Rasmussen, in exchange for the implementation of some of their key demands, first and foremost stricter policies on immigration.<ref name=dsd/> The party had a key role in writing the rules and conditions for immigration in the immigration law that was established by the government in May 2002,<ref>Meret, 2009, p. 100.</ref> which it called "Europe's strictest".<ref name="bbc192"/>

In the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 election]] the party further increased their vote, and won 13.2% of the vote and 24 seats.<ref name=dsd/> By young first-time voters the party showed even more popular, receiving one fifth of their votes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:ztR2W3r-e50J:www.duf.dk/uploads/tx_templavoila/DUF_Fakta_-_Valgretsalder_-_Unges_partivalg_og_deltagelse_09.pdf+danmark+politisk+spektrum+dansk+folkeparti+venstre+konservative+folkeparti&hl=no&gl=no&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgGZWxQQ3_ivuBG6sqW5GqgLVajIUqUzP2k2sBgP0KEGiEGPX0uG06VF3WTV39Czxh29WnH-hSuubQzFOEqsG2d1iHpxeq3rfvHIdrAbMkUpu3dln0pw78oVnK9b2qarW8zE8gT&sig=AHIEtbRMLxviWJzh5_UI9zvvV7AU63MJFQ|publisher=DUF Fakta|title=Valgretsalder – unges partivalg og deltagelse|year=2009}}</ref> The party continued to support the government, and developed a broader policy base, as it made welfare policies its core issue, together with immigration policies.<ref name=dsd/>

In 2006, the party's popularity rose dramatically in [[opinion polls]] following the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], at the expense of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]. The average of all monthly national polls showed DPP gaining seven seats in parliament from January to February, with the Social Democrats losing an equal amount.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/verden/1.590989|work=NRK (NTB)|title=Dansk Folkeparti sterkt fram|date=3 March 2006|language=no}}</ref> This effect, however, somewhat waned with the falling media attention to the cartoons controversy.

In the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], DPP won 13.9% and 25 seats, and again continued to support the Conservative-Liberal government. Thus, in every election since its founding the party has had a steady growth, although the growth rate has stagnated somewhat in recent years. Parties in the political centre, particularly the newly founded [[New Alliance (Denmark)|New Alliance]] had sought to become the kingmaker and be able to isolate the immigration policies of DPP, but eventually failed.<ref name=dsd/> The party was a member of the [[Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy]] (MELD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/intern-eu-rapport-retter-skarp-kritik-af-udgifter-i-messerschmidts-europaeiske-parti|title=Intern EU-rapport retter skarp kritik af udgifter i Messerschmidts europæiske parti}}</ref><ref>http://politik.tv2.dk/2015-10-20-df-sejltur-blev-ogsaa-stoettet-af-dansk-eu-kasse</ref>

In the [[2009 European Parliament election in Denmark|2009 elections for the European Parliament]] the prime candidate for the party, [[Morten Messerschmidt]], won his seat in a landslide with 284,500 personal votes (most votes for any single candidate by any party); thus giving the party a second seat (which went to [[Anna Rosbach Andersen]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/valg/Valg1191212/other/personlige_stemmer.pdf|title=Personlige stemmer ved Europa-Parlamentsvalget 7. juni 2009|work=Danmarks Statistik}}</ref> The party made a breakthrough from its previous results in European elections, more than doubling its vote to 15.3%, and receiving 2 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.

===2019 election===

The party suffered a major defeat in the [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general election]], recording its worst result since 1998. It won just 8.7% of the vote and 16 seats, a net loss of 21 seats since 2015; it fell to third place, just narrowly outpolling the Social Liberals.

==Policies==
===Immigration===
The party holds that Denmark is not naturally a country of [[immigration]]. The party also does not accept a [[multi-ethnic]] transformation of Denmark,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Principprogram.asp|title=Principprogram|work=Dansk Folkeparti|access-date=18 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234015/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Principprogram.asp|archive-date=30 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and rejects [[multiculturalism]].<ref name=dsd/> Former party leader Pia Kjærsgaard stated she did "not want Denmark as a multiethnic, multicultural society",<ref>"Världens lyckligaste folk". 1 September 2009, [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].</ref> and that a multiethnic Denmark would be a "national disaster".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Pia_Kj%C3%A6rsgaards_tale_om_Udl%C3%A6ndingepolitik_%C3%85rsm%C3%B8det_1997.asp |work=danskfolkeparti.dk |title=Pia Kjærsgaards tale om Udlændingepolitik, Årsmødet 1997 |date=4 October 1997 |language=da |access-date=25 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716202456/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Pia_Kj%C3%A6rsgaards_tale_om_Udl%C3%A6ndingepolitik_%C3%85rsm%C3%B8det_1997.asp |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> The party seeks to drastically [[Opposition to immigration|reduce non-Western immigration]], opposes [[Islamization]], and favors [[cultural assimilation]] of immigrants. In 2010, the party proposed to put a complete stop to all immigration from non-Western countries, a continuation of a proposal the month before to toughen the [[24-year rule]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/classifieds/personals/49627.html |title=Halt on non-Western immigration proposed |work=The Copenhagen Post |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811115301/http://cphpost.dk/classifieds/personals/49627.html |archive-date=11 August 2010 }}</ref> They do, however, make the distinction between immigrants, those who intend to stay in Denmark permanently, and refugees, those that will only be in Denmark for the duration of the conflict, but ultimately intend to return home. The party has stated that it is more than happy to help those in need, but have a moral responsibility to the people of Denmark to keep Denmark Danish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danskfolkeparti.dk/politik/principprogram/|title=Dansk Folkepartis principprogram - læs om partiets værdier}}</ref>

Cooperation with the Conservative-Liberal coalition government resulted in the implementation of some of their key demands, most importantly strong restrictions in immigration policies, which have resulted in what is often described as Europe's strictest immigration laws.<ref name="bbc192">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4276963.stm|title=Denmark's immigration issue|work=BBC|date=19 February 2005}}</ref> The new government enacted rules that prevented Danish citizens and others from bringing a foreign spouse into the country unless both partners were aged 24 or above, passed a solvency test showing the Dane had not claimed social security for 12 months, and could lodge a bond of 60,011 kroner (about US$10,100). One declared aim of this was to fight [[arranged marriages]]. These new rules had the effect that while about 8,151 [[family reunification]] permits were granted in 2002, the number had fallen to 3,525 by 2005. Some social benefits for refugees were also cut by 30-40% during their first seven years in power. Ordinary unemployment benefits were replaced by a reduced "start-up aid". Whereas the government coalition's declared aim with this was to improve integration by inciting people to work, immigration spokesman [[Søren Krarup]] of DPP has expressed his content in that the start-up aid has decreased the number of economic refugees greatly, showing them that "one does not find gold on the street, as has been told out in the third world".<ref name=DR1>{{cite web|title=DF: Starthjælpen skal holde udlændinge ude|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/df-starthjaelpen-skal-holde-udlaendinge-ude|website=DR.DK|publisher=DR|access-date=29 January 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, total immigration increased post implementation of the migration reforms.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Other domestic===
The party wants to improve conditions for the [[elderly]] and disabled,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and advocates stricter punishments for crimes such as [[rape]], [[violence]], [[sexual abuse]], reckless driving, and cruelty to animals. It supports grants for specific research into [[terrorism]], [[Islamism]], and [[Cold War]] history as well as increased defense spending. It also wants to maintain the Danish [[monarchy]] and the current [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]], and to abolish the [[Hate speech#Laws against hate speech|'hate speech' clause]] in the [[Danish penalty law|Danish criminal code]].<ref>{{cite news|title=DF vil af med racismeparagraf|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/df-vil-af-med-racismeparagraf|publisher=[[dr.dk]]|access-date=4 August 2017|date=18 June 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mchangama|first1=Jacob|author-link1=Jacob Mchangama|last2=Stjernfelt|first2=Frederik|title=MEN: Ytringsfrihedens historie i Danmark|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlixDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT837|isbn=9788702216189}}</ref>

===Foreign===
The party opposes a cession of Denmark's [[sovereignty]] to the [[European Union]] and seeks to renegotiate Danish membership of the EU. It also wants to maintain the [[Danish krone]] and opposes the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/M%C3%A6rkesag-EU.asp|work=Dansk Folkeparti|title=EU-politik|access-date=25 October 2010|language=da|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019185025/http://danskfolkeparti.dk/M%C3%A6rkesag-EU.asp|archive-date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Following [[Brexit]] and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union in 2016, several members of the DPP have expressed support for holding a referendum on Denmark's membership of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bt.dk/politik/morten-messerschmidt-vi-er-meldt-ud-af-eu-inden-2030|access-date=23 April 2020|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20161201/danish-peoples-party-signals-it-may-support-leaving-eu|work=thelocal.dk|title=Danish People's Party signals support for leaving EU|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> 
 
The party seeks international recognition of [[The Republic of China|Taiwan]] and supports Taiwan in its disputes with the [[China|People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Pia_Kj%C3%A6rsgaard_DF_arbejder_for_Taiwan.asp |work=Dansk Folkeparti |title=Pia Kjærsgaard: DF arbejder for Taiwan |access-date=25 October 2010 |language=da |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716202517/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Pia_Kj%C3%A6rsgaard_DF_arbejder_for_Taiwan.asp |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> In 2007, the party opposed the Danish government's plan to [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognise the independence of Kosovo]], and maintained the territorial integrity of [[Serbia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jp.dk/indland/indland_politik/article1196907.ece|work=[[Jyllands-Posten]]|title=DF siger nej til, at regeringen anerkender Kosovo|access-date=18 November 2010|date=9 December 2007|language=da}}</ref> The DPP also opposes the recognition of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] on the grounds that there is no effective Palestinian state,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altinget.dk/udvikling/artikel/vaelgerne-vil-anerkende-palaestina|title=Vælgerne vil anerkende Palæstina |first=Kasper|last=Frandsen|date=29 January 2015|access-date=7 January 2020|work=[[Altinget]]}}</ref> and wants to move the Danish embassy in Israel to [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/dansk-folkeparti-vi-boer-ogsaa-anerkende-jerusalem-som-hovedstad|title=Dansk Folkeparti: Vi bør også anerkende Jerusalem som hovedstad|first=Emil|last=Søndergaard Ingvorsen|date=6 December 2017|access-date=7 January 2020|work=[[dr.dk]]}}</ref> The DPP also supports Danish membership of [[NATO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danskfolkeparti.dk/politik/in-another-languages-politics/1757-2/|work=Danish People's Party|access-date=4 May 2020}}</ref>

==Analysis of vote==
{{synthesis|date=November 2012}}
* An analysis by the trade union SiD after the 2001 election stated that among unskilled workers aged under 40, 30% voted for DPP and only 25% for the Social Democrats.<ref>''Dansk Folkeblad'', vol. 4, 2002.</ref>
* ''Decreased importance of "economic cleavage"'': Several authors believe that the political "cleavages" of European societies have changed over recent decades<ref>Hout, M., Brooks, C. and Manza, J. 1996. “The persistence of classes in post-industrial societies,” in Lee, D. J. and Turner, B. S. eds. Conflicts about Class. Debating Inequality in Late Industrialism. London: Longman, pp. 55–56</ref> Contemporary Western European democracies are characterized by two major cleavage dimensions: the economic cleavage dimension, which pits workers against the capital, and which concerns the degree of state involvement in the economy, and the socio-cultural cleavage dimension.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* Referendums brought the rejection of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and the [[Euro]]. The DPP has managed to harness this scepticism more effectively than others.<ref>Catherine E. De Vries & Erica E. Edwards. 2009. Taking Europe To Its Extremes Extremist Parties and Public Euroscepticism. Party Politics January 2009 vol. 15 no. 1 5-28. doi: 10.1177/1354068808097889</ref>

One feature, compared to other Danish parties, is that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in [[opinion poll]]s. Election researchers have suggested that the party's voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore declining to talk to pollsters, or that voters are reluctant to reveal their support for the party to pollsters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php/id-9238412.html?ss|title=DF er bedre end meningsmålinger|work=TV2|date=5 November 2007}}</ref>
