'''Franz Müntefering''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmʏntəˌfeːʁɪŋ|lang|De-Franz Müntefering.ogg}}; born 16 January 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] politician and industrial manager. He was Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 2004 to 2005 and again from 18 October 2008 to 13 November 2009. He served as Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], from 2005 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Müntefering was born in [[Neheim]] (now part of [[Arnsberg]]). He trained as an industrial salesman and worked for local metalwork companies.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/890004d6-7e07-11dd-bdbd-000077b07658.html Franz Müntefering] ''[[Financial Times]]'', September 9, 2008.</ref>

==Political career==
Müntefering joined the SPD in 1966. He was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1975 to 1992 and again since 1998; from 1995 to 1998 he was a member of the Landtag (state parliament) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

Müntefering was ''Bundesgeschäftsführer'' (executive director) of the national SPD from 1995 to 1998. In this capacity, he managed the 1998 campaign that returned the SPD to power in the federal government after 16 years in opposition.<ref name="wsj.com">William Boston (March 22, 2002) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1016740944884886200 Schroeder's Campaign Manager Testifies in SPD Finance Scandal] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

From 1998 until 1999, Müntefering briefly held the post of Minister of Transportation and Construction in the first cabinet of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. In this capacity, he organized the government's move from Bonn to Berlin.<ref>Roger Cohen (August 24, 1999) [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/24/world/schroder-moves-and-so-does-germany-s-center-of-gravity.html Schroder Moves, and So Does Germany's Center of Gravity] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

Müntefering was the first to hold the new post of SPD Secretary General from 1999 to 2002, and thereafter became leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag. In February 2004 he was designated to succeed Schröder as party chairman in March 2004.<ref>Udo Kempf/ Hans-Georg Merz (eds.): ''Kanzler und Minister 1998-2005. Biographisches Lexikon der deutschen Bundesregierungen''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, p. 243.</ref>

Following Schröder’s defeat in the close [[2005 German federal election|2005 elections]], Müntefering helped form a [[grand coalition]] under the new [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] and her center-right [[CDU/CSU]] parties.<ref>Nicholas Kulish and Judy Dempsey (November 14, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/europe/14germany.html German Official Resigns in Blow to Coalition] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> During the coalition talks, on 31 October 2005, Müntefering's favoured candidate for Secretary General of the SPD, [[Kajo Wasserhövel]], was defeated by the left-wing candidate [[Andrea Nahles]] in a preliminary internal election. Müntefering subsequently announced his intention to resign as SPD Chairman, and was succeeded by [[Matthias Platzeck]] at the next party convention on 15 November 2005.

Müntefering became Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and Vice-Chancellor in the cabinet of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] on 22 November 2005. During his time in office, the government agreed to raise the retirement age in steps to 67 from 65 by 2029.

After two years in those posts, Müntefering's spokesman said on 13 November 2007 that Müntefering would resign from them later in the month. The decision was said to be based on "purely familial reasons".<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2901628,00.html "German Labor Minister Müntefering to Resign"], ''Deutsche Welle'', November 13, 2007.</ref> Later in the day, Müntefering said that he would leave his positions in the government on 21 November attributing his decision to the illness of his wife, Ankepetra, who was suffering from cancer.<ref>Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [https://archive.is/20120525104505/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&refer=europe "Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits"], Bloomberg.com, 13 November 2007.</ref> Upon leaving office on 21 November 2007, he was replaced as Vice-Chancellor by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and as Minister of Labor by [[Olaf Scholz]], both of whom are also members of the SPD.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/21/europe/EU-POL-Germany-Merkels-Two-Years.php "Merkel defends record as Germany's tense governing coalition hits 2-year mark"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 21 November 2007.</ref>

Müntefering's wife Ankepetra died on 31 July 2008. Following her death, Müntefering decided to return to active politics and was elected Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] on 18 October 2008.<ref name=Picked>Judy Dempsey, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/07/europe/germ.php "German foreign minister picked to challenge Merkel"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 7 September 2008.</ref> On 7 September 2008, [[Kurt Beck]] had resigned as SPD Chairman.<ref name=Picked/><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm "German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election"], Xinhua, 7 September 2008.</ref>

Following the SPD's defeat in the [[2009 German federal election|federal election of 2009]], Müntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party.

==Political positions==
In April 2005, Müntefering criticized the market economy of Germany and proposed more state involvement to promote economic justice. In this speech, he described private equity firms as "[[Locust (finance)|locust]]s". He subsequently published a "locust list" of companies, which he circulated within the SPD.<ref>http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,354733,00.html</ref> This began a debate which dominated the national news, being the subject of front-page articles and covered on the main television news broadcasts nearly every day. Müntefering's suggestions were criticized by employers and many economists, but met with popular support (up to 75% in some opinion polls). The word has since found its way into German language as an established term for shady financial business practices.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving active politics, Müntefering has held a variety of honorary positions, including the following:
* [[Berlin Demography Forum]], Chairman of the Advisory Board
* [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] (FES), Member<ref>[https://www.fes.de/stiftung/organigramm-gremien/mitgliederversammlung/ Members] [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] (FES).</ref>
* [[Witten/Herdecke University]], Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2014)<ref>[http://www.uni-wh.de/aktuelles/detailansicht/artikel/franz-muentefering-neu-im-kuratorium-der-universitaet-wittenherdecke-1/ Franz Müntefering neu im Kuratorium der Universität Witten/Herdecke] [[Witten/Herdecke University]], press release of November 14, 2014</ref>
* [[Herbert Wehner|Herbert and Greta Wehner Foundation]], Member of the Board (since 2002)
* Deutsche Hospiz- und PalliativStiftung, Member of the Board of Trustees<ref>[http://www.dhp-stiftung.de/stiftung_stiftungsrat.html Board of Trustees] Deutsche Hospiz- und PalliativStiftung.</ref>

Müntefering was a SPD delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2017.<ref>[https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/dokumentenarchiv/Dokument/MMD16-13713.pdf Wahl der Mitglieder für die 16. Bundesversammlung] [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]], decision of 14 December 2016.</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2002, news surfaced that, while Müntefering was head of the SPD in the North Rhine-Westphalia during the 1990s, local officials in the city of Cologne and possibly elsewhere allegedly engaged in corruption that involved illegal political donations from builders of waste-disposal facilities. Müntefering denied any knowledge of the anonymous donations and launched an internal investigation into all contracts awarded for the construction of waste-disposal facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1990s. On March 22, he testified about the affair before Parliament's investigative committee.<ref name="wsj.com"/>
