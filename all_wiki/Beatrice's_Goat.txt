'''''Beatrice's Goat''''' is a 2001 [[children's story]] book based on the true account of Beatrice Biira, an impoverished [[Uganda]]n girl whose life is transformed by the gift of a [[goat]] from the nonprofit world hunger organization [[Heifer International]]. The picture book, written by [[Page McBrier]] and illustrated by [[Lori Lohstoeter]], shows how the arrival of the goat sustains the family, and allows Beatrice to achieve her dream of attending school.

In an afterword, [[Hillary Clinton]] writes, "''Beatriceâ€™s Goat'' is a heartwarming reminder that families, wherever they live, can change their lives for the better." A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the book support Heifer International.

The book received a [[Christopher Award]] and made [[Tennessee]]'s Volunteer State Book Award Master List.

The true account was covered by ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/11/60minutes/main666166.shtml?CMP=ILC-SearchStories|title=Beatrice's Goat Fed A Dream: Bob Simon Reports On A Girl From Uganda Who Made It To A Prep School In America|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|date=February 11, 2009|work=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>
