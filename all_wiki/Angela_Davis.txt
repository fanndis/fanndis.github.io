'''Angela Yvonne Davis''' (born January 26, 1944) is an American political activist, philosopher, academic, and author. She is a professor [[emeritus|emerita]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Davis was a longtime member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) and is a founding member of the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]] (CCDS). She is the author of over ten books on [[social class|class]], [[feminism]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], and the [[incarceration in the United States|US prison system]]. 

Born to an [[African Americans|African-American]] family in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Davis studied French at [[Brandeis University]] and philosophy at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]]. Studying under the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], a prominent figure in the [[Frankfurt School]], Davis became increasingly engaged in [[far-left politics]]. Returning to the United States, she studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]], before moving to [[East Germany]], where she completed a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. After returning to the United States, she joined the Communist Party and became involved in numerous causes, including the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]] and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against the Vietnam War]]. In 1969 she was hired as an acting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language. 

In 1970, guns belonging to Davis were used in an [[Marin County Civic Center attacks|armed takeover of a courtroom in Marin County]], [[California]], in which four people were killed. Prosecuted for three capital felonies, including conspiracy to murder, and held in jail for over a year, she was acquitted of all charges in 1972. She visited [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in the 1970s and during the 1980s was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]; at this time, she also held the position of professor of [[ethnic studies]] at [[San Francisco State University]]. Much of her work focused on [[Prison abolition movement|the abolition of prisons]] and in 1997 she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison–industrial complex]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Some Scholars Have Long Talked About Abolishing the Police.

What Comes Next?|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Some-Scholars-Have-Long-Talked/249149|date=9 July 2020|website=Chronicle of Higher Education|last=Pettit|first=Emma}}</ref> In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she helped start the CCDS, a platform initially operating inside the CPUSA seeking to reorient the party's ideology away from orthodox communism. When the majority of party members voted against CCDS proposals, along with CCDS colleagues, she left the CPUSA. Also in 1991, she joined the [[Women's studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008. Since then she has continued to write and remained active in movements such as [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.

Davis has received various awards, including the Soviet Union's [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. Accused of supporting political violence, she has sustained criticism from the highest levels of the US government. She has also been criticized for supporting the Soviet Union and its satellites.<ref>https://thebulwark.com/the-real-stain-on-angela-davis-legacy-is-her-support-for-tyranny/</ref> Davis has been inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/angela-davis/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Angela Davis]</ref> In 2020 she was listed as the 1971 "Woman of the Year" in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "100 Women of the Year" edition, which covered the 100 years that began with women's suffrage in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Magazine |first1=Time |title=100 Women of the Year |url=https://time.com/5793638/angela-davis-100-women-of-the-year/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=2 June 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Angela Davis was born on January 26, 1944,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/individuals/angela-davis |title=Angela Davis (January 26, 1944) |website=African American Heritage |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |access-date=January 24, 2020 }}</ref> in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Her family lived in the "Dynamite Hill" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class black people who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> She had two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania. Ben played [[defensive back]] for the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Detroit Lions]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="Aptheker-1999">{{cite book|last1=Aptheker|first1=Bettina|author-link1=Bettina Aptheker|title=The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis|url=https://archive.org/details/morningbreakstri00apth|url-access=registration|edition=2nd|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|isbn=0801485975}}</ref>

Davis attended Carrie A. Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South. Davis grew up surrounded by communist organizers and thinkers, who significantly influenced her intellectual development.<ref name="Interview-Angela Davis">{{cite journal|last=Kum-Kum Bhavnani|first=Bhavnani|author2=Davis, Angela|title=Complexity, Activism, Optimism: An Interview with Angela Y. Davis|journal=Feminist Review|date=Spring 1989|issue=31|pages=66–81|jstor=1395091}}</ref>
[[File:Angela_Davis_10-year-old_Girl_Scouts.tif|thumb|Davis as a 10-year-old Girl Scout in Birmingham, Alabama, the place whence, she says, "my political involvement stems"]]
Davis was involved in her church youth group as a child, and attended Sunday school regularly. She attributes much of her political involvement to her involvement with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts of the United States of America]]. She also participated in the Girl Scouts 1959 [[Girl Scout Senior Roundup|national roundup]] in [[Colorado]]. As a Girl Scout, she marched and picketed to protest racial segregation in Birmingham.<ref>"The Radicalization of Angela Davis," ''Ebony'', July 1971: n.p., Mag.</ref>

By her junior year of high school, Davis had been accepted by an [[American Friends Service Committee]] (Quaker) program that placed black students from the South in [[Racial integration|integrated]] schools in the North. She chose [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. There she was recruited by a Communist youth group, Advance.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bubbins|first=Harry|date=2018-01-26|title=Angela Davis: Her Greenwich Village Connections|url=https://www.villagepreservation.org/2018/01/26/happy-birthday-angela-davis-2/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Village Preservation|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Education==

===Brandeis University===
Davis was awarded a scholarship to [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]], where she was one of three black students in her class. She encountered the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] at a rally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and became his student. In a 2007 television interview, Davis said, "Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist|title=The Bourgeois Marxist|author=Barbarella Fokos|publisher=sandiegoreader.com|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref> She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland and attended the eighth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Helsinki, Finland|Helsinki]]. She returned home in 1963 to a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] interview about her attendance at the Communist-sponsored festival.<ref name="Waters">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Waters}}</ref>

During her second year at Brandeis, Davis decided to major in French and continued her intensive study of philosopher and writer [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed. She grieved deeply as she was personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name="Waters"/>

Nearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote in her autobiography, was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'', a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name="Waters"/>

===University of Frankfurt===
[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Davis studied the work of philosophers Kant, Hegel, and Adorno.]]
In Germany, with a monthly stipend of $100, she lived first with a German family and later with a group of students in a loft in an old factory. After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]]. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union]] (SDS), and Davis participated in some SDS actions. Events in the United States, including the formation of the [[Black Panther Party]] and the transformation of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) to an all-black organization, drew her interest upon her return.<ref name="Waters" />

===Postgraduate work===
Marcuse had moved to a position at the [[University of California, San Diego]], and Davis followed him there after her two years in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name="Waters"/> On her way back, she stopped in London to attend a conference on "The Dialectics of Liberation". The black contingent at the conference included the Trinidadian-American<!-- description per his own article --> [[Stokely Carmichael]] and the British [[Michael X]]. Although moved by Carmichael's rhetoric, Davis was reportedly disappointed by her colleagues' [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] sentiments and their rejection of communism as a "white man's thing."<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Flames}}</ref>

She joined the Che-Lumumba Club, an all-black branch of the Communist Party USA named for international Communist sympathizers and leaders [[Che Guevara]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]], of Cuba and the Congo, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angela Davis Biography: Academic, Civil Rights Activist, Scholar, Women's Rights Activist|url=http://www.biography.com/people/angela-davis-9267589|website=biography|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC.|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Beginning in 1969, Davis was an acting assistant professor in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy department]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Although both [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] had tried to recruit her, she opted for UCLA because of its urban location.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1427|title=Encyclopedia of Alabama|publisher=Auburn University|date=January 8, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref> At that time she was known as a [[radical feminist]] and activist, a member of the Communist Party USA, and an affiliate of the Los Angeles Chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref name="BookTV">{{cite episode|title=Interview with Angela Davis|series=BookTV|airdate=October 3, 2004}}</ref><ref name="Angela Y.

Davis was a supporter of the [[Soledad Brothers]], three inmates who were accused of killing a prison guard at [[Correctional Training Facility|Soledad Prison]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Angela Davis Biography: Academic, Civil Rights Activist, Scholar, Women's Rights Activist|url=http://www.biography.com/people/angela-davis-9267589|website=biography|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

On August 7, 1970, heavily armed 17-year-old African-American high-school student [[Jonathan P. Jackson|Jonathan Jackson]], whose brother was [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], one of the three Soledad Brothers, gained control of a courtroom in [[Marin County, California]]. He armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages.<ref name="Trial-1">{{cite book|last=Aptheker|first=Bettina|title=The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press}}</ref><ref name="Register-Guard">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Search broadens for Angela Davis|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=August 17, 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4BkRAAAAIBAJ&pg=6482%2C3554926|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref> As Jackson transported the hostages and two black defendants away from the courtroom, one of the defendants, James McClain, shot at the police. The police returned fire. The judge and the three black men were killed in the melee; one of the jurors and the prosecutor were injured.

As California considers "all persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense&nbsp;... principals in any crime so committed", Davis was charged with "aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley", and Marin County Superior Court Judge Peter Allen Smith issued a warrant for her arrest. Hours after the judge issued the warrant on August 14, 1970, a massive attempt to find and arrest Davis began. On August 18, four days after the warrant was issued, the FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] listed Davis on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List]]; she was the third woman and the 309th person to be listed.<ref name="Trial-1"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Davis (Angela) Legal Defense Collection, 1970–1972|url=http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/scm/scmdavisa|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref>

Soon after, Davis became a fugitive and fled California. According to her autobiography, during this time she hid in friends' homes and moved at night.

On January 5, 1971, Davis appeared at Marin County Superior Court and declared her innocence before the court and nation: "I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California." [[John Abt]], [[general counsel]] of the [[Communist Party USA]], was one of the first attorneys to represent Davis for her alleged involvement in the shootings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abt|first1=John|author-link1=John Abt|last2=Myerson|first2=Michael|title=Advocate and Activist: Memoirs of an American Communist Lawyer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9REaIPPh4k4C|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Illinois|isbn=978-0-252-02030-8}}</ref>

While being held in the Women's Detention Center, Davis was initially segregated from other prisoners, in [[solitary confinement]].

Across the nation, thousands of people began organizing a movement to gain her release. In New York City, black writers formed a committee called the Black People in Defense of Angela Davis. By February 1971 more than 200 local committees in the United States, and 67 in foreign countries, worked to free Davis from prison.

==Later academic career==
[[File:Angela Davis urges - declare your independence - vote for Hall and Tyner LCCN2016648082.jpg|thumb|[[Communist Party USA]] 1976 campaign poster featuring Davis]]
Davis was a lecturer at the Claremont Black Studies Center at [[the Claremont Colleges]] in 1975. Attendance at the course she taught was limited to 26 students out of the more than 5,000 on campus, and she was forced to teach in secret because alumni benefactors didn't want her to indoctrinate the general student population with Communist thought. College trustees made arrangements to minimize her appearance on campus, limiting her seminars to Friday evenings and Saturdays, "when campus activity is low." Her classes moved from one classroom to another and the students were sworn to secrecy. Much of this secrecy continued throughout Davis's brief time teaching at the colleges.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holles|first=Everett R.|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-job.html|title=Angela Davis Job Debated on Coast|publisher=East Bay|date=November 16, 1975|accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref> In 2020 it was announced that Davis would be the Ena H.

As early as 1969, Davis began public speaking engagements. She expressed her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison–industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969, she blamed [[imperialism]] for the troubles oppressed populations suffer: 
<blockquote>We are facing a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to separate those struggles, anyone who would say that in order to consolidate an anti-war movement, we have to leave all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right into the hands of the enemy, she declared.<ref name="Speech-Vietnam">{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Speech by Angela Davis at a Black Panther Rally in Bobby Hutton Park|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/04/15/18589458.php|work=East Bay|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2001 she publicly spoke against the war on terror following the [[9/11 attacks]], continued to criticize the prison–industrial complex, and discussed the broken immigration system. She said that to solve social justice issues, people must "hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them." Later, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, she declared that the "horrendous situation in New Orleans" was due to the country's structural racism, capitalism, and imperialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKENb33U4E|work=YouTube|title=Angela Davis making a live public speech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

Davis opposed the 1995 [[Million Man March]], arguing that the exclusion of women from this event promoted [[male chauvinism]].
