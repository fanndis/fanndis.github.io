In the same year, he was a co-author of a policy pamphlet ''Direct Democracy: An Agenda For A New Model Party'' which included statements supporting denationalising the NHS and suggested replacing it with "a new system of health provision in which people would pay money into personal health accounts, which they could then use to shop around for care from public and private providers. Those who could not afford to save enough would be funded by the state".<ref name="toby">{{cite news|last1=Helm|first1=Toby|last2=Syal|first2=Rajeev|date=16 August 2009|title=Key Tory MPs backed call to dismantle NHS|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/16/tory-mps-back-nhs-dismantling|access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Hunt later denied that the policy pamphlet expresses his views.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-privatise-nhs-tories-privatising-private-insurance-market-replacement-direct-democracy-a6865306.html|title=Jeremy Hunt co-authored book calling for NHS to be replaced with private insurance|work=The Independent|date=10 February 2016|last=Stone|first=Jon}}</ref> In David Cameron's reshuffle of 2 July 2007, Hunt joined the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]].

===Expenses===
In 2009, Hunt was investigated by the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/labour-mps-expenses/6780793/MPs-expenses-Jeremy-Hunt-to-repay-9500.html|title=MPs' expenses: Jeremy Hunt to repay £9,500|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 December 2009|access-date=19 January 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref name=PC>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmstnprv/157/15702.htm|title=Standards and Privileges Committee&nbsp;– Fourth Report Mr Jeremy Hunt |publisher=Standards and Privilege Committee|date=10 December 2009|access-date=4 January 2011}}</ref> The commissioner found: "Mr Hunt was in breach of the rules in not reducing his claims on the Additional Costs Allowance in that period to take full account of his agent's living costs. As a result, public funds provided a benefit to the constituency agent ... Mr Hunt received no real financial benefit from the arrangement and that the error was caused by his misinterpretation of the rules."<ref name=PC/>

Hunt's offer to repay half the money (£9,558.50) was accepted.<ref name=PC/> Hunt repaid £1,996 for claiming the expenses of his Farnham home while claiming the mortgage of his Hammersmith home.<ref name=PC/> The commissioner said: "Mr Hunt has readily accepted that he was in error, and in breach of the rules of the House, in making a claim for utilities and other services on his Farnham home in the period during which it was still his main home. He has repaid the sum claimed, £1,996, in full. It is clear that, as a new Member in May 2005, his office arrangements were at best disorganised."<ref name=PC/> The ''Legg Report'' showed no other issues.<ref name=leg>{{cite web |date=4 February 2010|title=Review of past ACA payments|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmmemest/348/348.pdf|page=86|publisher=House of Commons Members Estimate Committee|access-date=5 February 2010}}</ref>

===Views on Brexit===
Hunt supported Britain remaining in the European Union (EU) in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After the result which supported [[Brexit]] was announced, Hunt suggested a second referendum on the terms of any exit deal with him personally backing one in which the UK would stay in the [[European Single Market|Single Market]].<ref>{{cite news

In July 2018, Hunt expressed fears over the UK potentially leaving the EU without a deal. He said that it would be "incredibly challenging economically" and that "It would lead to a fissure in relations which would be highly damaging for that great partnership that we have had for so many years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-accident-scenario-eu-waits-uk-blink-jeremy-hunt-a8459881.html No-deal Brexit could happen 'by accident', Jeremy Hunt says] ''[[The Independent]]''</ref> In a December 2018 interview with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', he suggested the UK would "flourish and prosper" even without a deal, although he continued to back the Brexit withdrawal agreement proposed by Theresa May.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Malnick |first1=Edward |title=Jeremy Hunt: UK will 'flourish and prosper' if it walks away from the EU without a deal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/12/15/jeremy-hunt-uk-will-flourish-prosper-walks-away-eu-without-deal/ |access-date=23 December 2018 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 December 2018}}</ref> In March 2019 he stated that a "lot more work" was needed to get MPs to back May's deal but there were "encouraging signs" that progress was being made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47607186|title=Passing Brexit deal needs 'a lot more work'|date=18 March 2019|access-date=5 June 2019|work=BC News}}</ref>

=== Property interests ===
In April 2018, ''The Daily Telegraph'' revealed that Hunt breached anti-money laundering legislation by failing to declare his 50 per cent interest in a property firm to [[Companies House]] within the required 28 days. Hunt also failed to disclose his interest in the property firm on the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards|Parliamentary Register of Members’ interests]] within the required 28 days.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mikhailova|first=Anna|date=12 April 2018|title=Exclusive: Jeremy Hunt admits breaking Government's own rules over company he used to buy seven flats|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/12/exclusive-jeremy-hunt-admits-breaking-governments-rules-company/|access-date=13 April 2018|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Hunt later rectified the error. A spokesman for Hunt said that Hunt's "accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight." In response, a spokesman for Downing Street agreed with the [[Cabinet Office]] that there was no breach of the ministerial code. The Labour Party referred Hunt to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards|parliamentary commissioner for standards]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=13 April 2018|title=Labour to refer Hunt to Parliament watchdog|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43748513|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' revealed that Hunt was able to buy seven luxury flats at Alexandra Wharf, Southampton, with the help of a bulk discount from property developer and Conservative donor Nicholas James Roach.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Rob Davies and Rajeev Syal|date=18 April 2018|title=Jeremy Hunt got 'bulk discount' on seven flats by Tory donor|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/jeremy-hunt-investigated-breach-money-laundering-rules-luxury-flats|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref>

In September 2010, ''[[The Observer]]'' reported "raised eyebrows" when Hunt's former [[parliamentary assistant]], Naomi Gummer, was given a job within the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] on a fixed-term civil service contract after Hunt had proposed departmental cuts of 35–50 per cent.<ref name="obs">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/19/jeremy-hunt-naomi-gummer-chadlington-dcms|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Jamie|last= Doward|title=Row after Tory peer's daughter is given job in culture secretary Jeremy Hunt's department|date=19 September 2010|access-date=4 January 2011|location=London}}</ref> The head of the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] questioned Hunt's motives saying, "Political independence of the civil service is a fundamental part of our democracy and we would be deeply concerned if this was being put at risk by nepotism and privilege."<ref name="obs" /> Gummer is the daughter of a Conservative [[life peer]], [[Peter Gummer, Baron Chadlington|Lord Chadlington]], who was a director of Hotcourses between 2000 and 2004.<ref name="obs" />

There was initial scepticism about his plans with concerns they could lead to BT regaining its monopoly.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meyer |first=David |url=http://www.zdnet.com/broadband-policy-could-bring-back-bt-monopoly-claims-lords-report-7000001883/ |title=Broadband policy could bring back BT monopoly, claims Lords report |publisher=[[ZDNet]]|date=31 July 2012 |access-date=27 July 2015}}</ref> While speeds did increase when he was in office this was, in the main, due to customers switching to different packages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2012/02/02/jump-in-uk-broadband-speeds/ |title=Jump in UK broadband speeds |publisher=[[Ofcom]] |date=2 February 2012 |access-date=27 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220180158/http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2012/02/02/jump-in-uk-broadband-speeds/ |archive-date=20 December 2013 }}</ref> He also spearheaded the drive for local TV and as a result of this policy [[Ofcom]] awarded local television licences to Belfast, Birmingham, Brighton & Hove, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Grimsby, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Preston, Sheffield, Southampton, and Swansea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2012/05/ofcom-invites-applications-for-first-21-local-tv-channels/ |title=Ofcom invites applications for first 21 local TV channels |publisher=Ofcom |date=10 May 2012 |access-date=27 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030103/http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2012/05/ofcom-invites-applications-for-first-21-local-tv-channels/ |archive-date=1 March 2014 }}</ref> In terms of culture policy, his main focus was to boost philanthropy given the spending cuts that the arts along with other sectors was experiencing.

===News Corporation attempted takeover of BSkyB and Leveson Inquiry===
Hunt was consequently given the [[quasi-judicial]] power to adjudicate over the [[News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB]].

His actions as a decision maker were frequently adverse to News Corp's interests. He showed a willingness to follow Ofcom's advice and to take action, to the extent recommended by the regulators, in response to the consultation."<ref name="gov.uk" />

===Hillsborough comments===
In June 2010, Hunt attracted controversy for suggesting [[football hooliganism]] played a part in the death of 96 football fans in the [[Hillsborough disaster]]; when it has been established that a lack of police control and the presence of terraces and perimeter fences were the causes of the tragedy. Margaret Aspinall, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said of Hunt's comments: "I am very angry that he has shown such ignorance of the facts. He is an absolute disgrace." Hunt later apologised saying: "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/10434714.stm|title=Jeremy Hunt 'sorry' over Hillsborough hooligans claim|publisher=BBC News|access-date=28 June 2010 | date=28 June 2010}}</ref>

In 2015, an undercover ''Daily Telegraph'' investigation showed that in some cases locum agencies, Medicare and Team24 owned by [[Capita]] were charging some hospitals higher fees than others and giving false company details.  The agencies were charging up to 49% of the fee.  Hunt criticised those who sought "big profits" at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers and promised to "reduce the margins rip-off agencies are able to generate."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/nhs/12064455/NHS-hit-by-nurses-pay-scandal.html|title=NHS hit by locum agency nurses' pay scandal|work=The Daily Telegraph|first1=Lyndsey T|last1=elford |first2=Claire|last2= Newell |first3=Edward |last3=Malnick |first4=Luke|last4= Heighton |date=22 December 2015|access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref>

===NHS weekend cover===
In July 2015, Hunt indicated he would be prepared to impose a new consultant contract on doctors in England which would remove the opt out for non-emergency work at weekends to prevent "about 6,000 avoidable deaths" resulting from "Monday to Friday culture" in the NHS and to reintroduce "a sense of vocation" in consultants.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33542940|last=Triggle|first=Nick|title=Jeremy Hunt: Doctors 'must work weekends'|publisher=BBC News|date=16 July 2015}}</ref> The comments angered doctors who responded by sharing photographs of themselves working at weekends via social media using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33578990|publisher=BBC News|title=#ImInWorkJeremy: NHS staff post weekend working photos|date=18 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=20 July 2015|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/20/iminworkjeremy-doctors-working-weekend-selfies-open-letters-jeremy-hunt-nhs|title=#ImInWorkJeremy: doctors' working weekend selfies and open letters go viral|last=Cresci|first=Elena}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/21/doctors-decisions-ill-informed-jeremy-hunt-people-die-iminworkjeremy|title=If doctors made decisions as ill-informed as Jeremy Hunt's, people would die|last=Certic|first=Katya}}</ref> Hunt was criticised by statisticians [[David Spiegelhalter]] and David Craven, BMA council chair [[Mark Porter (anaesthetist)|Mark Porter]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care|Shadow Health Secretary]] [[Heidi Alexander]] for his claims not merely misrepresenting the facts but potentially causing patients to delay hospitals visits and put themselves at risk.

In October 2015, Hunt was accused by the editor of ''[[The BMJ]]'' [[Fiona Godlee]] of repeatedly misrepresenting a study published in the journal on the [[weekend effect]].

In January 2016, Hunt was criticised by stroke doctors for using out-of-date data to show stroke patients were more likely to die if admitted at weekends.

Hunt supported the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian]]-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] and described Saudi Arabia as a "very, very important military ally".

In July 2018, Hunt visited [[China]] and met China's foreign minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]]. Hunt said that the "UK-China Strategic Dialogue is an important opportunity to intensify our cooperation on shared challenges in international affairs, ranging from global free trade to non-proliferation and environmental challenges, under the UK-China Global Partnership and 'Golden Era' for [[China–United Kingdom relations|UK-China relations]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=UK's new foreign minister in China for first overseas visit |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-china-hunt/uks-new-foreign-minister-in-china-for-first-overseas-visit-idUSKBN1KJ0PI |agency=Reuters |date=30 July 2018}}</ref> In October 2018, he criticised the [[Xinjiang re-education camps]] and human rights abuses against the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[Islam in China|Muslim]] minority in [[China]], saying: "British diplomats who visited Xinjiang have confirmed that reports of mass internment camps for Uighur Muslims were 'broadly true'."<ref>{{cite news|date=22 December 2018|title=Muslim cleansing: A global pandemic?|work=Al-Jazeera|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/muslim-cleansing-global-pandemic-181220084045168.html}}</ref>

Hunt supported the continued efforts of the government to leave the European Union. During the September 2018 Conservative conference, Hunt likened the [[European Union]] to the former [[USSR]], saying: "It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. The lesson from history is clear: If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish." This comment was strongly criticised.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stone, Jon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-eu-membership-ussr-latvia-brexit-foreign-secretary-a8562726.html |title=Jeremy Hunt rebuked by Latvian ambassador for likening EU membership to Soviet occupation |work=The Independent |date=1 October 2018 |access-date=17 January 2019}}</ref> While on a February 2019 Brexit-related visit to [[Ljubljana]], he caused anger by congratulating his hosts on "making really remarkable transformation from a Soviet vassal state to a modern European democracy."

In November 2018, Hunt threatened the [[United Arab Emirates]] with "serious diplomatic consequences" after it sentenced British research student [[Matthew Hedges]] to life in prison for allegedly spying for the UK.

Following [[Boris Johnson]]'s election victory, Hunt was offered a different role to Foreign Secretary in Johnson's [[First Johnson ministry|Cabinet]] but had decided to turn it down. He said on [[Twitter]]: "I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but understand the need for a new Prime Minister to choose his team.
