"'''Spirit'''" is a song by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for the [[The Lion King (2019 soundtrack)|soundtrack of the photorealistic remake of ''The Lion King'']] and the companion album ''[[The Lion King: The Gift]]''. Released on July 10, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/beyonce-releasing-new-song-spirit-tonight-curates-lion-king-album/|title=Listen to Beyoncé's Song 'Spirit' From New Lion King Album|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last1=Strauss|first1=Matthew|last2=Minsker|first2=Evan|date=July 10, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref> it was written and produced by [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]], [[Labrinth]] and Beyoncé.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/beyonce-new-song-lion-king-album-spirit-nala-movie-1203263043/|title=Beyonce to Release New Single 'Spirit' for 'Lion King'-Inspired Album|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Tingley|first=Anna|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref> Lyrically, the song discusses Simba's, the film's main protagonist's return home and is played during that particular scene in the film. "Spirit" is a [[gospel]] ballad that opens with lyrics chanted in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] by male choristers.

Upon its release, "Spirit" received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised Beyoncé's full vocal range display and the [[African music]]al undertones. The song charted at number 98 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 6 on the US [[Hot R&B Songs]] chart, while also entering the charts in numerous European countries. A [[music video]] directed by [[Jake Nava]] was filmed at [[Havasu Falls]] in Arizona and Apple Valley, California and premiered on July 16, 2019. It shows Beyoncé performing a dancing choreography surrounded by African dancers and choristers in a desert-like environment and features a cameo appearance by her daughter, [[Blue Ivy Carter]]. Upon its release, the video was positively received by most critics who praised the scenery of the location and Beyoncé's fashion style.

==Background==
In a Huffpost interview with [[Hans Zimmer]], he explained that "Spirit" was the final addition to the soundtrack and was initially slotted in for the end credits.

"At the last moment, she comes to the room and basically shows us a diamond and goes, ‘If you want it, you can have it." "Every musician has a habit of when they come into the room to play you something for the first time ... We’re all just a tiny little bit nervous how it lands,” he said. “Of course, everybody's reaction — we absolutely adored it. It was absolutely perfect for the film.”
I suddenly thought, ‘No, no, no. This song is a gift. This song does a great bit of storytelling.’ ... I just thought, ‘Hang on. We should try this at this different spot as opposed to the end title.’ I think it will be, if it's in the body of the movie and it's over a crucial scene, I think it will have much more resonance and weight."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beyonce-spirit-lion-king-hans-zimmer_n_5d264cf1e4b07e698c44f76a|title=Here's How Beyoncé's New Song 'Spirit' Wound Up In 'The Lion King'|date=July 11, 2019|website=HuffPost Canada=|access-date=July 13, 2019}}</ref>

The cover art for the single features a shot of Beyoncé's face next to the CGI face of Nala, the character she portrays in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/10/20688891/beyonce-lion-king-the-gift-song-spirit|title=Of course Beyoncé’s new song for The Lion King is perfect|first=Allegra|last=Frank|date=July 10, 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}</ref>

==Composition and lyrics==
The song opens with two male backing vocals singing the lines "Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] which translate to "Long live the king" in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a28410596/beyonce-spirit-lyrics-meaning/|title=The Lyrics to Beyoncé's "Spirit" Perfectly Match The Lion King's Theme|first=Celia|last=Fernandez|work=[[Oprah Magazine]]|date=July 16, 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> These vocals are also featured later throughout the song preserving the song's traditional African choral sound. According to Pitchfork's Michelle Kim, sonically, the song is an amalgam of African music with American South music.<ref name="kim">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/beyonce-spirit/|title="Spirit" by Beyoncé Review|work=Pitchfork|first=Michelle|last=Kim|date=July 10, 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>

In the film, "Spirit" can be heard during the scene in which Simba goes back home with Nala in the Pride Lands. He has grown up and established friendly relationships with Timon and Pumbaa. Nala, however, convinces him to return home in order to reclaim the throne that rightfully belongs to him and has been taken by Scar who has allowed the hyenas to overrule the kingdom. The song's lyrics are straightforward and in accordance with the scene as they portray the main protagonist's return home in an attempt to rectify the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/beyonces-spirit-plays-in-the-lion-king-over-a-big-triumphant-moment-18203730|title=Beyonce’s "Spirit" Plays In ‘The Lion King’ Over A Big, Triumphant Moment|work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|first=Lia|last=Becl|date=July 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>

==International versions==
At the time of its original theatrical release, the film was released in 44 versions worldwide, with the song ''Spirit'' counting as many versions overall. Nala's [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubber [[Iza (singer)|IZA]] performed each and every part of the character, except for the song ''Spirit'' following a contract issue between [[Warner Music Group]] and Disney and was replaced by voice-actor {{illm|Andrezza Massei|pt}}. She was the only one out of all Nala's dubbers not to perform the song.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://disneyinternationalvoices.weebly.com/nala.html|title=Nala|website=CHARGUIGOU|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>

==Chart performance==
The single charted at number 98 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and it peaked at number 6 on the US [[Hot R&B Songs]] chart. It fared better in Europe, where it entered the top 50 in the Netherlands and Scotland.

==Music video==
The song's [[music video]] was filmed at [[Havasu Falls]], a waterfall in [[Havasu Creek]], located in the [[Grand Canyon]], Arizona, United States. Beyoncé received special permission from the [[Havasupai]] tribe to close off the waterfall from the public to allow filming of the music video on July 10. Shooting lasted around five hours, with Knowles arriving and departing from the location via helicopter.<ref name="shoot" /> The music video premiered during ''Can You Feel the Love Tonight'', an hour-long special hosted by [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] on July 16, 2019.
