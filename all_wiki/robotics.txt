'''Robotics''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area at the interface of [[computer science]] and [[engineering]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&cqlMode=true&query=nid%3D4261462-4 |website=International classification system of the German National Library (GND)}}</ref> Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of [[robot]]s. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe. Robotics draws on the achievement of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]] and others.

Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, [[bomb detection]] and [[bomb disposal|deactivation]]), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].

The concept of creating robots that can operate [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] dates back to [[classical times]], but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether [[domestic robot|domestically]], [[industrial robot|commercially]], or [[military robot|militarily]]. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] (science, [[technology]], engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Nocks | first1 = Lisa | title = The robot : the life story of a technology | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2007 | location = Westport, CT}}</ref>

Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with [[computer engineering]], [[computer science]] (especially [[artificial intelligence]]), [[electronics]], [[mechatronics]], [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[bioengineering]].<ref>{{cite book | last1=Arreguin|first1=Juan|title=Automation and Robotics| url=https://archive.org/details/ost-engineering-automation-and-robotics|publisher=I-Tech and Publishing|year= 2008|location=Vienna, Austria}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The word ''robotics'' was derived from the word ''robot'', which was introduced to the public by [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', which was published in 1920.<ref name="KapekWebsite">{{cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123023343/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|archive-date=23 January 2013|url-status=dead|first=Dominik| last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel Čapek website|access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> The word ''robot'' comes from the Slavic word ''robota'', which means slave/servant. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called ''robots'', creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of [[Android (robot)|androids]]. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother [[Josef Capek|Josef Čapek]] as its actual originator.<ref name="KapekWebsite"/>

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the word ''robotics'' was first used in print by [[Isaac Asimov]], in his [[science fiction]] short story ''[[Liar! (short story)|"Liar!"]]'', published in May 1941 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is ''electronics'', he assumed ''robotics'' already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word ''robotics'' was in his short story ''[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]'' ([[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]], March 1942),<ref>{{cite book

However, the original publication of "Liar!" predates that of "Runaround" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.

==History{{anchor|History_of_robotics}}==
{{see also|History of robots}}
In 1948, [[Norbert Wiener]] formulated the principles of [[cybernetics]], the basis of practical robotics.

Fully [[autonomous]] robots only appeared in the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the [[Unimate]], was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a [[Die casting|die casting machine]] and stack them. Commercial and [[industrial robot]]s are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in [[manufacturing]], assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and [[space exploration]], surgery,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=Elizabeth|date=25 September 2019|title=Your robot surgeon will see you now|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02874-0|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=573|issue=7775|pages=S110–S111|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-02874-0|pmid=31554995|doi-access=free}}</ref> weaponry, [[Laboratory|laboratory research]], safety, and the [[mass production]] of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[Industrial marketing|industrial goods]].<ref>{{cite web

==Robotic aspects==
[[File:Type 95 wheel and treads detail.JPG|thumbnail|Mechanical construction]]
[[File:Computer Circuit Board MOD 45153624.jpg|thumbnail|Electrical aspect]]
[[File:Dev win32.png|thumbnail|A level of programming]]

There are many types of robots; they are used in many different environments and for many different uses. Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:
# Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use [[caterpillar tracks]]. The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.
# Robots have electrical components that power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with [[caterpillar tracks]] would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic [[electrical circuit]]. Even petrol powered [[machines]] that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of [[electrical energy]] supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)
# All robots contain some level of [[computer programming]] code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with [[remote control]] programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use [[artificial intelligence]] interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.

== Applications ==
As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed as "assembly robots". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a "welding robot" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as "heavy-duty robots".<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpXbBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA141|chapter=Smart Robots|title=Smart Robots: A Handbook of Intelligent Robotic Systems|last=Hunt|first=V.

* [[Military robot]]s.
* [[Industrial robot]]s. Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s).

At present, mostly (lead–acid) [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] are used as a power source. Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime and [[weight]]. Generators, often some type of [[internal combustion engine]], can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need a fuel, require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.<ref name="Robot Power supply Sources">{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Kevin|title=Power Sources for Small Robots|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/dowling_power_sources.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Potential power sources could be:
* [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] (compressed gases)
* [[Solar power]] (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)
* [[hydraulic]]s (liquids)
* [[flywheel energy storage]]
* organic garbage (through [[anaerobic digestion]])
* [[nuclear power|nuclear]]

===Actuation===
{{Main|Actuator}}
[[File:2005-11-14 ShadowLeg Finished medium.jpg|thumb|A [[robot leg|robotic leg]] powered by [[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscles]] ]]

Actuators are the "[[muscle]]s" of a robot, the parts which convert [[potential energy|stored energy]] into movement.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Design Optimisation and Control of Compliant Actuation Arrangements in Articulated Robots for Improved Energy Efficiency|journal= IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters|volume = 1|issue=2|pages = 1110–1117|last1 = Roozing|first1 = Wesley|last2 = Li|first2 = Zhibin|last3 =Tsagarakis|first3 = Nikos| last4=Caldwell |first4 = Darwin| year = 2016| doi=10.1109/LRA.2016.2521926 |s2cid= 1940410}}</ref> By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.

==== Electric motors ====
{{Main|Electric motor}}
The vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and [[numerical control|CNC]] machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.

==== Linear actuators ====
{{Main|Linear actuator}}
Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air ([[pneumatic actuator]]) or an oil ([[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic actuator]]) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand, such as a rack and pinion on a car.

==== Series elastic actuators ====
Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpiece) or during collisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pratt|first1=G.A.|last2=Williamson|first2=M.M.|date=1995|title=Series elastic actuators|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/525827|journal=Proceedings 1995 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the [[Passivity (engineering)|passivity]] framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The control of dynamically interacting systems|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/14380|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=1988|degree=Thesis|first=J.

==== Air muscles ====
{{Main|Pneumatic artificial muscles}}
Pneumatic artificial muscles, also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand(typically up to 40%) when air is forced inside them. They are used in some robot applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesco.com/articles/airmuscle/AirMuscleDescription06.html|title=Air Muscle actuators, going further, page 6|first=Images SI Inc -|last=www.imagesco.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowrobot.com/airmuscles/overview.shtml|title=Air Muscles|publisher=Shadow Robot|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927065220/http://www.shadowrobot.com/airmuscles/overview.shtml|archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Tondu, Bertrand|year=2012|title=Modelling of the McKibben artificial muscle: A review|journal=Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures|volume=23|issue=3|pages=225–253|doi=10.1177/1045389X11435435|s2cid=136854390}}</ref>

==== Muscle wire ====
{{Main|Shape memory alloy}}
Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, Nitinol® or Flexinol® wire, is a material which contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied.

==== Piezo motors ====
{{Main|Piezoelectric motor}}
Recent alternatives to DC motors are [[piezoelectric motor|piezo motors]] or [[ultrasonic motor]]s. These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny [[Piezoelectricity|piezoceramic]] elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piezomotor.se/pages/PLtechnology.html|title=Piezo LEGS – -09-26|access-date=28 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130125244/http://www.piezomotor.se/pages/PLtechnology.html|archive-date=30 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are [[nanometre|nanometer]] resolution, speed, and available force for their size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscaletech.com/squiggle_overview.html| title=Squiggle Motors: Overview|access-date=8 October 2007}}</ref> These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Nishibori|year=2003|title=Robot Hand with Fingers Using Vibration-Type Ultrasonic Motors (Driving Characteristics)| journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics| volume=15| issue=6| pages=588–595|display-authors=etal| doi=10.20965/jrm.2003.p0588}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.neuroscint.org/otake/uploads/papers/Otake_smems2001ems.pdf|title=Shape Design of Gel Robots made of Electroactive Polymer trolo Gel|author=Otake|year=2001|access-date=16 October 2007|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==== Elastic nanotubes ====
{{further|Carbon nanotube}}
Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development. The absence of defects in [[carbon nanotube]]s enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10&nbsp;[[Joule|J]]/cm<sup>3</sup> for metal nanotubes. Human biceps could be replaced with an 8&nbsp;mm diameter wire of this material. Such compact "muscle" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.<ref>John D. Madden, 2007, /science.1146351</ref>

===Sensing===
{{Main|Robotic sensing|Robotic sensors}}
Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components. This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response. They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information of the task it is performing.

====Touch====
{{Main|Tactile sensor}}
Current [[Robotic arm|robotic]] and [[prosthetic hand]]s receive far less [[Touch|tactile]] information than the human hand. Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syntouchllc.com/technology.htm|title=Syntouch LLC: BioTac(R) Biomimetic Tactile Sensor Array|access-date=10 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003150719/http://syntouchllc.com/technology.htm|archive-date=3 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wettels | first1 = N | last2 = Santos | first2 = VJ | last3 = Johansson | first3 = RS | year = 2008 | title = Biomimetic tactile sensor array | journal = Advanced Robotics | volume = 22 | issue = 8| pages = 829–849 | doi = 10.1163/156855308X314533 | last4 = Loeb | first4 = Gerald E. | s2cid = 4594917 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects.

Scientists from several [[Science and technology in Europe|European countries]] and [[Science and technology in Israel#Biomedical engineering|Israel]] developed a [[prosthetic]] hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one—allowing patients to write with it, type on a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], play piano and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips.<ref name=SmartHand>{{cite web|title=What is The SmartHand?|url=http://www.elmat.lth.se/~smarthand/|publisher=SmartHand Project|access-date=4 February 2011}}</ref>

====Vision====
{{Main|Computer vision}}
{{see also|Vision processing unit}}
[[Computer vision]] is the science and technology of machines that see. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.

In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.

Computer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[solid-state physics]]. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using [[optics]]. Sophisticated image sensors even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' "eyes" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.

There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of [[biological system]], at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology.

====Other====
Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar.<ref name="Automation and Robotics">{{cite book | last1=Arreguin | first1= Juan | title = Automation and Robotics | url=https://archive.org/details/ost-engineering-automation-and-robotics | publisher = I-Tech and Publishing | year= 2008 | location= Vienna, Austria}}</ref> [[Lidar]] measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. [[Radar]] uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. [[Sonar]] uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.

===Manipulation===

{{further|Mobile manipulator}}
A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: "manipulation refers to an agent’s control of its environment through selective contact”.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mason|first=Matthew T.|date=2001|title=Mechanics of Robotic Manipulation|doi=10.7551/mitpress/4527.001.0001|isbn=9780262256629}}</ref>

Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as ''[[Robot end effector|end effectors]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ati-ia.com/|title=What is a robotic end-effector?|publisher=ATI Industrial Automation|year=2007|access-date=16 October 2007}}</ref> while the "arm" is referred to as a ''manipulator''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-57063-8|publisher=Cambridge University Press|title=Kinematic Analysis of Robot Manipulators|isbn=978-0-521-57063-3|date=1998|access-date=16 October 2007|first=Carl D.|last=Crane|author2=Joseph Duffy }}</ref> Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks. Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand.<ref>G.J. Monkman, S. Hesse, R. Steinmann & H. Schunk (2007).  ''Robot Grippers''. Berlin: Wiley</ref>

==== Mechanical grippers ====
One of the most common types of end-effectors are "grippers". In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2007/04/episode_78_ninja_myths_walking.html|title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 78: Ninja Myths – Walking on Water, Catching a Sword, Catching an Arrow}} (Discovery Channel's Mythbusters making mechanical gripper from chain and metal wire)</ref> Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the [[Shadow Hand]] and the [[Robonaut]] hand.<ref>[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/Robotics/index.html Robonaut hand]</ref> Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the [[Delft]] hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbl.tudelft.nl/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/onderzoek/dbl-delft-biorobotics-lab/delft-arm-and-hand/|title=Delft hand|publisher=[[TU Delft]]|access-date=21 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203150043/http://www.dbl.tudelft.nl/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/onderzoek/dbl-delft-biorobotics-lab/delft-arm-and-hand|archive-date=3 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tudelft.nl/nl/actueel/laatste-nieuws/artikel/detail/tu-delft-ontwikkelt-goedkope-voorzichtige-robothand/|title=TU Delft ontwikkelt goedkope, voorzichtige robothand|last=M&C}}</ref> Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.

==== Suction end-effectors ====
Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definitions/astrictive|title=astrictive definition – English definition dictionary – Reverso}}</ref> devices that can hold very large loads provided the [[prehensility|prehension]] surface is smooth enough to ensure suction.

Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors.

Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural [[Stiffness#Compliance|compliance]] of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception.  As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system estimates the position of a water bottle, but has 1 centimeter of error.  While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface.

==== General purpose effectors ====
Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands, like the Shadow Hand, MANUS,<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Evaluation of new user interface features for the MANUS robot arm|first1=H.

===Locomotion===
{{Main|Robot locomotion|Mobile robot}}

====Rolling robots====
[[File:Segway 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Segway PT|Segway]] in the Robot museum in [[Nagoya]]]]
For simplicity, most mobile robots have four [[wheel]]s or a number of [[continuous track]]s. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.

===== Two-wheeled balancing robots =====
Balancing robots generally use a [[gyroscope]] to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an [[inverted pendulum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtoussaint.de/tobb/index.html |title=T.O.B.B |publisher=Mtoussaint.de |access-date=27 November 2010}}</ref> Many different balancing robots have been designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.heroy.smu.edu/~dpa-www/robo/nbot/ |title=nBot, a two wheel balancing robot |publisher=Geology.heroy.smu.edu |access-date=27 November 2010}}</ref> While the [[Segway PT|Segway]] is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform).

===== One-wheeled balancing robots =====
{{Main|Self-balancing unicycle}}
A one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel. Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s "[[Ballbot]]" that is the approximate height and width of a person, and [[Tohoku Gakuin University]]'s "BallIP".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/042910-a-robot-that-balances-on-a-ball |title=IEEE Spectrum: A Robot That Balances on a Ball |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |access-date=27 November 2010|date=29 April 2010 }}</ref> Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.cmu.edu/PR/releases06/060809_ballbot.html|title=Carnegie Mellon Researchers Develop New Type of Mobile Robot That Balances and Moves on a Ball Instead of Legs or Wheels|publisher=Carnegie Mellon|date=9 August 2006|access-date=20 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609180645/http://www.cmu.edu/PR/releases06/060809_ballbot.html|archive-date=9 June 2007}}</ref>

===== Six-wheeled robots =====
Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass.

===== Tracked robots =====
[[File:Foster-Miller TALON SWORDS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foster-Miller TALON|TALON]] [[military robot]]s used by the [[United States Army]]]]
Tank tracks provide even more traction than a six-wheeled robot. Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain. However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors. Examples include NASA's Urban Robot "Urbie".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=4#urbie|title=JPL Robotics: System: Commercial Rovers}}</ref>

==== Walking applied to robots ====
Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve. Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipedalrobotics.com|title=AMBER Lab}}</ref> Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexapodrobot.com/index.html|title=Micromagic Systems Robotics Lab}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mecatron.rma.ac.be/pub/2005/ISMCR05_verlinden.pdf|title=AMRU-5 hexapod robot}}</ref> Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up [[stairway|stairs]]. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are:

===== ZMP technique =====
{{Main|Zero moment point}}
The zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as [[Honda]]'s [[ASIMO]]. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total [[inertia|inertial forces]] (the combination of [[Earth]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] and the [[acceleration]] and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor [[reaction (physics)|reaction force]] (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no [[moment (physics)|moment]] (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/history/technology2.html|publisher=Honda Worldwide|title=Achieving Stable Walking|access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref> However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the [[toilet|lavatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pootergeek.com/2004/12/funny-walk/|title=Funny Walk|publisher=Pooter Geek|date=28 December 2004|access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://popsci.typepad.com/ces2007/2007/01/asimos_pimp_shu.html |title=ASIMO's Pimp Shuffle|magazine=Popular Science|date=9 January 2007|access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://motegi.vtec.net/forums/one-message?message_id=131434&news_item_id=129834|title=The Temple of VTEC – Honda and Acura Enthusiasts Online Forums > Robot Shows Prime Minister How to Loosen Up > > A drunk robot?}}</ref> ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.

===== Hopping =====
Several robots, built in the 1980s by [[Marc Raibert]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by [[wikt:hop|hopping]]. The movement is the same as that of a person on a [[pogo stick]]. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_hopper/3D_hopper.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D One-Leg Hopper (1983–1984)|access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref> Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing [[somersault]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_biped/3D_biped.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D Biped (1989–1995)}}</ref> A [[quadrupedalism|quadruped]] was also demonstrated which could [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], run, [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], and bound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/quadruped/quadruped.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=Quadruped (1984–1987)}}</ref> For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/robots-main-bottom.html|title=MIT Leg Lab Robots- Main}}</ref>

===== Dynamic balancing (controlled falling) =====
A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anybots.com/abouttherobots.html|publisher=Anybots|title=About the robots|access-date=23 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909132949/http://anybots.com/abouttherobots.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 9 September 2007}}</ref> This technique was recently demonstrated by [[Trevor Blackwell|Anybots']] Dexter Robot,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anybots.com/|title=Homepage|publisher=Anybots|access-date=23 October 2007}}</ref> which is so stable, it can even jump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnTy_smY3sw|title=Dexter Jumps video|publisher=YouTube|date=1 March 2007|access-date=23 October 2007}}</ref> Another example is the [[Flame (robot)|TU Delft Flame]].

===== Passive dynamics =====
{{Main|Passive dynamics}}
Perhaps the most promising approach utilizes [[passive dynamics]] where the [[momentum]] of swinging limbs is used for greater [[efficient energy use|efficiency]]. It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only [[gravitation|gravity]] to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a [[hill]]. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Wisse, Martijn |author3=Ruina, Andy |author4= Tedrake, Russ |title=Efficient bipedal robots based on passive-dynamic Walkers|journal=Science|issue= 5712|pages=1082–1085|date=11 February 2005|url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf

====Other methods of locomotion====

===== Flying =====

A modern [[Jet airliner|passenger airliner]] is essentially a [[Flight|flying]] robot, with two humans to manage it. The [[autopilot]] can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2008/feb/i_ca01.pdf|publisher=Boeing|title=Testing the Limits|page=29|access-date=9 April 2008}}</ref> Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs). They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions. Some can even fire on targets under command. UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, without the need for a command from a human. Other flying robots include [[cruise missile]]s, the Entomopter, and the [[Seiko Epson Micro flying robot|Epson micro helicopter robot]]. Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, propelled by paddles, and guided by sonar.

===== Snaking =====

[[File:Robosnakes.jpg|right|thumb|Two robot snakes. Left one has 64 motors (with 2 degrees of freedom per segment), the right one 10.]]

Several [[snake]] robots have been successfully developed. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snakerobots.com/|publisher=snakerobots.com|title=Introduction|first=Gavin|last=Miller|access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref> The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/robot/snake/acm-r5/acm-r5_e.html|title=ACM-R5|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011030934/http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/robot/snake/acm-r5/acm-r5_e.html|archive-date=11 October 2011}}</ref> can even navigate both on land and in water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=139523333240485714|title=Swimming snake robot (commentary in Japanese)}}</ref>

=====Skating=====
A small number of [[Roller skating|skating]] robots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device. It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/robot/walking/titan8/titan8_e.html|publisher=Hirose Fukushima Robotics Lab|title=Commercialized Quadruped Walking Vehicle "TITAN VII"|access-date=23 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106024355/http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/robot/walking/titan8/titan8_e.html|archive-date=6 November 2007}}</ref> Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.scifi.com/tech/archives/2007/01/23/plen_the_robot.html|publisher=SCI FI Tech|title=Plen, the robot that skates across your desk|date=23 January 2007|access-date=23 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011080732/http://blog.scifi.com/tech/archives/2007/01/23/plen_the_robot.html|archive-date=11 October 2007}}</ref>
[[File:Capuchin Free Climbing Robot.jpg|right|thumb|Capuchin, a climbing robot]]

===== Climbing =====
Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces. One approach mimics the movements of a human [[climbing|climber]] on a wall with protrusions; adjusting the [[center of mass]] and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage. An example of this is Capuchin,<ref>{{YouTube|JzHasc4Vhm8|Capuchin}}</ref> built by Dr. Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California. Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing [[gecko]]es, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass. Examples of this approach include Wallbot<ref>{{YouTube|Tq8Yw19bn7Q|Wallbot}}</ref> and Stickybot.<ref>{{YouTube|k2kZk6riGWU|Stanford University: Stickybot}}</ref>

China's ''Technology Daily'' reported on 15 November 2008, that Dr. Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft ([[Zhuhai]]) Co., Ltd. had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named "[[Mechanical Gecko|Speedy Freelander]]". According to Dr. Yeung, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically. Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko. A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.<ref name="Automation and Robotics"/>

===== Swimming (Piscine) =====
It is calculated that when [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]] some fish can achieve a [[Marine propulsion|propulsive]] efficiency greater than 90%.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk/Research/oceans/people/Michael_Sfakiotakis/IEEEJOE_99.pdf|author=Sfakiotakis|date=1999|title=Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion|journal=IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering|volume=24|issue=2|pages=237–252|access-date=24 October 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926175113/http://www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk/Research/oceans/people/Michael_Sfakiotakis/IEEEJOE_99.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 26 September 2007|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1999IJOE...24..237S|doi=10.1109/48.757275|citeseerx=10.1.1.459.8614}}</ref> Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made [[boat]] or [[submarine]], and produce less noise and water disturbance.

[[File:ISplash Robotic Fish.jpg|thumb|Robotic Fish: ''iSplash''-II]]
In 2014 ''iSplash''-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof. Huosheng Hu at Essex University.

===== Sailing =====
[[File:Vaimosluc.jpg|thumbnail|The autonomous sailboat robot ''[[Vaimos]]'']]
Sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean. A typical sailboat robot is ''[[Vaimos]]''<ref>
{{cite journal|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Le Bars|first2=F.|
year=2012|title=An interval approach for stability analysis; Application to sailboat robotics|journal=IEEE Transactions on Robotics|volume=27|issue=5|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_checking.pdf}}</ref> built by IFREMER and ENSTA-Bretagne. Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail). If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever. The two main competitions of sailboat robots are [[WRSC (World Robotic Sailing Championship)|WRSC]], which takes place every year in Europe, and [http://www.sailbot.org/ Sailbot].

===Environmental interaction and navigation===
{{Main|Robotic mapping|Robotic navigation}}
[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Radar, [[GPS]], and [[lidar]], are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of [[Robotic mapping|navigation hardware and software]] in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as [[ASIMO]] and [[Meinü robot]] have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, [[Intelligent car|self-controlled cars]], [[Ernst Dickmanns]]' [[driverless car]], and the entries in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots.<ref name="Search and foraging"/> Most of these robots employ a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] navigation device with waypoints, along with [[radar]], sometimes combined with other sensory data such as [[lidar]], [[video camera]]s, and [[inertial guidance system]]s for better navigation between waypoints.

===Human-robot interaction===
{{main|Human-robot interaction}}
[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]
The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through [[speech]], [[gesture]]s, and [[facial expression]]s, rather than a [[command-line interface]]. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional [[C-3PO]], or [[Star Trek|Data of Star Trek, Next Generation]].

==== Speech recognition ====
{{Main|Speech recognition}}
Interpreting the continuous flow of [[sound]]s coming from a human, in [[real-time computing|real time]], is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of [[Manner of articulation|speech]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pires | first1 = J.

==== Robotic voice ====
Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans. For social reasons, [[synthetic voice]] proves suboptimal as a communication medium,<ref>M.L. Walters, D.S. Syrdal, K.L. Koay, K. Dautenhahn, R. te Boekhorst, (2008). ''Human approach distances to a mechanical-looking robot with different robot voice styles''.

==== Gestures ====
{{Further|Gesture recognition}}
One can imagine, in the future, explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry, or asking directions from a robot police officer. In both of these cases, making hand [[gesture]]s would aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate "down the road, then turn right". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/waldherr.gestures-journal.pdf|title=A Gesture Based Interface for Human-Robot Interaction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|author=Waldherr, Romero & Thrun|year=2000| access-date=28 October 2007}}</ref> A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711151910/http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 July 2012|title=Vision Based Hand Gesture Recognition Systems|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|volume=263–266|pages=2422–2425|author=Markus Kohler|publisher=University of Dortmund|access-date=28 October 2007|bibcode=2012AMM...263.2422L|year=2012|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.263-266.2422|s2cid=62744240}}</ref>

==== Facial expression ====
{{Further|Emotion recognition}}
Facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics]] using their elastic polymer called [[Frubber]], allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors ([[servomechanism|servos]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|title=Frubber facial expressions|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207121306/http://hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html|archive-date=7 February 2009}}</ref> The coating and servos are built on a metal [[human skull|skull]]. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and [[body language]]. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] and the more recent addition, Nexi<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854135,00.html|title=Best Inventions of 2008 – TIME|journal=Time|date=29 October 2008|via=www.time.com}}</ref> can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samogden.com/Kismet.html|title=Kismet: Robot at MIT's AI Lab Interacts With Humans|publisher=Sam Ogden|access-date=28 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035539/http://samogden.com/Kismet.html|archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref>

==== Artificial emotions ====
Artificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions and/or gestures. As can be seen from the movie [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]], the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots.

==== Personality ====
Many of the robots of science fiction have a [[Personality psychology|personality]], something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/GI2005/Posters/GI_abstract.pdf|title=(Park et al. 2005) Synthetic Personality in Robots and its Effect on Human-Robot Relationship}}</ref> Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5067678|title=Robot Receptionist Dishes Directions and Attitude}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060929205205/http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2006|title=New Scientist: A good robot has personality but not looks}}</ref> i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example is [[Pleo]], a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_chung_plays_with_pleo#t-17244|title=Playtime with Pleo, your robotic dinosaur friend}}</ref>

==== Social Intelligence ====
The Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the  [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots. The aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts. These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through [[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised learning]], and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach. These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks. The results are demonstrated by the robot ''Curi'' who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/meet-woman-who-trains-robots-living|title=Meet a woman who trains robots for a living|date=31 October 2014|author=Jennifer Bogo}}</ref>

==Control==
[[File:Magnus B. Egerstedt puppet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puppet Magnus]], a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systems.]]
[[File:RuBot II.jpg|thumb|right|[[RuBot II]] can manually resolve Rubik's cubes.]]
{{Further|Control system}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}

The [[machine|mechanical]] structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motors]]) which move the mechanical.

The processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. [[Sensor fusion]] may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from [[control theory]] convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.

At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a "cognitive" model. [[Cognitive model]]s try to represent the robot, the world, and how they interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|Mapping]] techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, [[motion planning]] and other [[artificial intelligence]] techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.

===Autonomy levels===
[[File:TOPIO 3.jpg|thumb|[[TOPIO]], a [[humanoid robot]], played [[ping pong]] at Tokyo IREX 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator|title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator|magazine=Popular Science}}</ref>]]
Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.
# Direct interaction is used for [[haptic technology|haptic]] or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.
# Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.therobotreport.com/synthiam-exosphere-trains-ai-robots-human-operators|title=Synthiam Exosphere combines AI, human operators to train robots|magazine=The Robot Report}}</ref>
# An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time . Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.

Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.
# [[Teleoperation]]. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.
# Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.
# Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.
# Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.

Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new [[Robot#Types of robots|types of robots]], alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. Other investigations, such as MIT's [[cyberflora]] project, are almost wholly academic.

A first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robot-projects. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term "Generation Robots" can be used. This term is coined by Professor [[Hans Moravec]], Principal Research Scientist at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robotics Institute]] in describing the near future evolution of robot technology. ''First generation'' robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a [[lizard]] and should become available by 2010. Because the ''first generation'' robot would be incapable of [[learning]], however, Moravec predicts that the ''second generation'' robot would be an improvement over the ''first'' and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a [[mouse]]. The ''third generation'' robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a [[monkey]]. Though ''fourth generation'' robots, robots with [[human]] intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.<ref>[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]] conversation with Professor Moravec, October 1997. ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/robots/moravec.html NOVA Online]''</ref>

The second is [[Evolutionary robotics|evolutionary robots]]. This is a [[methodology]] that uses [[evolutionary computation]] to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior [[controller (control theory)|controllers]]. In a similar way to [[evolution|natural evolution]], a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a [[fitness function]]. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/09/54900|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=A Theory of Evolution, for Robots|journal=Wired|first=Lakshmi|last=Sandhana|date=5 September 2002|access-date=28 October 2007}}</ref> and to explore the nature of evolution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222155713.htm|publisher=Science Daily|title=Experimental Evolution In Robots Probes The Emergence Of Biological Communication|date=24 February 2007|access-date=28 October 2007}}</ref> Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leon|last=Žlajpah|title=Simulation in robotics|journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation|issue=4|pages=879–897|date=15 December 2008|doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.017|volume=79}}</ref> this technique may be run entirely or mostly in [[simulation]], using a [[robot simulator]] software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2004/051904/Evolution_trains_robot_teams_051904.html|title=Evolution trains robot teams TRN 051904|first=Technology Research|last=News|website=www.trnmag.com}}</ref> Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Dynamics and kinematics===
{{further|Kinematics|Dynamics (mechanics)}}
{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FHtcR78GA0 How the BB-8 Sphero Toy Works]}}
The study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]].<ref>{{cite book|first=P.K.|last=Agarwal|title=Elements of Physics XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEVnsSy0yF8C&pg=SA2-PA3|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-81-7133-911-2|page=2}}</ref> Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]], and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. [[Inverse kinematics]] refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance, and [[Mechanical singularity|singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[force]]s upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulation]]s of the robot. [[Inverse dynamics]] refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.

In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for "optimal" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.

=== Bionics and biomimetics ===
[[Bionics]] and [[biomimetics]] apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots.  For example, the design of [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the way kangaroos jump.

===Quantum computing===
There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on [[quantum computers]] than they can be run on [[digital computers]]. This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quantum Robotics|last=Tandon|first=Prateek|publisher=Morgan & Claypool Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1627059138}}</ref>

===Certification===
The [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.

===Summer robotics camp ===
Several national summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums and institutions.

=== Robotics competitions ===
{{Main|Robot competition}}
There are many competitions around the globe. The [[SeaPerch]] curriculum is aimed as students of all ages. This is a short list of competition examples; for a more complete list see [[Robot competition]].

====Competitions for Younger Children====
The FIRST organization offers the [[FIRST Lego League Jr.]] competitions for younger children. This competition's goal is to offer younger children an opportunity to start learning about science and technology. Children in this competition build Lego models and have the option of using the Lego WeDo robotics kit.

====Competitions for Children Ages 9-14====
One of the most important competitions is the FLL or [[FIRST Lego League]]. The idea of this specific competition is that kids start developing knowledge and getting into robotics while playing with [[Lego]] since they are nine years old. This competition is associated with [[National Instruments]]. Children use [[Lego Mindstorms]] to solve autonomous robotics challenges in this competition.

====Competitions for Teenagers====
{{Main|FIRST}}
The [[FIRST Tech Challenge]] is designed for intermediate students, as a transition from the [[FIRST Lego League]] to the [[FIRST Robotics Competition]].

The [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] focuses more on mechanical design, with a specific game being played each year. Robots are built specifically for that year's game. In match play, the robot moves autonomously during the first 15 seconds of the game (although certain years such as 2019's Deep Space change this rule), and is manually operated for the rest of the match.

====Competitions for Older Students====
The various [[RoboCup]] competitions include teams of teenagers and university students.  These competitions focus on soccer competitions with different types of robots, dance competitions, and urban search and rescue competitions. All of the robots in these competitions must be autonomous. Some of these competitions focus on simulated robots.

AUVSI runs competitions for [[International Aerial Robotics Competition|flying robots]], [[Unmanned surface vehicle|robot boats]], and [[RoboSub|underwater robots]].

The Student AUV Competition Europe <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sauc-europe.org/|title=Student AUV Competition Europe}}</ref> (SAUC-E) mainly attracts undergraduate and graduate student teams. As in the AUVSI competitions, the robots must be fully autonomous while they are participating in the competition.

[[The Microtransat Challenge]] is a competition to sail a boat across the Atlantic Ocean.

====Competitions Open to Anyone====
[[RoboGames]] is open to anyone wishing to compete in their over 50 categories of robot competitions.

[[Federation of International Robot-soccer Association]] holds the FIRA World Cup competitions. There are flying robot competitions, robot soccer competitions, and other challenges, including weightlifting barbells made from dowels and CDs.

===Robotics afterschool programs===
Many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Some major programs for afterschool robotics include [[FIRST Robotics Competition]], [[Botball]] and B.E.S.T. Robotics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestinc.org/|title=B.E.S.T. Robotics}}</ref> Robotics competitions often include aspects of business and marketing as well as engineering and design.

The [[The Lego Group|Lego company]] began a program for children to learn and get excited about robotics at a young age.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://carobotfactory.com/classes/|access-date=5 November 2014|title=LEGO® Building & Robotics After School Programs}}</ref>

== Employment ==
[[File:MobileRobotsPioneerAT.jpg|thumb|A robot technician builds small all-terrain robots. (Courtesy: MobileRobots Inc)]]
{{Main|Technological unemployment}}
Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments. As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tommytoy.typepad.com/tommy-toy-pbt-consultin/2011/06/outlook-for-robotics-and-automation-for-2011-and-beyond-are-excellent-says-expert-.html | title = Outlook for robotics and Automation for 2011 and beyond are excellent says expert | access-date = 27 January 2012 | last = Toy | first = Tommy | date = 29 June 2011 | publisher = PBT Consulting}}</ref> The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors.

== Occupational safety and health implications ==
{{main|Workplace robotics safety}}

A discussion paper drawn up by [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|EU-OSHA]] highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/seminars/focal-points-seminar-review-articles-future-work|title=Focal Points Seminar on review articles in the future of work – Safety and health at work – EU-OSHA|website=osha.europa.eu|access-date=19 April 2016}}</ref>

The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robotics: Redefining crime prevention, public safety and security|url=http://www.sourcesecurity.com/news/articles/robotics-redefining-crime-prevention-public-safety-security-co-12903-ga-co-14203-ga.21083.html|publisher=SourceSecurity.com}}</ref>

Despite these advances, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in [[collaborative robots]] and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[BAuA]]) organises annual workshops on the topic "human-robot collaboration".

In the future, co-operation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms. Current approaches and technical standards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peshkin.mech.northwestern.edu/publications/2002_T15.1_DraftStandardForTrialUse_IntelligentAssistDevicesPersonnelSafetyRequirements.pdf|title=Draft Standard for Intelligent Assist Devices — Personnel Safety Requirements}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62996|title=ISO/TS 15066:2016 – Robots and robotic devices – Collaborative robots}}</ref> aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised.
