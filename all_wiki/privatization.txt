'''Privatization''' (or '''privatisation''' in [[British English]]) can mean different things including moving something from the public sector into the private sector. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for [[deregulation]] when a heavily regulated private company or industry becomes less regulated. Government functions and services may also be privatised (which may also be known as "franchising" or "out-sourcing"); in this case, private entities are tasked with the implementation of government programs or performance of government services that had previously been the purview of state-run agencies. Some examples include revenue collection, [[law enforcement]], [[Water privatization|water supply]], and [[penology|prison management]].<ref>Chowdhury, F. L. ‘’Corrupt Bureaucracy and Privatisation of Tax Enforcement’’, 2006: Pathak Samabesh, Dhaka.</ref>

Another definition is the purchase of all [[shares outstanding|outstanding shares]] of a [[public company|publicly traded]] company by private investors, or the sale of a [[state-owned enterprise]] or [[municipally owned corporation]] to private investors. In the case of a for-profit company, the shares are then no longer traded at a [[stock exchange]], as the company became private through [[private equity]]; in the case the partial or full sale of a [[state-owned enterprise]] or [[municipally owned corporation]] to private owners shares may be traded in the public market for the first time, or for the first time since an enterprise's previous [[nationalization]]. The second such type of privatization is the [[demutualization]] of a [[mutual organization]], [[cooperative]], or [[public-private partnership]] in order to form a [[joint-stock company]].<ref name="crisis">{{Cite news |url=http://www.thenews.coop/index.php?content=story&id=835 |title=Musselburgh Co-op in crisis as privatization bid fails. |publisher=[[Co-operative Press|Co-operative News]] |date=2005-11-01 |access-date=2008-05-21}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''[[The Economist]]'' magazine introduced the term ''privatisation'' (alternatively ''privatisation'' or ''reprivatisation'' after the German {{lang|de|Reprivatisierung}}) during the 1930s when it covered [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[economic policy]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Ruth Dudley |author-link=Ruth Dudley Edwards |title=The Pursuit of Reason: The Economist 1843–1993 |page=946 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87584-608-8}}</ref><ref>Compare {{cite journal |last=Bel |first=Germà |year=2006 |title=Retrospectives: The Coining of 'Privatisation' and Germany's National Socialist Party |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=187–94 |doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.187|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.2842 }}</ref> It is not clear if the magazine coincidentally invented the word in English or if the term is a loanword from the same expression in German, where it has been in use since the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kämmerer |first=Jörn Axel |title=Privatisierung: Typologie – Determinanten – Rechtspraxis – Folgen |page=7 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck Verlag |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-16-147515-3}}</ref>

== Definition ==
The word ''privatization'' may mean different things depending on the context in which it is used. It can mean moving something from the public sphere into the private sphere, but it may also be used to describe something that was always private, but heavily regulated, which becomes less regulated through a process of [[deregulation]]. The term may also be used descriptively for something that has always been private, but could be public in other jurisdictions.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 28| issue = 5| pages = 1507| last = Beerman| first = Jack| title = Privatization and Political Accountability| journal = Fordham Urban Law Journal| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ulj/vol28/iss5/2/ |date = 2001-01-01}}</ref>

There are also private entities that may perform public functions. These entities could also be described as privatized. Privatization may mean the government sells state-owned businesses to private interests, but it may also be discussed in the context of the privatization of services or government functions, where private entities are tasked with the implementation of government programs or performance of government services. [[Gillian E. Metzger]] has written that: "Private entities [in the US] provide a vast array of social services for the government; administer core aspects of government programs; and perform tasks that appear quintessentially governmental, such as promulgating standards or regulating third-party activities." Metzger mentions an expansion of privatization that includes health and welfare programs, public education, and prisons.<ref name=metzger>{{Cite journal| pages = 1367–1502| last = Metzger| first = Gillian| title = Privatization as Delegation| journal = Colum.

== History ==
{{see also|List of privatizations}}

=== Pre-20th century ===
The history of privatization dates from [[Ancient Greece]], when governments contracted out almost everything to the private sector.<ref name="handbook">''International Handbook on Privatization'' by David Parker, David S. Saal</ref> In the [[Roman Republic]] private individuals and companies performed the majority of services including tax collection ([[farm (revenue leasing)|tax farming]]), army supplies ([[defense contractor|military contractors]]), religious sacrifices and construction. However, the [[Roman Empire]] also created [[government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]]—for example, much of the grain was eventually produced on estates owned by the Emperor. David Parker and David S. Saal suggest that the cost of bureaucracy was one of the reasons for the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]].<ref name="handbook" />

Perhaps one of the first ideological movements towards privatization came during [[China]]'s golden age of the [[Han Dynasty]]. [[Taoism]] came into prominence for the first time at a state level, and it advocated the [[laissez-faire]] principle of [[Wu wei]] (無為), literally meaning "do nothing".<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Zheng|2001|p=241}}</ref> The rulers were counseled by the Taoist clergy that a strong ruler was virtually invisible.

During the [[Renaissance]], most of Europe was still by and large following the [[feudal]] economic model. By contrast, the [[Ming dynasty]] in [[China]] began once more to practice privatization, especially with regards to their manufacturing industries. This was a reversal of the earlier [[Song dynasty]] policies, which had themselves overturned earlier policies in favor of more rigorous state control.<ref>Bouye, Thomas M., Manslaughter, markets, and moral economy</ref>

In Britain, the privatization of common lands is referred to as [[enclosure]] (in Scotland as the [[Lowland Clearances]] and the [[Highland Clearances]]). Significant privatizations of this nature occurred from 1760 to 1820, preceding the [[industrial revolution]] in that country.

=== 20th century onwards ===
The first mass privatization of state property occurred in [[Nazi Germany]] between 1933 and 1937: "It is a fact that the government of the National Socialist Party sold off public ownership in several state-owned firms in the middle of the 1930s. The firms belonged to a wide range of sectors: steel, mining, banking, local public utilities, shipyard, ship-lines, railways, etc. In addition to this, delivery of some public services produced by public administrations prior to the 1930s, especially social services and services related to work, was transferred to the private sector, mainly to several organizations within the Nazi Party."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bel|first=Germà|date=2010-02-01|title=Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany1|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00473.x|issn=1468-0289|hdl=2445/11716|s2cid=154486694|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/11716/1/162.pdf}}</ref>

[[Great Britain]] privatized its [[steel industry]] in the 1950s, and the [[West German]] government embarked on large-scale privatization, including sale of the [[majority stake]] in [[Volkswagen]] to small investors in public share offerings in 1961.<ref name="handbook" /> However, it was in the 1980s under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States that privatization gained worldwide momentum. Notable privatization attempts in the UK included privatization of [[Britoil]] (1982), [[Amersham International]] PLC (1982), [[British Telecom]] (1984), [[Sealink]] ferries (1984), [[British Petroleum]] (gradually privatized between 1979 and 1987), [[British Aerospace]] (1985 to 1987), [[British Gas]] (1986), [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (1987), [[Rover Group]] (formerly [[British Leyland]], 1988), [[British Steel Corporation]] (1988),  and the regional water authorities (mostly in 1989). After 1979, [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in the UK were given the [[right to buy]] their homes (at a heavily discounted rate). One million purchased their residences by 1986.

Such efforts culminated in 1993 when British Rail was privatized under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]]. [[British Rail]] had been formed by prior [[nationalization]] of private rail companies. The privatization was controversial, and the [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail|its impact is still debated today]], as doubling of passenger numbers and investment was balanced by an increase in [[rail subsidy]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/15/nostalgia-british-rail-trains-better |title=Forget the nostalgia for British Rail – our trains are better than ever|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2013-08-15|last1=Birrell|first1=Ian}}</ref>

Privatization in Latin America flourished in the 1980s and 1990s as a result of a Western liberal economic policy. Companies providing public services such as [[water management]], transportation, and [[telecommunication]] were rapidly sold off to the private sector. In the 1990s, privatization revenue from 18 Latin American countries totaled 6% of gross domestic product.<ref name="Nellis">"Privatization in Latin America: The rapid rise, recent fall, and continuing puzzle of a contentious economic policy" by John Nellis, Rachel Menezes, Sarah Lucas. Center for Global Development Policy Brief, Jan 2004, p. 1.</ref> Private investment in infrastructure from 1990 and 2001 reached $360.5 billion, $150 billion more than in the next emerging economy.<ref name="Nellis" />

While economists generally give favorable evaluations of the impact of privatization in Latin America,<ref>"The Distributive Impact of Privatization in Latin America: Evidence from Four Countries" by David McKenzie, Dilip Mookherjee, Gonzalo Castañeda and Jaime Saavedra. Brookings Institution Press, 2008, p. 162.</ref> opinion polls and public protests across the countries suggest that a large segment of the public is dissatisfied with or have negative views of privatization in the region.<ref>"Why is Sector Reform So Unpopular in Latin America?" by Mary Shirley. The Ronald Coase Institute Working Papers, 2004, p. 1.</ref>

In the 1990s, the governments in Eastern and Central Europe engaged in extensive privatization of state-owned enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia, with assistance from the [[World Bank]], the U.S. Agency for International Development, the German [[Treuhand]], and other governmental and [[NGO|nongovernmental organizations]].

Ongoing privatization of [[Japan Post]] relates to that of the national postal service and one of the largest banks in the world. After years of debate, the privatization of Japan Post spearheaded by [[Junichiro Koizumi]] finally started in 2007. The privatization process is expected{{By whom|date=April 2010}} to last until 2017. Japan Post was one of the nation's largest employers, as one-third of Japanese state employees worked for it. It was also said to be the largest holder of personal savings in the world. Criticisms against Japan Post were that it served as a channel of corruption and was inefficient. In September 2003, Koizumi's cabinet proposed splitting Japan Post into four separate companies: a bank, an insurance company, a postal service company, and a fourth company to handle the post offices and retail storefronts of the other three. After the Upper House rejected privatization, Koizumi scheduled [[2005 Japan general election|nationwide elections]] for September 11, 2005. He declared the election to be a referendum on postal privatization. Koizumi subsequently won the election, gaining the necessary [[supermajority]] and a mandate for reform, and in October 2005, the bill was passed to privatize Japan Post in 2007.<ref>Takahara, "All eyes on Japan Post"{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Faiola |title=Japan Approves Postal Privatization |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101402163.html |work=Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post Company |page=A10 |date=2005-10-15 |access-date=2007-02-09}}</ref>

[[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]'s privatization in 1987 involved the largest share offering in financial history at the time.<ref name="megginson205">The Financial Economics of Privatisation By William L. Megginson, pp. 205–06</ref> 15 of the world's 20 largest public share offerings have been privatizations of telecoms.<ref name="megginson205" />

In 1988, the [[perestroika]] policy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started allowing privatization of the centrally planned economy. Large privatization of the Soviet economy occurred over the next few years as the country dissolved. Other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries followed suit after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] introduced non-communist governments.

The United Kingdom's largest public share offerings were privatizations of [[British Telecom]] and [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] during the 1980s under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], when many state-run firms were sold off to the private sector. The privatization received very mixed views from the public and the parliament. Even former Conservative prime minister [[Harold Macmillan]] was critical of the policy, likening it to "selling the family silver".<ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-macmillan-2/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623162706/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-macmillan-2/ |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref> There were around 3 million shareholders in Britain when Thatcher [[1979 United Kingdom general election|took office in 1979]], but the subsequent sale of state-run firms saw the number of shareholders double by 1985.

The largest public shares offering in France involved [[Orange S.A.|France Télécom]].

Egypt undertook widespread privatization under [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Following his overthrow in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|2011 revolution]], most of the public began to call for re-nationalization, citing allegations of the privatized firms practicing [[crony capitalism]] under the old regime.<ref>Amos, Deborah, [https://www.npr.org/2011/04/20/135542498/in-egypt-revolution-moves-into-the-factories "In Egypt, Revolution Moves Into The Factories"], ''[[NPR]]'', April 20, 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-20.</ref>

== Forms of privatization ==
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}
There are five main methods{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} of privatization:
# [[Share issue privatization]]: shares sale on the [[stock market]].
# [[Asset sale privatization]]: asset divestiture to a strategic investor, usually by [[auction]] or through the [[Treuhand]] model.
# [[Voucher privatization]]: distribution of vouchers, which represent part ownership of a corporation, to all citizens, usually for free or at a very low price.
# [[Privatization from below]]: start of new private businesses in formerly socialist countries.
# [[Management buyout]] or [[Employee stock ownership plan|employee buyout]]: distribution of shares for free or at a very low price to workers or management of the organization.

The choice of sale method is influenced by the [[capital market]] and the political and firm-specific factors. Privatization through the stock market is more likely to be the method used when there is an established capital market capable of absorbing the shares. A market with high liquidity can facilitate the privatization. If the capital markets are insufficiently developed, however, it would be difficult to find enough buyers. The shares may have to be underpriced, and the sales may not raise as much capital as would be justified by the fair value of the company being privatized. Many governments, therefore, elect for listings in more sophisticated markets, for example, [[Euronext]], and the [[London Stock Exchange|London]], [[New York Stock Exchange|New York]] and [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Hong Kong]] stock exchanges.

Governments in [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[Transition economy|transition countries]] more often resort to direct asset sales to a few investors, partly because those countries do not yet have a stock market with high capital.

Voucher privatization occurred mainly in the [[transition economy|transition economies]] in Central and Eastern Europe, such as [[Privatization in Russia|Russia]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Slovakia]]. Additionally, privatization from below had made important contribution to economic growth in transition economies.

In one study assimilating some of the literature on "privatization" that occurred in Russian and Czech Republic transition economies, the authors identified three methods of privatization: "privatization by sale", "mass privatization", and "mixed privatization". Their calculations showed that "mass privatization" was the most effective method.<ref name="methods" />

However, in economies "characterized by shortages" and maintained by the state bureaucracy, wealth was accumulated and concentrated by "gray/black market" operators. Privatizing industries by sale to these individuals did not mean a transition to "effective private sector owners [of former] state assets".  Rather than mainly participating in a market economy, these individuals could prefer elevating their personal status or prefer accumulating political power. Instead, outside foreign investment led to the efficient conduct of former state assets in the private sector and market economy.<ref name="methods">{{cite journal |last1=John Bennett, Saul Estrin, and Giovanni Urga |title=Methods of privatization and economic growth in transition economies |journal=Economics of Transition |date=2007 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=661–683 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0351.2007.00300.x |url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/140745/1/514551011.pdf |access-date=18 June 2017|hdl=10419/140745 |s2cid=447407 }}</ref>

Through privatization by direct asset sale or the stock market, bidders compete to offer higher prices, generating more revenue for the state. Voucher privatization, on the other hand, could represent a genuine transfer of assets to the general population, creating a sense of participation and inclusion. A market could be created if the government permits transfer of vouchers among voucher holders.

=== Secured borrowing ===
Some privatization transactions can be interpreted as a form of a [[secured loan]]<ref name="roin">{{Cite journal |last=Roin |first=Julie |title=Privatization and the Sale of Tax Revenues |ssrn=1880033 |postscript=, also published as "[http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/articles/privatization-sale-tax-revenues/ Privatization and the Sale of Tax Revenues]" in ''[http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/ Minnesota Law Review],'' Vol. 85, p. 1965, 2011, and ''U of Chicago Law & Economics,'' [http://www.law.uchicago.edu/lawecon/workingpapers Olin Working Paper] No. 560|date=2011-07-06 }}</ref><ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-22/business/ct-biz-0722-chicago-law-20110722_1_parking-meters-privatization-summer-reading U. of C. professor argues privatization of public assets just like borrowing money], July 22, 2011, ''Chicago Tribune,'' Ameet Sachdev's Chicago Law, Ameet Sachdev</ref> and are criticized as a "particularly noxious form of governmental debt".<ref name="roin" /> In this interpretation, the upfront payment from the privatization sale corresponds to the [[debt|principal amount]] of the loan, while the proceeds from the underlying asset correspond to secured interest payments – the transaction can be considered substantively the same as a secured loan, though it is structured as a sale.<ref name="roin" /> This interpretation is particularly argued to apply to recent municipal transactions in the United States, particularly for fixed term, such as the 2008 sale of the proceeds from Chicago parking meters for 75 years. It is argued that this is motivated by "politicians' desires to borrow money surreptitiously",<ref name="roin" /> due to legal restrictions on and political resistance to alternative sources of revenue, viz, raising taxes or issuing debt.

== Results of privatization ==
Privatization had different outcomes around the world. Results of privatization may vary depending on the privatization model employed.<ref>Alen Jugovič, Ante Bistričić & Borna Debelić (2010) Economic Effects

More recent research and literature review performed by Professor Saul Estrin and Adeline Pelletier concluded that "the literature now reflects a more cautious and nuanced evaluation of privatization" and that "private ownership alone is no longer argued to automatically generate economic gains in developing economies".<ref>{{cite journal| title=Privatization in Developing Countries: What Are the Lessons of Recent Experience?|author=Saul Estrin|author2=Adeline Pelletier|date=22 March 2018|journal=The World Bank Research Observer}}</ref>

Although typically there are many costs associated with these efficiency gains,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cgdev.org/docs/cgd_wp006.pdf |title=Winners and Losers: Assessing the Distributional Impact of Privatisation, CGD Working Paper No 6 |work=Nancy Birdsall & John Nellis |date=March 9, 2006 |publisher=Center for Global Development |access-date=2005-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050623081056/http://www.cgdev.org/docs/cgd_wp006.pdf |archive-date=2005-06-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
many economists argue{{who|date=October 2020}} that these can be dealt with by appropriate government support through [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] and perhaps [[retraining]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Yet, some empirical literature suggests that privatization could also have very modest effects on efficiency and quite regressive distributive impact. In the first attempt at a social welfare analysis of the British privatization program under the Conservative governments of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] during the 1980s and 1990s, [[Massimo Florio]] points to the absence of any productivity shock resulting strictly from ownership change. Instead, the impact on the previously nationalized companies of the UK productivity leap under the Conservatives varied in different industries. In some cases, it occurred prior to privatization, and in other cases, it occurred upon privatization or several years afterward.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 30032311|last1 = Evenson|first1 = Robert E.|title = Reviewed work: The Great Divestiture: Evaluating the Welfare Impact of the British Privatizations, 1979-1997, Massimo Florio|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|volume = 44|issue = 1|pages = 172–174|last2 = Megginson|first2 = William L.|year = 2006}}</ref>

Privatizations in Russia and Latin America were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have widely reported the grand corruption that accompanied those sales, according to research released by the World Bank there has been increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, according to the World Bank extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.<ref>Privatisation in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date.

In Latin America, on the one hand, according to John Nellis's research for [[Center for Global Development]], economic indicators, including firm profitability, productivity, and growth, project positive [[microeconomic]] results.<ref name="Nellis" /> On the other hand, however, privatisation has been largely met with a negative criticism and citizen coalitions. This [[neoliberal]] criticism highlights the ongoing conflict between varying visions of economic development. [[Karl Polanyi]] emphasizes the societal concerns of self-regulating markets through a concept known as a "double movement". In essence, whenever societies move towards increasingly unrestrained, free-market rule, a natural and inevitable societal correction emerges to undermine the contradictions of capitalism.{{Fact|date=October 2020}} This was the case in the [[2000 Cochabamba protests]].{{Fact|date=October 2020}}

Privatization in Latin America has invariably experienced increasing push-back from the public. [[Mary Shirley]] from [[The  Ronald Coase Institute]] suggests that implementing a less efficient but more politically mindful approach could be more sustainable.<ref>"Why is Sector Reform So Unpopular in Latin America?" by Mary Shirley.

In Australia a "People's Inquiry into Privatisation" (2016/17) found that the impact of privatisation on communities was negative.  The report from the inquiry "Taking Back Control" <ref>https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/cpsu/pages/1573/attachments/original/1508714447/Taking_Back_Control_FINAL.pdf?1508714447</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2020}} made a range of recommendations to provide accountability and transparency in the process.  The report highlighted privatisation in healthcare, aged care, child care, social services, government departments, electricity, prisons and vocational education featuring the voices of workers, community members and academics.

== Opinion ==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2011}}
Arguments for and against the controversial subject of privatization are presented here.

=== Support ===
Studies show that private market factors can more efficiently deliver many goods or service than governments due to [[free market]] [[competition]].<ref name=nellis_kikeri /><ref name=megginson_netter /><ref name=oecd /> Over time, this tends to lead to lower prices, improved quality, more choices, less corruption, less [[red tape]], and/or quicker delivery. Many proponents do not argue that everything should be privatized. According to them, [[market failure]]s and [[natural monopolies]] could be problematic. However, [[anarcho-capitalists]] prefer that every function of the state be privatized, including [[Private defense agency|defense]] and [[Alternative dispute resolution|dispute resolution]].<ref name="libertarianpapers">[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers VOL. 3, ART. NO. 3 (2011)</ref>

Proponents of privatization make the following arguments:
* Performance: state-run industries tend to be [[bureaucratic]]. A political government may only be motivated to improve a function when its poor performance becomes politically sensitive.
* Increased efficiency: private companies and firms have a greater incentive to produce goods and services more efficiently to increase profits.
* Specialization: a private [[business]] has the ability to focus all relevant human and financial resources onto specific functions. A state-owned firm does not have the necessary resources to [[Departmentalization|specialize]] its goods and services as a result of the general products provided to the greatest number of people in the [[population]].
* Improvements: conversely, the government may put off improvements due to political sensitivity and special interests—even in cases of companies that are run well and better serve their customers' needs.
* Corruption: a state-monopolized function is prone to [[Political corruption|corruption]]; decisions are made primarily for political reasons, personal gain of the decision-maker (i.e. "graft"), rather than economic ones. Corruption (or [[Principal–agent problem|principal–agent]] issues) in a state-run corporation affects the ongoing asset stream and company performance, whereas any corruption that may occur during the privatization process is a one-time event and does not affect ongoing cash flow or performance of the company.
* Accountability: managers of privately owned companies are accountable to their owners/shareholders and to the consumer, and can only exist and thrive where needs are met. Managers of publicly owned companies are required to be more accountable to the broader community and to political "stakeholders". This can reduce their ability to directly and specifically serve the needs of their customers, and can bias investment decisions away from otherwise profitable areas.
* Civil-liberty concerns: a company controlled by the state may have access to information or assets which may be used against dissidents or any individuals who disagree with their policies.
* Goals: a political government tends to run an industry or company for [[political]] goals rather than [[economic]] ones.
* Capital: a privately held companies can sometimes more easily raise investment capital in the financial markets when such local markets exist and are suitably liquid. While interest rates for private companies are often higher than for government debt, this can serve as a useful constraint to promote efficient investments by private companies, instead of cross-subsidizing them with the overall credit-risk of the country. Investment decisions are then governed by market interest rates. State-owned industries have to compete with demands from other government departments and special interests. In either case, for smaller markets, [[political risk]] may add substantially to the cost of capital.
* Security: governments have had the tendency to "bail out" poorly run businesses, often due to the sensitivity of job losses, when economically, it may be better to let the business fold.
* Lack of market discipline: poorly managed state companies are insulated from the same discipline as private companies, which could go bankrupt, have their management removed, or be taken over by competitors. Private companies are also able to take greater risks and then seek bankruptcy protection against creditors if those risks turn sour.
* Natural monopolies: the existence of [[natural monopolies]] does not mean that these sectors must be state owned. Governments can enact or are armed with [[anti-trust legislation]] and bodies to deal with anti-competitive behavior of all companies public or private.
* Concentration of wealth: ownership of and profits from successful enterprises tend to be dispersed and diversified -particularly in voucher privatization. The availability of more investment vehicles stimulates capital markets and promotes liquidity and job creation.
* Political influence: nationalized industries are prone to interference from [[politicians]] for [[political]] or [[Populism|populist]] reasons. Examples include making an industry buy supplies from local producers (when that may be more expensive than buying from abroad), forcing an industry to freeze its prices/fares to satisfy the electorate or control [[inflation]], increasing its staffing to reduce [[unemployment]], or moving its operations to [[constituency|marginal constituencies]].
* Profits: corporations exist to generate profits for their shareholders. Private companies make a profit by enticing [[consumer]]s to buy their products in preference to their competitors' (or by increasing [[primary demand]] for their products, or by reducing costs). Private corporations typically profit more if they serve the needs of their clients well. Corporations of different sizes may target different market niches in order to focus on marginal groups and satisfy their demand. A company with good [[corporate governance]] will therefore be incentivized to meet the needs of its customers efficiently.
* Job gains: as the economy becomes more efficient, more profits are obtained and no government subsidies and less taxes are needed, there will be more private money available for investments and consumption and more profitable and better-paid jobs will be created than in the case of a more regulated economy.<ref>[http://www.heritage.org/research/europe/HL352.cfm Central Europe's Mass-Production Privatization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018193244/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Europe/HL352.cfm |date=2009-10-18 }}, Heritage Lecture #352</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}}

=== Opposition ===
Opponents of certain privatizations believe that certain [[Public good (economics)|public goods and services]] should remain primarily in the hands of government in order to ensure that everyone in society has access to them (such as law enforcement, basic [[health care]], and basic [[education]]). There is a [[positive externality]] when the government provides society at large with public goods and services such as [[National security|defense]] and disease control. Some national constitutions in effect define their governments' "core businesses" as being the provision of such things as justice, tranquility, defense, and general welfare. These governments' direct provision of security, stability, and safety, is intended to be done for the common good (in the public interest) with a long-term (for posterity) perspective.  As for [[natural monopolies]], opponents of privatization claim that they aren't subject to fair competition, and better administrated by the state.

Although private companies will provide a similar good or service alongside the government, opponents of privatization are careful about completely transferring the provision of public goods, services and assets into private hands for the following reasons:
* Performance: a democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a legislature, Congress or [[Parliament]], and is motivated to safeguarding the assets of the nation. The profit motive may be subordinated to social objectives.
* Improvements: the government is motivated to performance improvements as well run businesses contribute to the State's revenues.
* Corruption: government ministers and civil servants are bound to uphold the highest ethical standards, and standards of probity are guaranteed through codes of conduct and declarations of interest. However, the selling process could lack transparency, allowing the purchaser and civil servants controlling the sale to gain personally.
* Accountability: the public has less control and oversight of private companies.
* Civil-liberty concerns: a democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a [[parliament]], and can intervene when civil liberties are threatened.
* Goals: the government may seek to use state companies as instruments to further social goals for the benefit of the nation as a whole.
* Capital: governments can raise money in the financial markets most cheaply to re-lend to state-owned enterprises.
* Cuts in essential services: if a government-owned company providing an essential service (such as the water supply) to all citizens is privatized, its new owner(s) could lead to the abandoning of the social obligation to those who are less able to pay, or to regions where this service is unprofitable.
* Natural monopolies: privatization will not result in true competition if a [[natural monopoly]] exists.
* Concentration of wealth: profits from successful enterprises end up in private, often foreign, hands instead of being available for the common good.
* Political influence: governments may more easily exert pressure on state-owned firms to help implementing government policy.
* Profit: private companies do not have any goal other than to maximize profits. A private company will serve the needs of those who are most willing (and able) to pay, as opposed to the needs of the majority, and are thus anti-democratic. The more [[necessity good|necessary a good]] is, the lower the [[price elasticity of demand#Elasticity and revenue|price elasticity of demand]], as people will attempt to buy it no matter the price. In the case of a price elasticity of demand of zero (perfectly inelastic good), the demand part of supply and demand theories does not work.
* Privatization and poverty: it is acknowledged by many studies that there are winners and losers with privatization. The number of losers—which may add up to the size and severity of poverty—can be unexpectedly large if the method and process of privatization and how it is implemented are seriously flawed (e.g. lack of transparency leading to state-owned assets being appropriated at minuscule amounts by those with political connections, absence of regulatory institutions leading to transfer of monopoly rents from public to private sector, improper design and inadequate control of the privatization process leading to [[asset stripping]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dagdeviren |year=2006 |title=Revisiting privatisation in the context of poverty alleviation |journal=Journal of International Development |volume=18 |issue= 4|pages=469–88 |doi=10.1002/jid.1244}}</ref>
* Job loss: due to the additional financial burden placed on privatized companies to succeed without any government help, unlike the public companies, jobs could be lost to keep more money in the company.
* Reduced wages and benefits: a 2014 report by In the Public Interest, a resource center on privatization,<ref>David Moberg (6 June 2014).

In the Public Interest, 3 June 2014. Retrieved 7 June 2014.</ref>
* Inferior quality products: private, for-profit companies might cut corners on providing quality goods and services in order to maximize profit.<ref>Joshua Holland (17 July 2014).

''[[Moyers & Company]].'' Retrieved 20 July 2014.</ref>

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, privatization has been studied in the field of [[contract theory]]. When contracts are complete, institutions such as (private or public) property are difficult to explain, since every desired incentive structure can be achieved with sufficiently complex contractual arrangements, regardless of the institutional structure (all that matters is who are the decision makers and what is their available information). In contrast, when contracts are incomplete, institutions matter. A leading application of the incomplete contract paradigm in the context of privatization is the model by [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart]], [[Andrei Shleifer|Shleifer]], and [[Robert W. Vishny|Vishny]] (1997).<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Proper Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to Prisons |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |date=1997 |issn=0033-5533 |pages=1127–1161 |volume=112 |issue=4 |doi=10.1162/003355300555448 |language=en |first1=Oliver |last1=Hart |first2=Andrei |last2=Shleifer |first3=Robert W. |last3=Vishny|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.7133 |s2cid=16270301 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:30727607 }}</ref> In their model, a manager can make investments to increase quality (but they may also increase costs) and investments to decrease costs (but they may also reduce quality). It turns out that it depends on the particular situation whether private ownership or public ownership is desirable. The Hart-Shleifer-Vishny model has been further developed in various directions, e.g. to allow for mixed public-private ownership and endogenous assignments of the investment tasks.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Public versus private ownership: Quantity contracts and the allocation of investment tasks |journal=Journal of Public Economics |date=2010 |pages=258–68 |volume=94 |issue=3–4 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.11.009 |first1=Eva I. |last1=Hoppe |first2=Patrick W. |last2=Schmitz}}</ref>
