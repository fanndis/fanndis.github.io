<!-- Do not add "Dr. Liam Fox" below, please, and read the following page first before you do so: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS:DOCTOR -->
'''Liam Fox''' (born 22 September 1961) is a British politician who served as [[Secretary of State for International Trade]] from 2016 to 2019 and [[Secretary of State for Defence]] from 2010 to 2011. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North Somerset]] since [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]]. Fox was first elected as the MP for [[Woodspring (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodspring]] in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]].

Fox studied medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]] and worked as a [[General practitioner|GP]] and [[Royal Army Medical Corps|civilian army medical GP]] before being elected as an MP. After holding several ministerial roles under [[John Major]], Fox served as [[Department for Constitutional Affairs|Constitutional Affairs Spokesman]] from 1998 to 1999, [[Shadow Health Secretary]] from 1999 to 2003, [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Chair of the Conservative Party]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] in 2005 and [[Shadow Defence Secretary]] from 2005 to 2010.

In the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 expenses scandal]], he was the Shadow Cabinet minister found to have the largest over-claim on expenses and, as a result, was forced to repay the most money. In 2010, he was appointed Defence Secretary by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]], a position from which he resigned on 14 October 2011 over allegations that he had given a close friend, [[lobbying|lobbyist]] [[Adam Werritty]], inappropriate access to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and allowed him to join official trips overseas.

In July 2016, in the wake of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union]], Fox was appointed the first [[Secretary of State for International Trade]] by new Prime Minister [[Theresa May]]. He was also made President of the Board of Trade. Fox has twice stood unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2005]] and [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2016]]. In July 2019, he lost his cabinet position when new Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] made a cabinet reshuffle.

==Early life==
Fox was born and raised in a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic family of Irish heritage]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/sad-fall-console |title=The sad fall of Console |publisher=The Irish Catholic |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=22 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815121218/http://irishcatholic.ie/article/sad-fall-console |archivedate=15 August 2016 }}</ref> in [[East Kilbride, Scotland|East Kilbride]], Scotland, and brought up in a [[council house]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Deacon |first=Carol |title=North Somerset MP Liam Fox says the 'big society' is local people who support our armed forces |url=http://www.nailseapeople.co.uk/news/North-Somerset-MP-Liam-Fox-say-big-society-local/story-10057077-detail/story.html |accessdate=15 September 2011 |newspaper=Nailsea People |date=6 October 2010 |page=(paragraph 5) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404163122/http://www.nailseapeople.co.uk/news/North-Somerset-MP-Liam-Fox-say-big-society-local/story-10057077-detail/story.html |archivedate=4 April 2012}}</ref> that his parents later [[Right to buy scheme|bought]].

Along with his brother and two sisters, he was educated in the state sector; he attended St. Bride's High School (now part of [[St Andrew's and St Bride's High School]]). He studied medicine at the [[University of Glasgow Medical School]], graduating with a [[Bachelors of medicine and surgery|MB ChB]] in 1983. Fox is a former [[general practitioner]] (he was a GP in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, before his election to Parliament), a former Civilian Army General Practitioner and Divisional Surgeon with [[St John Ambulance (England and the Islands)|St John Ambulance]].<ref>{{cite web|date=31 October 2011|title=Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP|url=http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Fox_Liam.aspx|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019075533/http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Fox_Liam.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12283134|title=Former GP Liam Fox comes to aid of pregnant passenger |publisher=BBC News |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126045522/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12283134|archivedate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

While studying medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]] in the early 1980s, he was a member of the [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society|Dialectic Society]] and became president of the [[Glasgow University Conservative Association]]. Fox contested the [[Hairmyres]] [[Wards (UK)|ward]] of East Kilbride [[Subdivisions of Scotland|District Council]] in May 1984, coming second (210 votes) to the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillor, Ed McKenna.

While at Glasgow, Fox resigned his position on the university's [[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council|Students Representative Council]] (SRC) in protest at the council passing a motion condemning the decision of the university's [[Glasgow University Union]] (GUU) not to allow a [[homosexual|gay]] students' society to join the union. The SRC motion called both the union's decision and the explanations given for it "bigoted". The GUU maintained its stance regardless, and the controversy was reported in the national media; this led to many other university student unions up and down the country, including [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], cutting ties with their Glasgow counterparts.

Explaining his decision to resign from the SRC and support the GUU's position, Fox was quoted as saying: "I'm actually quite liberal when it comes to sexual matters. I just don't want the gays flaunting it in front of me, which is what they would do." When asked about these comments in 2008, Fox said that "fortunately most of us have progressed from the days when we were students more than a quarter of a century ago".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/revealed-tory-mp-s-homophobic-past-1.828532 |title=Revealed: Tory MP's 'homophobic' past |work=The Herald |location=Glasgow |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521110602/http://www.heraldscotland.com/revealed-tory-mp-s-homophobic-past-1.828532 |archivedate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

His first attempt to get elected as an MP for a [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Scottish constituency]] ended in failure when he contested [[Roxburgh and Berwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Roxburgh and Berwickshire]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]]. Thereafter, he sought and won the nomination for the English constituency of [[Woodspring (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodspring]] and was successful in being elected MP for that constituency at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].

In September 2005, Fox announced he would join the [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|contest to be the next leader of the Conservative party]].

Fox was appointed as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|cabinet of David Cameron]] on 12 May 2010 and that weekend flew out to [[Afghanistan]] with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[William Hague]], and the [[International Development Secretary]], [[Andrew Mitchell]], to see first hand the issues facing the troops based there.

In July 2010, he said that the dire state of the public finances meant the [[Armed Forces of the United Kingdom|Armed Forces]] could no longer be equipped to cover every conceivable danger. He said that the strongest signal that it will have to give up one or more of these capabilities, which have been maintained at the same time as contributing to collective security pacts such as [[NATO]]. "We don't have the money as a country to protect ourselves against every potential future threat," he said. "We have to look at where we think the real risks will come from, where the real threats will come from and we need to deal with that accordingly. The Russians are not going to come over the European plain any day soon," he added. Fox's admission cast doubt on the future of the 25,000 troops currently [[British Forces Germany|stationed in Germany]].

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) faced budget cuts of up to 8% over the next five years, according to some analysts, and the department was grappling with a £37&nbsp;billion shortfall on programmes it has signed up to. The results of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] (SDSR) were published on 19 October 2010. Speaking in September 2010 at a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart [[Hervé Morin]] on the possibility of sharing [[aircraft carrier]]s with the [[French Navy]], Fox said, "I think it is unrealistic to share an aircraft carrier but, in other areas like tactical lift we can see what we can do." He added: "I can't deny that there is an element of urgency added by budget concerns."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/7980904/UK-and-France-wont-share-aircraft-carriers-says-Defence-Secretary-Liam-Fox.html|title=UK and France won't share aircraft carriers, says Defence Secretary Liam Fox|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=14 November 2011|first=Amy|last=Wilson|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906170518/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/7980904/UK-and-France-wont-share-aircraft-carriers-says-Defence-Secretary-Liam-Fox.html|archivedate=6 September 2010}}</ref>

In September 2010, in a private letter to [[David Cameron]], Fox refused to back any "draconian cuts" in the Armed Forces at a time when Britain was at war. The letter was written the night before a [[National Security Council (UK)|National Security Council (NSC)]] meeting on the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] (SDSR). In the letter, Fox wrote that: "Frankly this process is looking less and less defensible as a proper SDSR (Strategic Defence and Strategy Review) and more like a 'super CSR' (Comprehensive Spending Review). If it continues on its current trajectory it is likely to have grave political consequences for us". Fox continued saying that "Our decisions today will limit severely the options available to this and all future governments. The range of operations that we can do today we will simply not be able to do in the future. In particular, it would place at risk."<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Liam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8031385/Defence-cuts-Liam-Foxs-leaked-letter-in-full.html|title=Defence cuts: Liam Fox's leaked letter in full|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2010|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121180047/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8031385/Defence-cuts-Liam-Foxs-leaked-letter-in-full.html|archivedate=21 January 2011}}</ref>

In February 2011, Fox criticised "ballooning" spending in his own department. The top 15 major procurement projects were running at £8.8&nbsp;billion over budget and, between them, were delayed by a total of 32 years. That included the [[Airbus A400M|A400M]] transporter aircraft order that was £603&nbsp;million over budget and six years behind schedule. Fox criticised what he called a "conspiracy of optimism based on poor cost-estimation, unrealistic timescales" at the MoD and in industry. "These practices in the MOD would simply not be tolerated in the private sector, and they will no longer be tolerated in the MoD."<ref>{{cite news|last=Whitehead|first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8336883/Fox-to-crack-down-on-military-overspends.html|title=Fox to crack down on military overspends|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 February 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224034859/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8336883/Fox-to-crack-down-on-military-overspends.html|archivedate=24 February 2011}}</ref>

In March 2011, Fox defended the decision to make 11,000 redundancies in the armed forces, insisting that personnel who have recently returned from Afghanistan would not be sacked. Cameron had conceded that axing around 5,000 personnel from the army, 3,300 from the Navy and 2,700 from the RAF will be ''difficult'' for those affected. Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out plans for reducing the size of the armed forces by 17,000 in total. Some of that number would be met by not replacing people who were retiring or leaving for other reasons. Defence officials said 11,000 personnel still faced being redundant on a compulsory or voluntary basis. Fox said it was essential that service personnel were made "fully aware of the options available and the time-scales involved". "That means that a timetable needs to be adhered to for the sake of themselves and their families," he said. "It would simply be wrong to alter that timetable for the convenience of the Government."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/8357092/Liam-Fox-armed-forces-job-losses-will-be-a-painful-process.html|title=Liam Fox: armed forces job losses will be a painful process|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411011310/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/8357092/Liam-Fox-armed-forces-job-losses-will-be-a-painful-process.html|archivedate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

In light of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Fox warned that Libya could end up split in two as [[Muammar Gaddafi]] unleashed the full fury of his military arsenal, sending warplanes and ground troops to attack rebel-held positions across the country. "We could see the Gaddafi forces centred around Tripoli," Fox said. "We could see a de facto partition of the country."<ref>{{cite news|last=Blomfield|first=Adrian|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8364997/Libya-could-split-says-Liam-Fox-as-regime-hits-rebels-hard.html|title=Libya could split, says Liam Fox, as regime hits rebels hard|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=6 March 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310025641/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8364997/Libya-could-split-says-Liam-Fox-as-regime-hits-rebels-hard.html|archivedate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

In May 2011, Fox opposed plans to sharply increase Britain's [[Department for International Development|aid budget]], in a direct challenge to David Cameron's authority. In a leaked letter to the Prime Minister, Fox said he could not accept plans to increase the development budget to 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The aid pledge, made in the Conservative election manifesto last year, was at the heart of Cameron's attempts to change his party's image. It has gained opponents among right-wing Tories, many of whom voted for Fox when he fought Cameron for the party leadership in 2005. "I cannot support the proposal in its current form," Fox told the Prime Minister. Fox suggested that development funding should be diverted to the defence budget, writing that reneging on the aid pledge would release more public money to be spent on "other activities or programmes rather than aid". The ''Telegraph''{{'s}} James Kirkup said the leak was increasing suspicion among Cameron's allies that the Defence Secretary was trying to undermine the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirkup|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8517782/Liam-Fox-attacks-David-Cameron-over-pledge-to-raise-aid-budget.html|title=Liam Fox attacks David Cameron over pledge to raise aid budget|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004164635/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8517782/Liam-Fox-attacks-David-Cameron-over-pledge-to-raise-aid-budget.html|archivedate=4 October 2011}}</ref>

After negative comments by Sir [[Simon Bryant (RAF officer)|Simon Bryant]] and Sir [[Mark Stanhope]], Secretary Fox said admirals and air marshals who have voiced concerns were giving strength to Muammar Gaddafi's regime. He also warned that high-ranking members of the Armed Forces were facing the sack because the Government wanted to reduce bureaucracy by cutting "the star count". ''The Daily Telegraph'' had learned that the redundancies would include up 500 starred officers, equivalent to the rank of an [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Army brigadier]] and above. Fox said: "We must be very careful, those of us who have authority in defence, when discussing the sustainability of a mission. People's lives are at stake and there can only be one message that goes out on Libya." [[Sandy Woodward|Admiral Sir John "Sandy" Woodward]], a former deputy chief of the defence staff, suggested Fox was trying to blame military chiefs for "his own failings". He said: "Of course the service chiefs should not be talking outside the MoD, but when politicians have got it so wrong they have no other choice."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8602016/Outspoken-Forces-chiefs-risk-lives-warns-Liam-Fox.html |title=Outspoken Forces chiefs risk lives, warns Liam Fox |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |first=Thomas |last=Harding |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630232227/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8602016/Outspoken-Forces-chiefs-risk-lives-warns-Liam-Fox.html |archivedate=30 June 2011  }}</ref>

===Levene report===

On 27 June 2011, Fox announced that [[Peter Levene, Baron Levene of Portsoken|Baron Levene]] had completed his report<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8600041/MoD-is-bureaucratic-bloated-and-indecisive-warns-report.html |title=MoD is bureaucratic, bloated and indecisive, warns report |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |first=James |last=Kirkup |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831153540/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8600041/MoD-is-bureaucratic-bloated-and-indecisive-warns-report.html |archivedate=31 August 2011  }}</ref> on the reform of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] which suggested that they could cut the number of senior officers and could also lead to ministerial posts being axed. The army, navy and air force would each be run by a single chief. Currently, the services have two commanders, one in charge of strategy, the second in charge of day-to-day operations. The reforms would see operational control pushed down the [[chain of command]]. In addition, the three service chiefs will be removed from the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|defence board]], a powerful committee the defence secretary chairs. The overall head of the military, the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|chief of the defence staff]], currently, General Sir [[David Richards (British Army officer)|David Richards]], will represent them. A committee chaired by an independent non-executive director, chosen by the defence secretary, will be in charge of appointments to the services' top ranks. The MoD is expected to axe up to 8,000 civil servants in 2012. Senior commanders would be given more overall control of their budgets and internal appointments.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Hopkins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/27/uk-armed-forces-cuts-fox |title=Liam Fox backs plan to cut swath through armed forces' top ranks |work=The Guardian |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714203232/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/27/uk-armed-forces-cuts-fox |archivedate=14 July 2015  }}</ref>

The report also suggested that a new [[Joint Forces Command]] structure should be created with senior appointments in the MoD lasting longer than every two years by making sure people stay in post for longer. Levene said that "finance and the need for affordability are not regarded as sufficiently important throughout the organisation." He said that the "lack of trust" which pervades the MoD has led to a tendency for those at the top to try to micromanage, while the individual services look out for themselves rather than thinking of defence as a whole. This has led to a "predisposition to overcomplicate ... and a culture of reinventing the wheel". The role of the chief of the defence staff should also be enhanced so that "he alone will be responsible for representing the military voice." Levene says that the new defence board "should be the primary decision-making body for non-operational matters", and should meet 10 times a year. It will have nine members, but only one will be from the military, the chief of the defence staff, currently General Sir [[David Richards (British Army officer)|David Richards]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Nick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2011/jun/27/mod-armed-forces-shakeup-liam-fox|title=MoD and armed forces shakeup – in detail|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518212306/http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2011/jun/27/mod-armed-forces-shakeup-liam-fox|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

===Defence and Security Review===
[[File:Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP (4799289920).jpg|thumb|150px|Liam Fox at [[Chatham House]]]]
In a speech on the future of the Armed Forces to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 19 October 2010 Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] set out plans that would mean cuts: 7,000 jobs go in the [[British Army]]; 5,000 in the [[Royal Navy]]; 5,000 in the [[Royal Air Force]]; and 25,000 civilian jobs at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. In terms of equipment, the RAF would lose the [[Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft]] programme, the entire [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier jump-jet]] fleet would be scrapped, and bases will be turned over to the Army. The Army will have its tanks and heavy artillery cut by 40%, and half of the soldiers in Germany will return to the UK by 2015, with the rest brought home by 2030 and housed in former RAF bases. The Navy would have its destroyer and frigate fleet cut from 23 to 19 (by cutting the [[Type 22 frigate]]s) and will be provided with less expensive frigates. It will be affected by the loss of the Harriers. Overall, the defence budget was to be cut by 8% but Cameron insisted that Britain would continue to meet the [[Nato]] target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8073455/Defence-review-David-Cameron-says-42000-jobs-to-go.html |title=Defence review: David Cameron says 42,000 jobs to go |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |first=Andy |last=Bloxham |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303145454/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8073455/Defence-review-David-Cameron-says-42000-jobs-to-go.html |archivedate=3 March 2011  }}</ref>

In the same speech Cameron announced a national cyber security programme, costing £500&nbsp;million, "to fix shortfalls in cyber infrastructure", while more focus will be given to tackling terrorists such as Al Qaeda and dissident Irish republicans in what he said would be "continuing investment in our world class intelligence agencies". Army numbers will fall to 95,500 by 2015 – 7,000 fewer than today – but ground forces will continue to have vital operational role in the future, he said.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

===Resignation===
On 14 October 2011, Fox resigned from his office as Secretary of State for Defence, for breaking the ministerial code by letting [[Adam Werritty]] into defence meetings.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

==Secretary of State for International Trade==
After [[Theresa May]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in July 2016, Fox was appointed Secretary of State for International Trade, responsible for helping to secure trade deals with other countries following [[Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news|date=14 July 2016|title=Liam Fox is back in government just five years after resigning in disgrace|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/who-is-liam-fox-international-trade-secretary-brexit-theresa-may-cabinet-a7136011.html|url-status=live|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715153637/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/who-is-liam-fox-international-trade-secretary-brexit-theresa-may-cabinet-a7136011.html|archivedate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported Fox as saying he would prefer a free trade agreement with the EU rather than be part of the [[EU customs union]], which he said could restrict Britain's ability to negotiate lower tariffs with other trading partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-fox-idUKKCN10612L|title=Early 2017 could be best time to trigger Article 50 - Liam Fox|publisher=Reuters|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729082851/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-fox-idUKKCN10612L|archivedate=29 July 2016}}</ref>

In a September 2016 speech on international trade, Fox said there needed to be a change in British business culture, arguing that exporting was a "duty" which companies neglected because "it might be too difficult or too time-consuming or because they can't play golf on a Friday afternoon".<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain 'too lazy and fat', says Trade Secretary Liam Fox|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37324491|accessdate=10 September 2016|publisher=BBC|date=10 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042211/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37324491|archivedate=10 September 2016}}</ref> In April 2017, he was criticised for a trade visit to the Philippines, where he acknowledged "shared values" when speaking to [[President of the Philippines|Philippines President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]], heavily criticised for the increase in extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.<ref name=guardian-20170404>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/liam-fox-meets-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte |title=Dismay over Liam Fox's claim of 'shared values' with Duterte's brutal regime |author=Oliver Holmes, Anushka Asthana, Rowena Mason |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 April 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405182741/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/liam-fox-meets-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte |archivedate=5 April 2017  }}</ref><ref name=times-20170405>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fox-we-share-values-with-nation-led-by-the-punisher-b9lgnpv9j |title=Fox: We share values with nation led by the Punisher |first=Sam |last=Coates |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=5 April 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405042125/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fox-we-share-values-with-nation-led-by-the-punisher-b9lgnpv9j |archive-date=5 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2017, Fox announced a new [[board of trade]] which would meet four times a year to "ensure the benefits of free trade are spread throughout the UK." The announcement was criticised by Liberal Democrat MP [[Tom Brake]], who said the board was a "job-creation scheme" for Fox. A DIT spokesman said it was a "technicality" that Fox was the sole member of the board, because of a constitutional convention that full membership is only for privy counsellors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/liam-fox-only-official-member-new-uk-board-of-trade|title=Liam Fox ridiculed for being only member of new UK board of trade|work=The Guardian|author=Jessica Elgot|date=12 October 2017|accessdate=14 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014085112/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/liam-fox-only-official-member-new-uk-board-of-trade|archivedate=14 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-trade-secretary-dr-liam-fox-convenes-a-new-board-of-trade-to-ensure-the-benefits-of-free-trade-are-spread-throughout-the-uk|title=International Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox convenes a new Board of Trade to ensure the benefits of free trade are spread throughout the UK|author=Department for International Trade|date=12 October 2017|accessdate=14 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014183429/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-trade-secretary-dr-liam-fox-convenes-a-new-board-of-trade-to-ensure-the-benefits-of-free-trade-are-spread-throughout-the-uk|archivedate=14 October 2017}}</ref>In July 2019, he lost his cabinet position when new Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] made a cabinet reshuffle.<ref>{{Cite web|date=24 July 2019|title=Boris Johnson conducts cabinet bloodbath to fill his government with Brexit loyalists|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-cabinet-resignations-mordaunt-fox-clark-grayling-a9019341.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017161254/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-cabinet-resignations-mordaunt-fox-clark-grayling-a9019341.html|archive-date=17 October 2019|access-date=22 October 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref>

In July 2010, Fox said that an early withdrawal of coalition troops from Afghanistan would risk a return of civil war and act as a "shot in the arm to jihadists" across the world. In marked contrast to David Cameron, who pledged to withdraw all British troops by 2015, Fox said Britain would be betraying the sacrifices of its fallen soldiers if it left "before the job is finished". British forces would be among the last to leave Afghanistan, he added, because they are stationed in Helmand, one of the most dangerous provinces in the country. He said that "Were we to leave prematurely, without degrading the insurgency and increasing the capability of the Afghan national security forces, we could see the return of the destructive forces of transnational terror ... Not only would we risk the return of civil war in Afghanistan, creating a security vacuum, but we would also risk the destabilisation of Pakistan with potentially unthinkable regional, and possibly nuclear, consequences."<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Watt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/30/liam-fox-afghanistan-foreign-policy |title=Liam Fox insists army cannot leave Afghanistan until job done |work=The Guardian |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915011836/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/30/liam-fox-afghanistan-foreign-policy |archivedate=15 September 2013  }}</ref>

In July 2010, it was reported that 1,000 Royal Marines were expected to leave and be redeployed to central Helmand by the end of 2010. Fox told MPs that UK forces had made "good progress" in Sangin, but the move would enable Britain to provide "more manpower and greater focus" on Helmand's busy central belt, leaving the north and south to the US. "The result will be a coherent and equitable division of the main populated areas of Helmand between three brigade-sized forces, with the US in the north and the south, and the UK-led [[Task Force Helmand]], alongside our outstanding Danish and Estonian allies, in the central population belt," he told the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Beale  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10533771.stm |title=UK troops in Afghanistan to pull out of Sangin |publisher=BBC News |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>

On 19 July 2010, Fox said that within four years the Afghan army and police should take responsibility for security, leaving British troops to work only as military trainers. The date is a full year earlier than the deadline suggested by David Cameron this month, who said he wanted most troops back by 2015. Fox said: "It has always been our aim to be successful in the mission and the mission has always said that the Afghan national security forces would be able to deal with their own security by 2014. We recognise that there will be further work to do in terms of training and improving the quality of those forces beyond that, which is why we have said training forces may be available after that date. But we have made it very clear that that will not be combat forces."<ref>{{cite news|last=Farmer|first=Ben|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/7897196/Liam-Fox-troops-will-leave-Afghanistan-by-2014.html|title=Liam Fox: troops will leave Afghanistan by 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 July 2010|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128180649/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/7897196/Liam-Fox-troops-will-leave-Afghanistan-by-2014.html|archivedate=28 January 2011}}</ref>

Fox is critical of abortion and has called for "huge restriction, if not abolition" on the UK's "pro-abortion laws".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1134042.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Tories in abortion row|date=24 January 2001|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040526085023/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1134042.stm|archivedate=26 May 2004}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Piers Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Amanda Platell|Platell]]'', Fox elaborated on these views, stating that he would "like to see [abortion limits] brought down...well below 20 weeks; I'd like to see us look at limits more akin to some of the European countries at 12 or 14 weeks."<ref name="http">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3323922/Fox-courts-religious-Right-with-plea-to-limit-abortion-to-12-weeks.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Melissa|last=Kite|title=Fox courts religious Right with plea to limit abortion to 12 weeks|date=20 September 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518130848/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3323922/Fox-courts-religious-Right-with-plea-to-limit-abortion-to-12-weeks.html|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

He went on to state that "a society that actually aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself. For me, it's a simple personal belief. It says, "thou shall not kill", it doesn't say, thou shall not kill unless Parliament says it's OK. For the same reason I'm against the death penalty. However, I do accept...that if the majority of the population decide that it's something they find acceptable, I've got to live with that. But I'm not going to be quiet and I'm not going to pretend that my views are other than they are for the sake of political convenience."<ref name="http"/>

===Same-sex marriage===
On 5 February 2013, Fox voted against a second reading of the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]], designed to introduce [[same-sex marriage]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305131329/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm%7D |date=5 March 2016 }} The House of Commons.2013.Marriage (Same Sex Couples)Bill 2012–2013.</ref> He described David Cameron's plans to legalise same-sex marriage as "divisive, ill thought through and constitutionally wrong", arguing that redefining marriage for the majority to satisfy a "small, yet vocal, minority" was not a good basis for a stable, tolerant society.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/10/gay-marriage-plan-criticised-liam-fox|title=Liam Fox criticises gay marriage plan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023080037/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/10/gay-marriage-plan-criticised-liam-fox|archive-date=23 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Freedom of the press===
In October 2013, Fox called for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper to face prosecution over the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Rowena|last=Mason|first2=Patrick|last2=Wintour|date=16 October 2013|title=MPs set to investigate Guardian's involvement in Snowden leaks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mps-investigate-guardian-edward-snowden-leaks|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016185244/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mps-investigate-guardian-edward-snowden-leaks|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

In January 2015, Fox published a video on YouTube detailing his opinions and criticism of [[Edward Snowden]]. He stated: "We're constantly having to protect our society from a range of threats, especially organised crime, paedophilia, and terrorism. For our intelligence services to operate effectively, and to protect us from these threats, they need to be able to do things in secret, secrets whose public disclosure would be damaging to our National Interest. When Edward Snowden stole files and took them with him to China and then Russia, some 58,000 files came from [[GCHQ]], information that had played a vital role in preventing terrorist outrages in Britain, over the past decade and longer. It was not freedom fighting. We should call treason by its name. And those who assisted Snowden must be held responsible for their actions."<ref name="treason-by-its-name">{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zeneY5xfOE | title=Let's Call Treason By It's [sic] Real Name | publisher=YouTube, Liam Fox | date=28 January 2015 | people=Liam Fox | medium=Internet Video | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216172817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zeneY5xfOE | archivedate=16 February 2015}}</ref>

===National Health Service===
In January 2014, Fox stated that ring-fenced funding for the [[National Health Service|NHS]] should end, stating: "The increase [in spending] over the last decade has been phenomenal and yet a lot of our health indicators lag behind other countries, particular things like stroke outcome or a lot of cancer outcomes."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25574096 |title=Liam Fox calls for end to protection of NHS spending |publisher=BBC News |date=2 January 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221034917/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25574096 |archivedate=21 December 2016  }}</ref>

Before the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence vote]] he made a speech setting out reasons why Scotland should remain in the union.<ref name=speechFeb2014>{{cite news|url=http://www.liamfox.co.uk/news/liam-fox-delivers-speech-dangers-scottish-nationalism|title=Speech made in February 2014|accessdate=3 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312164736/http://www.liamfox.co.uk/news/liam-fox-delivers-speech-dangers-scottish-nationalism|archivedate=12 March 2014}}</ref>
If Scotland leaves the United Kingdom "we all lose" he told a [[Neighbourhood Watch (United Kingdom)|Neighbourhood Watch group]] from his constituency visiting Westminster Houses of parliament on 1 September 2014.

Fox was disappointed that Parliament [[Premiership of David Cameron#Syria|voted not to take military action]] over [[Ghouta chemical attack|the use of chemical weapons in Syria]].<ref name=jc-20131003>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/112017/beware-simple-peace-solutions-warns-liam-fox |title=Beware simple peace solutions, warns Liam Fox |first=Rosa |last=Doherty |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191939/http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/112017/beware-simple-peace-solutions-warns-liam-fox |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref> Fox was critical of Cameron's strategy and performance for that debate, and stated "There was no need to seek parliamentary approval for any military action, as constitutional authority lies with the government."<ref name=ft-20140822/><ref name=bbc-20150904/> He later took the view that there were no easy answers to the [[Syrian civil war]] and the prospect of the [[Assad government]] surviving should be considered.<ref name=jc-20131025/> Fox argued that bombing attacks against [[ISIL]] in Iraq should be extended into Syria, and safe havens should be created in Syria by military intervention.<ref name=bbc-20150904>{{Cite AV media |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031l9kg |title=Liam Fox: Need to look at 'creation of a safe haven' in Syria |work=World at One |publisher=BBC |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=6 November 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209114956/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031l9kg |archivedate=9 December 2017  }}</ref><ref name=bbc-20140903>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29050150 |title=Liam Fox urges air strikes against Islamic State |first=James |last=Landale |publisher=BBC |date=3 September 2014 |accessdate=6 November 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624083647/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29050150 |archivedate=24 June 2015  }}</ref>

===Expenses===
In March 2010, Fox appealed [[Sir Thomas Legg]]'s decision that he had overclaimed £22,476 in mortgage interest payments.

In his response, Sir Paul Kennedy stated: "What you claimed was not recoverable under the rules then in force. I entirely accept that, like many others, you could have made other claims if the fees office had rejected your claims for mortgage interest, and that you may well have spent some of what you raised by increasing your mortgage on your constituency home, but the evidence is imprecise, and my terms of reference only allow me to interfere if I find special reasons in your individual case showing that it would not be fair and equitable to require repayment, either at all or at the level recommended."<ref name="Siddique"/> This reportedly made him the Conservative Shadow Cabinet member with the largest over-claim on expenses, and as a result, he has been forced to repay the most money.<ref name="telegraph7450738">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7450738/MPs-expenses-Liam-Fox-becomes-highest-shadow-cabinet-repayer.html|title=MPs' expenses: Liam Fox becomes highest shadow cabinet repayer|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Rosa|last=Prince|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203083854/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7450738/MPs-expenses-Liam-Fox-becomes-highest-shadow-cabinet-repayer.html|archivedate=3 February 2011}}</ref>

It was reported in June 2009 that Fox claimed expenses of more than £19,000 over the previous four years for his mobile phone. Fox stated that the high bill was due to regular trips overseas, in his capacity as Shadow Defence Secretary and said he was looking for a cheaper tariff.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MP Dr Fox's huge phone bills|url=https://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/mp-dr-fox-s-huge-phone-bills-1-331835|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Weston Mercury|language=en}}</ref>

In October 2012, the Commons Speaker blocked the release of data showing which MPs were renting their homes to other MPs for financial gain. However, a study of parliamentary records was published in ''[[the Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9619022/Expenses-scandal-27-MPs-let-one-home-and-claim-for-another.html |title=Expenses scandal: 27 MPs let one home and claim for another |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042226/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9619022/Expenses-scandal-27-MPs-let-one-home-and-claim-for-another.html |archivedate=5 March 2016  }}</ref> The study showed that Liam Fox receives rental income from his London home while simultaneously claiming rental income from the taxpayer to live at another residence.

In October 2013, documents showed that Fox claimed 3p for a 100 metre car trip a year earlier. He also made an additional 15 claims under £1 for car travel approved in 2012–13, two of which were for 24p and 44p. He told the ''[[Sunday People]]'': "I don't do my expenses. My office does them.

===Breaches of parliamentary rules===
In March 2010, Fox admitted breaking parliamentary rules on two occasions by visiting [[Sri Lanka]] on a trip paid for by the [[Sri Lankan government]] without declaring the trip in the Register of Members' Financial Interests in the required time of 30 days and failing to declare an interest in Sri Lanka when asking ministers how much UK aid had been given to Sri Lanka.

Fox stated that he had been working for 'all sides of the ethnic divide': "I have been involved in attempts to promote peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, involving all sides of the ethnic divide, since I was a foreign minister in 1997. During my most recent visit, I spoke at a press conference to outline my reasons for being there. The declaration of the visit you refer to in November 2007 was highlighted in an end-of-year audit following a changeover of staffing responsibilities.
