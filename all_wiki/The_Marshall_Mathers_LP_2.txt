'''''The Marshall Mathers LP 2''''' is the eighth studio album by American rapper [[Eminem]]. It was released on November 5, 2013 by [[Aftermath Entertainment]], [[Shady Records]], and [[Interscope Records]]. The album is Eminem's last to have the involvement of independent label [[Web Entertainment]]. It serves as a sequel to his third album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000). Recorded from 2012 to 2013 with several producers, [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Rick Rubin]] served as executive producers for ''The Marshall Mathers LP 2''. It features [[guest appearance]]s from [[Skylar Grey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Nate Ruess]], and rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]], among others.

The idea of a sequel to ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' came about after Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him of his earlier music, though Eminem wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds from [[turntablism]] for the sequel. The album draws influences from [[arena rock]] and [[old-school hip hop]], mainly inspired by the [[Beastie Boys]]' ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' era and [[LL Cool J]]'s [[Radio (LL Cool J album)|''Radio'']] era, while the production is more minimalist than Eminem's previous records.

''The Marshall Mathers LP 2'' was regarded as one of the most anticipated albums of 2013. The album was revealed during the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]] in August 2013, alongside a preview of its lead single "[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]". It was followed by two more singles: "[[Survival (Eminem song)|Survival]]" and "[[Rap God]]". "[[The Monster (song)|The Monster]]", featuring Rihanna, was released as the album's fourth single and reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album's fifth single "[[Headlights (Eminem song)|Headlights]]", featuring Ruess, was released in 2014.

''The Marshall Mathers LP 2'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling more than 792,000 copies in its first week. In March 2017, it was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="totalsales" /> It was met with positive reviews by critics, with praise directed at Eminem's technical rapping abilities and production choices. The album marked an improvement in reception over Eminem's previous three albums, and was named on multiple best album year-end lists. It won Eminem a record sixth [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|2015 Grammy Awards]].

{{Quote box|width=25em|quote = "Calling it ''The Marshall Mathers LP 2'', obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. I wouldn't want to call it that just for the sake of calling it that. I had to make sure that I had the right songs – and just when you think you got it, you listen and you're like, 'Fuck, man. I feel like it needs this or that,' to paint the whole picture. So there's not gonna be, like, continuations of every old song on there or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe, and it's more about the nostalgia."<ref name="RSExclusive">{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Hiatt|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-revives-the-real-slim-shady-20131023|title=Eminem Exclusive: Slim Shady on His New LP|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>

Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at [[Activision Blizzard]], explained to ''Billboard'' in August 2013 that he was contacted by Eminem's manager Rosenberg in March to partner Eminem with ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]''. In June, Riley and members of his team flew to Detroit to meet Eminem and Rosenberg. The team was showcased a "handful" of songs, while Eminem was shown early concept art and gameplay footage of ''Ghosts''. "Survival" was picked as the best-fitting song, but the final version differed vastly from the earliest version of the track. Over the next couple of months, Eminem turned in five successive versions of the song, each one "bigger and more anthemic sounding than the last." – The final version was turned in only a day before its reveal on August 14.<ref name="TimRiley">{{cite web|first=Reggie|last=Ugwu|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/5657693/how-call-of-duty-and-activisionblizzard-scored-eminems-first-new|title=How 'Call of Duty' and ActivisionBlizzard Scored Eminem’s First New Song in Over Two Years (Exclusive)|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref>

In a behind the scenes video for "Berzerk", released in October 2013, Rubin explained that he met Rosenberg a few years back and that they had discussed the possibility of him and Eminem working together. He stated that the idea of "throwback" song to earlier hip hop recordings was an idea conceived later in the creative process of the album. He noted that initial sample the song was built around ended up not being used, and that the final product differs greatly from the original.<ref name="BehindBerzerk1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/behind-scenes-eminem-berzerk-video|title=Behind The Scenes: Eminem 'Berzerk' |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>
In an October 2013 interview with MTV, [[DVLP]] said that the instrumental for "Rap God" had been in the making two years prior to the track's release. While the instrumental had been offered to rappers such as [[T.I.]] and [[Fabolous]], the producer didn't feel the record fit their music. He estimated that Shady Records got hold of the instrumental around Fall 2012, and DVLP himself did not hear "Rap God" until Eminem phoned him after its release.<ref name="DVLPMTV">{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Markman|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1716079/eminem-rap-god-producer-dvlp/|title=Eminem's Thanks 'Rap God' Producer For One Of The 'Illest Beats' He's Heard|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref>

The idea of a sequel to ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' came about after Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him and his friends, namely Rosenberg, of Eminem's earlier recordings; " The more I listened to it, the more it made sense to call it that," said Eminem. Eminem also wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds such as beatbreaks and scratches, and he felt that Rubin could help him "take that to another level."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Brian Hiatt |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-q-a-exclusive-the-making-of-the-marshall-mathers-lp-2-20131101 |title=Eminem QA Exclusive: The Making of 'Marshall Mathers LP 2' &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref>

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 33 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."<ref name="Metacritic"/>

Paul MacInnes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the album a perfect five star rating saying, "His flows are exceptional, the wordplay is dazzling. The jokes, in places offensive, are relentless. There is no apology; no concession; just a virtuoso application of talent."<ref name="theguardian1" /> Jon Dolan of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "Nostalgia is everywhere. … He's playing his best character, the demon spawn of Trailer Hell, America, hitting middle age with his middle finger up his nose while he cleans off the Kool-Aid his kids spilled on the couch".<ref name="rollingstone.com" /> Christopher Weingarten of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' stated, "If rapping were purely an athletic competition, Eminem would be Michael Phelps and Lou Retton combined: pure ability and flexibility, like a bullet with only white-hot hate in his wake". He would go on to add that "we get rhymes… more rhymes than some rappers manage in a whole career".<ref name="spin.com" /> Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "Eminem sounds more alive – angrier yet fully present – than he has in years… Eminem burns with purpose on "MMLP2". And if you don't like what he (still) has to say, there's a chance he doesn't either".<ref name="latimes.com">{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Mikael|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-review-eminems-the-marshall-mathers-lp-2-20131101-story.html#page=1|title=Review: Eminem's furious 'The Marshall Mathers LP 2'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>

[[Edna Gundersen]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' said, Eminem "recaptures  the original release's wild, clever, emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats".<ref name="USATodayreview"/> Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the album a positive review saying, "If anything, the sequel is more intense than the original, as the Detroit rapper explodes like an M-80..... many memorable ones to be heard here, as Eminem doubles down on his manic flow, bursting with analogies, jokes, illusions, and ingenious wordplay with dizzying speed and skill".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/11/04/album-review-eminem-the-marshall-mathers/o9fkabLTfGjFj6hYVaTedL/story.html |title=ALBUM REVIEW: Eminem, 'The Marshall Mathers LP 2' – Music |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> Dan Rys of ''XXL'' gave the album a rating of XL saying, "the thing that carries Em through is the diversity of his flows, and his ability to rap over anything ..... you're getting one with more perspective, a version which has seen 13 more years and has a different outlook on some of the same topics that he first visited in 2000".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2013/11/eminem-marshall-mathers-lp-2-album-review/ |title=Eminem Battles Slim Shady On 'Marshall Mathers LP 2'|magazine= XXL |publisher=Harris Publications |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref> Evan Rytlewski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the album a B rating, saying "after years of stagnancy and tedious anger, he shows real growth on ''The Marshall Mathers LP''. Eminem has always rapped with forceful determination out of compulsive drives to prove himself to doubters, cut down his enemies, and retain his commercial foothold. For the first time in far too long, he sounds like he's rapping because he enjoys it, too."<ref name=AV/> Jon Carmanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the album a positive review saying, "His lyrics are best viewed under a microscope..... to see how he gets from one rhyme to the next in unexpected ways..... he'll dominate almost any sound..... but he still has some old habits, still heavy-handed with homophobic slurs..... Eminem is still rapping from deep inside his cave, as if he's had no new experiences to draw from."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/arts/music/eminem-grows-older-but-not-up.html|title=Eminem Grows Older, but Not Up|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=2013-11-08|first=Jon|last=Caramanica}}</ref> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] spoke of the album saying, it is a "vicious, infectious, hilarious triumph..... a super villain so familiar with hate and depression, he's powered by all shades of anger ..... most of the best moments on MMLP2 are just as angry and just as irresponsible.....

In a mixed review, [[Greg Kot]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the album two out of four stars saying, "it reaffirms his prodigious agility with rhymes. Eminem still crunches together syllables, silliness, and storytelling flights of ridiculousness with acrobatic skill" and "The sense that we've all been here before, twice, is exacerbated by tired samples and interpolations. Eminem tries to cover up his retreat by doing cartwheels and back-flips with his rhymes".<ref>{{cite news|author-link=Greg Kot|first=Greg|last=Kot |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-eminem-marshall-mathers-lp2-review-20131103,0,4989351.column |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223154604/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-03/entertainment/chi-eminem-marshall-mathers-lp2-review-20131103_1_marshall-mathers-lp2-slim-shady-most-revered-albums |archive-date=2013-12-23 |title=Eminem album review; The Marshall Mathers LP2 reviewed |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> Craig Jenkins of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album a mixed review saying, "Eminem is a titan with wordplay, but ''MMLP2'' once again finds him at a loss for how to apply his talents."<ref name="pitchfork.com"/> Nick Catucci of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a C+ criticizing Eminem's use of slurs on the album, saying "Eminem wouldn't be Eminem..... if he didn't allot some of his whizbang homophobic slurs and misogynistic fantasies..... rightly considered a rap great for his technical prowess, wicked humor, and tenacity..... which make his flashes of hatred for women and gay men all the more alarming."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal|first=Nick|last=Catucci|date=November 6, 2013|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20752992,00.html|title=The Marshall Mathers LP 2|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

===Accolades===
{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by Eminem}}
Closing out the year, ''The Marshall Mathers LP 2'' was ranked in multiple "Albums of the Year" lists. ''XXL'' named it the second best album of the year. They commented saying, "Three years after his widely praised album ''Recovery'', Em tapped into his former self for ''Marshall Mathers LP 2''. Slim Shady, along with the characters and stories from the first installment, are peppered throughout his latest effort. The Rap God also displays his lyrical prowess on songs like “Love Game” with Kendrick Lamar, the tribute to his mother in “[[Headlights (Eminem song)|Headlights]]," and the old school rap-rock ode "Berzerk." Em also supplies the world with another Rihanna collaboration that ups the expectations for fans every time their name is paired together. Overall, Eminem proves once again that his second wind is just as good as his glory days."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/the-25-best-albums-of-2013/4/ |title=The 25 Best Albums Of 2013 – Page 4 of 6|magazine=XXL |publisher=Harris Publications |date=2013-12-23 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> ''Complex'' ranked the album number six, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013, praising it as Eminem's best album since ''The Eminem Show''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2013/eminem-marshall-mathers-lp-2 |title=6.
