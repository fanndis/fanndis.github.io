==Career==
Since arriving at NBC News in 2004, Alexander has covered many international stories— from Iraq’s historic election in <!-- Which one: January or December? --> 2005 to the death of [[Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan, and the tsunami in Indonesia<!--Which one?-->. He has filed reports from [[Afghanistan]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Israel]], [[Laos]] and [[Mexico]]. Alexander’s work also includes environmental reporting from the [[Northwest Passage]] in the Arctic, and reports on the deeply personal story of his sister, Rebecca, who has [[Usher Syndrome]], type III — a rare genetic disorder that is robbing her of her vision and her hearing.

Alexander has covered numerous breaking news events, including anchoring live coverage of the "[[Miracle on the Hudson]]" and the [[Virginia Tech shooting]]. In 2010, he reported on the international controversy surrounding [[WikiLeaks]] and its founder [[Julian Assange]]. In addition to his news responsibilities, Alexander has also served as an [[NBC Sports]] host, and covered both the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]] and the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

===White House correspondent===
Alexander served as a White House correspondent from 2012 to March 2014.  He covered the [[Presidency of Barack Obama]], traveling across the world with the president. As Alexander is based in [[Washington, D.C.]], he still frequently reports from the White House.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

On March 20, 2020, he attended a live White House briefing held on steps the federal and state governments were undertaking to respond to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].  President Donald Trump stated he had a "good feeling" and was "hopeful" about the potential effectiveness against coronavirus of certain older drug therapies such as [[chloroquine]] that have been effective on other conditions.  Alexander asked: "Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope?" President Trump answered that it was important to communicate hopeful therapies that are being investigated.  Alexander further questioned the president: "What do you say to Americans who are scared though? I guess, nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions, as you witnessed, who are scared right now. What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?" Trump replied, "I say that you are a terrible reporter, that's what I say. I think it's a very nasty question. I think it's a very bad signal that you are putting out to the American people. They're looking for answers and they're looking for hope. And you're doing sensationalism."<ref name="wapo-trump">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/nbcs-peter-alexander-asked-trump-to-reassure-americans-about-coronavirus-trump-berated-him-instead/2020/03/20/f7452a80-6ada-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html NBC's Peter Alexander asked Trump to reassure Americans about coronavirus.
