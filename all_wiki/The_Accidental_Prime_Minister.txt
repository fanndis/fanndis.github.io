'''''The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh''''' is a 2014 memoir by Indian policy analyst [[Sanjaya Baru]], who was Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]]'s media advisor from May 2004 to August 2008.<ref>[http://www.iiss.org/en/persons/sanjaya-s-baru Sanjaya Baru: Director for Geo-Economics and Strategy]. [[International Institute of Strategic Studies]]. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.</ref> Published by [[Penguin India]], the book alleges that Singh was not entirely in control of his [[Union Council of Ministers|cabinet]]—or even the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister's Office]] (PMO). Instead, significant power was wielded by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]]'s president [[Sonia Gandhi]], to whom Singh was completely "subservient".<ref name=reuters>John Chalmers. "[http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/11/india-election-singh-sonia-idINDEEA3A0C320140411 Ex-adviser says Manmohan Singh was hobbled by Sonia Gandhi]". [[Reuters]]. 11 April 2014.</ref> "There cannot be two centres of power", Baru remembers Singh explaining to him, "That creates confusion. I have to accept that the party president is the centre of power. The government is answerable to the party."<ref name=reuters/>

The PMO released a statement the day ''The Accidental Prime Minister'' was released, dismissing the veracity of the memoir, "It is an attempt to misuse a privileged position and access to high office to gain credibility and to apparently exploit it for commercial gain. The commentary smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser."<ref name=guardian>Anu Anand.

''[[The Hindu]]''. 12 April 2014.</ref> Baru told ''[[The Indian Express]]'', "most of the book is positive [about the PM]" and that he wrote it mainly because Singh "has become an object of ridicule, not admiration. I am showing him as a human being, I want there to be empathy for him."<ref>Ritu Sarin.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Such an intimate portrait of dysfunction will certainly have political ramifications", especially since India is in the [[2014 Indian general election|midst of a general election]].<ref name=guardian/> Spokespersons of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], the chief opposition party, posed a series of questions to Singh and Sonia Gandhi on the basis of ''The Accidental Prime Minister''{{'}}s revelations, "did the PM refuse to take daily briefings from intelligence agencies and did this not have a bearing on our security situation? ... Did the PM forfeit his prerogative to decide on who would be in his cabinet? Was the '2G fame' [[Andimuthu Raja|A Raja]] appointed at the behest of Sonia Gandhi? Did the PM knowingly overlook corruption by his colleagues as alleged in the book. Did [[2G spectrum case|2G]], [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|CWG]] and [[Indian coal allocation scam|Coalgate]] happen because of this?"<ref>"[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/barus-book-bjp-poser-to-pm-sonia/article5905661.ece Baru’s book: BJP poser to PM, Sonia]". ''The Hindu''. 12 April 2014.</ref> In light of the elections, the BJP also promised "We will not give an accidental Prime Minister to this country."<ref>"[http://zeenews.india.com/news/general-elections-2014/we-will-not-give-an-accidental-prime-minister-bjp_924025.html We will not give an accidental Prime Minister: BJP]".
