==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the [[bowel]], and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body ([[metastasis]]). The classic warning signs include: worsening [[constipation]], blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]] in someone over 50 years old.<ref>{{cite book |first1=David H. |last1=Alpers |first2=Anthony N. |last2=Kalloo |first3=Neil |last3=Kaplowitz |first4=Chung |last4=Owyang |first5=Don W. |last5=Powell |editor1-last=Yamada |editor1-first=Tadataka | name-list-style = vanc |title=Principles of clinical gastroenterology |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex |isbn=978-1-4051-6910-3 |pages=381 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo7QcUjz0PYC&pg=PA381 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928133221/https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo7QcUjz0PYC&pg=PA381 |archive-date=September 28, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Around 50% of individuals with colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Juul JS, Hornung N, Andersen B, Laurberg S, Olesen F, Vedsted P | title = The value of using the faecal immunochemical test in general practice on patients presenting with non-alarm symptoms of colorectal cancer | language = En | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 119 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–479 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30065255 | pmc = 6133998 | doi = 10.1038/s41416-018-0178-7 }}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
Colorectal cancer is a disease originating from the [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] lining the colon or rectum of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], most frequently as a result of mutations in the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] that increase signaling activity. The mutations can be [[Hereditary disease|inherited]] or [[somatic cell|acquired]], and most probably occur in the [[intestinal crypt]] [[stem cell]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M | s2cid = 4254940 | title = Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 363 | issue = 6429 | pages = 558–561 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8505985 | doi = 10.1038/363558a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.363..558I }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthi S, Krishnan B, Madhavan M | title = Apoptosis and expression of p53 in colorectal neoplasms | journal = Indian J.

The APC protein prevents the accumulation of [[β-catenin]] protein. Without APC, β-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of proto-[[oncogenes]]. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer. While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased β-catenin because of mutations in [[β-catenin]] (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as [[AXIN1]], [[AXIN2]], [[TCF7L2]], or [[Naked cuticle 1|NKD1]].<ref name="markowitz">{{cite journal |vauthors=Markowitz SD, Bertagnolli MM | title = Molecular Origins of Cancer: Molecular Basis of Colorectal Cancer | journal = N.

Beyond the defects in the [[Wnt signaling pathway]], other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The [[p53]] protein, produced by the ''TP53'' gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their [[apoptosis|programmed death]] if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the ''TP53'' gene and transforms the tissue from a [[adenoma|benign epithelial tumor]] into an invasive [[carcinoma|epithelial cell cancer]]. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named [[BAX (gene)|BAX]] is mutated instead.<ref name="markowitz"/>

Other proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are [[TGF-β]] and DCC ([[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer]]). TGF-β has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-β is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named [[SMAD (protein)|SMAD]] is deactivated.<ref name="markowitz"/> DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehlen P, Fearon ER | title = Role of the dependence receptor DCC in colorectal cancer pathogenesis | journal = J.

Approximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer.<ref name="Uh2017"/> Some genes are [[oncogenes]]: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins [[KRAS]], [[C-Raf|RAF]], and [[PI3K]], which normally stimulate the [[Cell cycle|cell to divide]] in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vogelstein B, Kinzler KW | s2cid = 205383514 | title = Cancer genes and the pathways they control | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 789–799 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15286780 | doi = 10.1038/nm1087 }}</ref> [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]], a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.<ref name="markowitz"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:ColonCaWithMetsMark.png|thumb|Colon cancer with extensive metastases to the liver]]
Colorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion.<ref name=Lancet10/> It is confirmed by microscopical examination of a tissue sample.

===Medical imaging===
A colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on [[CT scan]].

Presence of [[Metastasis|metastases]] is determined by a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.<ref name="Lancet10"/> Other potential imaging tests such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[MRI]] may be used in certain cases.<ref name="Lancet10" /> The latter is often used for rectal lesions to determine its local stage and to facilitate preoperative planning.

<!-- Diet -->
Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of [[red meat]] and [[processed meat]]s. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions (outside of eating a healthy diet) will have significant protective effects.<ref name="WCR2014Willett">{{cite book |last1=Willett |first1=Walter C. |editor1-last=Stewart |editor1-first=Bernard W. |editor2-last=Wild |editor2-first=Christopher P | name-list-style = vanc |title=World Cancer Report |date=2014 |publisher=the International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization |isbn=978-92-832-0443-5 |pages=432–435 |chapter-url=http://publications.iarc.fr/Non-Series-Publications/World-Cancer-Reports/World-Cancer-Report-2014 |chapter=Diet, nutrition, and cancer: where next for public health?}}</ref>{{rp|432–433}}<ref name=WCR2014_2.6/>{{rp|125–126}} In 2018 the [[National Cancer Institute]] stated that "There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree."<ref name=NCI2018Overview/><ref name="NCI2018Evidence">{{cite web |title=Colorectal Cancer Prevention Description of Evidence |url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-prevention-pdq#section/_29 |website=National Cancer Institute |access-date=26 October 2018 |language=en |date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

The three main screening tests are [[colonoscopy]], [[fecal occult blood]] testing, and [[flexible sigmoidoscopy]].

If the cancer is found at a very early stage, it may be removed during a colonoscopy using a variety of techniques including [[Endoscopic mucosal resection|EMR]] and [[Endoscopic submucosal dissection|ESD]].<ref name=NCI2014PtTx/> For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> The procedure of choice is a partial [[colectomy]] (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its [[mesocolon]] and [[Mesenteric arteries|blood supply]] to facilitate removal of draining [[lymph node]]s. This can either be done by an open [[laparotomy]] or [[laparoscopic]]ally, depending on patient and lesion factors.<ref name="Lancet10" /> The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a [[colostomy]].<ref name=NCI2014PtTx/>

In the “''Surgical Resection of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Carcinoma Survival According to Radical Liver Resection and to Prognostic Factors''“ the Autors stated that the surgical resection of the liver metastases is considered the most effective therapy for liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (LMCC) patients, and is potentially the only curative treatment. Their results shows that if radical (R0) liver resection was achieved, the number of metastases, their location (unilobar vs bilobar), and the occurrence of extrahepatic metastases did not affect the patients’ 3 year survival.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fantola|first=G.|last2=Tondolo [[Mater_Olbia_Hospital]]|first2=V.|last3=Mantovani|first3=G.|last4=Runfola|first4=M.|last5=Zamboni|first5=F.|date=September 2011|title=6077 POSTER Surgical Resection of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Carcinoma -Survival According to Radical Liver Resection and to Prognostic Factors|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(11)71722-1|journal=European Journal of Cancer|volume=47|pages=S414|doi=10.1016/s0959-8049(11)71722-1|issn=0959-8049}}</ref> 

===Chemotherapy===
In both cancer of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[rectum]], [[chemotherapy]] may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.

In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Böckelman C, Engelmann BE, Kaprio T, Hansen TF, Glimelius B |date=January 2015 |title=Risk of recurrence in patients with colon cancer stage II and III: a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature |journal=Acta Oncologica |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |doi=10.3109/0284186x.2014.975839 |pmid=25430983 |doi-access=free}}</ref> It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.<ref name=Lancet10/>

If cancer has spread to the [[lymph nodes]] or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents [[fluorouracil]], [[capecitabine]] or [[oxaliplatin]] increases life expectancy.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then [[palliative]].<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.<ref name="Lancet10" /> Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include [[capecitabine]], [[fluorouracil]], [[irinotecan]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[Tegafur-Uracil|UFT]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer | journal = Prescrire International | volume = 19 | issue = 109 | pages = 219–224 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21180382 }}</ref> The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine.

The primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a [[colostomy]] is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.

Stage IV colorectal cancer due to [[peritoneal carcinomatosis]] can be treated using [[Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy|HIPEC]] in selected patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sugarbaker PH, Van der Speeten K | title = Surgical technology and pharmacology of hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy | journal = Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–44 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26941982 | pmc = 4754302 | doi = 10.3978/j.issn.2078-6891.2015.105 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Segura-Sampedro JJ, Morales-Soriano R | title = Prophylactic HIPEC with oxaliplatin might be of benefit in T4 and perforated colon cancer: another possible interpretation of the COLOPEC results | journal = Revista Espanola de Enfermedades Digestivas | volume = 112 | date = July 2020 | issue = 8 | page = 666 | pmid = 32686435 | doi = 10.17235/reed.2020.6755/2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Esquivel J, Sticca R, Sugarbaker P, Levine E, Yan TD, Alexander R, Baratti D, Bartlett D, Barone R, Barrios P, Bieligk S, Bretcha-Boix P, Chang CK, Chu F, Chu Q, Daniel S, de Bree E, Deraco M, Dominguez-Parra L, Elias D, Flynn R, Foster J, Garofalo A, Gilly FN, Glehen O, Gomez-Portilla A, Gonzalez-Bayon L, Gonzalez-Moreno S, Goodman M, Gushchin V, Hanna N, Hartmann J, Harrison L, Hoefer R, Kane J, Kecmanovic D, Kelley S, Kuhn J, Lamont J, Lange J, Li B, Loggie B, Mahteme H, Mann G, Martin R, Misih RA, Moran B, Morris D, Onate-Ocana L, Petrelli N, Philippe G, Pingpank J, Pitroff A, Piso P, Quinones M, Riley L, Rutstein L, Saha S, Alrawi S, Sardi A, Schneebaum S, Shen P, Shibata D, Spellman J, Stojadinovic A, Stewart J, Torres-Melero J, Tuttle T, Verwaal V, Villar J, Wilkinson N, Younan R, Zeh H, Zoetmulder F, Sebbag G | display-authors = 6 | title = Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the management of peritoneal surface malignancies of colonic origin: a consensus statement.

===Radiation therapy===
While a combination of [[radiation]] and chemotherapy may be useful for [[rectal cancer]],<ref name=Lancet10/> its use in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.<ref>{{cite book| first1 = Vincent T. | last1 = DeVita | first2 = Theodore S. | last2 = Lawrence | first3 = Steven A. | last3 = Rosenberg | name-list-style = vanc |title=DeVita, Hellman, and Rosenberg's Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NF90HzUFPjgC&pg=PA1258|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7207-5|pages=1258–}}</ref> Just as for [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation|radiotherapy]] can be used in the [[Neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant]] and [[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] setting for some stages of [[rectal cancer]].

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palliative or Supportive Care|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|publisher=American Cancer Society|access-date=20 August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821054618/http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|archive-date=August 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ASCO Provisional Clinical Opinion: The Integration of Palliative Care into Standard Oncology Care |url=http://www.asco.org/quality-guidelines/asco-provisional-clinical-opinion-integration-palliative-care-standard-oncology |publisher=ASCO |access-date=20 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821114944/http://www.asco.org/quality-guidelines/asco-provisional-clinical-opinion-integration-palliative-care-standard-oncology |archive-date=August 21, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Higginson IJ, Evans CJ | s2cid = 39881122 | title = What is the evidence that palliative care teams improve outcomes for cancer patients and their families? | journal = Cancer Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 423–435 | date = Sep–Oct 2010 | pmid = 20890138 | doi = 10.1097/PPO.0b013e3181f684e5 }}</ref>

In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving [[quality of life]]. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wasserberg N, Kaufman HS | title = Palliation of colorectal cancer | journal = Surg.

===Follow-up===
The aims of follow-up are to diagnose, in the earliest possible stage, any metastasis or tumors that develop later, but did not originate from the original cancer (metachronous lesions).

The U.S. [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] and [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.<ref name="NCCNguidelines">{{cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/colon.pdf|title=National Comprehensive Cancer Network|work=nccn.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325235446/http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/colon.pdf|archive-date=March 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="pmid16260687">{{cite journal | vauthors = Desch CE, Benson AB, Somerfield MR, Flynn PJ, Krause C, Loprinzi CL, Minsky BD, Pfister DG, Virgo KS, Petrelli NJ | title = Colorectal cancer surveillance: 2005 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 33 | pages = 8512–8519 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16260687 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.0063 }}</ref> A [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]] are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. [[Carcinoembryonic antigen]] blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A [[Computed tomography|CT-scan]] of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A [[colonoscopy]] can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.

Routine [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scanning]], [[chest X-ray]]s, [[complete blood count]] or [[liver function tests]] are not recommended.<ref name="NCCNguidelines"/><ref name="pmid16260687"/>

For people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffery M, Hickey BE, Hider PN | title = Follow-up strategies for patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | pages = CD002200 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31483854 | pmc = 6726414 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002200.pub4 }}</ref>

===Exercise===
Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and expression of biomarkers. Patients with tumors that lacked [[CTNNB1]] expression (β-catenin), involved in [[Wnt signalling pathway]], required more than 18 [[Metabolic equivalent]] (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of patients who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Betof AS, Dewhirst MW, Jones LW | title= Effects and potential mechanisms of exercise training on cancer progression: A translational perspective | journal = Brain Behav.

Another potential biomarker may be [[p27 (gene)|p27]]. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal-cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]] may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.<ref name="Ballard-Barbash2012"/>

==Prognosis==
In Europe the [[five-year survival rate]] for colorectal cancer is less than 60%.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> In the [[developed world]] about a third of people who get the disease die from it.<ref name="Lancet10" />

Survival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the [[muscularis mucosa]] (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. Patients with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 5% and an average survival time of 13 months.<ref name="pmid20332485">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zacharakis M, Xynos ID, Lazaris A, Smaro T, Kosmas C, Dokou A, etal | title=Predictors of survival in stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer. | journal=Anticancer Res | year= 2010 | volume= 30 | issue= 2 | pages= 653–660 | pmid=20332485 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=20332485 }}</ref><ref name="agabegi2nd">Box 3-1, Page 107 in: {{cite book |first1 = Elizabeth D | last1 = Agabegi | last2 = Agabegi | first2 = Steven S. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-7153-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stepuptomedicine0000agab }}</ref>

The average five-year recurrence rate in people where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II and 33% in stage III.

===United States===
Colorectal cancer is the second highest cause of cancer occurrence and death for men and women in the United States combined. An estimated 141,210 cases were diagnosed in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Effectively Communicating Colorectal Cancer Screening Information to Primary Care Providers |journal=American Journal of Health Education |date=2012 |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=194–201 |doi= 10.1080/19325037.2012.10599235|pmid=26937262 |pmc=4770578 }}</ref>

Based on rates from 2007 to 2009, 5.0% of US men and women born today will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer during their lifetime.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Howlader N, Noone AM, Krapcho M, Neyman N, Aminou R, Altekruse SF, Kosary CL, Ruhl J, Tatalovich Z, Cho H, Mariotto A, Eisner MP, Lewis DR, Chen HS, Feuer EJ, Cronin KA | title = SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975–2009 (Vintage 2009 Populations) | publisher = National Cancer Institute | location = Bethesda, MD | url = http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2009_pops09/ | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120903030917/http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2009_pops09/ | archive-date = September 3, 2012 | df = mdy-all }} Based on November 2011 SEER data submission, posted to the SEER web site, 2012.</ref> From 2005 to 2009, the median age at diagnosis for cancer of the colon and rectum in the US was 69 years of age. Approximately 0.1% were diagnosed under age 20; 1.1% between 20 and 34; 4.0% between 35 and 44; 13.4% between 45 and 54; 20.4% between 55 and 64; 24.0% between 65 and 74; 25.0% between 75 and 84; and 12.0% 85+ years of age. Rates are higher among males (54 per 100,000 c.f. 40 per 100,000 for females).

==Research==
Preliminary [[in-vitro]] evidence suggests [[lactic acid bacteria]] (e.g., [[lactobacilli]], [[streptococci]] or [[lactococci]]) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as [[antioxidant]] activity, [[Immunotherapy|immunomodulation]], promoting [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]], [[cytostasis|antiproliferative effects]], and [[epigenetic]] modification of cancer cells.<ref name="Zhong2014">{{cite journal|vauthors=Zhong L, Zhang X, Covasa M |title=Emerging roles of lactic acid bacteria in protection against colorectal cancer|journal=World J.
