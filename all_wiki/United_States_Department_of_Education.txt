The '''United States Department of Education''' ('''ED''' or '''DoED'''), also referred to as '''the ED''' for (the) Education Department, is a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level department of the [[federal government of the United States|United States government]]. It began operating on May 4, 1980, having been created after the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] was split into the Department of Education and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] by the [[Department of Education Organization Act]], which President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed into law on October 17, 1979.<ref>{{USStatute|96|88|93|668|1979|10|17|S|210}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/department-of-education-organization-act-1979/|title=Department of Education Organization Act, 1979|date=15 April 2011|website=wordpress.com|access-date=15 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107175246/https://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/department-of-education-organization-act-1979/|archive-date=7 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Department of Education is administered by the [[United States Secretary of Education|United States secretary of education]]. It has under 4,000 employees (2018)<ref name="politico"/> and an annual budget of $68 billion (2016).<ref name="About ED" /> The 2019 Budget also supports $129.8 billion in new postsecondary grants, loans, and work-study assistance to help an estimated 11.5 million students and their families pay for college.<ref name="FY2019 Federal Budget">{{cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/budget-factsheet.pdf|title=ED FY2019 Budget|author=U.S. Secretary of Education|date=14 February 2018|website=ed.gov|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118013909/https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/budget-factsheet.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Its official abbreviation is "ED" ("DOE" refers to the [[United States Department of Energy]]) and is also often abbreviated informally as "DoEd".

==Functions==

The primary functions of the Department of Education are to "establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights."<ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/about/what-we-do.html What We Do] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106024234/http://www2.ed.gov/about/what-we-do.html |date=6 January 2011 }}.

Unlike the systems of most other countries, [[education in the United States]] is highly decentralized, and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards (with the exception of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]). This has been left to state and local school districts. The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as [[educational accreditation|accreditation]], over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.

The Department of Education is a member of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usich.gov/member_agency/department_of_education/|title=Department of Education &#124; Member Agency &#124; United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)|publisher=Usich.gov|access-date=2012-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826101616/http://www.usich.gov/member_agency/department_of_education|archive-date=26 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.

Opposition to the Department of Education mainly stems from [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who see the department as an undermining of [[states rights]], and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] who believe it results in a state-imposed leveling towards the bottom and low value for taxpayers' money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/daily/6095/LaissezFaire-Learning|title=Laissez-faire-learning|access-date=2012-06-28|date=2012-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011011409/http://mises.org/daily/6095/LaissezFaire-Learning|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Budget==

The U.S. Department of Education oversees the nation's education system. The department sets uniform rules and standards which are applied nationwide. “Since the Department of Education (Education) began operations in fiscal year 1980, its mission has included promoting student achievement and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity. To do so, Education partners with state and local governments, which provide most of the resources to school districts for K-12 programs".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hubbard|first1=Janie|last2=Swain|first2=Holly Hilboldt|date=July 2017|title=Using the U.S. Civil Rights Movement to explore social justice education with K-6 pre-service teachers|journal=[[The Journal of Social Studies Research]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=217–233|doi=10.1016/j.jssr.2016.09.002|issn=0885-985X}}</ref>

== History ==
===Establishment===
The Department's origin goes back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that the Department would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.<ref>(1) {{cite web|url=http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1867-act-to-establish-a-federal-department-of-education/|title=Act to Establish a Federal Department of Education, 1867|date=19 February 2011|website=wordpress.com|access-date=15 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093408/http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1867-act-to-establish-a-federal-department-of-education/|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=live}}<br>(2) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=465 Chap.

Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the [[United States Department of the Interior]] and the former United States Department of Health Education and Welfare (DHEW) (now the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS)).<ref name="Department History"/> An unsuccessful attempt at creating a Department of Education, headed by a [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], came with the Smith–Towner Bill in 1920.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=April 1920|title=The Smith-Towner Bill|journal=[[Elementary School Journal]]|volume=20|issue=8|pages=575–583|jstor=994235|doi=10.1086/454812|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

In 1939, the organization (then a bureau) was transferred to the [[Federal Security Agency]], where it was renamed as the Office of Education.  After [[World War II]], President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] promulgated "Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953." The Federal Security Agency was abolished and most of its functions were transferred to the newly formed DHEW.<ref>[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/ewing3.htm "Oral History Interview with Oscar R.

Upgrading Education to cabinet level status in 1979 was opposed by many in the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who saw the department as [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]], arguing that the Constitution doesn't mention ''education'', and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs. However, many see the department as constitutional under the [[Commerce Clause]], and that the funding role of the department is constitutional under the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]. The [[National Education Association]] supported the bill, while the [[American Federation of Teachers]] opposed it.<ref>{{cite news |title=House Narrowly Passes Department of Education Bill |agency=The New York Times |location=Spokane, Washington |date=July 12, 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lGsjAAAAIBAJ&pg=7077,5962023&dq=department-of-education&hl=en |access-date=23 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513043257/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lGsjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HO4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7077,5962023&dq=department-of-education&hl=en |archive-date=13 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Early history===
The Republican Party platform of 1980 called for the elimination of the Department of Education created under Carter and President [[Ronald Reagan]] promised during the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] to eliminate it as a cabinet post,<ref name="pbsfall96">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/backgrounders/department_of_education.html|title=Online Backgrounders: The Department of Education|date=Fall 1996|publisher=PBS|access-date=2005-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107065647/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/backgrounders/department_of_education.html|archive-date=7 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> but he was not able to do so with a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="catoed" /> In the 1982 [[State of the Union]] Address, he pledged: "The budget plan I submit to you on Feb. 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Department of Education."<ref name="catoed" />

By 1984 the GOP had dropped the call for elimination from its platform, and with the election of President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1988, the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with [[Goals 2000]] a virtual joint effort.

After the [[Newt Gingrich]]-led "revolution" in 1994 had taken control of both Houses of Congress, federal control of and spending on education soared. That trend continued unabated despite the fact that the Republican Party made abolition of the department a cornerstone of 1996 platform and campaign promises, calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local, state, and family affairs.<ref name="catoed" /> The GOP platform read: "The Federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place. This is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning."<ref name="catoed" />

In 2000, the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]] passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education.<ref name="workingca">{{cite web|url=http://workingcalifornians.com/2008_presidential_issues/education|title=Education|year=2007|access-date=2007-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117185409/http://workingcalifornians.com/2008_presidential_issues/education|archive-date=17 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the [[George W. Bush]] administration, which made reform of federal education a key priority of the president's first term.
