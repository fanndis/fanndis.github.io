In [[law]], '''''sua sponte''''' ([[Latin]]: "of his, her, its or their own accord") or '''''suo motu''''' ("on its own motion")<ref>{{cite web|title=(See--> Paragraph 26) Political Parties Dispute Tribunal & another v Musalia Mudavadi & 6 others Ex Parte Petronila Were [2014] eKLR|url=http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/103475/|publisher=The National Council for Law Reporting (Kenya Law) 17-11- 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> describes an act of authority taken without formal prompting from another [[Party (law)|party]].  The term is usually applied to actions by a [[judge]] taken without a prior [[Motion (legal)|motion]] or request from the parties. The form '''''nostra sponte''''' ("of our own accord") is sometimes used by the court itself, when the action is taken by a multi-member court, such as an appellate court, rather than by a single judge (third parties describing such actions would still refer to them as being taken by the court as a whole and therefore as 'sua sponte'). While usually applied to actions of a court, the term may reasonably be applied to actions by government agencies and individuals acting in official capacity.

One situation in which a party might encourage a judge to move ''sua sponte'' occurs when that party is preserving a [[special appearance]] (usually to challenge [[jurisdiction]]), and therefore cannot make motions on its own behalf without making a [[general appearance]]. Common reasons for an action taken ''sua sponte'' are when the judge determines that the court does not have [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] or that the case should be moved to another judge because of a [[conflict of interest]], even if all parties disagree.
