'''Alexandria''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]] in the United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 139,966,<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=January 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040415/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|archive-date=January 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in 2019, the population was estimated to be 159,428.<ref name="US Census Bureau Estimates 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_739801612 |title=County Population Totals and Components of Change: 2010-2018 |access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref> Located along the western bank of the [[Potomac River]], Alexandria is approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} south of [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown Washington, D.C.]]

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]], as well as [[Central Maryland]], modern Alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Another is the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. In 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] moved to Alexandria, and in 2017, so did the headquarters of the [[National Science Foundation]].

The historic center of Alexandria is known as Old Town. With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, [[antique shop]]s and theaters, it is a major draw for all who live in Alexandria as well for visitors. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact and walkable. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.

A large portion of adjacent [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], mostly south but also west of the city, has Alexandria mailing addresses. However, this area is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County's government and separate from the independent city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/finance/info/default.aspx?id=27130|title=Tax Guide for New City Residents|website=www.alexandriava.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30|quote=Please note that some Alexandria postal addresses are located in Fairfax County, while some Arlington postal addresses are located in the City.}}</ref> The city is therefore sometimes referred to as the "City of Alexandria" to avoid confusion (see the "Neighborhoods" paragraph below). Additionally, neighboring [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] was formerly named "Alexandria County" before it was renamed by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1920 to reduce confusion with the city.

{{further|History of Alexandria, Virginia|Timeline of Alexandria, Virginia}}

=== Early history ===
According to archaeologists' estimates, a succession of [[indigenous peoples]] began to occupy the Chesapeake and Tidewater region about 3,000 to 10,000 years ago. Various [[tribe]]s of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the lands in the [[Potomac River]] drainage area since at least the early [[14th century]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland|last=Ferguson|first=Alice and Henry|publisher=Alice Ferguson Foundation|year=1960|pages=11}}</ref>

In the summer of 1608, English settler [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] explored the Potomac and came into contact with the [[Patawomeck]] (loosely affiliated with the [[Powhatan]]) and [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]] tribes who lived on the [[Virginia]] side, as well as on [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]], and the [[Piscataway Indians|Piscataway]] (also known as the Conoy), who resided on the [[Maryland]] side.<ref>Humphrey, Robert L.; Chambers, Mary Elizabeth (1977). ''Ancient Washington: American Indian Cultures of the Potomac Valley''. George Washington University.</ref> On this visit, Smith recorded the presence of a settlement called ''Assaomeck'' near the south bank of what is now [[Hunting Creek]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=41290|title=Assaomeck village depended on fish|last=Cressey|first=Pamela|date=6 June 1996|publisher=Alexandria Gazette Packet|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===

On October 21, 1669 a patent granted {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}} to Robert Howsing for transporting 120 people to the [[Colony of Virginia]].<ref name="Brockett and Rock">{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Franklin Longdon|last2=Rock|first2=George W.|title=A Concise History of the City of Alexandria, Va: From 1669 to 1883, with a Directory of Reliable Business Houses in the City|date=1883|publisher=Gazette Book and Job office|pages=140}}</ref>{{rp|5}} That tract would later become the City of Alexandria.<ref name="Brockett and Rock" />{{rp|5}} Virginia's comprehensive [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730|Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730]] mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale. One of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper [[Potomac River]] was at the mouth of [[Hunting Creek]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |title=Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612–1776 |website=Tobacco.org |access-date=January 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222043059/http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, the ground proved to be unsuitable, and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river, where the water was deep near the shore.

Following the 1745 settlement of the Virginia's 10-year dispute with [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] over the western boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], when the Privy Council in London found in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim, some of the Fairfax County gentry formed the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia. They intended to conduct trade into the interior of America, and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the Potomac. The best location was Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse, since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships. Many local tobacco planters, however, wanted a new town further up Hunting Creek, away from nonproductive fields along the river.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |title=Discovering the Decades: 1740s &#124; Historic Alexandria &#124; City of Alexandria, VA |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |access-date=January 29, 2012}}</ref>

Around 1746, Captain [[Philip Alexander II]] (1704–1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748–49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the [[House of Burgesses]] on November 1, 1748, that the "inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River," as [[Hugh West]] was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)]], the representative for Fairfax County and, more importantly, the son-in-law of [[William Fairfax]] and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother [[George Washington]], an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html|title=George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker|website=Loc.gov}}</ref>

Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town ''Alexandria'', in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain [[John Alexander (captain)|John Alexander]] (1711–1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria, and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of [[Robert Alexander II]] (1688–1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered "Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council]] and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax."<ref>{{cite book|author=Virginia. General Assembly.

Waddey Company}}</ref> A "Public Vendue" (auction) was advertised for July, and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots. The auction was conducted on July 13–14, 1749.

Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town "Belhaven", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, [[John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton]], the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt|title=The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903)|website=Files.usgwarchives.net|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref> The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.

In 1755, [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the provinces of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and [[Province of New York|New York]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[Early Modern France|French]] in America.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]]. The [[Mount Vernon Conference]] concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the [[Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which in turn led to the calling of the [[Federal Convention of 1787]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In 1791, Alexandria was included in the area chosen by [[George Washington]] to become the District of Columbia.

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], a British fleet launched a successful [[Raid on Alexandria]], which surrendered without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wine]], and [[sugar]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28306 | title=Discovering the Decades: 1810s | publisher=Alexandria Archaeology Museum}}</ref> In 1823 [[William Holland Wilmer]], [[Francis Scott Key]], and others founded the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cromey|first1=Robert Warren|title=Essays Irreverent|date=Sep 27, 2012|publisher=iUniverse|pages=184}}</ref>{{rp|116}} From 1828 to 1836,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=31254#African_American | title=Self-Guided Walking Tour Black Historic Sites | publisher=Alexandria Black History Museum}}</ref> Alexandria was home to the [[Franklin & Armfield]] Slave Market, one of the largest slave trading companies in the country.

A portion of the City of Alexandria—most of the area now known as "Old Town" as well as [[Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia|the areas of the city northeast of what is now King Street]]—and all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] share the distinction of having been the portion of Virginia ceded to the U.S. Government in 1791 to help form the new [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]]. Over time, a movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, the city's economy stagnated; at the same time, residents had lost any representation in Congress and the right to vote, and were disappointed with the negligible economic benefit (on the Alexandria side) of being part of the national capital. Alexandria still had an important port and market in the [[slave trade]], and as talk increased of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] slavery in the national capital, there was concern that Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if this step were taken. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the portion of the District of Columbia south of the Potomac River (Alexandria County) to Virginia. On July 9, 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded Alexandria County to Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |title=Get to know D.C. – Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C. |publisher=History Society of Washington, D.C. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206013429/http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |archive-date=February 6, 2007 }}</ref> The City of Alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]] in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1920.

The first fatalities of the North and South in the [[American Civil War]] occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|New York Fire Zouaves]], Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], sortied with a small detachment to remove a large [[Confederate flag]] displayed on the roof of the [[Marshall House (Alexandria, Virginia)|Marshall House Inn]] that had been visible from the White House.

[[Fort Ward (Virginia)|Fort Ward]], one of a ring of forts built by the Union army for the defense of [[Washington, D.C.]], is located inside the boundaries of present-day Alexandria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/FortWard|title= Fort Ward Museum|website=Alexandriava.gov|access-date=September 19, 2014}}</ref> After the creation by Washington of the state of [[West Virginia]] in 1863 and until the close of the war, Alexandria was the seat of the so-called [[Restored Government of Virginia]], also known as the "Alexandria Government".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}} During the Union occupation, a recurring contention between the Alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the Union army's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the President of the United States. Failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their church.

In 1861 and 1862, escaped [[African-American]] slaves poured into Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered comparative freedom and employment. Alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the Union army.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria">{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |title=Office of Historic Alexandria, Alexandria Freedmen's Cemetery: Historical Overview, April 2007, p. 2. |access-date=January 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140231/http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |archive-date=March 24, 2012 }}</ref> Until the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863, escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners. Therefore, they were labeled [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] to avoid returning them to their masters. Contrabands worked for the Union army in various support roles.

After all slaves in the seceding states were liberated, even more African Americans came to Alexandria. By the fall of 1863, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000{{mdash}}an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria" />

As of ratification of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifteenth Amendment]], Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the county. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.<ref name="alexandriaweba.com">[http://www.alexandriaweba.com/go/alexandriaafricanamericanhistory/freedmancemetery]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

At the turn of the 20th century the most common production in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer, and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905. The Old Dominion Glass Company also had a glass works fall to fire, then built a new one. The Belle Pre Bottle Company held a monopoly on a milk bottle that they patented, yet that organization only lasted 10 years.<ref>Commerce: {{Hanging indent | {{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Al|last2=Cressey|first2=Pamela J.|last3=Dennee|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Miller|first4=T.

=== History of libraries ===
John Wise, a local Alexandria businessman and hotel keeper, hosted a meeting in his home in 1789 to discuss the creation of a Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician [[Elisha Cullen Dick]], and George Washington's personal attorney [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]]. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]].

[[File:Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First city library location within an apothecary shop]]
Druggist Edward Stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his [[Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop|apothecary shop]]. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and place of business. Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library. The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary L.F. Custis]], wife of [[George Washington Parke Custis]].

The catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books, mostly on history and travel. By 1815, there were 1,022 entries in the catalog, and the collection had added more biographies, fiction, and magazines. The library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years, including the New Market House next to the City Hall, the [[Lyceum]] Company building, and Peabody Hall, which was owned by the Alexandria School Board. Raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge. In 1853, a lecture series was created to raise money. Speakers included Professor [[Joseph Henry]] of the Smithsonian, Colonel [[Francis H. Smith]] of the Virginia Military Institute, and humorist [[George W. Bagby]].

The arrival of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861 took its toll on the library collection. Members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection. Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.

In 1897, a group of women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in Peabody Hall, using the old books stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.

In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Robert South Barrett presented a proposal to the Library Association. They agreed to donate a building in memory of Dr. Barrett's mother, [[Kate Waller Barrett]], if the city would commit to running it as a public library. The city agreed and the Society of Friends offered a 99-year lease on an old Quaker graveyard located on Queen Street. The old library was closed on March 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library, which opened to the public in August 1937. The Alexandria Library Association became the Alexandria Library Society.

In 1939, the Barrett library was the scene of possibly [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker#Alexandria library sit-in|the nation's first sit-in demonstrations]], as [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker|Samuel Tucker]], a young law school graduate from the neighborhood, and several other African-American residents insisted on access to the racially segregated library where they had been banned. Tucker later became a prominent attorney in Richmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimcrowlivedhere.org/exhibits/show/1939-alexandria-library-sit-in |title=1939 Alexandria Library Sit-in |publisher=Jim Crow Lived Here |access-date=November 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org/history |title=Alexandria Historical Society – Alexandria's History |website=Alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org |access-date=November 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122072933/https://alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org/history |archive-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1947, the Library Society was reconstituted and took the earlier historic name Alexandria Library Company. A lecture series was also revived. Speakers included [[Thomas Jefferson]] biographer [[Dumas Malone]]. Some of the books belonging in the original collection of the Alexandria Library Company can now be found in the Local History/Special Collections Room at the Queen Street library that still carries Mrs. Barrett's name.<ref>Seale, William. ''The Alexandria Library Company''. Alexandria, Virginia: Alexandria Library, 2007.</ref>

In 1948, [[Ellen Coolidge Burke]] became director. Burke brought [[bookmobile]] services to Alexandria, one of the first services in Virginia. She oversaw the growth of the library system by the addition of two new branch libraries. In April 1968 the Ellen Coolidge Burke Branch at 4701 Seminary Road was opened, and in December 1969 the [[James M. Duncan]] branch at 2501 Commonwealth Avenue. Burke retired in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandria.lib.va.us/client/en_US/home/;jsessionid=55F1FE7BBEDA3613D2634F145C817736.enterprise-23800?rm=ELLEN+COOLIDGE1%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7Ctrue&ic=true&dt=list|title=Ellen Coolidge Burke|publisher=Alexandria Libraries}}</ref>

== Sports ==
Due to its proximity to Washington, Alexandria has only been the home of one professional sports team, the [[Alexandria Dukes]], a minor league baseball team which has moved to [[Woodbridge, Virginia|Woodbridge]] and is now named the [[Potomac Nationals]].

== Parks and recreation ==
Alexandria has a distributed park system with approximately {{convert|950|acre|km2}} spread across 70 major parks and 30 [[recreation]] centers, of which [[Castanea pumila|Chinquapin]] is one of the largest.

As an independent city of Virginia (as opposed to an incorporated town within a county), Alexandria derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1950 and it has been amended in 1968, 1971, 1976, and 1982.

Alexandria adopted a [[council-manager]] form of government by way of referendum in 1921. This type of government empowers the elected City Council to pass legislation and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for overseeing the city's administration.

The Mayor, who is chosen on a separate ballot, presides over meetings of the Council and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Mayor does not have the power to veto Council action. Council members traditionally choose the person receiving the most votes in the election to serve as Vice Mayor. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor performs the mayoral duties.

== Education ==
[[File:NVCC - Alexandria campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Big street with cars waiting at intersection|Entrance to [[Northern Virginia Community College]]'s Alexandria campus]]
The city is served by the [[Alexandria City Public Schools]] system and by the Alexandria campus of [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. The largest seminary in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], is located on Seminary Road. [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech's]] Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center, also known as WAAC, is located on Prince Street in Old Town, offering graduate programs in Urban Affairs and Planning, Public and International Affairs, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture. [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] operates a Northern Virginia branch of its School of Social Work and [[The George Washington University]] also has a campus near the King Street metro. This campus mainly offers professional and vocational programs, such as an executive MBA program, urban planning and security studies.

Alexandria has several of the Washington, D.C., area's top private schools, such as [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School]], [[Bishop Ireton High School]], and [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]]. Also in the city are Alexandria Country Day School, Commonwealth Academy, the Basilica School of Saint Mary, St. Rita's Catholic School, Blessed Sacrament School and [[Global Health College]].

Alexandria's public school system consists of thirteen elementary schools for grades 5-year-old Kindergarten through Grade 5. Middle Schools, George Washington and Francis C. Hammond, serve 6th through 8th graders. Minnie Howard Ninth Grade Center and [[T.C. Williams High School]] serve grades 9th and 10 through 12, respectively, for the entire city.

The demographics of Alexandria City Public Schools contrast with those of the city. In 2008, only 14% of the students at Francis C. Hammond Middle School were non-Hispanic whites, compared to about 60% when looking at the city as a whole. 27% were of Hispanic descent, and 48% were black. About 9% of the school was of Asian descent. In 2004, 62% of the school-going children received free lunches; by 2008, that number had decreased to 56%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100069&udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}</ref> At George Washington Middle School, 41% of students are non-Hispanic whites, 34% were Hispanic, and 21% was black; 2% of the students were Asian, and 52% of students received free lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100071&udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}</ref> T.C. Williams High School follows this trend as well; 23% of the students were classified as non-Hispanic whites, 25% as Hispanic, and 44% as black. 7% of the school was Asian, and 47% of all students received free lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100080&udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}</ref>

Alexandria is bisected east and west by [[State Route 7 (Virginia)|State Route 7]], known as [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]]. The most western section of King St here once was the terminus of the Leesburg Turnpike. Interstate 95/495 (the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]), including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, approximately parallels the city's southern boundary with Fairfax County. [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] crosses north and south through the western part of the city. Other major routes include north–south [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]] (Patrick and Henry Streets after [[Patrick Henry]], [[Jefferson Davis Highway#Virginia|Jefferson Davis Highway]] and Richmond Highway), Washington St/[[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], Russell Rd, Quaker Lane, Van Dorn St and Beauregard St, and east–west Duke Street ([[State Route 236 (Virginia)|State Route 236]]), Braddock Rd and Janneys Lane/Seminary Rd.

[[File:Amtrak 82 at Alexandria Union Station in 2007.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Big shiny train facing us, at station with passengers on platform|Southbound [[Amtrak]] train at Alexandria's Union Station]]
[[Union Station (Alexandria)|Alexandria Union Station]], the city's historic train station, has [[Amtrak]] intercity services and the [[Virginia Railway Express]] regional rail service.

The traditional boundary between Old Town and the latterly annexed sections of the city followed the railway now owned by [[CSX Transportation]].

The city government operates its own mass transit system, the [[DASH (bus)|DASH]] bus, connecting points of interest with local transit hubs. [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]], [[Washington Metro]], and the [[Virginia Railway Express]], better known as the VRE, also serve Alexandria. The city also offers a free "trolley" diesel bus service on King Street from the King Street Metro Station to the Waterfront<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|title=DASH : King Street Trolley – FREE|website=Dashbus.com|access-date=February 12, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150209153908/http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|archive-date=February 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a water taxi to and from the [[National Harbor]] development in Prince George's County, Maryland.
