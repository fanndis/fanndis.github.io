'''Three Rivers Press''' is the [[Trade paper edition|trade paperback]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of the [[Crown Publishing Group]], a division of [[Random House]]. It publishes original paperback titles as well as paperback reprints of books issued initially in [[hardcover]] by the other Crown imprints.

== History ==
The Crown Publishing Group launched its first paperback imprint, Crown Trade Paperbacks, in 1992. Five years later, the imprint decided to re-brand itself as Three Rivers Press, named for the [[Harlem River|Harlem]], [[East River|East]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] rivers that border [[Manhattan]], as well as the three hardcover imprints (Crown, Harmony, and Clarkson Potter) that initially fed the list. In 2010, Three Rivers began the paperback publisher for Crown Archetype and [[Harmony Books]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Crown Realigns Trade Paperback Operations| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2019-10-14| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/44491-crown-realigns-trade-paperback-operations.html}}</ref>
