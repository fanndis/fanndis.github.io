The '''57th Annual Grammy Awards''' were held on February 8, 2015, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The show was broadcast live by [[CBS]] at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]] ([[UTC−08:00|UTC−8]]). Rapper [[LL Cool J]] hosted the show for the fourth consecutive time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/entry/view/id/899269|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Grammys: LL Cool J To Host for Fourth Year in a Row|date=January 21, 2015|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

The Grammy nominations were open for recordings released between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2014. Breaking from tradition of a prime-time concert approach, the Grammy nominees were announced during an all-day event on December 5, 2014, starting with initial announcements on the ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' telecast, followed by updates made through The Grammys' official [[Twitter]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/12/05/2015-grammy-nominations-announced/19938541/|title=2015 Grammy nominations roll out|author=Ann Oldenburg, USA TODAY|date=December 5, 2014|work=USA TODAY}}</ref>

[[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] won four awards, including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for "[[Stay with Me (Sam Smith song)|Stay with Me]]" and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]''. [[Beck]]'s album ''[[Morning Phase]]'' was named [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. This prompted [[Kanye West]], who later said he thought Beyoncé should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his [[2009 MTV VMA]] scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.<ref name="cbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/kanye-west-causes-stir-at-grammys-with-beck-beyonc%C3%A9-comment-1.2950052|title=Kanye West causes stir at Grammys with Beck, Beyoncé comment - Arts &amp; Entertainment - CBC News|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}</ref> Both [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Beyoncé]] took three honors; with her wins, Beyoncé became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following [[Alison Krauss]].

== Pre-telecast ceremony ==

Not all Grammys were presented during the live telecast. As in previous years, most awards were handed out during the so-called ''pre-telecast ceremony'', held at the Nokia Theater next to the Staples Center, which takes place during the afternoon before the main show. From 2015 on, this ceremony has been known as the ''Premiere Ceremony''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-introduces-the-grammy-awards-premiere-ceremony|title=The Academy Introduces The GRAMMY Awards Premiere Ceremony|work=The GRAMMYs}}</ref> Approximately 70 Grammys were presented at this ceremony, consisting of the "minor" categories.

== Changes ==
As usual, had a number of small changes in the voting and awarding process:
* New categories
The [[Best American Roots Performance]] is a new category in the American Roots genre field. It was presented to the creators of the best performance in this genre field, which includes traditional Northern American (or ''regional roots'') musical styles such as [[cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[polka]] and others.
Another new category is the [[Best Roots Gospel Album]] in the Gospel genre field, for gospel albums in the aforementioned musical styles, including traditional southern Gospel music.
* Changes in the Gospel categories
The Gospel genre field was redefined to make a clearer distinction between the traditional gospel music and the style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the [[Best Roots Gospel Album]] category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as ''[[Best Gospel Performance/Song]]'', ''[[Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]]'', ''[[Best Gospel Album]]'', ''[[Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]]'' and ''[[Best Roots Gospel Album]]''.
* Samples allowed
For the first time, the use of samples and/or interpolations of other works in a new track was permitted in the various songwriters categories. Until now, samples were only allowed in the [[Best Rap Song]] category, but these are now also eligible in the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Best Rock Song]], [[Best R&B Song]], [[Best Country Song]], [[Best Gospel Performance/Song]], [[Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]], [[Best American Roots Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written For Visual Media]] categories.
* A few minor name changes.
