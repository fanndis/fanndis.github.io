==Background and release==
"We Ride" was written by [[Makeba Riddick]], [[Stargate (music producers)|Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen]], with production helmed by Eriksen and Hermansen under their stage name [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]].<ref name="Credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Rihanna-A-Girl-Like-Me/release/1098380 |title=Rihanna  – A Girl Like Me |publisher=discogs |accessdate=2011-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930035448/http://www.discogs.com/Rihanna-A-Girl-Like-Me/release/1098380 |archivedate=2012-09-30 }}</ref> Rihanna explained the reasoning behind "We Ride" being chosen as the third single from the album in an interview with Corey Moss of [[MTV]]. The singer stated that instead of asking her record label and management which song should be released after "[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]", Rihanna looked on [[iTunes]] to see which was her most downloaded song after the album's lead single "[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]" and "Unfaithful" and stated that "We Ride" was the third most popular, saying "Out of all my songs available for sale on iTunes, [We Ride was] the third most downloaded, behind 'SOS' and 'Unfaithful,'&nbsp;...

So 'We Ride' is just one of those songs.<ref name="MTVInterview1"/>}}

==Critical reception==
"We Ride" received positive reviews from music critics. David Jeffries of [[Allmusic]] praised "We Ride", writing that the song is "an easy-flowing weekend cruiser".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-girl-like-me-r828728/review|title=Rihanna – A Girl Like Me|publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[All Media Guide]] ([[Rovi Corporation|Rovi]])|accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> Spence D. of [[IGN]] similarly noted that "We Ride" is a song to which someone can listen to whilst driving, writing that it is a "ubiquitous cruising track that reworks the cliché catch phrase of the new millennium: 'we ride till the day that we die.{{' "}}<ref name="IGN"/> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] noted that "We Ride" would appeal most to urban audiences due to its hip-hop composition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/rihannagirllike.htm|title=Rihanna – A Girl Like Me|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> However, Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] was critical of "We Ride", writing that although the song is a "hip hop-influenced club banger", it appeared to be too mature for the singer and her "minor vocal talents".<ref name="Slant"/>

===Synopsis===
[[File:Rihanna We Ride.png|200|thumb|right|In the video, Rihanna incorporates professionally choreographed dance routines in front of a white backdrop.<ref name="VideoInfo"/>]]
The video begins with Rihanna walking towards a white [[Jeep Wrangler]], but stops due to her [[mobile phone]] ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him that she needs to do some things before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, different scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a [[close-up]] shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a [[lace]] dress.

For the second chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in restaurant and walk down the street. During the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns her head to the side and looks into the distance, as the camera [[Panning (camera)|pans]] away.
