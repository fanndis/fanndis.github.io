'''Diana Ross''' (born March 26, 1944) is an American singer and actress. Born and raised in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], she rose to fame as the lead singer of the vocal group [[The Supremes]], who became [[Motown#Major divisions|Motown]]'s most successful act during the 1960s and one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. They remain the best-charting female group in US history,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/pop-shop/girl-group-week/5901266/top-10-girl-groups-of-all-time |title=Top 10 Girl Groups of All Time: page 1 |website=Billboard.com|date=July 11, 2017 }}</ref> with a total of twelve number-one hit singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including "[[Where Did Our Love Go]]", "[[Baby Love]]", "[[Come See About Me]]", and "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070107/top-40-girl-group-songs-of-all-time?page=0%2C1|title=Top 40 Girl Group Songs Of All Time|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|first=Jason|last=Lipshutz|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223053621/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070107/top-40-girl-group-songs-of-all-time?page=0,1|archive-date=February 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  

Following departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross embarked on a highly successful, globally ground-breaking solo career in music, television, film and stage.  Ross' [[Diana Ross (1970 album)|eponymous debut solo album]] that same year, featured the US number-one hit "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]" and music anthem "Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)".  It was followed with her second solo album, ''[[Everything Is Everything (Diana Ross album)|Everything Is Everything]]'', which spawned her first UK number-one single "[[I'm Still Waiting (Diana Ross song)|I'm Still Waiting]]". She continued her successful solo career by mounting elaborate record-setting world-wide concert tours, starring in a number of highly-watched prime-time television specials and releasing hit albums like ''[[Touch Me in the Morning (album)|Touch Me in the Morning]]'' (1973), ''[[Mahogany (soundtrack)|Mahogany]]'' (1975) and ''[[Diana Ross (1976 album)|Diana Ross]]'' (1976) and their number-one hit singles, "[[Touch Me in the Morning]]", "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)|Theme from Mahogany]]" and "[[Love Hangover]]", respectively. Ross further released numerous top-ten hits into the 1970s, 80s and 90s. She achieved two more US number-one singles, [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|"Upside Down]]" (1980) and "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" (1981), as well as UK number-one hit "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" (1986) and UK number-two hit "When You Tell Me You Love Me" (1991).  In 2019, Ross made history by charting four more number-ones on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance Chart in just two years with remixes  'Ain't No Mountain High Enough 2017' in January 2018, 'I'm Coming Out/Upside Down 2018' in August that year and 'The Boss 2019' in April 2019.

Ross has also ventured into acting, with a [[Golden Globe Award]]-winning and [[Academy Award]]-nominated performance in the film ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972); she recorded its soundtrack, which became a number one hit on the US album chart. She also starred in two other feature films, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), later acting in the television films ''[[Out of Darkness]]'' (1994), for which she also was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and ''[[Double Platinum (film)|Double Platinum]]'' (1999).

Ross was named the "Female Entertainer of the Century" by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in 1976. She is the only female artist to have number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 as a solo artist, as the other half of a duet, as a member of a trio, and as an ensemble member. ''Billboard'' ranked her as 28th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-hot-100-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists|work=Billboard}}</ref> According to [[Joel Whitburn]], Diana Ross ranks among the Top 5 artists on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart from 1955 to 2018 when combining her solo and Supremes' hits.<ref name="Top Pop Singles">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2018|isbn=0-89820-233-7|publisher=Record Research}}</ref> She had a top 10 UK hit in every one of the last five decades, and sang lead on a top 75 hit single at least once every year from 1964 to 1996 in the UK, a period of 33 consecutive years and a record for any performer. In 1988, Ross was inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Supremes. In 1990s, ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' recognized her success in the United States and United Kingdom for having more hits than any female artist in the charts, with a career total of 70 hit singles with her work with the Supremes and as a solo artist. She was the recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2007, the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2012, and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2016.

==Early life==
[[File:Frederick Douglass HomestowerDetroit.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The building that was part of the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects]] in Detroit, where Diana spent her teenage years]]
Diana Ross was born in Detroit, Michigan on March 26, 1944.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicbyday.com/diana-ross-was-born-on-march-26-1944/425/ |title=Diana Ross Was Born on March 26, 1944 &#124; Music Trivia |website=Musicbyday.com |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>Whitburn, Joel, ''The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits'', p. 207.</ref> She was the second-eldest child of Ernestine (née Moten; January 27, 1916{{spaced ndash}}October 9, 1984) and Fred Ross, Sr. (July 4, 1920{{spaced ndash}}November 21, 2007). Ross's elder sister is American physician [[Barbara Ross-Lee]].

According to Ross, her mother actually named her "Diane", but, a clerical error resulted in her name being recorded as "Diana" on her birth certificate. She was listed as "Diane" during the first Supremes records, and she introduced herself as "Diane" until early in the group's heyday. Her friends and family still call her "Diane".<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Mary |title=Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme |year=1986 |publisher=Cooper Square Press |isbn=0-8154-1000-X |pages=169–70}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=George |first=Nelson |title=Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross's grandfather John E. Ross, a native of [[Gloucester County, Virginia]], was born to Washington Ross and Virginia Baytop. Virginia Baytop's mother Francis "Frankey" Baytop was a former slave who had become a midwife after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Ross and her family originally lived on Belmont Road in the [[North End, Detroit|North End]] section of Detroit, near [[Highland Park, Michigan]], where her neighbor was [[Smokey Robinson]]. When Ross was seven, her mother contracted tuberculosis, causing her to become seriously ill. Ross's father moved with his children to live with relatives in [[Bessemer, Alabama]]. After her mother recovered, her family moved back to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web<!--|url=http://www.musicbyday.com/diana-ross-was-born-on-march-26-1944/425/--> |title=Diana Ross Was Born on March 26, 1944 &#124; Music Trivia web |url=http://blackhistory.com/content/65381/diana-ross|website=blackhistory.com|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref>

On her 14th birthday in 1958, her family relocated to the working-class [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects]] settling at St. Antoine Street. Attending [[Cass Technical High School]],<ref>{{cite web|title=1962 Cass Technical Yearbook|url=http://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Cass-Technical-High-School/398?page=38|website=classmates.com|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> a four-year college and preparatory [[magnet school]], in [[downtown Detroit]], Ross began taking classes including clothing design, millinery, pattern making, and tailoring, as she had aspired to become a fashion designer. She also took modeling and cosmetology classes at the school and participated in three or four other extracurricular activities while being there.

Ross also worked at Hudson's Department Store where it has been claimed in biographies, she was the first black employee "allowed outside the kitchen".{{sfn|Taraborelli|2008|p=64}} For extra income, she provided hairdressing services for her neighbors. Ross graduated from Cass Tech in January 1962.

==Career==
===The Supremes: 1959–1970===
{{Main|The Supremes}}
[[File:1966 The Supremes.JPG|thumb|right|Ross (far right) performing with [[the Supremes]] as lead singer]]

At fifteen, Ross joined the Primettes, a sister group of a male vocal group called the Primes, after being brought to the attention of music manager Milton Jenkins by Primes member [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. Along with Ross, the other members included [[Florence Ballard]], the first group member hired by Jenkins, [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and [[Betty McGlown]]. Following a talent competition win in [[Windsor, Ontario]], in 1960, the Primettes were invited to audition for Motown Records.

Later, following local success via live performances at sock hops, etc., Ross approached former neighbor (and rumored childhood former boyfriend), William "Smokey" Robinson, who insisted that the group audition for him first. Robinson agreed to bring the Primettes to Motown, in exchange for letting him and the Miracles hire the Primettes' guitarist, [[Marv Tarplin]], for an upcoming tour. Tarplin played in Robinson's band(s) for the next 30-plus years.

In her autobiography, ''Secrets of a Sparrow'', Ross wrote that she felt that deal was "a fair trade". The Primettes later auditioned for [[Motown Records]], before various Motown executives. In [[Berry Gordy]]'s autobiography, ''To Be Loved'', Gordy recalled he was heading to a business meeting when he heard Ross singing "There Goes My Baby" and Ross's voice "stopped me in my tracks". He approached the group and asked them to perform it again but, learning of their ages, Gordy advised them to come back after graduating from high school.<ref name="pc26">{{Pop Chronicles |26 |4}}</ref>

Undeterred, the group went to Motown's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] headquarters regularly, offering to provide extra help for Motown's recordings, often including hand claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks for [[Lu Pine Records]], with Ross singing lead on one of the tracks. During the group's early years, Ross served as hairstylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown with [[Barbara Martin (singer)|Barbara Martin]], the Primettes were allowed to record their own songs at Hitsville's studio, many written by "Smokey" Robinson, who, by then, was vice president of Motown ("Your Heart Belongs to Me" and "A Breathtaking Guy"). Gordy, too, composed songs for the trio, including "Buttered Popcorn" (featuring Ballard on lead) and "Let Me Go the Right Way". While these songs were regional hits, they were not nationwide successes.

In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Eventually, [[Janie Bradford]] approached Florence Ballard, the only group member at the studio at the time, to pick out a new name for the group. Ballard chose "Supremes", reportedly, because it was the only name on the list that did not end with "ette". Upon hearing the new name, the other members weren't impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group (a male vocal group was, indeed, named the Supremes). Gordy signed the group under their name on January 15, 1961.

A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with "[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]", peaking at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 pop chart. At the end of the year, Gordy assigned Ross as the group's lead singer, even though Ballard was usually the lead vocalist.

[[File:The Supremes 1967.JPG|thumb|left|Ross with the Supremes in 1967]]

The group scored their first number-one hit with "[[Where Did Our Love Go]]", paving the way for unprecedented success: between August 1964 and May 1967, Ross, Wilson, and Ballard sang on ten [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one hit singles]], all of which also made the UK top 40.<ref name="pc26" /> The group had also become a hit with audiences both domestically and abroad, going on to become Motown's most successful vocal act throughout the sixties. Following significant issues with her comportment, weight, and alcoholism, Florence Ballard was fired from the Supremes by Gordy in July 1967, hiring [[Cindy Birdsong]] from [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Blue-Bells]] as Ballard's replacement.

Gordy renamed the group ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'', making it easier to charge a larger performance fee for a solo star and a backing group, as it did for other renamed Motown groups. Gordy initially considered Ross leaving the Supremes for a solo career in 1966 but changed his mind because the group's success was still too significant for Ross to pursue solo obligations. Ross remained with the Supremes until early 1970.

{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=As the lead voice of the Supremes, she was really only the soul—or perhaps ''[[élan vital]]''—of a machine, ready to plug into whatever arrangement, lyric, or show dress Berry Gordy and the Motown organization provided. She sang of the pain of love without appearing to suffer, but that doesn't mean that the catch-phrases—'[[You Keep Me Hangin' On|You keep me hanging on]],' '[[Where Did Our Love Go|Where did our love go?]]' '[[Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart|Love is like an itching in my heart, and I can't scratch it]]'—were softened or somehow corrupted. Instead, they were transcended with the vivacity that is Diana Ross' great gift.

The group appeared as a trio of singing nuns in a 1968 episode of the popular [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]''. Between their early 1968 single "[[Forever Came Today]]" and their final single with Ross, "[[Someday We'll Be Together]]", Ross would be the only Supremes member to be featured on many of their recordings, often accompanied by [[session singer]]s [[the Andantes]] or, as in the case of "Someday, We'll Be Together", Julia and Maxine Waters and Johnny Bristol.<ref>Benjaminson, Peter. ''The Lost Supreme: The Life of Dreamgirl Florence Ballard''. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, November 2007. 75–79. {{ISBN|1-55652-705-5}}</ref> Still, Wilson and Birdsong continued to sing on recordings.

Gordy, drove Ross diligently throughout this period and Ross, due to anxiety arising from Gordy's demands of her, began suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]], according to her autobiography, ''Secrets of a Sparrow''. During a 1967 performance in Boston, Massachusetts, Ross collapsed onstage and had to be hospitalized for exhaustion.

In 1968, Ross began to perform as a solo artist on television specials, including the Supremes' own specials such as ''[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]'' and ''[[G.I.T. on Broadway]]'', ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'', and a [[Bob Hope]] special, among others. In mid-1969, Gordy decided that Ross would depart the group by the end of that year, and Ross began recording her initial solo work that July. One of the first plans for Ross to establish her own solo career was to publicly introduce a new Motown recording act.

Though she herself did not claim their discovery, Motown's publicity department credited Ross with having discovered [[the Jackson 5]]. Ross would introduce the group during several public events, including ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''.<ref name="Jackson5">{{cite book|last=George|first=Nelson|title=Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross' presumed first solo recording, "Someday We'll Be Together", was eventually released as a Supremes recording and became the group's final number-one hit on the Hot 100. It was also the final number-one ''Billboard'' Hot 100 single of the 1960s. Ross made her final appearance with the Supremes at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Frontier Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on January 14, 1970.

===Solo career, ''Touch Me in the Morning'', Duets album, ''Lady Sings the Blues'' soundtrack and ''diana'': 1970–1981===
In May 1970, Ross released her eponymous [[Diana Ross (1970 album)|solo debut]], which included her [[signature song]]s, "[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)]]" and "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]", the latter becoming Ross' first [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one solo single]]. Follow-up albums, ''[[Everything Is Everything (Diana Ross album)|Everything Is Everything]]'' and ''[[Surrender (Diana Ross album)|Surrender]]'' came out shortly afterwards. In 1971, the ballad "[[I'm Still Waiting (Diana Ross song)|I'm Still Waiting]]" became her first number-one single in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]]. Later in 1971, Ross starred in her first solo [[television special]], ''Diana!'', which included [[the Jackson 5]].

In 1972, the [[Lady Sings the Blues (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to her film debut, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling two million units. In 1973, Ross had her second number-one hit with the ballad "[[Touch Me in the Morning]]". Later in the year, Motown issued ''[[Diana & Marvin]]'', a duet album with fellow Motown artist [[Marvin Gaye]]. The album became an international hit. Touring throughout 1973, Ross became the first entertainer in Japan's history to receive an invitation to the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] for a private audience with the [[Empress Kōjun|Empress Nagako]], wife of Emperor [[Hirohito]].{{sfn|''Jet''|1973|p = 60}}

In April 1974, Ross became the first African-American woman to co-host the 46th Academy Awards, with [[John Huston]], [[Burt Reynolds]], and [[David Niven]].

After the release of a modestly successful LP, ''[[Last Time I Saw Him]]'', Ross had a third number-one hit with "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]", from her second feature film, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]''. A year later, in 1976, Ross released her fourth solo number-one hit, "[[Love Hangover]]", a sensual, dramatic mid-tempo song that bursts into an uptempo disco tune. Later that year, Ross launched her "An Evening with Diana Ross" tour. The tour's success led to a two-week stint at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]'s [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] and a 90-minute, [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated television special of the same name, featuring special make-up effects by Stan Winston, for a scene in which Ross portrayed legendary cabaret artist [[Josephine Baker]] and blues singers [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Ethel Waters]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtpJnC2Yblg|title=An Evening With Diana Ross (1977 - TV Special) [Full Show]|last=Diana Ross Fan Club|date=July 24, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> and a [[Special Tony Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvamSHzyJQE|title=Diana Ross - Receiving Special Tony Award - 31th Annual Tony Awards 1977|last=Nandy Ross|date=June 20, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The albums ''[[Baby It's Me]]'' and ''[[Ross (1978 album)|Ross]]'' sold modestly. In 1979, Ross released ''[[The Boss (Diana Ross album)|The Boss]]'', continuing her popularity with dance audiences, as [[The Boss (Diana Ross song)|the title song]] became a number-one dance single. On July 16, 1979, Ross guest-hosted an episode of Johnny Carson's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', featuring [[Lynda Carter]], [[George Carlin]], and [[Muhammad Ali]] as guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_bRxK7mNM|title=Diana Ross guest host of the Tonight Show - July 16, 1979 (Full Episode)|last=Diana Ross Fan Club|date=August 14, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Later that year, Ross hosted the [[HBO]] special, ''Standing Room Only'', filmed at Caesar's Palace's Circus Maximus Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada, during her "Tour '79" concert tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XICDjK_I5_k|title=Diana Ross - "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" - Caesar's Palace, 1979 Opening (Part 1 of 17)|last=TheReturnOfStephan1|date=June 13, 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> This concert special is noted for its opening, during which Ross literally makes her entrance through a movie screen.

In 1980, Ross released her most successful album to date, ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]''. Composed by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]], the album included the hits "[[I'm Coming Out]]" and "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]", the latter becoming her fifth chart-topping single. Prior to leaving Motown, Ross recorded the duet ballad "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]", with [[Lionel Richie]]. The song would become her sixth and final single to reach number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Ross began negotiations to leave Motown at the end of 1980. After over 20 years with the label, Ross received US$250,000 as severance. [[RCA Records]] offered Ross a $20&nbsp;million, seven-year recording contract, which gave her complete production control of her albums. Allegedly, before signing onto the label, Ross asked Berry Gordy if he could match RCA's offer. Gordy stated that doing so was "impossible". Ross then signed with RCA on May 20, 1981. At the time, Ross's was music history's most expensive recording deal.

===Film career: 1972–1999===
{{Main|Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Mahogany (film)|The Wiz (film)|Out of Darkness|Double Platinum (film)}}
In 1971, Diana Ross began working on her first film, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', which was a loosely based biography on singer [[Billie Holiday]]. Despite some criticism of her for taking the role, once the film opened in October 1972, Ross won critical acclaim for her performance in the film. Jazz critic Leonard Feather, a friend of Holiday's, praised Ross for "expertly capturing the essence of Lady Day". Ross's role in the film won her [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actress. The [[Lady Sings the Blues (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Lady Sings the Blues'' became just as successful, reaching No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] staying there for two weeks.

Ross's second film, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]'', was released in 1975. The film reunited her with [[Billy Dee Williams]], her co-star in ''Lady Sings the Blues'' and featured costumes designed by Ross herself. The story of an aspiring fashion designer who becomes a runway model and the toast of the industry, ''Mahogany'' was a troubled production from its inception. The film's original director, [[Tony Richardson]], was fired during production, and Berry Gordy assumed the director's chair himself.

In addition, Gordy and Ross clashed during filming, with Ross leaving the production before shooting was completed, forcing Gordy to use secretary Edna Anderson as a body double for Ross. While a box-office success, the film was not well received by the critics: ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's review of the film chastised Gordy for "squandering one of America's most natural resources: Diana Ross."<ref>Posner, Gerald. ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power'', p. 286.</ref>

In 1977, Motown acquired the film rights to the Broadway play ''[[The Wiz]]'', an African-American reinterpretation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The film initially was to include the stage actors who had performed on the play, but, producer [[Rob Cohen]] could not garner the interest of any major Hollywood film studios. It was not until Ross convinced Cohen to cast her (instead of [[Stephanie Mills]], who portrayed Dorothy on Broadway) as Dorothy that [[Universal Pictures]] agreed to finance the production. This casting decision led to a change in the film's script, in which Dorothy went from a schoolgirl to a schoolteacher. The role of the Scarecrow, also performed by someone else onstage, was eventually given to Ross's former Motown labelmate, [[Michael Jackson]].

The [[The Wiz (film)|film adaptation of ''The Wiz'']] had been a $24&nbsp;million production, but upon its October 1978 release, it earned only $21,049,053 at the box office.<ref name="sharp">{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Kathleen |title=Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood: Edie and Lew Wasserman and Their Entertainment Empire |publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mrmrshollywooded00shar/page/357 357–58] |isbn=0-7867-1220-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/mrmrshollywooded00shar/page/357}}</ref><ref name="harpole" /><ref name="dreamgirl">{{cite book |last=Adrahtas |first=Thomas |title=A Lifetime to Get Here: Diana Ross: The American Dreamgirl |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2006 |pages=163–67 |isbn=1-4259-7140-7}}</ref> Though pre-release television broadcast rights had been sold to [[CBS]] for over $10&nbsp;million, the film produced a net loss of $10.4&nbsp;million for Motown and Universal.<ref name="harpole">{{cite book |last=Harpole |first=Charles |title=History of the American Cinema |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica0000unse_x8l5/page/64 64, 65, 219, 220, 290] | isbn=0-684-80463-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica0000unse_x8l5/page/64}}</ref><ref name="dreamgirl" /> At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made.<ref name="skow">{{cite news |last=Skow |first=John |title=Nowhere Over the Rainbow |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |date=October 30, 1978 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912236,00.html |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref> The film's failure ended Ross's short career on the big screen and contributed to the Hollywood studios' reluctance to produce the all-black film projects which had become popular during the [[blaxploitation]] era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moon |first=Spencer |author2=George Hill |title=Reel Black Talk: A Sourcebook of 50 American Filmmakers |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-313-29830-0 |no-pp=true |page=xii |url=https://archive.org/details/reelblacktalksou00moon}}</ref><ref name="benshoff">{{cite book |last=Benshoff |first=Harry M. |author2=Sean Griffin |title=America on Film: Representing Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality at the Movies |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=0-631-22583-8 |page=88}}</ref><ref name="George">{{cite book |last=George |first=Nelson |title=Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross had success with movie-themed songs. The soundtrack for ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (soundtrack)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' peaked at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Pop chart, selling over 300,000 copies in its first eight days of release. While her version of Holiday's "[[Good Morning Heartache]]" only performed modestly well in early 1973, her recording of "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]" gave Ross her third number-one hit, in late 1975.

Three years later, Ross and Michael Jackson had a modest dance hit with their recording of "[[Ease on Down the Road]]". Their second duet, actually as part of the ensemble of ''The Wiz'', "Brand New Day", found some success overseas. Ross scored a Top 10 hit in late 1980 with the theme song to the 1980 film ''[[It's My Turn (film)|It's My Turn]]''. The following year, she collaborated with former [[Commodores]] singer-songwriter [[Lionel Richie]] on the theme song for the film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]''. The [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Endless Love (song)|title single]] became her final hit on Motown Records and the number-two record of the year.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Several years later, in 1988, Ross recorded the theme song to ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]''. "[[If We Hold on Together]]" became an international hit, reaching number one in Japan.

In 1993, Ross returned to acting with a dramatic role in the television film, ''[[Out of Darkness]]''. Ross won acclaim for her role in the TV movie and earned her third [[Golden Globe]] nomination, although she did not win. In 1999, she and [[Brandy Norwood]] co-starred in the television movie, ''[[Double Platinum (film)|Double Platinum]]'', which was aired prior to the release of Ross's album, ''[[Every Day Is a New Day]]''.

In October 1981, Ross released her first RCA album, ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (album)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]''. The album sold over a million copies and featured hit singles such as her remake of the [[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (song)|classic hit of the same name]] and "[[Mirror Mirror (Diana Ross song)|Mirror Mirror]]". Shortly thereafter, Ross established her production company, named Anaid Productions ("Diana" spelled backwards), and also began investing in real estate and touring extensively in the United States and abroad.

Before the release of ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'', Ross hosted her first TV special in four years, ''Diana''. Directed by [[Steve Binder]], the concert portions of the special were filmed at [[Inglewood, California]]'s 17,500-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] indoor stadium and featured performances by [[Michael Jackson]], [[Muhammad Ali]], '' [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' actor [[Larry Hagman]], music impresario [[Quincy Jones]] and members of The [[Joffrey Ballet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/arts/tv-an-hour-of-diana-ross.html|title=TV: AN HOUR OF DIANA ROSS|date=March 2, 1981|website=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMFw-sMH0h4|title=Diana Ross - diana TV Special 1981 (Full Show)|last=Nandy Ross|date=November 4, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In early 1982, Ross sang the "[[Star-Spangled Banner]]" at [[Super Bowl XVI]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAki6VTx1Y|title=The Star Spangled Banner|last=Scott Pangburn|date=December 23, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> and appeared on the dance show ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEyKsTXWSSY|title=Diana Ross Full Episode Soul Train 1982 Interview with Don Cornelius|last=fred fishers|date=April 23, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> The program devoted a full episode to her and Ross performed several songs from the ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' album.

On May 6, 1982, Ross was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hwof.com/star/recording/diana-ross/462|title=Diana Ross :: The Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Hwof.com}}</ref> She followed up the success of ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' with ''[[Silk Electric]]'', which featured the Michael Jackson-written and -produced "[[Muscles (song)|Muscles]]", resulting in another top-ten success for Ross. The album eventually went gold on the strength of that song. In 1983, Ross ventured further out of her earlier soul-based sound for a more [[pop rock]]-oriented sound following the release of the ''[[Ross (1983 album)|Ross]]'' album. Though the album featured the top 40 hit single, "[[Pieces of Ice]]", the ''Ross'' album did not generate any more hits or achieve gold status.

On July 21, 1983, Ross performed a free concert on [[Central Park]]'s Great Lawn, aired live worldwide by [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Proceeds of the concert would be donated to build a playground in the singer's name. Midway through the beginning of the show, a torrential downpour began. Ross tried to continue performing, but, the severe weather required that the show be stopped after 45 minutes. Ross urged the large crowd to exit the venue safely, promising to perform the next day.

The second concert held the very next day was without rain. The funds for the playground were to be derived from sales of various memorabilia. However, they were destroyed by the storm. When the mainstream media discovered the exorbitant costs of the two concerts, Ross faced criticism from New York City's then-mayor [[Ed Koch]] and the city's Parks Department commissioner and poor publicity. During a subsequent mayoral press conference, Ross handed Koch a check for US$250,000 for the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbEDAAAAMBAJ&q=diana+ross+ed+koch+250%2C000&pg=PA46|title=Jet|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=February 6, 1984|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> The [[Diana Ross Playground]] was built three years later.<ref>Anderson, Susan Heller and Deirdre Carmody (September 12, 1986).

In 1984, Ross released ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]]''. The album featured ''[[All of You (Julio Iglesias and Diana Ross song)|All of You]]'', a duet with friend [[Julio Iglesias]]. The single was featured on both Ross' album and Iglesias' ''[[1100 Bel Air Place]]'', his first English-language album. It became an international hit, as did the [[Lionel Richie]]-penned ballad "[[Missing You (Diana Ross song)|Missing You]]", composed as a tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]], who [[Death of Marvin Gaye|had died earlier that year]]. [[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]] garnered gold record sales status.

Her 1985 album, ''[[Eaten Alive (album)|Eaten Alive]]'', found major success overseas. "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" reached number one on the UK charts as well as in Australia and Ireland and [[Eaten Alive (song)|the title track]] also performed well. Both songs had strong music videos that propelled the tracks to success. The [[Eaten Alive]] video was patterned after the 1960s horror film, ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'' while the "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" music video saluted the 1960s [[American Bandstand]]-style music shows. "Experience", the third international single's video reignited the "Eaten Alive" romantic storyline with Diana and actor [[Joseph Gian]]. The track, "[[Eaten Alive (song)|Eaten Alive]]," a collaboration with Barry Gibb and Michael Jackson, became a top 20 hit internationally.

The [[Barry Gibb]]-produced album garnered an international number one in "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" and a Top 20 selling album. It is believed Michael Finbarr Murphy, a distant cousin of Alan Murphy, guitarist for singer Kate Bush, Level 42 and others, played the guitar parts on "Chain Reaction". Michael was the producer for ''Unknown Quantity'', the backing vocalists featured on the "Chain Reaction" track, are also featured as Ross' backing singers in the track's video. There were four members of Unknown Quantity, however, only 3 were needed for the video.

Earlier in 1985, Ross appeared as part of [[USA for Africa]]'s '"[[We Are the World]]"' charity single, which sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Ross's 1987 follow-up to ''Eaten Alive'', ''[[Red Hot Rhythm & Blues]]'' (No. 39 ''Billboard'' Top R&B Albums chart; No. 12 Sweden), found less success than the prior album. The accompanying acclaimed television special was nominated for three Emmy Awards, winning two (Outstanding Costume Design for a Variety or Music Program - Ray Aghayan and Ret Turner; Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Miniseries or a Special - Greg Brunton).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361510/awards|title=Diana Ross: Red Hot Rhythm and Blues|website=IMDb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9byLni-1xY|title=Diana Ross "Red Hot Rhythm & Blues" – 1.7|last=dianarossbroadcast|date=September 5, 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

On January 27, 1986, Ross hosted the 13th annual American Music Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VyWBCh1H7g|title=Diana Ross - Eaten Alive (Live) 13th Annual AMA's 1986|last=Nandy Ross|date=July 11, 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ross returned the next year to host the 14th annual telecast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjwf7gaGvo|title=Diana Ross Touch By Touch at 14th Annual AMA's 1987|last=Nandy Ross|date=May 10, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In 1988, Ross chose to not renew her RCA contract and had been in talks with her former mentor Berry Gordy to return to Motown. When she learned of Gordy's plans to sell Motown, Ross tried advising him against the decision though he sold it to MCA Records in 1988. Following the sale of the company, Ross was asked to return to the Motown label with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part-owner. Ross accepted the offer.

Ross' next album, 1989's ''[[Workin' Overtime]]'' was not a commercial success, despite the title track reaching the top three of the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/diana-ross/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/368022|title=Diana Ross Workin' Overtime Chart History|work=Billboard}}</ref> The album peaked at number 34 on the ''Billboard'' Hot R&B Albums chart, and achieved top 25 placings in Japan and the UK, attaining a silver certification in the latter country. Subsequent releases, such as ''[[The Force Behind the Power]]'' (1991), ''[[Take Me Higher]]'' (1995), and ''[[Every Day Is a New Day]]'' (1999) produced similar results. Ross's albums achieved more international than domestic success.

In 1991, Ross became one of the few American artists to have headlined the annual [[Royal Variety Performance]], performing a selection of her UK hits before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]], London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_xZwzXEz2o|title=Diana Ross Live at The Royal Variety Performance [1991] (Full Concert)|last=Diana Ross Fan Club|date=May 25, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

"[[The Force Behind the Power]]" sparked an international comeback of sorts when the album went [[double platinum]] in the UK.<ref>BPI 1991-UK, ''[[Music Week]]''.</ref> led by the No. 2 UK hit single "[[When You Tell Me That You Love Me]]". The single's duet version with Irish group, [[Westlife]], also hit No. 2 in the UK in 2005. The album performed well across Europe and into Japan as "[[The Force Behind the Power]]" achieved Gold record status in the nation. The album produced an astounding 9 singles across international territories, including another Top 10 hit, "One Shining Moment".

In 1994, ''[[One Woman: The Ultimate Collection]]'', a career retrospective compilation, became a number one hit in the UK, selling quadruple platinum, and selling well across Europe and in the English-speaking world. The retrospective was EMI's alternative to Motown's box set ''[[Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs]]''.

Ross performed during the Opening Ceremony of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] held in Chicago, where she infamously missed a penalty kick that was part of her act, and during the pre-match entertainment of the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bloomfield|first=Craig|title=Grace Jones and FIFA, Diana Ross at USA 94 and six of the best unlikely entertainers at sport|url=http://talksport.com/magazine/features/2011-06-02/grace-jones-and-fifa-diana-ross-usa-94-and-six-best-unlikely-entertainers-sport|work=talksport.com|publisher=talkSPORT|accessdate=January 4, 2014|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Supremes reunions, Return to Love and 2002 solo tour===
{{Main|Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever|Return to Love Tour}}

Ross reunited with [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] first in 1976 to attend the funeral service of [[Florence Ballard]], who had died in February of that year. In March 1983, Ross agreed to reunite with Wilson and [[Cindy Birdsong]] for the television special "[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]". The Supremes did not rehearse their performance for that evening, due to time constraints. A scheduled medley of hits was cancelled.

Instead of following producer Suzanne dePasse's instructions to recreate their choreography from their final Ed Sullivan Show appearance, Wilson (according to her autobiography) planned with Birdsong to take a step forward every time Ross did the same, then began to sing lead on the group's final number-one hit song, "[[Someday We'll Be Together]]", on which Wilson did not perform.

Later, Wilson introduced Berry Gordy from the stage (unaware that the program's script called for Ross to introduce Gordy), at which point Ross subtly pushed down Wilson's hand-held microphone, stating, "It's been taken care of." Ross then re-introduced Gordy.<ref>Wilson, Mary, ''Dreamgirl, My Life as a Supreme''; Taraborrelli, Randy, ''Call Her Miss Ross: The Unauthorized Biography of Diana Ross''; George, Nelson ''Where Did Our Love Go?, The Rise & Fall of Motown''.</ref><ref>Posner, Gerald.

In 1999, Ross and mega-tour promoter SFX (which later became [[LiveNation]]) began negotiations regarding a Diana Ross tour which would include a Supremes segment. During negotiations with Ross, the promoters considered the creation of a Supremes tour, instead. Ross agreed. As the tour's co-producer, Ross invited all living former Supremes to participate. Neither [[Jean Terrell]] nor late 1970s member [[Susaye Greene]] chose to participate. 70s Supremes [[Lynda Laurence]] and [[Scherrie Payne]] were then touring as [[Former Ladies of the Supremes]].

Ross contacted Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who then began negotiations with SFX. Negotiations with Wilson and Birdsong (who allowed Wilson to negotiate on her behalf) failed when Wilson refused SFX's and Ross' offer of $4 Million for 30 performances. Following the passage of SFX's final deadline for Wilson to accept their offer. Payne and Laurence, already negotiating with SFX, signed on to perform with Ross on the tour.

Laurence and Payne would later say that they got along well with Ross. The newly formed group performed together on ''The Today Show'' and ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', as well as VH1's ''Divas 2000: A tribute To Diana Ross''. The Return to Love tour launched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia. The tour's final performance was at [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]]. The tour was cancelled by SFX shortly thereafter, due to mediocre ticket sales, despite glowing reviews from media as varied as ''Billboard'' magazine, ''The Detroit Free Press'', the ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''The Village Voice'' newspapers.

On December 5, 2000, Ross received a Heroes Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS). The Heroes Award is the highest distinction bestowed by the New York Chapter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/News_Photos/view/upi/a9acdea950eeba2c67346626bb3dcd94/DIANA-ROSS-AND-BB-KING-RECEIVE-HEROES-AWARDS/|title=DIANA ROSS AND B.B. KING RECEIVE HEROES AWARDS|website=UPI}}</ref>

Diana Ross' first public post-RTL appearance was at a fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. In January 2001, "Love & Life: The Very Best of Diana Ross" was released in the United Kingdom, becoming Ross' 17th gold album in that country. In June, Ross presented [[costume designer]] [[Bob Mackie]] with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the American Fashion Awards.

Two days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ross performed "God Bless America" at the U.S. Open tennis championships before the tournament's women's final, between Venus and Serena Williams. Immediately following the attacks, Ross performed the song again at Shea Stadium, before the Mets first game, after driving cross-country to be with her children(In the wake of the attacks, flying in the U.S. was temporarily restricted.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxA6QkcBfwk|title=Diana Ross performs "God Bless America" at Shea|last=MLB|date=September 11, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ross teamed with legendary singers [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Eartha Kitt]] among others for a Nile Rodgers-produced recording of [[Sister Sledge]]'s classic disco hit, "We Are Family", recorded to benefit the families of 9/11 victims.

In May 2002, Ross and all five of her children appeared on Barbara Walters' Mother's Day television special. Shortly thereafter, Ross admitted herself into the 30-day substance abuse program at the Promises Institute in [[Malibu, California]], after friends and family began to notice a burgeoning alcohol problem. Ross left the program three weeks later and began to fulfill previously scheduled concert dates, beginning with a performance before a 60,000-strong crowd at London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], for Prince Charles' Prince's Trust charity.

U.S. ticket sales for the new tour were brisk, from coast to coast. Venues such as [[Long Island, New York]]'s [[Westbury Music Fair]] and California's [[Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts]] and Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay attempted to add extra shows, due to public demand. Sold-out performances in [[Boston]] and [[Ontario]], Canada, followed. In August, shortly after the tour began, however, Ross re-entered the Promises Institute's substance abuse rehabilitation program. That December, during her stay at Arizona's Canyon Ranch Health Resort, Ross was pulled over by Tucson police for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. She failed a breathalizer test and was arrested for a DUI. Ross was later sentenced to 48 hours in jail, which she served near her home in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].

In January 2003, Ross was honored as Humanitarian of the Year by Nile Rodgers' We Are Family Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Ross was feted as an honored guest at the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters Awards. Later that year, Ross was the guest performer at that year's Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute's annual gala, in an ensemble custom-designed by designer Tom Ford, followed by an appearance as the surprise celebrity model for American couturier Dennis Basso's runway show.

In February, 2003, The Supremes were honored by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation honored The Supremes with its Pioneer Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhythmblues.org/awards.php?year=2003 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302124355/http://www.rhythmblues.org/awards.php?year=2003 |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

''[[Motown: The Musical]]'' is a Broadway musical that launched on April 14, 2013. It is the story of Berry Gordy's creation of Motown Records and his romance with Diana Ross.

As a member of the Supremes, her songs "Stop! In the Name of Love" and "You Can't Hurry Love" are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.<ref>"[http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-qs/ The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll (by artist)]".

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed the group at number 96 on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".<ref>"[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty The Immortals: The First Fifty]".

As lead singer of the Supremes and as a solo artist, Ross has earned 18 number-one singles (12 as lead singer of the Supremes and 6 as a solo artist). Ms. Ross is the only female artist to have number one singles as a solo artist; as the other half of a duet (Lionel Richie); as a member of a trio (the Supremes); and, as an ensemble member (We are the World-USA for Africa). Ross was featured on [[the Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1997 number-one hit "[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]" since her voice from her 1980 hit "[[I'm Coming Out]]" was sampled for the song.

''Billboard'' magazine named Ross the "female entertainer of the century" in 1976. In 1993, she earned a [[Guinness World Record]], due to her success in the United States and United Kingdom for having more hits than any other female artist in the charts with a career total of 70 hit singles. Ross is also one of the few recording artists to have two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one as a solo artist and the other as a member of the Supremes. After her 1983 concert in Central Park, [[Diana Ross Playground]] was named in her honor with a groundbreaking opening ceremony in 1986.

Ross was given credit for the discovery of [[the Jackson 5]]. Her "discovery" was simply part of Motown's marketing and promotions plan for the Jackson 5. Consequently, their debut album was titled ''[[Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5]]''. It was actually Motown producer [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers|Bobby Taylor]] who discovered the Jacksons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diana Ross: A Biography| first=J.

In 2006, Diana was one of 25 African-American women saluted at [[Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball]], a three-day celebration, honoring their contributions to art, entertainment, and civil rights.

Diana Ross was named one of the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Five Mighty Pop Divas of the Sixties]] along with [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Martha Reeves]], and [[Dionne Warwick]].
