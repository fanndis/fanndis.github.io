==Coaching career==
He founded the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in 1996 near Paris (later relocated to the outskirts of [[Nice]]), and has coached many up-and-coming players, including [[Marcos Baghdatis]] (whom he coached to the final of the [[2006 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2006 Australian Open]]), [[Julia Vakulenko]], [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]], [[Aravane Rezaï]], [[Jérémy Chardy]], [[Laura Robson]], [[Yanina Wickmayer]] and [[Grigor Dimitrov]].<ref name="about">[http://www.mouratoglou.com/patrick-mouratoglou?lang=en Patrick Mouratoglou].

Mouratoglou started coaching the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] player [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in 1999 when Mouratoglou invited him to his Tennis Academy in October 1999, on a one-week basis. Baghdatis was, according to Mouratoglou, "not an athlete at all", however within seven years he would become a junior world No. 1, win the [[2003 Australian Open]] boys' title, reach the final of the same tournament in [[2006 Australian Open|2006]] and reach the world's top ten.<ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/DEUCE-Tennis/DEUCE-Australian-Open-2011/Marcos-Baghdatis.aspx Tennis – ATP World Tour – DEUCE Australian Open 2011 – Marcos Baghdatis – Back to Basics].

Tennishead.net (7 March 2012). Retrieved on 12 June 2013.</ref> This association ended in September that year and Mouratoglou moved on to his present job, exclusively coaching [[Serena Williams]].

By the time Mouratoglou started coaching Williams, she had just suffered her first-ever opening round defeat in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, losing in the first round of the [[2012 French Open]]. Since then, Mouratoglou has guided Williams to her fifth, sixth and seventh [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles, the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's singles|Olympic gold medal]], her fourth, fifth, and sixth [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] titles, her second and third [[French Open]] titles, three consecutive [[WTA Tour Championships|year-end championships]] titles, her sixth and seventh [[Australian Open]] title and lifted her back to world No. 1 in the WTA rankings.<ref name="Serena">Balym, Toddy.
