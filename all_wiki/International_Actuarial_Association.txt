The '''International Actuarial Association''' ('''IAA''') is a worldwide association of local professional actuarial associations.

==History==

The IAA is the continuation of the "Comité Permanent des Congrès d’Actuaires", established in 1895, as an association of individuals. It was renamed the IAA in 1968. At the 26th [[International Congress of Actuaries]], held in [[Birmingham]] on 7–12 June 1998, the General Assembly of the International Actuarial Association restructured itself.

The restructure created a single unified framework to ensure unity of direction and efficient coordination with respect to issues of a worldwide nature. The major responsibilities of the IAA are now in the hands of the actuarial associations, which bring together the actuaries in their respective countries and is the link between the actuaries and the actuarial associations worldwide. The IAA is the unique [[international organization]] dedicated to the research, education and development of the profession and of actuarial associations.

==Sections==

The IAA has seven sections, [[Actuarial Studies in Non-life Insurance|ASTIN]], [[Actuarial Approach for Financial Risks|AFIR/ERM]], [[International Association of Consulting Actuaries|IACA]], [[International Actuarial Association Health Section|IAAHS]], [[Pensions, Benefits and Social Security Section|PBSS]], [[Actuaries Without Borders|AWB]] and [[International Actuarial Association Life Section|LIFE]]. The ASTIN Section stands for Actuarial Studies In Non-life insurance and was founded in 1957. ASTIN organises annual colloquia and jointly publishes with the other sections, the ASTIN Bulletin, an internationally renowned referenced scientific journal. The AFIR/ERM Section stands for Actuarial Approach for Financial Risks and was founded in 1988. It has as its objective the promotion of actuarial research in financial risks and enterprise risk management, and its most important function is the organizing of annual colloquia. The IACA Section stands for International Association of Consulting Actuaries and was founded in 1968, independently of the IAA, to facilitate international exchange of views between consulting actuaries. It was admitted as a section of the IAA in 1999. The International Actuarial Association Health Section (IAAHS) was founded in 2003 to provide an international perspective on health actuarial practice, public and private health insurance, and health policy matters. The Pensions, Benefits, Social Security Section (PBSS) was founded in 2003 to serve actuaries around the world who have personal, professional, educational or [[research]] interests in social protection and the commercial, social and public policy issues concerning the provision of pensions and other benefits. The Actuaries Without Borders Section (AWB) was also founded in 2003 to link situations in need of actuarial skills with financial resources and with actuarial volunteers to meet those needs. The LIFE Section has as its objectives to promote and facilitate an international exchange of views, advice, research and practical information among actuaries involved with life insurance issues.

==Governance==

The IAA Council comprises the President whose term of office is one year, the Officers and one delegate per Full Member association and one delegate per Section. The Committees and the Council normally meet twice a year in different countries. 

The Officers for the period January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 are:

Tonya B. Manning, President<br/>
Jan Kars, President-Elect<br/>
Gábor Hanák, Immediate Past President

The Council elects an Executive Committee to coordinate activities and operations, and propose strategies, budgets, membership fees and Council meeting venues. The President chairs the Executive Committee, which comprises the Officers and the chairpersons of the Committees and Sections.

Currently, the IAA has 74 full member associations, 28 associate member associations, five partners organisations, one observer organisations and 5 patrons. All individual actuaries can elect to join any section of the IAA, which currently are ASTIN, AFIR, IACA, IAAHS, PBSS, AWB and LIFE by paying the required contribution.
