The '''Brexit withdrawal agreement''', officially titled '''''Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community''''',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12019W/TXT(02)|title= INFORMATION FROM EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS, BODIES, OFFICES AND AGENCIES|website=eur-lex.europa.eu |format=PDF|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/862063/TS3202_1.PDF |title=Data |publisher=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> is a treaty between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Euratom]], and the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), signed on 24 January 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/sombre-eu-leaders-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement|title='Fantastic moment': Boris Johnson signs Brexit withdrawal deal|first1=Kate|last1=Proctor|first2=Daniel|last2=Boffey|date=24 January 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> setting the terms of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and Euratom.

The earlier version of the withdrawal agreement was rejected by the [[House of Commons]] on three occasions, leading to Queen Elizabeth II accepting the resignation of [[Theresa May]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and appointing [[Boris Johnson]] as the new Prime Minister on 24 July 2019.

The Parliament of the United Kingdom gave its approval to the then draft Agreement by enacting implementing legislation (the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020]]) on 23 January 2020. After the Agreement was signed, the Government of the United Kingdom issued and deposited Britain's instrument of ratification of the Agreement on 29 January 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-parliament-idUSKBN1ZS1EE |title=Tears and cheers as EU lawmakers give final nod to Brexit |date=30 January 2020 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-uk-after-referendum/ |title=Brexit |website=www.consilium.europa.eu}}</ref> The Agreement was ratified by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 30 January 2020, following the consent of the [[European Parliament]] on 29 January 2020. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union took effect on 11&nbsp;p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020, and at that moment the Withdrawal Agreement entered into force, as per its article 185.

The Agreement covers such matters as money, citizens' rights, border arrangements and dispute resolution. It also contains a transition period and an outline of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Published on 14 November 2018, it was a result of the [[Brexit negotiations]]. The agreement was endorsed by the leaders of the 27 remaining EU countries<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/25/670626957/european-union-leaders-approve-brexit-plan |title=European Union Leaders Approve Brexit Plan |last=Kesbeh |first=Dina |date=25 November 2018 |work=National Public Radio|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref> and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]], but faced opposition in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]], whose [[Meaningful vote|approval was necessary]] for ratification. Approval by the European Parliament would also have been required. On 15 January 2019, the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by a vote of 432 to 202.<ref name="Guardian 15-01-19">{{cite web |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Theresa May loses Brexit deal vote by majority of 230 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230 |date=15 January 2019 |website=The Guardian |access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref> The Commons rejected the Agreement again on 12 March 2019, on a vote of 391 to 242,<ref name="Guardian 12-03-19">{{cite web |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=MPs ignore May's pleas and defeat her Brexit deal by 149 votes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/mps-ignore-mays-pleas-and-defeat-her-brexit-deal-by-149-votes |date=13 March 2019 |website=The Guardian |access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref> and rejected a third time of 29 March 2019 by 344 votes to 286. On 22 October 2019 the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson's government cleared the first stage in Parliament, but Johnson paused the legislative process when the accelerated programme for approval failed to achieve the necessary support, and announced his intention to call a general election.<ref name="Reuters22Oct">{{cite web |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/british-parliament-backs-pm-johnsons-brexit-deal-at-important-stage-idUKKBN1X10K0 |title=Brexit in chaos after parliament defeats Johnson's ratification timetable |last1=James |first1=William |last2=MacLellan |first2=Kylie |last3=Piper |first3=Elizabeth |publisher=Reuters |date=22 October 2019 |access-date=17 November 2019 }}</ref> On 23 January 2020, Parliament ratified the agreement by passing the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020|Withdrawal Agreement Act]]; on 29 January 2020, the European Parliament gave its consent to the withdrawal agreement. It was subsequently concluded by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 30 January 2020.

The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until 31 December 2020, during which time the UK remains in the single market, in order to ensure frictionless trade until a long-term relationship is agreed. If no agreement is reached by this date, then the UK will leave the single market without a [[Trade negotiation between the UK and the EU|trade deal]] on 1 January 2021. Closely connected to the withdrawal agreement is a non-binding political declaration on the future EU–UK relationship.

{{main|2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union}}

=== 2015 United Kingdom general election and 2016 Brexit referendum===
In the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s manifesto for the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election in May 2015]], the Party promised an EU referendum by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32302062 |title=At-a-glance: Conservative manifesto |date=15 April 2015 |access-date=22 September 2018 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points |title=Conservatives election manifesto 2015 – the key points |first=Frances |last=Perraudin |date=14 April 2015 |website=the Guardian |access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]], held on 23 June 2016, resulted in a 51.9% to 48.1% majority vote for leaving the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results |title=EU referendum results |date=24 June 2016 |access-date=5 March 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

== Content (2018 version) ==
The withdrawal agreement, which runs to 599 pages, covers the following main areas:<ref>Chris Morris (25 November 2018) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46237012 ''Britain's withdrawal agreement-what it all means'']. Reality Check, [[BBC]]; retrieved 2 April 2019</ref>
* Money, particularly the division of assets and liabilities, and payment of any debt outstanding
*  Citizens rights, both of UK citizens in EU countries and vice versa
* Border arrangements and customs, particularly along the border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland
* The law, and the mechanisms for resolving disputes, currently vested with the [[European Court of Justice]]
The agreement also sets up a transitional period, which lasts until 31 December 2020 and can be extended once by mutual consent. During the transitional period, EU law will continue to apply to the UK (including participation in the [[European Economic Area]], the [[European Single Market|single market]], and the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]), and the UK will continue to pay into the EU budget, but the UK will not be represented in the decision-making bodies of the EU. The transition period will give businesses time to adjust to the new situation and time for the British and EU governments to negotiate a new trade deal between the EU and UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/18/brexit-transition-could-be-extended-to-2022-says-barnier |title=Brexit transition could be extended to 2022, says Barnier |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |date=18 November 2018 |website=the Guardian |language=en|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=BBC News |title=Brexit: The transition period explained – BBC News |date=19 November 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO_Fg6R0i5w|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

On the [[Irish border question]], there is a [[Irish backstop|Northern Ireland Protocol]] (the "Backstop") appended to the agreement which sets a fall-back position that will only come into force should effective alternative arrangements fail to be demonstrated before the end of the transition period. If this happens, the UK will shadow the EU's [[Common external tariff]] and Northern Ireland will keep in aspects of the Single Market, until such a demonstration is achieved. Neither party can unilaterally withdraw from this customs union. The goal of this backstop agreement is to avoid [[Hard border|a "hard" border in Ireland]], where [[customs|customs check]]s are necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/14/brexit-deal-key-points-from-the-draft-withdrawal-agreement |title=Brexit deal: key points from the draft withdrawal agreement |last=Henley |first=Jon |date=14 November 2018 |website=the Guardian |language=en|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

The governance will be through a [[joint committee (diplomatic)|Joint Committee]] with representatives of both the European Union and the British government. There will be a number of specialised committees reporting to the Joint Committee.

The withdrawal agreement also includes [[European Schools#Brexit|provisions]] for the UK to leave the Convention Defining the Statute of the [[European Schools]], with the UK bound by the Convention and the accompanying regulations on Accredited European Schools until the end of the last academic year of the transition period, i.e. the end of the spring semester of 2020–2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europa School: 10 Jan 2019: House of Commons debates |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2019-01-10c.687.0#g687.1 |website=TheyWorkForYou |access-date=21 January 2019 |language=en |date=10 January 2019}}</ref>

The more important elements of the draft agreement are these:<ref name=draft>[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf Text of draft withdrawal agreement]{{snd}} [[European Commission]]</ref>

=== Common provisions ===
The Agreement assists the arrangements of withdrawing the UK from the European Union and [[Euratom]] (Art. 1), provides a clear definition for the territorial scope of the United Kingdom (Art. 3), and assures the legal liability of the Agreement (Art. 4). Additionally, it states that by the end of the transition period, the UK shall be denied access to "any network, any information system and any database established on the basis of Union law" (Art. 8).

=== Citizens' rights: general provisions ===
The Agreement defines and provides the personal scope of citizens, family members, frontier workers, host states, and nationals. Article 11 deals with continuity of residence and Article 12 discusses non-discrimination (i.e., it would be prohibited to discriminate on grounds of nationality).

=== Rights and obligations ===
UK nationals and Union citizens, family members who are UK nationals or Union citizens and family members who are neither of those two shall maintain the right to reside in the host State (Art. 13). The host State may not limit or condition the persons for obtaining, retaining or losing residence rights (Art. 13). Persons with valid documentation{{clarify|reason=What sort of documention? Passport? Residency? |date=September 2019}} would not require entry and exit visas or equal formalities and would be permitted to leave or enter the host state without complications (Art. 14). In case the host State demands "family members who join the Union citizen or United Kingdom national after the end of the transition period to have an entry visa", the host State is required to grant necessary visas through an accelerated process in appropriate facilities free of charge (Art. 14). The Agreement further deals with the issuance of permanent residence permits during and after the transition period, as well as its restrictions. Moreover, it clarifies the rights of workers and self-employed individuals, and provides recognition and identification of professional qualifications.

=== Coordination of social security systems ===
This title discusses special cases, administrative cooperation, legal adaptations and development of Union laws.

=== Goods placed on the market ===
The Agreement defines the goods, services and the processes connected to them. It claims that any good or service that was lawfully placed in the market prior to the withdrawal from the Union may be further made available to the consumers in the UK or the Union States (Art. 40 & 41).

=== Ongoing customs procedures ===
This title addresses the custom procedures of goods moving from the customs territory of the UK to the customs territory of the Union and vice versa (Art. 47). The processes that start before the end of the transition period "shall be treated as an intra-Union movement regarding importation and exportation licensing requirements in Union law". The Agreement also addresses the ending of temporary storage or customs procedures (Art. 49).

=== Ongoing value added tax and excise duty matters ===
The VAT applies to goods that are exchanged between the Union and the UK. By way of derogation from previous Articles, the Title permits access to information systems that are necessary for the application or processing of the VAT (Art. 51).

===Annexes===
There are ten annexes to the draft. The first is a protocol to maintain an [[open border]] between the EU and the UK on the island of [[Ireland]] (generally known as the 'Irish backstop'). The second covers the arrangements for a common customs territory to operate between the EU and the UK, until a technical solution can be found that delivers both an open border and independent customs policies. The third covers operations of the joint customs territory. The fourth covers 'good governance in the area of taxation, environmental protection, labour and social standards, [[state aid]], competition, and state-owned undertakings. The fifth to eighth cover relevant provisions in EU law. The ninth and tenth details procedures arising from main sections of the draft.

====Northern Ireland protocols (the Backstop and beyond)====
{{Main|Irish backstop}}
{{More information|Brexit and the Irish border}}
The Northern Ireland Protocol, known familiarly as the "Irish backstop", was an annex to the November 2018 draft agreement that described the provisions to prevent a [[Hard border|hard border in Ireland]] after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. The Protocol included a safety-net provision to handle the circumstances where satisfactory alternative arrangements remain to come into operation at the end of the transition period. This draft was replaced by a new Protocol that is described next.

==Revisions in 2019==

The agreement was subject to revisions under the [[First Johnson ministry|Johnson ministry]]'s [[Brexit negotiations in 2019|renegotiation in 2019]]. The amendments adjust approximately 5% of the text.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/18/how-much-johnson-great-new-deal-actually-new|title=How much of Johnson's 'great new deal' is actually new?|first1=Josh|last1=Holder|first2=Josh|last2=Holder|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Northern Ireland===
The [[Irish backstop]] is removed, and replaced by a [[Brexit and the Irish border#2019 renegotiation: New Protocol|new protocol]] on [[Northern Ireland]]/[[Republic of Ireland]]. In this, the whole of the UK comes out of the [[European Union Customs Union|EU Customs Union]] as a single customs territory, with Northern Ireland included in any future UK [[Trade agreement|trade deals]]. However, Northern Ireland adopts EU [[European Single Market|Single Market]] regulations on goods (including the [[European Union value added tax|EU VAT]]) in order to prevent a [[hard border]] and remains an entry point into the EU Customs Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50079385|title=Brexit: EU and UK reach deal but DUP refuses support|website=BBC News|date=17 October 2019|access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref> This leads to a ''[[de jure]]'' customs [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|border on the island of Ireland]], but a ''[[de facto]]'' customs border down the [[Irish Sea]]. EU [[tariff]]s (which ones dependent on a UK-EU [[Free trade agreement|FTA]]), collected by the UK on behalf of the EU, would be levied on goods going from [[Great Britain]] to Northern Ireland that are "at risk" of then being transported into and sold in the Republic of Ireland; if they ultimately aren't, then firms in Northern Ireland can claim [[Tax refund|rebates]] on goods where the UK had lower tariffs than the EU.<ref name="bbcNewDeal">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50083026|title=Brexit: What is in Boris Johnson's new deal with the EU?|website=BBC News|date=21 October 2019|access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref name="FTNewDeal">{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cdb2dadc-ec40-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55|title= How Boris Johnson moved to break the Brexit deadlock|website=Financial Times|date=11 October 2019|access-date=23 December 2019|last1=Parker|first1=George|last2=Brunsden|first2=Jim|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

This protocol also includes a unilateral exit mechanism for Northern Ireland: the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] will vote every four years on whether to continue with these arrangements, for which a simple majority is required. These votes will occur two months before the end of each four-year period, with the first period starting at the end of December 2020 (when the [[transition period]] is expected to end).<ref name="guardianOnDeal">{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/how-is-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-different-from-theresa-may | title = How is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? | author = Lisa O'Carroll | newspaper = The Guardian | date= 17 October 2019| access-date= 24 December 2019}}</ref> If the Assembly is suspended at the time, arrangements will be made for the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLAs]] to vote. If the Assembly expresses [[cross-community support]] in one of these periodic votes, then the protocol will apply for the next eight years instead of the usual four.<ref name="guardianOnDeal" /> However, if the Assembly votes against continuing with these arrangements, then there will be a two-year period for the UK and EU to agree to new arrangements.<ref name="bbcNewDeal"/><ref name="FTNewDeal"/>

===Political declaration===
The 2019 revisions also adjusted elements of the political declaration, replacing the word "adequate" with "appropriate" in regard to labour standards. According to Sam Lowe, trade fellow at the Centre for European Reform, the change excludes labour standards from dispute settlement mechanisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50199309|title=Key word 'adequate' removed from Brexit plan|first=Faisal|last=Islam|date=27 October 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> In addition, the [[level playing field]] mechanism has been moved from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement to the political declaration,<ref name="bbcNewDeal"/> and the line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” has been removed.<ref name="guardianOnDeal"/>

== Reception ==

=== Original deal ===
The reception of the agreement in the House of Commons ranged from cool to hostile and the vote was delayed more than a month. Prime Minister May won a no confidence motion in her own party, but the EU refused to accept any further changes.

==== UK government resignations ====
{{See also|List of resignations from the second May ministry}}
On 15 November 2018, the day after the agreement was presented and received backing from the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] of the UK government, several members of the government resigned, including [[Dominic Raab]], [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-dominic-raab-resigns-brexit-13592683 |title=Dominic Raab resigns as Brexit Secretary over Theresa May's Brexit deal |last=Bloom |first=Dan |date=15 November 2018 |work=Daily Mirror|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Contempt of Parliament ===
Following an unprecedented vote on 4 December 2018, MPs ruled that the UK government was in [[contempt of parliament]] for refusing to provide to Parliament the full legal advice it had been given on the effect of its proposed terms for withdrawal.<ref name="brexitbbc20181205">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46451970|title=Brexit: Legal advice warns of Irish border 'stalemate'|date=5 December 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref> The key point within the advice covered the legal effect of the "backstop" agreement governing Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the UK, in regard to the customs border between the EU and UK, and its implications for the [[Good Friday agreement]] which had led to the end of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, and specifically, whether the UK would be certain of being able to leave the EU in a practical sense, under the draft proposals.

The following day, the advice was published. The question asked was, ''"What is the legal effect of the UK agreeing to the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular its effect in conjunction with Articles{{nbsp}}5 and 184 of the main Withdrawal Agreement?"'' The advice given was that:<ref name="brexitbbc20181205" />

: The Protocol is binding on the UK and EU [para 3], and anticipates a final future resolution of the border and customs issues being reached [para 5,12,13]. But "the Protocol is intended to subsist even when negotiations have clearly broken down" [para 16] and "In conclusion, the current drafting of the Protocol{{nbsp}}... does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement. This remains the case even if parties are still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement." [para 30]

=== Revised deal ===
Immediately following announcement of a revised withdrawal agreement on 17 October 2019, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] said that they could not support the new deal.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50079385 |title=Brexit: EU and UK reach deal but DUP refuse support |date=17 October 2019 |work=BBC|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref>

On 22 October 2019, the House of Commons agreed by 329 votes to 299 to give a [[Second Reading]] to the revised withdrawal agreement (negotiated by Boris Johnson earlier that month), but when the accelerated timetable which he proposed failed to gain the necessary parliamentary support, Johnson announced that the legislation would be paused.<ref name=Bloomberg22Oct>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-22/johnson-finally-gets-to-put-his-deal-to-the-vote-brexit-update |title=Johnson to Press Ahead After Timetable Setback: Brexit Update |website=bloomberg.com |date=23 October 2019 |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="Reuters22Oct" />

On 20 December 2019, following the Conservative victory in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]], the House of Commons passed the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill by a margin of 358–234. After amendments proposed by the [[House of Lords]] and ping-pong between the two houses, the bill received [[royal assent]] on 23 January 2020, enabling ratification on the UK side.<ref>https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-21/europeanunionwithdrawalagreement/stages.html</ref>

== European Union ratification ==

On the part of the European Union, the European Parliament gave its consent to the ratification of the Agreement also on 29 January 2020,<ref>{{cite news |title=European Parliament approves Brexit agreement |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51287430 |access-date=31 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2020}}</ref> and the Council of the European Union approved the conclusion of the Agreement on 30 January 2020<ref>{{cite web |title=Brexit: Council adopts decision to conclude the withdrawal agreement |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/ |website=www.consilium.europa.eu |publisher=Council of the European Union |access-date=31 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> by email.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stevis-Gridneff |first1=Matina |title=Press Send for Brexit: E.U.

== Political declaration of future relationship==
{{see also|Continuing United Kingdom relationship with the European Union}}
The '''Declaration on Future European Union–United Kingdom Relations''', also referred to as the Political Declaration, is a non-binding declaration that was negotiated and signed along with the binding and more comprehensive Withdrawal Agreement in connection with the [[Brexit|withdrawal]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) from the [[European Union]] (EU), colloquially known as Brexit, and the planned end of the transitional period.

==Implementation==
===Citizens rights===
According to evidence presented by lobby group "British in Europe" (representing British citizens resident in EU countries) to the Brexit Select Committee of the House of Commons in June 2020, "as many as 23 EU member states [had] yet to implement systems to document the future rights of the estimated 1.2 million British citizens already living on the continent, who are in the dark over their future rights and obligations".<ref name=Graun200630>{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/30/uk-citizens-rights-eu-at-risk-brexit | title = Rights of UK citizens in EU at risk as member states' legislation not yet in place.

===Northern Ireland Protocol===
On 6 September 2020, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that the UK government planned to draw up new legislation that would bypass the withdrawal agreement's Northern Ireland Protocol.<ref>{{Cite news|date=6 September 2020|title=UK plan to undermine withdrawal treaty puts Brexit talks at risk|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9906e0d4-0c29-4f5f-9cb0-130c75a2f7a7|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=Graun060720>{{Cite news|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|last2=O'Carroll|first2=Lisa|last3=Rankin|first3=Jennifer|date=7 September 2020|title=Brexit: Boris Johnson to override EU withdrawal agreement|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/06/five-weeks-clinch-brexit-deal-uk-move-boris-johnson-to-say|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> The new law would give ministers the power to define what state aid needs to be reported to the EU, and define what products that at risk of being brought into Ireland from Northern Ireland (the withdrawal agreement states that in the absence of a mutual agreement, all products should be considered at risk).<ref name=Graun070920>{{Cite news|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|last2=Elgot|first2=Jessica|last3=Stewart|first3=Heather|date=7 September 2020|title=Leaked EU cables reveal growing mistrust of UK in Brexit talks|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/07/leaked-eu-cables-reveal-mistrust-of-uk-motives-in-brexit-talks|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> The government defended the move, saying the legislation was compliant with the protocol and merely "clarified" ambiguity in the protocol.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|last2=O'Carroll|first2=Lisa|date=7 September 2020|title=Downing Street defends Brexit plans for Northern Ireland|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/07/downing-street-defends-brexit-plans-for-northern-ireland|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> Ursula von der Leyen warned Johnson not to break international law, saying that the UK's implementation of the withdrawal agreement was a "prerequisite for any future partnership".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|last2=Rankin|first2=Jennifer|date=7 September 2020|title=Von der Leyen warns UK against breaking international law over Brexit deal|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/07/michel-barnier-worried-by-no-10-plans-to-renege-on-brexit-deal|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> On 8 September, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland [[Brandon Lewis]] told the UK Parliament that the government's planned [[United Kingdom Internal Market Bill|Internal Market Bill]] will "break international law".<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54073836 | title= Northern Ireland Secretary admits new bill will 'break international law' | work= BBC News | date = 8 September 2020 | access-date= 9 September 2020 }}</ref>

On 1 October 2020, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the UK government as the first step in an infringement procedure, as the UK's Internal Market Bill would be "in full contradiction" to the Northern Ireland Protocol if adopted as-is.<ref>{{cite press release |last=von der Leyen |first=Ursula |date=2020-10-01 |title=Press statement by President von der Leyen on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1800 |location=[[Brussels]] |publisher=[[European Commission]] |access-date=2020-10-02}}</ref>
