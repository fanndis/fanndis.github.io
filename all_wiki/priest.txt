A '''priest''' is a [[religious leader]] authorized to perform the [[Sacred rite|sacred rituals]] of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer [[religious rite]]s; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a [[deity]] or deities. Their office or position is the '''priesthood''', a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. A priest may have the duty to hear confessions periodically, give marriage counseling, provide prenuptial counseling, give spiritual direction, teach catechism, or visit those confined indoors, such as the sick in hospitals and nursing homes.

== Description ==
According to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of prehistoric [[Proto-Indo-European society]], priests have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies, most likely as a result of [[Agricultural surplus#Neolithic|agricultural]] surplus and consequent [[social stratification]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  The necessity to read sacred texts and keep temple or church records helped foster literacy in many early societies.   Priests exist in many religions today, such as all or some branches of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Shinto]] and [[Hinduism]].  They are generally regarded as having privileged contact with the [[deity|deity or deities]] of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. There is no common definition of the duties of priesthood between faiths; but generally it includes mediating the relationship between one's congregation, [[worshipper]]s, and other members of the religious body, and its deity or deities, and administering religious [[ritual]]s and rites. These often include blessing worshipers with prayers of joy at marriages, after a birth, and at [[consecrations]], teaching the wisdom and [[dogma]] of the faith at any regular worship service, and mediating and easing the experience of grief and death at funerals – maintaining a spiritual connection to the [[afterlife]] in faiths where such a concept exists. Administering religious building grounds and office affairs and papers, including any religious library or collection of [[sacred text]]s, is also commonly a responsibility – for example, the modern term for [[secretary|clerical duties]] in a secular office refers originally to the duties of a [[cleric]]. The question of which religions have a "priest" depends on how the titles of leaders are used or translated into English. In some cases, leaders are more like those that other believers will often turn to for advice on spiritual matters, and less of a "person authorized to perform the sacred rituals." For example, [[clergy]] in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] are ''priests'', but in [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]], they are typically ''[[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]'' and ''[[pastor]]''. The terms ''priest'' and ''priestess'' are sufficiently generic that they may be used in an [[anthropology|anthropological]] sense to describe the religious mediators of an unknown or otherwise unspecified religion.

In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. Many Christian priests and pastors choose or are mandated to dedicate themselves to their churches and receive their living directly from their churches. In other cases, it is a part-time role. For example, in the early [[history of Iceland]] the chieftains were titled ''[[goði]]'', a word meaning "priest". As seen in the [[saga]] of [[Hrafnkels saga|Hrafnkell Freysgoði]], however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.

In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism, the priesthood is inherited in familial lines. In a [[theocracy]], a society is [[government|governed]] by its priesthood.

== Etymology ==
The word "priest", is ultimately derived from [[ancient Greek|Greek]] via Latin ''[[presbyter]]'',<ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', College Edition, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland OH, s.v. "priest"</ref> the term for "elder", especially elders of Jewish or Christian communities in [[late antiquity]]. The Latin ''presbyter'' ultimately represents Greek {{lang|grc|πρεσβύτερος}} ''presbúteros'', the regular Latin word for "priest" being ''[[sacerdotalism|sacerdos]]'', corresponding to {{lang|grc|ἱερεύς}} ''hiereús''.

It is possible that the Latin word was loaned into [[Old English]], and only from Old English reached other Germanic languages via the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] to the continent, giving [[Old Icelandic]] ''prestr'', [[Old Swedish]] ''präster'', [[Old High German]] ''priast''. Old High German also has the disyllabic ''priester, priestar'', apparently derived from Latin independently via [[Old French]] ''presbtre''.

Αn alternative theory makes ''priest'' cognate with Old High German ''priast'', ''prest'', from [[Vulgar Latin]] *''prevost'' "one put over others", from Latin ''praepositus'' "person placed in charge".<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/priest "priest"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref>

That English should have only the single term ''priest'' to translate ''presbyter'' and ''sacerdos'' came to be seen as a problem in [[English Bible translations]]. The ''presbyter'' is the minister who both presides and instructs a Christian congregation, while the ''sacerdos'', offerer of [[sacrifice]]s, or in a Christian context the [[eucharist]], performs "mediatorial offices between God and man".<ref>Joseph B. Lightfoot, ''Epistle to the Philippians; a revised text, with introduction, etc.'', 2nd ed. 1869, p. 184, cited after ''[[OED]]''.</ref>

The feminine English noun, ''priestess'', was coined in the 17th century, to refer to female priests of the pre-Christian religions of classical antiquity. In the 20th century, the word was used in controversies surrounding the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|women ordained in the Anglican communion]], who are referred to as "priests", irrespective of gender, and the term priestess is generally considered archaic in Christianity.

{{Further|Vedic priesthood|Druid}}
In historical [[polytheism]], a priest administers the [[sacrifice]] to a deity, often in highly elaborate [[ritual]]. In the [[Ancient Near East]], the priesthood also acted on behalf of the deities in managing their property.

Priestesses in antiquity often performed [[sacred prostitution]], and in Ancient Greece, some priestesses such as [[Pythia]], priestess at [[Delphi]], acted as [[oracle]]s.

=== Ancient priests and priestesses ===
* [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] {{smallcaps|[[EN (cuneiform)|en]]}} ({{lang-akk|entu}}) were top-ranking priestesses who were distinguished with special ceremonial attire and held equal status to high priests. They owned property, transacted business, and initiated the [[hieros gamos]] with priests and kings.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Dening |year=1996 |title=The Mythology of Sex – Ch.3 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-02-861207-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyofsexan0000deni |url-access=registration }}</ref>

* The Sumerian word {{smallcaps|[[NIN (cuneiform)|nin]]}}, {{smallcaps|EREŠ}} in Akkadian, is the sign for "lady." {{smallcaps|nin.[[dingir]]}} (Akkadian ''entu''), literally "divine lady", a priestess.

* [[Puabi]] of [[Ur]] was an Akkadian [[queen regnant]] or a priestess. In several other Sumerian city-states, the ruling governor or king was also a head priest with the rank of {{smallcaps|[[ensi (Sumerian)|ensi]]}}, such as at [[Lagash]].
* Control of the holy city of [[Nippur]] and its temple priesthood generally meant hegemony over most of Sumer, as listed on the ''[[Sumerian King List]]''; at one point, the Nippur priesthood conferred the title of queen of Sumer on Kugbau, a popular taverness from nearby [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (who was later deified as [[Kubaba]]).
* In the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{lang-he|קְדֵשָׁה}} ''qědēšā'',<ref name="blueletterbible">{{cite web|url=http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H06948&t=kjv|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710120059/http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H06948&t=kjv|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-10|title=Hebrew Lexicon :: H6948 (KJV)|publisher=cf.blueletterbible.org|access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref> derived from the root [[Q-D-Š]]<ref name="kedeshah">{{cite web |title=Strong's H6948 |url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs=h6948 |website=[[Blue Letter Bible]] |language=en}}, incorporating [[Strong's Concordance]] (1890) and [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).</ref> were sacred prostitutes usually associated with the goddess [[Asherah]].
* ''Quadishtu'' served in the temples of the Sumerian goddess [[Qetesh]].

=== Ancient Egypt ===
In [[ancient Egyptian religion]], the right and obligation to interact with the [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] belonged to the [[pharaoh]]. He delegated this duty to priests, who were effectively bureaucrats authorized to act on his behalf. Priests staffed [[Egyptian temple|temples]] throughout Egypt, giving offerings to the [[cult image]]s in which the gods were believed to take up residence and performing other rituals for their benefit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sauneron|first=Serge|author-link=Serge Sauneron|title=The Priests of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9yureoueAEC|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8654-8|pages=32–36, 89–92}}</ref> Little is known about what training may have been required of priests, and the selection of personnel for positions was affected by a tangled set of traditions, although the pharaoh had the final say. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], when temples owned great estates, the high priests of the most important cult—that of [[Amun]] at [[Karnak]]—were important political figures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sauneron|first=Serge|author-link=Serge Sauneron|title=The Priests of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9yureoueAEC|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8654-8|pages=42–47, 52–53}}</ref>

High-ranking priestly roles were usually held by men. Women were generally relegated to lower positions in the temple hierarchy, although some held specialized and influential positions, especially that of the [[God's Wife of Amun]], whose religious importance overshadowed the [[High Priests of Amun]] in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].<ref>Doxey, Denise M., "Priesthood", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' (2001), vol. III, pp. 69–70</ref>

=== Ancient Rome ===
{{See also|College of Pontiffs}}
In [[ancient Rome]] and throughout Italy, the ancient sanctuaries of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Proserpina]] were invariably led by female ''sacerdotes'', drawn from women of local and Roman elites. It was the only public priesthood attainable by Roman matrons and was held in great honor.

A Roman matron was any mature woman of the upper class, married or unmarried. Females could serve public cult as [[Vestal Virgin]]s but few were chosen, and then only from young maidens of the upper class.<ref>Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman goddess Ceres, University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 4–5, 9, 20 (historical overview and Aventine priesthoods), 84–89 (functions of plebeian aediles), 104–106 (women as priestesses): citing among others Cicero, ''In Verres'', 2.4.108; Valerius Maximus, 1.1.1; Plutarch, ''De Mulierum Virtutibus'', 26.</ref>

=== Ancient Greece ===
* The [[Pythia]] was the title of a priestess at the very ancient temple of [[Delphi]] that was dedicated to the [[Earth Mother]]. She was widely credited for her [[prophecy|prophecies]]. The priestess retained her role when the temple was rededicated to [[Apollo]], giving her a prominence unusual for a woman in the male-dominated culture of [[classical Greece]].
* The [[Phrygian Sibyl]] was the priestess presiding over an [[Apollo]]nian [[oracle]] at [[Phrygia]], a historical kingdom in the [[Anatolia]]n highlands.

====Historical====
In [[ancient Israel]], the priests were required by the [[Law of Moses]] to be of direct [[patrilineal descent]] from [[Aaron]], Moses' elder brother. In Exodus 30:22–25 God instructs Moses to make a [[holy anointing oil]] to consecrate the priests "for all of eternity." During the times of the two Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples in Jerusalem]], the Aaronic priests were responsible for the daily and special [[Jewish holiday]] offerings and sacrifices within the temples, these offerings are known as the ''[[korbanot]]''.

In Hebrew, the word "priest" is ''[[kohen]]'' (singular כהן ''kohen'', plural כּהנִים ''kohanim''), hence the family names ''Cohen'', ''Cahn'', ''Kahn'', ''Kohn'', ''Kogan'', etc. These families are from the [[tribe of Levi]] (Levites) and in twenty-four instances are called by scripture as such ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] to [[Mishna]]ic tractate Maaser Sheini p.&nbsp;31a). In Hebrew, the word for "priesthood" is ''kehunnah''.

The word comes from the root KWN/KON כ-ו-ן 'to stand, to be ready, established'<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Even-Shoshan|first=Avraham|title=Even-Shoshan Dictionary|year=2003|pages=Entry "כֹּהֵן" (Kohen)}}</ref> in the sense of someone who stands ready before God<ref>{{Cite web|title=Klein Dictionary, כֹּהֵן|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary,_כֹּהֵן|access-date=2020-08-01|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>, and is common with other Semitic languages, e.g. Phoenician [[Tabnit sarcophagus#Inscription|KHN 𐤊𐤄𐤍 'priest']].

====Modern Judaism====
{{See|List of disqualifications for the Jewish priesthood}}
Since the [[destruction of the Second Temple]], and (therefore) the cessation of the daily and seasonal temple ceremonies and sacrifices, [[kohanim]] have become much less prominent. In traditional Judaism ([[Orthodox Judaism]] and to some extent, [[Conservative Judaism]]) a few priestly and [[Levitical]] functions, such as the ''[[pidyon haben]]'' (redemption of a first-born son) ceremony and the [[Priestly Blessing]], have been retained. Especially in Orthodox Judaism, kohanim remain subject to a number of restrictions concerning matters related to marriage and [[tumah and taharah|ritual purity]].

[[Orthodox Judaism]] regard the kohanim as being held in reserve for a future [[Third Temple|restored Temple]]. Kohanim do not perform roles of propitiation, sacrifice, or sacrament in any branch of [[Rabbinical Judaism]] or in [[Karaite Judaism]]. The principal religious function of any kohanim is to perform the [[Priestly Blessing]], although an individual kohen may also become a [[rabbi]] or other professional religious leader.

=====Beta Israel=====
The traditional [[Beta Israel]] community in Israel had little direct contact with other Jewish groups after the destruction of the temple and developed separately for almost two thousand years. While some Beta Israel now follow Rabbinical Jewish practices, the Ethiopian Jewish religious tradition ([[Haymanot]]) uses the word [[Kahen]] to refer to a type non-hereditary cleric.

===Samaritanism===
Aaronic Kohanim also officiated at the [[Samaritan]] temple on [[Mount Gerizim]]. The Samaritan kohanim have retained their role as religious leaders.

=== Christianity ===

With the spread of Christianity and the formation of [[parish]]es, the Greek word ''ἱερεύς'' (hiereus), and Latin ''sacerdos'', which Christians had since the 3rd century applied to [[bishop]]s and only in a secondary sense to [[presbyter]]s, began in the 6th century to be used of presbyters,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Garhammer | first = Erich | editor = Erwin Fahlbusch | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Christianity | title = Priest, Priesthood &nbsp;3.

Today, the term "priest" is used in [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Church of the East]], and some branches of [[Lutheranism]] to refer to those who have been [[ordained]] to a ministerial position through receiving the [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders]], although "presbyter" is also used.<ref>An example of the use of "presbyter" is found in [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1554]</ref> Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], non-sacramental denominations are more likely to use the term "[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]" to refer to their pastors. The Christian term "Priest" does not have an entry in the [[Anchor Bible Series|Anchor Bible Dictionary]], but the dictionary does deal with the above-mentioned terms under the entry for "Sheep, Shepherd.".<ref>Vancil, Jack W. (1992). "Sheep, Shepherd" ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'' New York: Doubleday. 5, 1187-1190. {{ISBN|0-385-19363-7}}.</ref>

==== Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy ====
{{Main|Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Priesthood (Eastern Orthodox Church)}}
The most significant [[liturgy|liturgical]] acts reserved to priests in these traditions are the administration of the [[Sacrament]]s, including the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]] (the terms for the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] in the Latin and Byzantine traditions, respectively), and the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]], also called [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]. The sacraments of [[Anointing of the Sick]] ([[Extreme Unction]]) and [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] are also administered by priests, though in the Western tradition Confirmation is ordinarily celebrated by a [[bishop]]. In the East, Chrismation is performed by the priest (using oil specially [[consecrated]] by a bishop) immediately after Baptism, and [[Unction]] is normally performed by several priests (ideally seven), but may be performed by one if necessary. In the West, [[Baptism|Holy Baptism]] may be celebrated by anyone. The Vatican catechism states that "According to Latin tradition, the spouses as ministers of Christ's grace mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of [[Catholic marriage|Matrimony]]".<ref name="vatican">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – The sacrament of Matrimony|publisher=vatican.va|access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref> Thus marriage is a sacrament administered by the couple to themselves, but may be witnessed and blessed by a deacon, or priest (who usually administers the ceremony). In the East, Holy Baptism and Marriage (which is called "Crowning") may be performed only by a priest. If a person is baptized ''in extremis'' (i.e., when in fear of immediate death), only the actual threefold immersion together with the scriptural words ({{bibleverse||Matthew|28:19|KJV}}) may be performed by a layperson or deacon. The remainder of the rite, and [[Chrismation]], must still be performed by a priest, if the person survives. The only sacrament which may be celebrated only by a bishop is that of [[Ordination]] (''cheirotonia'', "Laying-on of Hands"), or [[Holy Orders]].

In these traditions, only men who meet certain requirements may become priests. In Roman Catholicism the [[canon law|canonical]] minimum age is twenty-five. Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men up to one year younger. Dispensations of more than a year are reserved to the [[Holy See]] (Can. 1031 §§1, 4.) A Catholic priest must be [[Incardination and excardination|incardinated]] by his bishop or his major religious superior in order to engage in public ministry. In Orthodoxy, the normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 9 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination. In the Roman Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Rite, which covers the vast majority of Roman Catholicism, must be [[Clerical celibacy|celibate]] except under special rules for married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions.<ref>{{cite news

==== Anglican or Episcopalian ====<!-- 'Anglican priest' and 'Episcopal priest' redirect here -->
[[File:Choirhabit.jpg|thumb|An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest in choir dress]]
{{Main|Anglican ministry}}
The role of a priest in the [[Anglican Communion]] is largely the same as within the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Christianity]], except that [[canon law]] in almost every [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] province restricts the administration of [[confirmation]] to the [[bishop]], just as with [[ordination]]. Whilst Anglican priests who are members of [[Anglican religious order|religious orders]] must remain [[celibate]] (although there are exceptions, such as priests in the [[Anglican Cistercians|Anglican Order of Cistercians]]), the [[secular clergy]]&mdash;bishops, priests, and deacons who are not members of religious orders&mdash;are permitted to marry before or after ordination (although in most provinces they are not permitted to [[same-sex marriage|marry a person of the same sex]].) The Anglican churches, unlike the Roman Catholic or [[Eastern Christian]] traditions, have allowed the ordination of women as priests (referred to as "priests" not "priestesses") in some provinces since 1971.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Observer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/04/should-women-ever-be-made-bishops | title=Should women ever be bishops? | author= Emma John |date=July 4, 2010|location=London}}</ref> This practice remains controversial, however; a minority of provinces (10 out of the 38 worldwide) retain an all-male priesthood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Male bishops speak out on female priests |author=Sulaiman Kakaire |url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9899&Itemid=59}}</ref> Most [[Continuing Anglican Movement|Continuing Anglican]] churches do not ordain women to the priesthood.

As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, its [[presbyterate]] includes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the Roman Catholic Church, and a minority who prefer to use the title ''[[presbyter]]'' in order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word ''priest''. While ''priest'' is the official title of a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide (retained by the Elizabethan Settlement), the ordination rite of certain provinces (including the [[Church of England]]) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the title ''The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters).'' Even though both words mean 'elders'  historically the term ''priest'' has been more associated with the "[[High Church]]" or [[Anglo-Catholic]] wing, whereas the term "[[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]" has been more commonly used in "[[Low Church]]" or Evangelical circles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minister or Priest?|author=Anglican Church of Canada|url=http://www.anglican.ca/help/faq/minister-or-priest/}}</ref>

==== Lutheranism ====
[[File:Strängnäs Cathedral interior.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran priest of the [[Church of Sweden]] prepares for the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Strängnäs Cathedral]]]]
The general priesthood or the [[priesthood of all believers]], is a [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine derived from several passages of the [[New Testament]]. It is a foundational concept of [[Protestantism]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Protestant Heritage |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2007 |access-date=2007-09-20 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614170201/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446 |archive-date=June 14, 2006 }}</ref> It is this doctrine that [[Martin Luther]] adduces in his 1520 ''[[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]]'' in order to dismiss the medieval Christian belief that Christians were to be divided into two classes: "spiritual" and "temporal" or non-spiritual.

The conservative reforms of Lutherans are reflected in the theological and practical view of the ministry of the Church. Much of European Lutheranism follows the traditional Catholic governance of deacon, priest and bishop. The Lutheran archbishops of Finland, Sweden, etc. and Baltic countries are the historic national primates and some ancient cathedrals and parishes in the Lutheran church were constructed many centuries before the Reformation. Indeed, ecumenical work within the Anglican Communion and among Scandinavian Lutherans mutually recognize the [[apostolic succession|historic apostolic legitimacy]] and [[full communion]]. Likewise in America, Lutherans have embraced the apostolic succession of bishops in the full communion with Episcopalians and most Lutheran ordinations are performed by a bishop.

In some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, ordained clergy are called priests as in Sweden and Finland, while in others the term pastor is preferred.

==== Methodism ====
Methodist [[clergy]] often have the title of [[pastor]], [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[reverend]], etc.

In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to perform [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and to act as a leader in the church. A body of priesthood holders is referred to as a [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorum]]. Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority. The priesthood includes the power [[Jesus]] gave his [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] to perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 9:1). Latter Day Saints believe that the [[Bible|Biblical]] miracles performed by [[prophet]]s and apostles were performed by the power of the priesthood, including the miracles of Jesus, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood. The priesthood is formally known as the "Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God", but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of deity, the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek priesthood ([[Melchizedek]] being the high priest to whom [[Abraham]] paid tithes). As an authority, the priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service in the name of God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular, [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]]) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife.

There is some variation among the Latter Day Saint denominations regarding who can be ordained to the priesthood. In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), all worthy males above the age of 12 can be ordained to the priesthood. However, prior to a [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|policy change in 1978]], the LDS Church did not ordain men or boys who were of black African descent. The LDS Church does not ordain women to any of its priesthood offices. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ), the second largest denomination of the movement, began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices in 1984. This decision was one of the reasons that led to a schism in the church, which prompted the formation of the independent [[Restoration Branches]] movement from which other denominations have sprung, including the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].

Islam has no sacerdotal priesthood. There are, however, a variety of academic and administrative offices which have evolved to assist Muslims with this task, such as the [[Imam|imāms]] and the [[Mullah|mullāhs]]; a full discussion can be found at [[Clergy#Islam]].

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hindu]] priests historically were members of the [[Brahmin]] caste. Priests are ordained and trained as well. There are two types of Hindu priests, ''[[pujari]]s'' (''[[swami]]s'', ''[[yogi]]s'', and [[Gurua|gurus]]) and ''[[purohit]]s'' (''[[pandit|pundits]]''). A ''pujari'' performs rituals in a temple. These rituals include bathing the ''[[murti]]s'' (the statues of the gods/goddesses), performing ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'', a ritualistic offering of various items to the Gods, the waving of a ''[[ghee]]'' or oil lamp also called an offering in light, known in Hinduism as ''[[aarti]]'', before the ''murtis''. ''Pujaris'' are often married.

A ''purohit'', on the other hand, performs rituals and ''[[saṃskāra]]s'' (sacraments) outside of the temple. There are special ''purohits'' who perform only funeral rites.

In many cases, a ''purohit'' also functions as a ''pujari''. Both women and men are ordained as ''purohits'' and ''pujaris''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lew |first=Irene |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/080226/indian-city-opens-doorway-female-hindu-priests |title=Indian City Opens Doorway to Female Hindu Priests |publisher=Women's eNews |date=2008-02-26 |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8012/is_20081018/ai_n39508201/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425034139/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8012/is_20081018/ai_n39508201/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=2011-04-25 | work=The Times of India | first=Kamini | last=Mathai | title=Masti, mehendi mark Karva Chauth in city [Chennai] | date=2008-10-18}}</ref>

=== Taoism ===
The [[Taoist priest]]s (道士 "master of the [[Taoism|Dao]]" p.&nbsp;488) act as interpreters of the principles of Yin-Yang  [[Wu Xing|5 elements]] (fire, water, soil, wood, and metal p.&nbsp;53) school of ancient Chinese philosophy, as they relate to marriage, death, festival cycles, and so on. The Taoist priest seeks to share the benefits of meditation with his or her community through public ritual and liturgy (p.&nbsp;326). In the ancient priesthood before the Tang, the priest was called ''Jijiu'' ("libationer" p.&nbsp;550), with both male and female practitioners selected by merit. The system gradually changed into a male only hereditary Taoist priesthood until more recent times (p.&nbsp;550,551).<ref>Pregadio, Fabrizio (2008) ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1'' Psychology Press {{ISBN|0700712003}}

[[File:Yasaka-jinja 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Shinto priest and priestess in Japan.|[[Shinto]] priest and priestess in Japan]]
The Shinto priest is called a ''{{nihongo|[[kannushi]]''|神主||lit. "Master of the [[kami]]"}}, originally pronounced ''kamunushi'', sometimes referred to as a {{nihongo|''shinshoku''|神職||}}. A kannushi is the person responsible for the maintenance of a Shinto shrine, or ''[[Shinto shrine|jinja]]'', purificatory rites, and for leading worship and veneration of a certain ''kami''. Additionally, priests are aided by ''{{nihongo|[[miko]]''|巫女||"shrine maidens"}} for many rites as a kind of shaman or [[Mediumship|medium]]. The maidens may either be family members in training, apprentices, or local volunteers.

''[[Saiin (priestess)|Saiin]]'' were female relatives of the Japanese emperor (termed ''saiō'') who served as High Priestesses in [[Kamo Shrine]]. ''Saiō'' also served at [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]]. ''Saiin'' priestesses usually were elected from royalty. In principle, ''Saiin'' remained unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some ''Saiin'' became [[Queen consort|consort]]s of the emperor, called ''Nyōgo'' in Japanese. The ''Saiin'' order of priestesses existed throughout the Heian and Kamakura periods.

The [[Yoruba people]] of western [[Nigeria]] practice an indigenous religion with a [[Tribal chief|chiefly]] hierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to AD 800–1000. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Ifá priests and priestesses bear the titles [[Babalawo]] for men and [[Iyanifa]] for women.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|author1=Asante, M.K.|author2=Mazama, A.|date=2009|volume=1|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412936361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC&pg=PT365|access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref>  Priests and priestesses of the varied [[Orisa|Orisha]] are titled Babalorisa for men and Iyalorisa for women.<ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=Shamanism: An Encyclopedia of World Beliefs, Practices, and Culture|author1=Walter, M.N.|author2=Fridman, E.J.N.|date=2004|volume=1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576076453|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8waCmzjiD4C&pg=PA451|page=451|access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref> Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated. For example, a Priestess of [[Osun]] may be named Osunyemi, and a Priest of [[Ifá]] may be named Ifáyemi. This traditional  culture continues to this day as initiates from all around the world return to Nigeria for initiation into the priesthood, and varied derivative sects in the New World (such as [[Cuba]]n [[Santería]] and Brazilian [[Umbanda]]) use the same titles to refer to their officers as well.

=== Afro-Latin American religions ===
In Brazil, the priests in the [[Umbanda]], [[Candomblé]] and [[Quimbanda]] religions are called ''[[pai-de-santo]]'' (literally "Father of saint" in English), or "babalorixá" (a word borrowed from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''bàbálórìsà'', meaning ''Father of the [[Orisha]]''); its female equivalent is the ''[[mãe-de-santo]]'' ("Mother of saint"), also referred to as "ialorixá" ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]: ''iyálórìsà'').

In the [[Cuba]]n [[Santería]], a priest is called ''Santero'', or ''Santera'' in its feminine equivalent.

According to traditional [[Wicca]]n beliefs, every member of the religion is considered a priestess or priest, as it is believed that no person can stand between another and the Divine. However, in response to the growing number of Wiccan temples and [[Wiccan church|churches]], several denominations of the religion have begun to develop a core group of ordained priestesses and priests serving a larger laity. This trend is far from widespread, but is gaining acceptance due to increased interest in the religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/glossary/g/Priesthood.htm |title=Priesthood |publisher=Paganwiccan.about.com |date=2014-03-04 |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/LeadershipClergy.html |title=Leadership |publisher=Patheos.com |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodgame.org.nz/priesthood.html |title=The Priesthood – Temple of the Good Game |publisher=Goodgame.org.nz |access-date=2014-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702065543/http://goodgame.org.nz/priesthood.html |archive-date=2014-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Dress ==
[[File:Kruisheren 1964 Canons Regular of the Order Sanctae Crucis.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Some clergy and religious, such as these, who are [[Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross]] and live in the Netherlands, wear distinctive clothing which distinguishes them from other clergy, whether [[Secular clergy|secular]] or [[Regular clergy|religious]].]]
[[File:AGMA Kylix femme autel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Priestess officiating before an altar while nude to demonstrate purity, Attic red-figure [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by Chairias, c. 510–500&nbsp;BC, Ancient Agora Museum in Athens]]
The dress of religious workers in ancient times may be demonstrated in frescoes and artifacts from the cultures. The dress is presumed to be related to the customary clothing of the culture, with some symbol of the deity worn on the head or held by the person. Sometimes special colors, materials, or patterns distinguish celebrants, as the white wool veil draped on the head of the [[Vestal Virgin]]s.

Occasionally, the celebrants at religious ceremonies shed all clothes in a symbolic gesture of purity. This was often the case in ancient times. An example of this is shown to the left on a Kylix dating from c. 500&nbsp;BC where a priestess is featured. Modern religious groups tend to avoid such symbolism and some may be quite uncomfortable with the concept.

The retention of long [[skirt]]s and [[vestment]]s among many ranks of contemporary priests when they officiate may be interpreted to express the ancient traditions of the cultures from which their religious practices arose.

In most Christian traditions, priests wear [[clerical clothing]], a distinctive form of street dress. Even within individual traditions it varies considerably in form, depending on the specific occasion. In [[Western Christianity]], the stiff white [[clerical collar]] has become the nearly universal feature of priestly clerical clothing, worn either with a [[cassock]] or a [[clergy shirt]]. The collar may be either a full collar or a vestigial tab displayed through a square cutout in the shirt collar.

[[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] priests mostly retain the traditional dress of two layers of differently cut cassock: the ''rasson'' (Greek) or ''podriasnik'' (Russian) beneath the outer ''exorasson'' (Greek) or ''riasa'' (Russian). If a pectoral cross has been awarded it is usually worn with street clothes in the Russian tradition, but not so often in the Greek tradition.

Distinctive clerical clothing is less often worn in modern times than formerly, and in many cases it is rare for a priest to wear it when not acting in a pastoral capacity, especially in countries that view themselves as largely secular in nature. There are frequent exceptions to this however, and many priests rarely if ever go out in public without it, especially in countries where their religion makes up a clear majority of the population. [[Pope John Paul II]] often instructed Catholic priests and religious to always wear their distinctive (clerical) clothing, unless wearing it would result in persecution or grave verbal attacks.

Christian traditions that retain the title of priest also retain the tradition of special liturgical [[vestment]]s worn only during services. Vestments vary widely among the different Christian traditions.

In modern [[Pagan]] religions, such as [[Wicca]], there is no one specific form of dress designated for the clergy. If there is, it is a particular of the denomination in question, and not a universal practice. However, there is a traditional form of dress, (usually a floor-length [[tunic]] and a knotted cord [[cincture]], known as the ''cingulum''), which is often worn by worshipers during religious rites. Among those traditions of Wicca that do dictate a specific form of dress for its clergy, they usually wear the traditional tunic in addition to other articles of clothing (such as an open-fronted [[robe]] or a [[cloak]]) as a distinctive form of religious dress, similar to a [[Religious habit|habit]].

== Assistant priest ==
In many religions, there are one or more layers of assistant priests.

In the [[Ancient Near East]], [[hierodule]]s served in temples as assistants to the priestess.

In ancient Judaism, the Priests (Kohanim) had a whole class of Levites as their assistants in making the sacrifices, in singing [[psalm]]s and in maintaining the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]. The Priests and the Levites were in turn served by servants called [[Nethinim]]. These lowest level of servants were not priests.

An assistant priest is a priest in the Anglican and Episcopal churches who is not the senior member of clergy of the parish to which they are appointed, but is nonetheless in priests' orders; there is no difference in function or theology, merely in 'grade' or 'rank'. Some assistant priests have a "sector ministry", that is to say that they specialize in a certain area of ministry within the local church, for example youth work, hospital work, or ministry to local light industry. They may also hold some diocesan appointment part-time. In most (though not all) cases, an assistant priest has the legal status of [[curate|assistant curate]], although not all assistant curates are priests, as this legal status also applies to many [[deacon]]s working as assistants in a parochial setting.

The corresponding term in the [[Catholic Church]] is "parochial vicar" – an ordained priest assigned to assist the pastor (Latin: ''parochus'') of a parish in the pastoral care of parishioners. Normally, all pastors are also ordained priests; occasionally an auxiliary bishop will be assigned that role.

In [[Wicca]], the leader of a [[coven]] or temple (either a high priestess or high priest) often appoints an assistant. This assistant is often called a 'deputy', but the more traditional terms 'maiden' (when female and assisting a high priestess) and 'summoner' (when male and assisting a high priest) are still used in many denominations.
