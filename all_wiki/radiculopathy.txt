'''Radiculopathy''', also commonly referred to as '''pinched nerve''', refers to a set of conditions in which one or more [[nerve]]s are affected and do not work properly (a [[neuropathy]]).  This can result in [[pain]] ([[radicular pain]]), weakness, numbness, or difficulty controlling specific muscles.<ref name=AAOS>{{cite web|title=Cervical Radiculopathy (Pinched Nerve)|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00332|publisher=OrthoInfo by American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=June 2015}}</ref>

In a radiculopathy, the problem occurs at or near the root of the nerve, shortly after its exit from the [[spinal cord]]. However, the pain or other symptoms often radiate to the [[Dermatome_(anatomy) | part of the body]] [[Myotome|served by that nerve]]. For example, a nerve root impingement in the neck can produce pain and weakness in the forearm. Likewise, an impingement in the lower back or [[lumbar]]-[[sacrum|sacral]] [[Vertebral column|spine]] can be manifested with symptoms in the foot.

The radicular pain that results from a radiculopathy should not be confused with [[referred pain]], which is different both in mechanism and clinical features.

''Polyradiculopathy'' refers to the condition where more than one [[Posterior root of spinal nerve|spinal nerve root]] is affected.

==Causes==
[[File:Brachial plexus 2.svg|thumb|[[Brachial plexus]]. C6 and C7 nerves affected most frequently.]]
Radiculopathy most often is caused by mechanical compression of a [[nerve root]] usually at the exit [[foramen]] or [[lateral recess]]. It may be secondary to [[degenerative disc disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[facet joint]] degeneration/hypertrophy, [[ligament]]ous [[hypertrophy]], [[spondylolisthesis]], or a combination of these factors.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarulli AW, Raynor EM | title = Lumbosacral radiculopathy | journal = Neurologic Clinics | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 387–405 | date = May 2007 | pmid =  17445735 | doi = 10.1016/j.ncl.2007.01.008 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27a9/f13596f9bc2fdb873eb83302d14aaa176381.pdf }}</ref> Other possible causes of radiculopathy include [[neoplastic disease]], infections such as [[shingles]], [[HIV]], or [[Lyme disease]], [[spinal epidural abscess]], [[spinal epidural hematoma]], [[proximal diabetic neuropathy]], [[Tarlov cysts]], or, more rarely, [[sarcoidosis]], [[arachnoiditis]],  [[tethered spinal cord syndrome]], or [[transverse myelitis]].<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/>{{Verify source|date=December 2019}}

==Mechanism ==
Most often the radiculopathy found in the patients are located in the [[cervical spine]], most commonly affecting C6-C7 spinal nerves.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oh |first1=Sein |last2=Kim |first2=Hyung Kuk |last3=Kwak |first3=Jehwan |last4=Kim |first4=Taikon |last5=Jang |first5=Seong Ho |last6=Lee |first6=Kyu Hoon |last7=Kim |first7=Mi Jung |last8=Park |first8=Si-Bog |last9=Han |first9=Seung Hoon  |year=2013 |title=Causes of Hand Tingling in Visual Display Terminal Workers |journal=Annals of Rehabilitation Medicine |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=221–8 |doi=10.5535/arm.2013.37.2.221 |pmid=23705117 |pmc=3660483}}</ref>

Certain injuries can also lead to radiculopathy. These injuries include lifting heavy objects improperly or suffering from a minor trauma such as in a car accident. Less common causes of radiculopathy include injury caused by tumor (which can compress nerve roots locally) and diabetes (which can effectively cause ischemia or lack of blood flow to nerves).

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Projectional radiograph of cervical foraminal stenosis, annotated.jpg|thumb|[[Projectional radiograph]] of a man presenting with pain by the [[nape]] and left shoulder, showing a stenosis of the left [[intervertebral foramen]] of [[cervical spinal nerve 4]], corresponding with the affected [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]].]]

There is also spondylosis of the [[facet joint]] between C2 and C3, with some foraminal stenosis at this level (upper arrow), which appears to be asymptomatic.]]

Radiculopathy is a diagnosis commonly made by physicians in primary care specialities, orthopedics, physiatry, and neurology. The diagnosis may be suggested by symptoms of pain, numbness, and weakness in a pattern consistent with the [[Dermatome_(anatomy)|distribution of]] [[Myotome|a particular nerve root]], such as [[sciatica]]. Neck pain or back pain may also be present. [[Physical examination]] may reveal motor and sensory deficits in the distribution of a nerve root. In the case of cervical radiculopathy, [[Spurling's test]] may elicit or reproduce symptoms radiating down the arm. Similarly, in the case of lumbosacral radiculopathy, a [[straight leg raise]] maneuver or a [[femoral nerve stretch test]] may demonstrate radiculopathic symptoms down the leg.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> Deep tendon reflexes (also known as a [[Stretch reflex]]) may be diminished or absent in areas innervated by a particular nerve root.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment within 4-6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first excluding possible causes that, although rare, require immediate attention, among them the following. [[Cauda equina syndrome]] should be investigated in case of [[saddle anesthesia]], loss of bladder or bowel control, or leg weakness.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> [[Cancer]] should be suspected if there is previous history of it, unexplained weight loss, or low-back pain that does not decrease by lying down or is unremitting.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> Spinal [[epidural abscess]] is more common among those with [[diabetes mellitus]] or [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]], who use [[Drug_injection|intravenous drugs]], or had [[Vertebral_column|spinal]] [[surgery]], [[Injection_(medicine)|injection]] or [[catheter]]; it typically causes [[fever]], [[leukocytosis]] and increased [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]].<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> If any of the previous is suspected, urgent [[magnetic resonance imaging]] is recommended for confirmation.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> [[Proximal diabetic neuropathy]] typically affects middle aged and older people with well-controlled type-2 [[diabetes mellitus]]; onset is sudden causing pain usually in multiple [[Dermatome_(anatomy)|dermatomes]] quickly followed by weakness. Diagnosis typically involves [[electromyography]] and [[lumbar puncture]].<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> [[Shingles]] is more common among the elderly and immunocompromised; usually (but not always) pain is followed by appearance of a [[rash]] with small blisters along a single [[Dermatome_(anatomy)|dermatome]].<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> It can be confirmed by quick laboratory tests.<ref name=Dwo2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dworkin RH, Johnson RW, Breuer J, etal | title=Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster| journal=[[Clin.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the portion of the spine where radiculopathy is suspected may reveal evidence of degenerative change, arthritic disease, or another explanatory lesion responsible for the patient's symptoms. Electrodiagnostic testing, consisting of NCS ([[nerve conduction study]]) and EMG ([[electromyography]]), is also a powerful diagnostic tool that may show nerve root injury in suspected areas. On nerve conduction studies, the pattern of diminished [[Compound muscle action potential]] and normal sensory nerve action potential may be seen given that the lesion is proximal to the [[posterior root ganglion]]. Needle EMG is the more sensitive portion of the test, and may reveal active denervation in the distribution of the involved nerve root, and neurogenic-appearing voluntary motor units in more chronic radiculopathies. Given the key role of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of acute and chronic radiculopathies, the [[American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine]] has issued evidence-based practice guidelines, for the diagnosis of both cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Guidelines in electrodiagnostic medicine.

==Treatment==
Ideally, effective treatment aims to resolve the underlying cause and restores the nerve root to normal function. Conservative treatment may include [[bed rest]], [[physical therapy]], or simply continuing to do usual activities; for pain, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]], nonopioid or, in some cases, narcotic [[analgesics]] may be prescribed.<ref name=tarulli_radiculopathy/> [[Chiropractic]] is another option.

===Rehabilitation===
With a recent injury (e.g. one that occurred one week ago), a formal physical therapy referral is not yet indicated. Often mild to moderate injuries will resolve or greatly improve within the first few weeks. Additionally, patients with acute injuries are often too sore to participate effectively in physical therapy so soon after the insult. Waiting two to three weeks is generally recommended before starting formal physical therapy. In acute injury resulting in lumbosacral radiculopathy, conservative treatment such as acetaminophen and [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] should be the first line of therapy.<ref name="AAOS" />

Therapeutic exercises are frequently used in combination with many of the previously mentioned [[Sensory modality|modalities]] and with great results. A variety of exercise regimens are available in patient treatment. An exercise regimen should be modified according to the abilities and weaknesses of the patient.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cleland |first1=Joshua A. |last2=Whitman |first2=Julie M. |last3=Fritz |first3=Julie M. |last4=Palmer |first4=Jessica A. |year=2005 |title=Manual Physical Therapy, Cervical Traction, and Strengthening Exercises in Patients with Cervical Radiculopathy: A Case Series |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=802–11 |doi=10.2519/jospt.2005.35.12.802 |pmid=16848101|doi-access=free }}</ref> Stabilization of the [[cervicothoracic]] region is helpful in limiting pain and preventing re-injury.

This is a preferred method of exercise during the sub-acute phase because it resists [[atrophy]] and is least likely to exacerbate the condition. Single plane resistance exercises against cervical flexion, extension, bending, and rotation are used.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Surgery===
While conservative approaches for rehabilitation are ideal, some patients will not improve and surgery is still an option. Patients with large cervical disk bulges may be recommended for surgery; however, most often, conservative management will help the herniation regress naturally.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heckmann |first1=J.

==Epidemiology==
Cervical radiculopathy is less prevalent in the United States than [[lumbar]] radiculopathy, with an occurrence rate of 83 cases per 100,000. According to the [[AHRQ]]’s 2010 National Statistics for cervical radiculopathy, the most affected age group is between 45 and 64 years with 51.03% of incidents. Females are affected more frequently than males and account for 53.69% of cases. Private insurance was the payer in 41.69% of the incidents followed by Medicare with 38.81%. In 71.61% of cases the patients’ income was considered not low for their zipcode. Additionally over 50% of patients lived in large metropolitans (inner city or suburb). The South is the most severely affected region in the US with 39.27% of cases. According to a study performed in Minnesota, the most common manifestation of this set of conditions is the C7 monoradiculopathy, followed by C6.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radhakrishnan |first1=Kurupath |last2=Litchy |first2=William J. |last3=O'Fallon |first3=W.
