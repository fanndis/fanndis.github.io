UBS was founded in 1862 as the [[Bank in Winterthur]] alongside the advent of the [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banking industry]]. During the 1890s, the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC) was founded, forming a [[private banking]] syndicate that expanded aided by Switzerland's [[Swiss neutrality|international neutrality]]. In 1912, the Bank of Winterthur merged with [[Toggenburger Bank]] to form the [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] (UBS) and grew rapidly after the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Law of 1934]] codified Swiss banking secrecy. Following decades of market competition between the SBC and UBS, the two merged in 1998 to create a single company known solely as "UBS".{{#tag:ref|The "three keys" symbol was taken from the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]]'s logo and are meant to represent the following, from left to right:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Booms and Busts: An Encyclopedia of Economic History from the First Stock Market Crash of 1792 to the Current Global Economic Crisis|last=Odekon|first=Mehmet|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317475767|pages=850|language=en|quote=...A logo of three keys, standing for confidence, security, and discretion, was taken over from [Swiss Bank Corporation]...}}</ref>

After UBS managed heavy losses during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] with an asset relief recovery program, it was hit by the [[2011 UBS rogue trader scandal|2011 rogue trader scandal]] resulting in a [[United States dollar|US$]]2 billion trading loss. In 2012 the bank reoriented itself around wealth management advisory services and limited its [[sell side]] operations.<!--Operations and coverage-->

Apart from private banking, UBS provides [[wealth management]], [[asset management]], and investment banking services for private, corporate, and institutional clients with international service. UBS manages the largest amount of private wealth in the world, <!--Do not remove without an editor consensus on the talk page and/or referencing UBS Wealth Management section.-->counting approximately half of [[The World's Billionaires|the world's billionaires]] among its clients. Despite its trimming of sell side operations, UBS maintains [[Bulge Bracket|a global investment bank]] and is considered a primary [[market maker]]. The bank also maintains numerous underground bank vaults, bunkers, and storage facilities for gold bars around the [[Swiss Alps]] and internationally. Partly due to its banking secrecy, <!--Do not remove without an editor consensus on the talk page.-->it has been at the centre of [[UBS tax evasion controversies|numerous tax avoidance investigations]] undertaken by U.S., French, German, Israeli, and Belgian authorities.

The official founding date of the bank is April 1862, the year when its nucleus [[Bank in Winterthur]] was founded.<ref name="UBS Es begann in Winterthur">[http://www.stadtgeschichte2014.ch/typo3conf/ext/startpage/pdf/Bank%20in%20Winterthur%20Landbote%202012-06-25.pdf Stadtgeschichte]. Der Landbote. Retrieved 23 October 2015</ref> Although the merged company's new name was originally supposed to be the "United Bank of Switzerland," the officials opted to call it simply ''UBS'' because of a name clash with the separate Swiss company ''United Bank Switzerland'' – a part of the [[United Bank Limited]]'s Swiss subsidiary. Therefore, UBS is no longer an [[acronym]] but ''is'' the company's brand. Its logo of three keys, carried over from SBC, stands for the company's values of confidence, security, and discretion.<ref name="Our Clients and Businesses" />

[[File:Swiss Bank Corp 1973 logo.png|thumb|275px|[[Swiss Bank Corporation]] logo (ca. 1973), featuring the three keys meant to symbolize confidence, security, and discretion]]

UBS, through Swiss Bank Corporation, traces its history to 1854 when six private banking firms in [[Basel]], Switzerland pooled their resources to form the ''Bankverein'', a consortium that acted as an underwriting [[syndicate]] for its member banks.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/about_us/history.html|title=History of UBS|website=global|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> In 1871, the Bankverein coordinated with the German ''Frankfurter Bankverein'' to form the ''Basler Bankverein'', a [[joint-stock]] company replacing the original Bankverein consortium.<ref name=":1" /> After the new bank started with an initial commitment of CHF&nbsp;30 million and CHF&nbsp;6 million of share capital, it soon experienced growing pains when heavy losses in Germany caused it to suspend its dividend until 1879.<ref name=":1" /> Following the years 1885 and 1886, when the bank merged with the Zürcher Bankverein and acquired the Basler Depositenbank and the Schweizerische Unionbank, it changed its name to ''Schweizerischer Bankverein''.<ref name=":1" /> The English name of the bank was originally Swiss Bankverein, but was changed to Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) in 1917.<ref name="UBS-FUHistory">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/ubs-ag-history/ UBS AG History].

SBC subsequently experienced a period of growth, which was only interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]], in which the bank lost investments in a number of large industrial companies. By the end of 1918, the bank had recovered and surpassed CHF&nbsp;1 billion in total assets and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920. The impact of the [[stock market crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] was severe, particularly as the [[Swiss franc]] suffered major [[devaluation]] in 1936. The bank saw its assets fall from a 1929 peak of CHF&nbsp;1.6 billion to its 1918 levels of CHF&nbsp;1 billion by 1936.<ref name="UBS-FUHistory" /><ref name=":1" />

In 1937, SBC adopted its three-keys [[logo]], designed by [[Warja Honegger-Lavater]], symbolizing confidence, security, and discretion, which remains an integral part in the current-day logo of UBS.<ref name=":1" /> On the eve of [[World War II]] in 1939, SBC, like other Swiss banks, was the recipient of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping. Just prior to the outbreak of the war, SBC made the timely decision to open an office in New York City.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903EFDD153EE63ABC4051DFB1668382629EDE Swiss Bank of Basle to Open Branch Here; Huge Vaults a Haven for European Capital].

In 1945, SBC acquired the ''Basler Handelsbank'' (Commercial Bank of Basel), which was one of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became [[Insolvency|insolvent]] by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which had entered the 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to CHF&nbsp;4 billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF&nbsp;10 billion by 1965.<ref name=":1" /> In 1961, SBC acquired ''Banque Populaire Valaisanne'', based in [[Sion, Switzerland]] and the ''Banque Populaire de Sierre''.<ref name="UBS History">{{cite web|title=UBS.

==Acquisition history==
As it exists today, UBS represents a conglomeration of dozens of individual firms, many of which date back to the 19th century. Over the years, these firms merged to form the bank's three major predecessors, [[Union Bank of Switzerland]], [[Swiss Bank Corporation]], and [[Paine Webber]]. The following is a visual illustration of the company's major [[mergers and acquisitions]] and historical predecessors, although this is not necessarily a comprehensive list:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/investor_relations/annualreporting/2009.html|title=UBS 2009 Annual report|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref>
