'''Belmont''' is a city in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It is in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] halfway between [[San Francisco]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].  It was originally part of [[Rancho de las Pulgas]], for which one of its main roads, the Alameda de las Pulgas, is named. The city was incorporated in 1926. Its population was 25,835 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

[[Ralston Hall]] is a historic landmark built by [[Bank of California]] founder [[William Chapman Ralston]] on the campus of [[Notre Dame de Namur University]], and is also home to [[Notre Dame High School (Belmont, California)|Notre Dame High School]]. It was built around a villa formerly owned by Count Cipriani, an Italian aristocrat. The locally famous "Waterdog Lake" is also located in the foothills and highlands of Belmont.

A surviving structure from the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] is on Belmont Avenue (another is the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco).  The building was brought to Belmont by E.D. Swift shortly after the [[World expo|exposition]] closed in 1915. 

Belmont has   a [[List of smoking bans in the United States |smoking ordinance]] passed in January 2009 which bans smoking in all businesses and multi-story apartments and condominiums; the ordinance has been described as one of the strictest [[List of smoking bans in the United States|in the nation]].

==Etymology==
The name is believed to derive from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''bel monte'', meaning "beautiful mountain." The town was  named for the "symmetrically rounded eminence" nearby.<ref>Gudde, Erwin G. "California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names," 4th ed.

===Smoking policy===
In January 2009, Belmont adopted an ordinance that bans smoking in city parks, all businesses, and all multi-story apartments and condominiums. The policy, which has been described as perhaps the strictest anti-smoking law in the nation, was the result of a group of retirees lobbying the city to stop secondhand smoke from drifting into their apartments from neighboring places. Public health advocates consider the ordinance to be a new front in a national battle against tobacco; officials from the [[American Lung Association]] of California said "Belmont broke through this invisible barrier in the sense that it addressed drifting smoke in housing as a public health issue."<ref>McKinley, Jesse. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/us/27belmont.html?_r=1&hp "Smoking Ban Hits Home. Truly."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 26, 2009. Retrieved on 2009-01-26.</ref>
