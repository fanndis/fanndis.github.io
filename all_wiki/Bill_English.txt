'''Sir Simon William English''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM}} (born 30 December 1961) served as the 39th [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 2016 to 2017. 

A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in {{NZ election link year|1990}} as the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party's]] candidate in the [[Wallace (New Zealand electorate)|Wallace electorate]]. He was elevated to [[cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] in 1996 and in 1999 was made [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]], although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 general election]]. In October 2001, English replaced [[Jenny Shipley]] as the [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party|leader of the National Party]] (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 general election]], and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by [[Don Brash]].

In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under [[John Key]]. After National's victory at the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], he became [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and was also made Minister for Finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a [[List MP|list-only MP]] after stepping down as an electorate MP at the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]].

John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won [[2016 New Zealand National Party leadership election|the resulting leadership election]] unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. In the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by [[Jacinda Ardern]], [[Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|leader of the Labour Party]]. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.<ref name="resignation">{{cite news|title=Bill English announces retirement from Parliament|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1802/S00098/bill-english-announces-retirement-from-parliament.htm|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop News]]|date=13 February 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
English is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased ''Rosedale'', a mixed sheep and cropping farm in [[Dipton, New Zealand|Dipton, Southland]] from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10517639|title=Being English – National – NZ Herald News|website=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/carroll-du-chateau/news/article.cfm?a_id=69&objectid=232498|title=The English Doctor – Carroll du Chateau|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref> English was born in the nearby town of [[Lumsden, New Zealand|Lumsden]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Temple|first=Philip|title=Temple's Guide to the 44th New Zealand Parliament|year=1994|publisher=McIndoe Publishers|location=Dunedin|isbn=0-86868-159-8|page=62}}</ref>

English attended St Thomas's School in [[Winton, New Zealand|Winton]], then boarded at [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St. Patrick's College]] in [[Upper Hutt]], where he became [[head boy]]. He played in the first XV of the school's [[Rugby union|rugby]] team. English went on to study commerce at the [[University of Otago]], where he was a resident at [[Selwyn College, Otago|Selwyn College]], and then completed an honours degree in English literature at [[Victoria University of Wellington]].<ref name="herbert">Patricia Herbert, "A country boy who's set to lead", ''The New Zealand Herald'', 11 August 1997; retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref>

After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years.<ref name="herbert"/> From 1987 to 1989, he worked in [[Wellington]] as a policy analyst for the [[New Zealand Treasury]], at a time when the [[free market]] policies favoured by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]'s finance minister [[Roger Douglas]] (known collectively as "[[Rogernomics]]") were being implemented.<ref name="rae">{{cite news |first=Marion |last=Rae |title=NZ's newly-minted Finance Minister takes office |work= [[Reuters]] |date=3 February 1999 |via=[[Factiva]]}}</ref>

English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the [[New Zealand Young Nationals|Young Nationals]], and became a member of the [[Wallace (New Zealand electorate)|Wallace]] electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the [[Island Bay (New Zealand electorate)|Island Bay]] and [[Miramar (New Zealand electorate)|Miramar]] electorate committees, respectively.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joanne |last=Black |title='Dominatrix act' the last straw for Nat plotters |work=The Evening Post |date=9 October 2001 |via=[[Factiva]]}}</ref>

At the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 general election]], English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring [[Derek Angus]], and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed [[Clutha-Southland]] in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs ([[Tony Ryall]], [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], and [[Roger Sowry]]) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the "brat pack", the "gang of four", and the "Young Turks". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a [[select committee (parliamentary system)|select committee]] into social services. He was made a [[Parliamentary secretary|parliamentary under-secretary]] in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.<ref name="herbert"/><ref>Helen Bain, "Plain English preferred", ''The Dominion'', 2 February 1999. Retrieved From [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref>

===First period in cabinet (1996–1999)===
In early 1996, English was elevated to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|cabinet]] by Prime Minister [[Jim Bolger]], becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]] (to [[Wyatt Creech]]). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member.<ref>Bernard Orsman, "Rapid rise for English", ''The New Zealand Herald'', 1 March 1996. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref> After the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 general election]], the National Party was forced into a coalition with [[New Zealand First]] to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]]. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's [[Neil Kirton]] (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a "[[shotgun marriage]]", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers.<ref>Victoria Main, "All's fair in love and health", ''[[The Dominion (Wellington)|The Dominion]]'', 20 May 1997. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref><ref>Brent Edwards, "Villain or hero, he won't give ground", ''[[The Evening Post (Wellington)|The Evening Post]]'', 23 July 1997. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref> After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader [[Winston Peters]].<ref>Michael Laws, "The staredown before the Kirton sacking", ''The Evening Post'', 12 August 1997. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref>

As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 general election]]. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge.<ref name="cannan">Dave Cannan, "English confident of health role", ''Otago Daily Times'', 6 November 1997. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref> English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to "balance sheets" and "user charges") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring.<ref>"Mr English seeks to cure health reforms", ''The New Zealand Herald'', 20 April 1996. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref> He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.<ref>Ruth Laugesen, "English making his mark as reformer Shipley's apprentice", ''The Dominion'', 17 June 1996; retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref>

By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with [[Jenny Shipley]] and [[Doug Graham]]. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run.<ref>Chris Trotter, "Who can save National from Bolger's liaison dangereuse?", ''Independent Business Weekly'', 23 May 1997. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref> National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.<ref name="cannan"/>

English was promoted to [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)#History|Treasurer]], [[Bill Birch]]. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors ([[Roger Douglas]]'s "[[Rogernomics]]" and [[Ruth Richardson]]'s "[[Ruthanasia]]") had focused on "fruitless, theoretical debates" when "people just want to see problems solved".<ref name="rae"/><ref>Guyon Espiner, "Shipley's new men at the top", 3 February 1999; retrieved from [[Factiva]], 12 December 2016.</ref>

==Opposition (1999–2008)==
[[File:Bill English.jpg|thumb|right|English in February 2005]]
After the National Party lost the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] to [[Helen Clark]]'s Labour Party, English continued on in the [[shadow cabinet]] as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of [[Wyatt Creech]], with [[Gerry Brownlee]] being his unsuccessful opponent.<ref>Ryan Keen, "English scores deputy leader", ''The Southland Times'', 8 February 2001; retrieved from [[Factiva]], 13 December 2016.</ref>

===Leader of the Opposition===
In October 2001, after months of speculation, [[Jenny Shipley]] resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English [[2001 New Zealand National Party leadership election|was elected]] as her replacement unopposed (with [[Roger Sowry]] as his deputy), and consequently became [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]].<ref>Grant Fleming, "Nat MP caucus claps in English", ''The Evening Post'', 9 October 2001. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 13 October 2001.</ref> However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to ''[[The Southland Times]]'' "there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension".<ref>"Bill English", ''The Southland Times'', 10 October 2001; retrieved from [[Factiva]], 13 December 2016.</ref>

Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after [[Jim McLay]] (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after [[Joseph Ward]] and [[Adam Hamilton]].<ref>Graeme Hunt, "Death in the afternoon – how the might fall", ''National Business Review'', 12 October 2001. Retrieved from [[Factiva]], 13 December 2016.</ref> However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as "the worst day of my political life". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.<ref>Audrey Young, [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/election-2002/news/article.cfm?c_id=774&objectid=2197717 "Is this the future National deserved?"], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 30 July 2002. Retrieved 14 December 2016.</ref>

By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer [[Ted Clarke]]. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. [[Don Brash]], former governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]] and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in [[2003 New Zealand National Party leadership election|a leadership contest]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3531139|title=Don Brash is the new leader of the National Party|date=28 October 2003|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

===Shadow cabinet roles and deputy leader===
On 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]]. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).<ref>[https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/document/51MP321/english-bill Rt Hon Bill English], New Zealand Parliament. Retrieved 14 December 2016.</ref>

After the resignation of [[Don Brash]], English aspired to replace [[Gerry Brownlee]] as deputy leader. In November 2006, Brownlee stepped aside and English also took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10412659|title=English back from the cold|date=27 September 2006|accessdate=29 September 2009|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|last=Tait|first=Maggie}}</ref>

In June 2002, English took part in [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3's]] ''Fight For Life'', a celebrity [[boxing]] fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997.
