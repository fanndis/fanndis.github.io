In 1956, she starred in the Broadway play ''Middle of the Night'' opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]].

Rowlands costarred with [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] in the 26-episode syndicated TV series ''Top Secret'' (1954–55).<ref name="Top Secret CTVA">{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Spy/TopSecretUSA.htm |title=Top Secret |publisher=Classic TV Archive |access-date=2014-11-26}}</ref> She guest-starred on such anthology television series as ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]]'', ''[[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]'', ''[[Studio One (American TV series)|Studio One]]'', ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]'', ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' and ''[[Goodyear Television Playhouse]]'', all in 1955. In 1959, Rowlands appeared in the western series ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', alongside her husband [[John Cassavetes]] in the [[detective]] series ''[[Johnny Staccato]]'', and in the [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]]. In 1961, she appeared in the adventure series ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]]'', set in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], and in ''[[Target: The Corruptors!]]'', starring [[Stephen McNally]]. She guest-starred in ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]'', the detective series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', the westerns ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'', all in 1963. In 1964, she guest-starred in the [[medical drama]] ''[[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Dr. Kildare]]'' and in two episodes of ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''. She appeared in four episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', three of which were after the series had been renamed ''The Alfred Hitchcock Hour''. In 1967, she was cast as socialite Adrienne Van Leyden in the prime-time ABC [[soap opera]] ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''.

Rowlands made her film debut in ''[[The High Cost of Loving]]'' in 1958. In 1962, she starred in director [[David Miller (director)|David Miller]]'s ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'', with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. She played the former lover of the Kirk Douglas character, now the wife of the Douglas character's best friend.

=== Cassavetes era (1963–1984) ===
Rowlands and Cassavetes made ten films together: ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963), ''[[Faces (1968 film)|Faces]]'' (1968), ''[[Machine Gun McCain]]'' (1969), ''[[Minnie and Moskowitz]]'' (1971), ''[[A Woman Under the Influence]]'' (1974; nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]), ''[[Two-Minute Warning]]'' (1976), ''[[Opening Night (1977 film)|Opening Night]]'' (1977), ''[[Gloria (1980 film)|Gloria]]'' (1980; nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]), ''[[Tempest (1982 film)|Tempest]]'' (1982), and ''[[Love Streams (film)|Love Streams]]'' (1984).<ref>"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOg-T4FvZv4&t=32s Gena Rowlands, a miraculous actress]"</ref>

According to [[Boston University]] film scholar [[Ray Carney]], Rowlands sought to suppress an early version of Cassavetes' first film, ''[[Shadows (1959 film)|Shadows]]'', that Carney says he rediscovered after decades of searching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/discoveries/shadowsquest.shtml|title=Who Owns an Improvised Work?|website=The John Cassavetes Pages|access-date=December 17, 2006}}</ref> Rowlands also became involved in the screenings of ''[[Husbands (film)|Husbands]]'' and ''[[Love Streams (film)|Love Streams]]'', according to Carney. The [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] mounted a restoration of ''Husbands'', as it was pruned down (without Cassavetes' consent, and in violation of his contract) by [[Columbia Pictures]] several months after its release, in an attempt to restore as much of the removed content as possible. At Rowlands' request, [[UCLA]] created an alternative print with almost ten minutes of content edited out, as Rowlands felt that these scenes were in poor taste. The alternative print is the only one that has been made available for rental.<ref>Carney, Ray [http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/discoveries/discint.shtml#hunka "On Your Relationship with Criterion"], ''The John Cassavetes Pages''; accessed December 17, 2006</ref>

=== Late career (1985–present) ===
[[File:Gena Rowlands Cannes.jpg|thumb|Rowlands at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

In 1985, Rowlands played the mother in the critically acclaimed made-for-TV movie ''[[An Early Frost]]''. She won an Emmy for her portrayal of former [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Betty Ford]] in the 1987 made-for-TV movie ''[[The Betty Ford Story]]''.

In 1988, Rowlands starred in [[Woody Allen]]'s dramatic film ''[[Another Woman (1988 film)|Another Woman]]''. She played Marion Post, a middle-aged professor who is prompted to a journey of self-discovery when she overhears the therapy sessions of another woman ([[Mia Farrow]]). The review in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' described the character's trajectory: "Marion gets to thinking, and is appalled to realise that so many assumptions about her own life and marriage are largely unfounded: in her desire for a controlled existence, she has evaded the emotional truth about relationships with her best friend ([[Sandy Dennis]]), brother ([[Harris Yulin]]) and husband ([[Ian Holm]])." ''Time Out'' praised the "marvellous" performances in the film, adding, "Rowlands' perfectly pitched approach to a demanding role is particularly stunning."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/another-woman|title=Another Woman|newspaper=Time Out|access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> [[Film4]] called her performance "sublime",<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Woman|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1988/another-woman|publisher=Film4|access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> while [[Roger Ebert]] noted that it marked a considerable change in tone from her work with Cassavetes, thus showing "how good an actress Rowlands has been all along."<ref>{{cite news|author=Ebert, Roger|title=Another Woman|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/another-woman-1988|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 18, 1988|access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref>

In 2002, Rowlands appeared in [[Mira Nair]]'s [[HBO]] movie ''[[Hysterical Blindness (film)|Hysterical Blindness]]'', for which she won her third Emmy. Next year she appeared as Mrs. Hellman an [[Provenance (Numbers)|episode]]  from the [[Numbers (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Numb3rs]]''. She played a Nazi survivor whose whole family was killed. The family owned a painting that the Nazis confiscated. Later on the painting reappeared. The new owner lent the painting to an art gallery in Los Angeles but while on display it was stolen. F.B.I. agent Don Eppes, played by [[Rob Morrow]], tries to figure out what really happened. Rowlands received rave reviews for this role. She has been a spokesperson for people who were persecuted by the Nazis so this role was a perfect match for her. 

She was later seen in ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]'' (2004), which was directed by her son [[Nick Cassavetes]]. The same year, she won her first [[Daytime Emmy]] for her role as Mrs. Evelyn Ritchie in ''The Incredible Mrs. Ritchie''. In 2005, she appeared opposite [[Kate Hudson]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], and [[John Hurt]] in the [[gothic novel|gothic]] thriller ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. 

In 2007, she played a supporting role opposite [[Parker Posey]] and [[Melvil Poupaud]] in ''[[Broken English (2007 film)|Broken English]]'', an independent American feature written and directed by her daughter [[Zoe Cassavetes]]. In 2009, she appeared on an episode of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' ("Mr. Monk and the Lady Next Door"). On March 2, 2010, she appeared on an episode of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as lead character [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]]'s former mother-in-law, who is embroiled in a murder investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/01/16/ncis-gena-rowlands-gibbs-mom-in-law/ |title='NCIS' exclusive: Gena Rowlands unlocks Gibbs' past |last=Ausiello |first=Michael |publisher=The Meredith Corporation |date=16 January 2010 |website=ew.com |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref> In 2014, she starred in the film adaptation of ''[[Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks (film)|Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-six-dance-lessons-in-six-weeks-1201380461/|title = Film Review: 'Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks'|first = Justin|last = Chang|date = 16 December 2014|access-date = 29 September 2016|publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Rowlands was married to [[John Cassavetes]] from April 9, 1954, until his death on February 3, 1989. They met at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts|American Academy]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] where they were both students. They had three children, all actor-directors: [[Nick Cassavetes|Nick]], [[Alexandra Cassavetes|Alexandra]], and [[Zoe Cassavetes|Zoe]]. Rowlands married retired businessman Robert Forrest in 2012.

Rowlands has stated that she was a fan of actress [[Bette Davis]] while growing up.
