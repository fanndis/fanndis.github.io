The '''betel''' (''Piper betle'') is a vine of the family [[Piperaceae]], which includes [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[kava]]. '''Betel leaf''' is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel ''quid'' or in [[paan]], with [[areca nut]] and/or [[tobacco]].

In [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]],  a sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Occasions include greeting elders at wedding ceremonies, celebrating the New Year, and offering payment to [[Ayurvedic]] physicians and astrologers (to whom money and/or [[areca nut]], placed on top of the sheaf of leaves, are offered in thanks for blessings).

The betel plant is an evergreen [[Perennial plant|perennial]], with glossy heart-shaped leaves and white [[catkin]]. The betel plant originated in South and South East Asia.

==Etymology==
[[wikt:betel|Betel]], derived from the ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]/[[Malayalam]]) word vettila, via Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite OED | betel }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Portuguese Vocables in Asiatic Languages: From the Portuguese Original of M S R Dalgado |year=1988 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |location=New Delhi |isbn=812060413X}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
[[File:Arecanutconsum1.PNG|thumb|left|350px|Betel leaf and Areca nut consumption in the world.]]
The betel leaf is cultivated mostly in South and Southeast Asia, from [[Pakistan]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Betel-leaf farming in coastal area|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/33381/betel-leaf-farming-in-coastal-area|accessdate=30 October 2014|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=13 May 2002}}</ref> to [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cassey|first1=Brian|title=Chewing over a betel ban|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/chewing-over-a-betel-ban-20131108-2x6ra.html|accessdate=30 October 2014|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 November 2013}}</ref> It needs a compatible tree or a long pole for support. Betel requires well-drained fertile soil. Waterlogged, [[Soil salinity|saline]] and [[alkali soil]]s are unsuitable for its cultivation.<ref name=LK/>

In Bangladesh, farmers called ''barui''<ref name="barouj">{{cite book |last=Karim |first=ASM Enayet |year=2012 |chapter=Pan1 |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pan1 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> prepare a garden called a ''barouj'' in which to grow betel.  The ''barouj'' is fenced with [[bamboo]] sticks and [[coconut]] leaves. The soil is plowed into furrows of 10 to 15 metres' length, 75 centimetres in width and 75 centimetres' depth. [[Press cake|Oil cakes]], [[manure]], and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the [[topsoil]] of the furrows and [[wood ash]]. The cuttings are planted at the beginning of the [[monsoon]] season.

[[File:Betel Plant.JPG|thumb|Betel Plant cultivation in Bangladesh]]
Proper shade and [[irrigation]] are essential for the successful cultivation of this crop. Betel needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Irrigation is frequent and light, and standing water should not remain for more than half an hour.

Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cow dung slurry is sprinkled. Application of different kinds of leaves at monthly intervals is believed advantageous for the growth of the betel. In three to six months the vines reach 150 to 180 centimeters in height and they will branch. Harvest begins, with the farmer plucking the leaf and its [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] with his right thumb. The harvest lasts 15 days to one month. Betel plant has made its way to research labs of many Bangladesh chemical and food nutrition companies.

The harvested leaves are consumed locally and exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. Betel is grown and cultivated as an important crop in rural Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Usage and cultural significance==
{{Main|Paan}}
The primary use of betel leaf is as a wrapper for the chewing of [[areca nut]] or [[tobacco]], where it is mainly used to add flavour. It may also be used in cooking, usually raw, for its peppery taste. Use of binglang, or betel, has over a 300 year history in areas of China where it was once promoted for medicinal use.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Levin |first1=Dan |title=Despite Risks, an Addictive Treat Fuels a Chinese City |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/world/asia/20hunan.html |accessdate=16 November 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 August 2010}}</ref>

==Health effects==

Some reports may suggest that betel leaf by itself has adverse health effects, in part because of tannins delivered by the leaf and for reasons currently not fully understood.<ref>Morton, J. F. (1992). Widespread tannin intake via stimulants and masticatories, especially guarana, kola nut, betel vine, and accessories (pp. 739–765). Springer USA</ref> For example, one research paper studied<ref name="Doi">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0027-5107(78)90266-X |title=Chromosome-damaging effect of betel leaf |year=1978 |last1=Sadasivan |first1=G. |last2=Rani |first2=Gulab |last3=Kumari |first3=C.Kusuma |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=183–5 |pmid=661839}}</ref> chromosome damaging effect of betel leaf in human leukocyte cultures.

Another scientific study from Japan<ref name="DoiBF">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01964368 |title=Carcinogenicity examination of betel nuts and piper betel leaves |year=1979 |last1=Mori |first1=H. |last2=Matsubara |first2=N. |last3=Ushimaru |first3=Y. |last4=Hirono |first4=I. |journal=Experientia |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=384–5 |pmid=446629|s2cid=30379485 }}</ref> indicates that the lab rats that ate a mixture of betel leaf and areca nuts all had severe thickening of the upper digestive tract, whereas after undergoing a diet of betel leaves alone, only one laboratory rat ended up having a forestomach papilloma.

Betel leaf extract alone has not been shown to cause significant side effects, but there are side effects associated with the use of betel quid.

==Economics==
[[File:পান পাতা.jpg|thumb|Betel in [[Bangladesh]]]]
Betel vines are cultivated throughout southeast Asia in plots whose area is typically 20 to 2000 square metres (0.005 to 0.5 acre).

Malaysian farmers cultivate four types of betel plants: sirih India, sirih Melayu, sirih Cina and sirih Udang. The harvest is then sold in bundles of in leaves, each bundle costing in 2011 between MYR 0.30 to 0.50 ($0.07 to $0.12 per bundle).

In Sri Lanka, betel is grown all over the country but the commercial production of betel, with bigger leaves with dark green colour combined with thickness, known as “kalu bulath” is confined to a few districts such as [[Kurunegala District|Kurunagala]], [[Gampaha District|Gampaha]], [[Kegalle District|Kegalle]], [[Kalutara District|Kalutara]] and [[Colombo District|Colombo]].<ref name=LK>{{cite web |title= Betel – Piper Betle L |author= Government of Sri Lanka |url= http://www.exportagridept.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=159&lang=ta |access-date= 2011-07-31 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160514054345/http://www.exportagridept.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=159&lang=ta |archive-date= 2016-05-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> These are sold at a whole seller in lots of 1000 leaves.

The FAO study found the successful farm's yield to be 18,000 leaves per {{convert|150|sqft|m2}}. The additional salary and income to the Sri Lankan betel grower, assuming he or she provides all needed labor and keeps all net profit, to be SL Rs. 1635 per {{convert|150|sqft|m2}} of betel farm every 6 months ($90 per "[[decimal]]" per year, or $9000 per acre per year). If the farmer hires outside labor to tend the betel vines, and harvest the crop, the FAO found the net income to the betel farm owner to be SL Rs. 735 per {{convert|150|sqft|m2}} of betel farm every six months ($40 per decimal per year, or $4000 per acre per year). According to FAO, the market prices for betel leaves vary with wet and dry season in Sri Lanka, and in 2010 averaged SL Rs. 200–400 per 1000 leaves ($1.82 to $3.64 per 1000 leaves).<ref>{{cite web|title=Life in the hill country of Sri Lanka|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/telefood/telefood-projects/slideshows/life-in-the-hill-country-of-sri-lanka/en/ }}</ref> The FAO study assumes no losses from erratic weather, and no losses during storage and transportation of perishable betel leaves. These losses are usually between 35% to 70%.<ref name=GUHA/>

In Bangladesh, betel leaf farming yields vary by region and vine variety. In one region where betel leaf cultivation is the main source of income for farmers, a total of 2,825 hectares of land is dedicated to betel vine farming.<ref>{{cite news |title= Betel-leaf farming benefiting farmers |url= http://theindependentbd.com/national/48153-betel-leaf-farming-benefiting-farmers.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |date=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315001729/http://theindependentbd.com/national/48153-betel-leaf-farming-benefiting-farmers.html |archive-date=15 March 2012}}</ref> The average production cost for these betel farms in Bangladesh are about Tk 300,000 per hectare ($4000 per hectare, $16 per decimal), and the farm owners can earn a profit of over Tk 100,000 per hectare ($1334 per hectare, $5.34 per decimal).

In India, a 2006 research reported<ref name=GUHA>{{cite journal |author= P.

The betel farming industry, the report claims, supports about 400,000 – 500,000 agricultural families.

A March 2011 report claims that betel farming is on a decline in India.<ref name=CSE1>{{cite web|title= Too costly to grow| publisher= CSE|url = http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/too-costly-grow }}</ref> While in ideal conditions, some farms may gross annual incomes after expenses of over IN Rs. 26,000 per 10 decimal farm ($5,780 per acre), a betel farm income is highly erratic from year to year, because of rainfall patterns, temperature, and spoilage rates of 35% to 70% during transport over poor infrastructure.<ref name= GUHA/> Simultaneously, the demand for betel leaves has been dropping in India because of acceptance of gutkha (chewing tobacco) by consumers over betel leaf-based ‘‘paan’’ preparation;<ref>{{cite web|title= Paan loses flavour|publisher= CSE|url= http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/paan-loses-flavour }}</ref> the report cites betel leaf trading has dropped by 65% from 2000 to 2010, and created an oversupply. As a result, the report claims Indian farmers do not find betel farming lucrative anymore.<ref name=CSE1/>
