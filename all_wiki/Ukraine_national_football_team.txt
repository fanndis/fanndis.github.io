The '''Ukraine national football team''' ({{lang-uk|збірна України з футболу}}) represents [[Ukraine]] in men's international [[Association football|football]] competitions and it is governed by the [[Ukrainian Association of Football]], the governing body for [[football in Ukraine]]. Ukraine's home ground is the [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Olimpiyskiy Stadium]] in [[Kyiv]]. The team has been a full member of [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]] since 1992.

After [[Modern history of Ukraine|Ukrainian Independence]] and the country's breakaway from the [[Soviet Union]], they played their [[1992 Ukraine v Hungary football match|first match]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 29 April 1992. The team's biggest success on the world stage was reaching the quarter-finals in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], which also marked the team's debut in the finals of a major championship.<ref name=UEFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ukr/profile/index.html|title=Member associations - Ukraine - Profile – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>

As the host nation, Ukraine automatically qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].<ref name=UEFA/> Four years later, Ukraine qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] via the play-off route, the first time qualifying for a [[UEFA European Championship]] via the qualifying process, as they finished in third place in their qualifying group. This marked the first time in Ukraine's five play-off appearances that it managed to win such a tie, previously having been unsuccessful in the play-off ties for the [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]].

Ukraine is seen as a specific case of being a successful youth football power in Europe and the world, yet fails to deliver the same taste at senior stage. The [[Ukraine national under-20 football team|U-20 team]] of Ukraine has been the current reigning world champions at the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]], while the [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|U-21 team]] had won silver medal in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]; however in spite of this rich record in youth stage, the senior side didn't have the same level of achievement to look back at. While the Ukrainian senior side managed to reach the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup, the team failed to enter the knockout stages in [[Euro 2012]] and [[Euro 2016]], and have never returned to the World Cup since.

==History==

===Pre-independence (1925–1935)===
Officially the national team of Ukraine, the national team was formed in the early 1990s and shortly after was recognized internationally. It is not widely known, however, that Ukraine previously had a national team in 1925–1935.<ref>[http://ukrainian-football.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2476 The Ukrainian Football National Team of 1925–1935] {{in lang|uk}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ukrsoccerhistory.com/index.aspx?page=nt_before1992 Ukrainian Soccer History website] {{in lang|uk}}</ref> Just like the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] had its own national team.

The earliest record of games it played can be traced back to August 1928. A championship among the national teams of the Soviet republics as well as the [[Moscow]] city team was planned to take place in Moscow. Just before the tournament started, the Ukraine national team played two exhibition games against the [[Red Sports Federation]] team from [[Uruguay]], one in [[Kharkiv]] (lost 1–2) and the other in Moscow (won 3–2). At the All-Soviet tournament, Ukraine played three games and reached the final where it lost to Moscow 0–1. Along the way, Ukraine managed to defeat the national teams of [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] and [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasus]].

In 1929, Ukraine beat the team of [[Lower Austria]] in an exhibition match in [[Kharkiv]], recording a score of 4–1.

In 1931, Ukraine participated in another All-Soviet championship in Moscow. It played only one game, starting from the semifinals. Ukraine lost to the national team of Transcaucasus 0–3 and was eliminated.

In 1986, Ukraine became a winner of [[Football at the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR|association football tournament]] of the [[Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR|Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR]] that was hosted in Ukraine when in final it beat the team of Uzbekistan (Uzbek SSR).

===Official formation===
Prior to Independence in 1991, Ukrainian players represented the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union national team]]. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1991, [[Russia national football team|Russia]] took the place of the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union national team]] in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup. The national team of Ukraine did not manage to enter the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification]] (the draw for the qualification stage was held on 8 December 1991,<ref>New York Times, 8 December 1991, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/sports/soccer-nations-lining-up-for-the-big-drawing.html Nations Lining Up for the Big Drawing]</ref> before Ukraine was admitted to FIFA). Meanwhile, some of the best Ukrainian players of the beginning of the 1990s (including [[Andrei Kanchelskis]], [[Viktor Onopko]], [[Sergei Yuran]], [[Yuriy Nikiforov]], [[Ilya Tsymbalar]] and [[Oleg Salenko]]) chose to play for [[Russia national football team|Russia]], as it was named the official successor of the Soviet Union.<ref name=kmcrossing/> At that time [[Vyacheslav Koloskov]] was the only top official from the former Soviet Union and later the [[Russia]] who served as a vice-president of [[UEFA]] in 1980–1996 and represented all of members of the Soviet Union and later the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].
[[File:Valeri Lobanovsky.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Valeriy Lobanovskyi]], was Head Coach of the National Team in 1979 and between 2001 and 2002]]
The Soviet Union's five-year [[UEFA coefficient]], despite being earned in part by Ukrainian players (for example, in the final of the last successful event, [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], under the direction of [[Valeriy Lobanovskyi|Valery Lobanovsky]], 7 out of starting 11 players were Ukrainians<ref name="squads">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/88e-full.html |title=RSSSF European Championship 1988&nbsp;– Final Tournament&nbsp;– Full Details |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref>), were transferred to the direct descendant of the Soviet national team&nbsp;– the [[Russia national football team|Russia national team]]. As a result, a crisis was created for both the national team and the [[Ukrainian Premier League|domestic league]]. When Ukraine returned to international football in late 1994, it did so as absolute beginners.

Another reason for the occurred harsh crisis in the Ukrainian football was lack of adequate funding of teams.<ref name=kmcrossing/> This is understandable in terms of the general economic crisis that has affected all of the CIS ([[Commonwealth of Independent States]]) countries.<ref name=kmcrossing/> Yet even in contrast with Russia, the Ukrainian teams looked very poor.<ref name=kmcrossing/> However, there also was a reverse influx of some top class players.<ref name=kmcrossing/> [[Viktor Leonenko]] agreed on transfer from [[Dynamo Moscow]] to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].<ref name=kmcrossing/> The Russian club did not want to release him, but Leonenko did not want to continue to play in Moscow.<ref name=kmcrossing/> During his first six months in Kyiv Viktor was forced to miss due to the FIFA disqualification.<ref name=kmcrossing/>

In the following years, the Ukrainian team improved, showcasing talents like [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Anatoliy Tymoshchuk]], [[Serhiy Rebrov]] and [[Oleksandr Shovkovskiy]]. Ukraine, however, failed to qualify for any major tournaments prior to 2006.

===First official games (Prokopenko)===
Soon after being accepted to [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] as a full member in 1992, Ukraine started its preparation for its first game. At first the head coach of the team was planned to be [[Valeriy Lobanovskyi]], but at that time he had a current contract with the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]]. Thus, the first manager of the team had to be chosen among members of a coaching council which consisted of [[Anatoliy Puzach]] (manager of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]), [[Yevhen Kucherevskyi]] ([[FC Dnipro]]), [[Yevhen Lemeshko]] ([[FC Torpedo Zaporizhia|Torpedo Zaporizhya]]), [[Yukhym Shkolnykov]] ([[FSC Bukovyna Chernivtsi|Bukovyna Chernivtsi]]) and [[Viktor Prokopenko]] ([[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]]). Later, they were joined by a native of [[Donetsk]] [[Valeriy Yaremchenko]] ([[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]). At the end a circle of candidates narrowed down only to three names: Puzach, Yaremchenko and Prokopenko, the latter who eventually became the head coach.
[[File:Настя Федоренко. Донецк. Увидеть и полюбить. ФК Шахтер 051.jpg|thumb|left|[[Viktor Prokopenko]], the first manager of the national team]]
For the first game of the team it was agreed to play against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 22 April 1992 in [[Kyiv]] at the [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Republican Stadium]]. Due to financial issues, however, it was rearranged to 29 April and moved to the border with Hungary in [[Uzhhorod]] at the [[Avanhard Stadium (Uzhhorod)|Avanhard Stadium]]. There was almost no preparation to the game as all "pioneers" gathered in Kyiv on 27 April and the next day flew out to Uzhhorod. At the same time, the opponent, while failing to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], was preparing for [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|1994 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. Ukraine at that time failed to be accepted for the qualification cycle.

Unlike the Hungarian squad, players of which played alongside before and were coached by the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]-winning coach [[Emerich Jenei]], the Ukrainian team lost some its better and experienced players to the [[CIS national football team]] that was playing its [[England national football team results (1980–99)#1992|own friendly]] against the [[England national football team]] in Moscow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150726235449/http://www.rusteam.permian.ru/history/1992.html 1992 season of the Russian national football tean]. Rusteam.permian.ru</ref> Among those were Andrei Kanchelskis, [[Volodymyr Lyutyi]], [[Sergei Yuran]], [[Viktor Onopko]], [[Oleksiy Mykhaylychenko]] and [[Akhrik Tsveiba]] (the last two would later represent Ukraine). For the game against Hungary, only [[Ivan Hetsko]] and [[Oleh Luzhny]] had previous experience of playing at international level; other players had only played for the Soviet Olympic football team, while [[Serhiy Kovalets]] played for Ukraine at the Spartakiad of People of the USSR in 1986.

The first home game was lost 1–3 with [[Ivan Hetsko]] becoming the first goalscorer in the history of national team. During the summer of 1992 Prokopenko's team played two more away games on 27 June against the United States (0-0) and on 26 August against Hungary (1-2). After the second loss to Hungary Prokopenko resigned. Leading in its game against Hungary, Ukraine conceded two goals in the final 10 minutes.

To the scheduled against Belarus in [[Minsk]] in the fall, Ukraine had left with Prokopenko's assistants [[Mykola Pavlov]] and [[Leonid Tkachenko (footballer)|Leonid Tkachenko]]. At the [[Dinamo Stadium (Minsk)|Dinamo Stadium]], Ukraine managed to salvage a game by tying one a piece with a goal from [[Yuriy Maksymov]].

===Euro 96 qualification (Bazylevych)===
{{main|UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying Group 4}}

Ukraine, having already suffered from a lack of good players, lost two promising young players during the winter intermission : [[Stepan Betsa]] and [[Oleksiy Sasko]], who perished in a car accident. Unable to secure a contract with [[Valeriy Lobanovskyi]], Ukraine appointed another head coach, former forward of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] [[Oleh Bazylevych]]. He made his debut with the national team in the spring of 1993 in [[Odessa]] during a friendly against [[Israel national football team|Israel]]. Their expected win was cancelled out in a 1–1 draw just 10 minutes before the end by [[Serhiy Konovalov]]. Less than a month later Ukraine finally celebrated its first victory in [[Vilnius]] in an away friendly against Lithuania that resulted in a 1–2 win (goals scored by [[Viktor Leonenko]] and [[Dmytro Mykhaylenko]]). During the summer they played one away game against Croatia, losing 3–1, with a goal scored [[Andriy Husin]] and one of the Croatian goals scored by [[Davor Šuker]]. In October 1993, Ukraine went on their first tour to the United States where they played three games against the US and Mexico. Their game against Mexico in [[San Diego]], resulting in a 1–2 loss, was attended by over 50,000 spectators. During the winter break Ukraine was seeded in [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying#Group 4|Group 4]] of the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] qualification.

In March 1994, Ukraine paid Israel a visit, but lost the game with a single penalty kick. Next there was a home game against Belarus where Ukraine finally won 3-1 after coming from behind at half-time. Just before their first official international competition game which was scheduled to be played against Lithuania at home, they played couple of away games against Bulgaria and the United Arab Emirates which both ended in a 1–1 draw. Another tour was scheduled right afterwards to Lithuania and Korea, the national coached by Kyivan [[Anatoliy Byshovets]]. The opening game on 7 September against Lithuania, considering their last encounter, was expected to end positively, which however resulted in a 0–2 defeat.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161029181244/http://fanat.ua/national/15.html In captivity of emotions and ambitions (В плену у эмоций и амбиций)]. Fanat (from Komanda newspaper).</ref> Both goals were scored within a couple of minutes in the middle of the second half by [[Hamburger SV]] striker [[Valdas Ivanauskas]]. The national team headed off to Korea without Bazylevych and his assistants whom were [[Mykola Pavlov]] and [[Vladimir Muntyan]]. Ukraine played two games and lost both. On 20 September 1994, [[Oleh Bazylevych]] was highly criticized at the federation's coaching meeting but was to be kept in position at the next meeting of the FFU Executive Committee a few days later.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224825/http://fanat.ua/national/17.html From Korea - empty-handed ("supping unsalted") (Из Кореи - не солоно хлебавши)]. Komanda newspaper (by Fanat)</ref> However, the following day Bazylevych resigned accusing [[Viktor Bannikov|Bannikov]] of being tactless. On 24 September 1994, the [[Ukrainian Association of Football|Football Federation of Ukraine]] appointed [[Yozhef Sabo]] as an acting head coach until the end of the year.
[[File:Yozhef Sabo.jpg|thumb|[[Yozhef Sabo]] served as one of temporary managers until appointed of Lobanovsky]]
Following the change of coach, the national team level took a while to improve. Their next home game against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] ended goalless.<ref>[http://fanat.ua/national/18.html Slovenians surprised and got surprised (Словенцы удивили и удивились)]. Komanda newspaper (by Fanat).</ref> After missing to obtain their first recent victory, Ukraine fell to bottom of the tournament table just above [[Estonia national football team|Estonian]], whom they played their next home match against in mid-November, which they needed to win to keep any hopes of qualification alive. The Estonians, who were unable to field their best team, hoped to repeat the Slovenian effort a month earlier.<ref>[http://fanat.ua/national/19.html Premature compliments (Преждевременные комплименты)]. Komanda newspaper (by Fanat)</ref> The game resulted in a 3–0 win. [[Serhiy Konovalov]] scored their first goal at competition level for the national team. Sabo left his post after the game.<ref>[http://fanat.ua/national/20.html Hopes are new, yet result is erstwhile (Надежды новые, результат прежний)]. Komanda newspaper (by Fanat)</ref> and the FFU confirmed [[Anatoliy Konkov]] as the new head coach on 5 January 1995 .
[[File:Oleg Blokhin-ua.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Oleg Blokhin]], head coach at the first World Cup participation in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]]]
In order to save situation and prepare for upcoming games against Italy and Croatia, Konkov conducted training camp at a sports base in [[Stubenberg, Styria]] near the Castle (Schloss) Schielleiten from 16 to 23 March 1995. According to the new head coach the set program of training camp was accomplished successfully. Their away game to Croatia ended in a 0–4 loss in [[Zagreb]], followed by a 0–2 defeat to three times World champions Italy at the [[Olympic Stadium]] (then Respublikanskiy).<ref>[http://fanat.ua/national/21.html To make &#91;necessary&#93; conclusions and &#91;continue&#93; to work (Сделать выводы и работать)]. Komanda newspaper (by Fanat)</ref>

===1998–2004: near misses===
Ukraine participated in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 FIFA World Cup qualification]], where the team was drawn into [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 9|Group 9]]. Ukraine had improved their performance well, and surprised the qualification by taking the second place instead of the more-favored [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], only behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]], thus sent Ukraine to the first ever playoff, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. Unfortunately, Ukraine was eliminated 3–1 after aggregate by Croatia, and missed the chance to qualify for the first ever competitive tournament.

In [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying]], Ukraine, assigned in [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 4|Group 4]], once again managed to top ahead of another favorite, [[Russia national football team|Russia]], thanked for an important draw in [[Moscow]], but still only qualified for playoff despite being undefeated, including two successful goalless draws to then-world champions [[France national football team|France]]. Ukraine then fell to [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 3–2 after aggregate as well, and lost the chance to qualify for the third time. Ukraine's defeat to Slovenia was more tragic, when [[Miran Pavlin]] canceled early Ukrainian lead at home and sealed Slovenia in instead.

The [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2002 FIFA World Cup qualification]] saw Ukraine in [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|Group 5]], and most of Ukraine's opponents were much weaker than Germany and France. Yet, Ukraine suffered a denting home loss to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in their opening account, and a number of draws had hampered Ukrainian hope to process. Ukraine eventually reached the playoff again, but this time could not manage to overcome the old foe, Germany, losing 5–2 on aggregate, and once again missed a major tournament debut.

The [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying]] was perhaps the most humiliating moment of Ukrainian football since its foundation. Assigned into [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 6|Group 6]], Ukraine's only major opponent at the time was a much stronger [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Ukraine had been in comfortable competitive place with Spain, having drawn the Spaniards at home. However, a surprising resurgence from the less known [[Greece national football team|Greece]] had dented any hope for Ukraine, as Ukraine failed to reach playoff for the first time since [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying]] due to Greek resurgence. Greece would go on to conquer the first European title.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
After an unsuccessful [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifying]] campaign, Ukraine appointed [[Oleg Blokhin]] as the national team's head coach. Despite initial skepticism about his appointment due to his previous somewhat undistinguished coaching record and general public calls for a foreign coach; as well as Ukraine's difficult group position, being drawn with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]], the latter had already won the Euro 2004 and caused upset on Ukraine in Euro 2004 qualification, Ukraine went on to qualify for their first-ever [[FIFA World Cup]] on 3 September 2005 after drawing 1–1 against [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] in [[Tbilisi]]. In their first World Cup, in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], they were in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] together with [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. After losing 0–4 in the first match against Spain, the Ukrainians beat their other two opponents to reach the knock-out stage.

In the round of 16, Ukraine played against the winner of [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], who they beat on penalties. In the quarter-finals, they were beaten 0–3 by eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

===2006–2010: disappointment return===
After a successful 2006 World Cup debut, Ukrainian enthusiasm increased for [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. Ukraine was assigned to [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B|Group B]], only this time there was no playoff competition and thus, Ukraine had to seek one of the top two places. However, Ukraine failed to deliver the promised performance, partly because the team was unlucky to be drawn with 2006 World Cup finalists [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[France national football team|France]]; however, Ukraine had also performed terribly against weaker opponents like [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], two shock losses and a draw away to these opponents had effectively ruined Ukraine's hope to qualify for the tournament, finishing in fourth place.

The [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] saw Ukraine regain some good improvement. Drawn in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|Group 6]], two good draws to a strong [[Croatia national football team|Croatian side]] and more importantly, a home win over [[England national football team|England]], sending Ukraine to a playoff for the first time since 2004 Euro qualification. However, Greece, which had been eliminated by Ukraine in the qualifiers four years earlier, would take revenge. Despite successfully drawing goalless in [[Athens]], Ukraine suffered a bitter home defeat to the Greeks in [[Donetsk]], a reply to Ukraine's elimination of Greece back in Athens. This meant Ukraine lost its first ever playoff match at home, and failed to qualify for [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

===UEFA Euro 2012===
{{Main|UEFA Euro 2012 Group D}}

[[File:Ukraine national football team 20120611.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=|Ukraine national football team in 2012]]
As co-hosts, Ukraine qualified automatically for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]],<ref name=UEFA/> marking their debut in the [[UEFA European Championship]]. In their opening game against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], Ukraine won 2–1 in Kyiv. Despite the team's efforts, however, Ukraine was eliminated after a 0–2 loss to [[France national football team|France]] and a 0–1 loss to England, both in Donetsk.

===2014 World Cup qualification&nbsp;– UEFA Group H===
The [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] was acceptable for Ukrainian squad. Being drawn with fellow Euro 2012 host Poland, together with England and the newcomer [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]], Ukraine had to face tough competitors. Despite facing struggles from the Montenegrin side, Ukraine was able to qualify for the playoff, thanked for two wins over Poland and two draws over England, and faced up France. Ukraine beat France at home 2–0, but Ukraine suffered a bitter 0–3 away loss to France, and failed to reach [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

{{main|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;– UEFA Group H}}

===UEFA Euro 2016===
[[File:Ukraine vs Luxembourg 14062015 UEFA EURO 2016 Qualifying round - Group C (6).jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=|Ukraine national football team in 2015]]
In the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifying]] round, Ukraine were drawn against Spain, [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]], Belarus, [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. The ''Zbirna'' was expected to qualify for the tournament as runners-up of the group behind Spain but, despite having won all their other matches, they finished third due to poor results against Spain and Slovakia. They therefore had to face [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in the play-off route (the side to which they had succumbed at the same stage of the 2000 edition) ; they recorded a 2–0 win at [[Lviv]] before forging a 1–1 draw at the very end of the second game.

Ukraine convincingly won all of their preparation friendlies against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]]. At club level, FC Dnipro had recently reached the [[2015 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League final in 2015]], while Shakhtar Donetsk had progressed to the semi-finals [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|one year later]], as the Ukrainian clubs succeeded in sending one participant to the round of 16 of the [[UEFA Champions League]] two times in a row. Having been drawn against [[2014 FIFA World Cup|world champions]] [[Germany national football team|Germany]], Slavic neighbors [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and first-time Euro participants [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], the Ukrainian team was expected to advance at least to the next round.

The tournament however, turned into a dreadful upset. Ukraine lost all of their three games, while also failing to score a single goal. Their first match resulted in a 2–0 loss to Germany, despite good resistance and great chances during an entertaining first half, they eventually came close to levelling the score but were caught on the counterattack at the very end of the game. This was followed by a second 2–0 loss to Northern Ireland, with a goal once again conceded in injury time. The Ukrainian media mainly criticized coach [[Mykhaylo Fomenko]]'s perceived inadequate psychological preparation of the squad as much as predictable tactics which were judged as easy to break down. Ukrainians stars [[Andriy Yarmolenko]] and [[Yevhen Konoplyanka]]'s under-performance was also mentioned. Ukraine at this stage were the first team eliminated from the competition and lost their last game to Poland 1–0.

===2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group I===
Ukraine started off with a home draw to eventual group leaders [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and an away draw to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. This was followed by two home wins, 3–0 against [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]] and 1–0 against [[Finland national football team|Finland]]. Despite a 1–0 away loss to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], they beat Finland 1–2 away and Turkey 2–0 at home. This was followed by a 2–0 away loss to Iceland and a 0–2 away win against Kosovo. Going to the last game, Ukraine stood a strong chance of qualifying for the tournament, but after a 0–2 home loss to Croatia, they failed to qualify for the play-offs for their first time since [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying]]. In their last game against Croatia, controversies rose when Ukrainian and Croatian supporters shared solidarity and chanted Russophobic chants as for the result of [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian aggression in Ukraine]].

===UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying – UEFA Group B===
{{main|UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group B}}Ukraine were placed in a tough group with Euro 2016 title holders Portugal, and Serbia—a side with personnel playing for multiple prominent club teams. According to many sports analysts, Ukraine were tipped to finish third in the group. The first match proved to be the most difficult match—an away game against Portugal. With the well-known centre-back Yaroslav Rakytskiy absent due to his controversial move to Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg and the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the Portuguese lineup after an absent Nations League, the Portuguese were favoured to win by a comfortable margin. However, contrary to popular prediction, Andriy Shevchenko's side proved to be very stubborn. Although the Portuguese controlled the majority of the game's possession, they could not find the back of the net. A heroic showing from goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov as well as persistent marking of Cristiano Ronaldo and the Portuguese attack by Ukraine's defense earned Ukraine a valuable point in Lisbon. The match ended with a 0-0 scoreline.

The second game (4 days after the positive result in Portugal) was away to supposed minnows of the group, Luxembourg. However, this match proved to be an absolute nightmare for the Ukrainians. After struggling to come up with inventive attacks, a very lacklustre Ukrainian side found themselves down 1-0 thanks to a goal from David Turpel, aided by very disorganized defending on the part of the Ukrainians. Right before the end of the first half, Ukraine did find an equalizer through Viktor Tsyhankov. Ukraine struggled to create any meaningful opportunities in a stressful second half. However, with literally the last kick of the ball in stoppage time (from a freekick), Ukraine found themselves extremely lucky and unlikely 2-1 winners when Gerson Rodrigues of Luxembourg headed the ball into his own goal. Therefore, after the first two matchdays, Ukraine found themselves top of the group with 4 points after Portugal and Serbia played a 1-1 match in Lisbon on the same day.

Matchday 3 came with a stiff test—a home match against a well-rounded and versatile Serbian squad boasting many experienced and skillful players from multiple world-renowned clubs. While it was expected to be a reasonably close match, it could not have been more of a rout. What appeared to be a well balanced and close affair within the opening exchanges of the first half quickly changed when Viktor Tsyhankov scored the opening goal in the 26th minute of play. The second goal (also by Tsyhankov) was scored from a thunderous strike from long range less than two minutes later. Ukraine went on to win the match 5–0 with Roman Yaremchuk achieving his first ever international goal and Konoplyanka helping himself to two goals. At this point, with positive results against the two supposedly strongest opponents in the groups, Ukraine looked as though they could secure a top two finish and avoid the play-offs.

After another stiff contest with Luxembourg, Ukraine managed to secure a 1–0 victory only three days after their triumph over Serbia. The goal came in the 6th minute from Roman Yaremchuk. Two matches—away and home against Lithuania (winning 3-0 and 2-0 respectively) saw Ukraine with 16 points and in need of only a point against Fernando Santos's Portuguese side, who at this point were crowned UEFA Nations League Champions.

The match against Portugal was expected to be an interesting test for Shevchenko's men, who had not lost a single match in qualifying and had only conceded once. Ukraine started brightly with noticeably more attacking intent than in the previous meeting between these two teams. Indeed, their pressure paid off when Roman Yaremchuk scored from close range after an initial save from Rui Patricio on 6 minutes. In the 27th minute, Ukraine doubled their advantage with a Yarmolenko goal. After building this comfortable lead, Ukraine began to sit back and defend as they did in Lisbon on matchday one. Portugal was once again unable to crack Ukraine's defense. However, in the 72nd minute, Cristiano Ronaldo was awarded a penalty kick from a supposed hand-ball by Taras Stepanenko as he blocked the ball from a Portuguese shot. While VAR was not an option, replays showed that this was an incorrect call from the referee, as the ball was blocked by Stepanenko's leg, before making contact with his arm as it deflected into the air. This incident also resulted in a red card for Stepanenko. Thus, Ukraine had to play the rest of the match with ten men. Ronaldo scored from the spot, giving Portugal a glimmer of hope to rescue the game and earn a valid point in Kyiv. However, it wasn't to be Portugal's night. Ukraine won 2-1 and subsequently won the group.

The last match was played in Belgrade against Serbia. Because Ukraine had already qualified and won the group, Shevchenko decided to field a team with a few less experienced players. Serbia on the other hand, had to win for any hopes of automatic qualification. Serbia took the lead early through a Dušan Tadić penalty kick. After controlling the majority of the match after falling behind, Ukraine found an equaliser through the inevitable Yaremchuk. Serbia took control of the second half and restored their lead thanks to a beautiful Alexander Mitrović finish. Serbia continued to search for another goal with multiple chances. However, in the last minute of stoppage time, Yarmolenko sent a low cross across the Serbian goal which was received by Artem Biesiedin and finished into the bottom corner. The match ended 2-2 and Ukraine accomplished a successful qualification campaign without a single loss. With Portugal beating Luxembourg 2–0, Serbia's hopes of direct qualification were shot.

===2020–21 UEFA Nations League===
Ukraine was drawn with the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in League A. Although being in a difficult group, Ukraine however is believed to be a stubborn opponent, given how Ukraine impressed in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. The Ukrainians started their campaign by overcoming Switzerland at home 2–1 to temporarily take the first place. However, Ukraine's next opponent, Spain, proved to be too strong, and Ukraine was unable to produce any significant threat and lost 0–4 to the Iberian giant. In October, Ukraine returned home to play two subsequent games against Germany and Spain, with nearly half of the main squad was infected with [[COVID-19]] or injuries. The first match against Germany saw a disastrous performance of [[Heorhiy Bushchan]], as his mistakes handled Germany a 2–1 win in [[Kyiv]]. With a demoralized squad, Ukraine had to face a powerful Spain who was impressing in the Nations League. However, despite significant absence of main key members due to injuries and COVID-19, Ukraine shocked by beating Spain for the first time with a 1–0 win to end Spain's 13 games undefeated streak. In November, Ukraine had two important games in order to survive in the League, and their first game against Germany away saw Ukraine got an early lead, but it was to be in vain when the Germans bounded back to win 3–1. Yet, as COVID-19 crisis in Ukraine worsened, eight players of the initial Ukrainian squad had been infected (including one positive [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]] test upon arrival to [[Lucerne]]), and as a result, the entire delegation was put into quarantine by the Department of Health of the [[Canton of Lucerne]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Hlyvynskyi |first=Oleksandr |url=https://en.uaf.ua/article/40745 |title=Official: League of Nations game Switzerland - Ukraine canceled - Official site of the Ukrainian Football Association |work=[[Ukrainian Association of Football]] |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=17 November 2020 }}</ref> As for the result, their game against Switzerland away as originally scheduled, was cancelled, and the matter had been put into question. Ukraine faces relegation if the game is awarded 3–0 to Switzerland or if the result is decided by a drawing of lots and Switzerland gets a 1–0 victory. Eventually, UEFA decided that the result was awarded 3–0 to Switzerland, meaning that Ukraine had been officially relegated after just a season in League A.
