She has served as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] since 2009, and was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 2007 to 2009.

Born and raised in upstate New York, Gillibrand graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] and from the [[UCLA School of Law]]. After holding positions in government and private practice and working on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[2000 United States Senate election in New York|2000 U.S. Senate campaign]], Gillibrand was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2006. She represented [[New York's 20th congressional district]], a conservative district in upstate New York, and was re-elected in 2008.

Following Senator [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]]'s appointment as [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in 2009, Governor [[David Paterson]] selected Gillibrand to fill the Senate seat that had been vacated by Clinton, which made her New York's second female Senator. Gillibrand won a [[United States Senate special election in New York, 2010|special election in 2010]] to keep the seat, and was re-elected to full terms [[United States Senate election in New York, 2012|in 2012]] and [[United States Senate election in New York, 2018|2018]]. During her Senate tenure, Gillibrand has shifted to the left.

She supports [[paid family leave]], a federal [[Job guarantee|jobs guarantee]], and the abolition and replacement of the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].

Gillibrand [[#2020 presidential campaign|was a candidate]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] for [[President of the United States]] in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], following an official campaign announcement on March 17, 2019.

==Law career==

===Private practice===
In 1991, Gillibrand joined the [[Manhattan]]-based law firm [[Davis Polk & Wardwell]] as an associate.<ref name=vogue>{{cite journal |title=In Hillary's Footsteps: Kirsten Gillibrand |last=Van Meter |first=Jonathan |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |journal=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |date=November 2010 |access-date=January 26, 2011 |url=http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/in-hillarys-footsteps-kirsten-gillibrand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106223839/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/in-hillarys-footsteps-kirsten-gillibrand/ |archive-date=January 6, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In 1992, she took a leave from Davis Polk to serve as a [[Law clerk (United States)|law clerk]] to Judge [[Roger Miner]] on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in Albany.<ref name=rodrick/><ref name=mcshane>{{cite news |title=Who is Kirsten Gillibrand?

Gillibrand's tenure at Davis Polk included serving as a defense attorney for tobacco company [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] during major [[tobacco litigation|litigation]], including both civil lawsuits and [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] criminal and civil [[racketeering]] and [[perjury]] probes.<ref name="tobacco"/> As a junior associate in the mid-1990s, Gillibrand defended the company's executives against a criminal investigation into whether they had committed perjury in their testimony before Congress when they claimed that they had no knowledge of a connection between tobacco smoking and cancer. Gillibrand worked closely on the case and became a key part of the defense team.<ref name="tobacco"/> As part of her work, she traveled to the company's laboratory in Germany, where she interviewed scientists about the company's alleged research into the connection. The inquiry was dropped and it was during this time that she became a senior associate.<ref name="Tobacco controversy"/><ref name="tobacco"/>

While working at Davis Polk, Gillibrand became involved in—and later the leader of—the Women's Leadership Forum, a program of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Gillibrand states that a speech to the group by [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]] inspired her:
"{{bracket|Clinton}} was trying to encourage us to become more active in politics and she said, 'If you leave all the decision-making to others, you might not like what they do, and you will have no one but yourself to blame.' It was such a challenge to the women in the room. And it really hit me: She's talking to me."<ref name="vogue" />

In 2001, Gillibrand became a partner in the Manhattan office of [[Boies, Schiller & Flexner]]. In 2002 she informed Boies of her interest in running for office and was permitted to transfer to the firm's Albany office. She left Boies in 2005 to begin her 2006 campaign for Congress.<ref name="rodrick" /><ref name="tobacco"/>

===Public interest and government service===
Gillibrand has said her work at private law firms allowed her to take on ''[[pro bono]]'' cases defending [[Domestic abuse|abused women]] and their children and tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.<ref name="rodrick" /> Following her time at Davis Polk, Gillibrand served as Special Counsel to [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) [[Andrew Cuomo]] during the last year of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].<ref name="powell" /> Gillibrand worked on HUD's Labor Initiative and its New Markets Initiative, as well as on TAP's Young Leaders of the American Democracy, and strengthening [[Davis–Bacon Act]] enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Kirsten Gillibrand |publisher=Dartmouth College Office of Alumni Relations |access-date=May 8, 2011 |url=http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/events/Celebrating35YearsofWomenatDartmouth/SpeakerList/KirstenGillibrand |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707084038/http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/events/Celebrating35YearsofWomenatDartmouth/SpeakerList/KirstenGillibrand |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In 1999, Gillibrand began working on Hillary Clinton's [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|2000 U.S. Senate campaign]], focusing on campaigning to young women and encouraging them to join the effort. Many of those women later worked on Gillibrand's campaigns.<ref name=tumulty/> Gillibrand and Clinton became close during the election, with Clinton becoming something of a mentor to the young attorney.<ref name=rodrick/> Gillibrand donated more than $12,000 to Clinton's Senate campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaign Contributions: Kirsten Gillibrand |publisher=newsmeat.com |date=January 31, 2011 |access-date=February 7, 2011 |url=http://www.newsmeat.com/washington_political_donations/Kirsten_Gillibrand.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622084918/http://www.newsmeat.com/washington_political_donations/Kirsten_Gillibrand.php |archive-date=June 22, 2011 }}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

====2006====
{{Main|2006 New York's 20th congressional district election}}
Gillibrand considered running for office in 2004, in [[New York's 20th congressional district]], against the three-term Republican incumbent [[John E. Sweeney]]. However, Hillary Clinton believed circumstances would be more favorable in 2006 and advised her to wait until then.<ref name=rodrick/> Traditionally conservative, the district and its electoral offices had been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1913, and as of November 2006, 197,473 voters in the district were registered Republicans while 82,737 were registered Democrats.<ref>{{cite web |title=NYSVoter Enrollment Statistics by District |publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]] |page=5 |url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/congress/congress_nov06.pdf |date = November 1, 2006 |access-date =February 2, 2011}}</ref> Sweeney said in 2006 that "no Republican can ever lose" {{bracket|the district}}.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Murphy's Law: One Democrat's defeat explains how the party lost the House |last=Romano |first=Andrew |journal=[[Newsweek]] |publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/11/03/the-anatomy-of-one-democrat-s-loss.html# |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=November 14, 2010}}</ref> Using New York's [[electoral fusion]] election laws, Gillibrand ran in 2006 on both the Democratic and [[Working Families Party|Working Families]] lines; in addition to having the Republican nomination, Sweeney was endorsed by the [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] parties.<ref name=2006results/>

During the campaign, Gillibrand got support from other Democratic Party politicians. [[Mike McNulty]], a Democratic Congressman from the neighboring [[New York's 21st congressional district|21st congressional district]], campaigned for her, as did both Hillary and [[Bill Clinton]]; the former president appeared twice at campaign events.<ref name=obrien20061109>{{cite news |title=Gillibrand Brings Clout to House |first=Tim |last=O'Brien |work=Times Union |location=Albany |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |page=B1 |date=November 9, 2006 |access-date=February 2, 2011 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6367342}}</ref> Both parties poured millions of dollars into the respective campaigns.<ref>{{cite web |title=Congressional Elections: New York's 20th Congressional District 2006 Election, Total Raised and Spent |publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] (opensecrets.org) |date=August 20, 2007 |access-date=February 2, 2011 |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2006&id=NY20}}</ref>

Many saw Gillibrand as moderate or conservative. ''[[The American Conservative]]'' stated after her eventual victory, "Gillibrand won her upstate New York district by running to the right: she campaigned against amnesty for illegal immigrants, promised to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, and pledged to protect gun rights."<ref name="dougherty">{{cite news |title=Rebranding Gillibrand |last=Dougherty |first=Michael Brendan |work=[[The American Conservative]] |publisher=[[Ron Unz]] |date=April 6, 2009 |access-date=February 20, 2019 |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/rebranding-gillibrand/}}</ref>

Gillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was an issue during the campaign. Her [[Campaign finance in the United States#Disclosure|campaign finance records]] showed that she received $23,200 in contributions from the company's employees during her 2006 campaign for Congress.<ref name="Tobacco controversy">{{cite web|last=Odato|first=James|title=Gillibrand's tobacco past includes Philip Morris|url=http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=729940&TextPage=1|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|work=[[Albany Times-Union]]|date=October 16, 2008|access-date=January 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022144730/http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=729940|archive-date=October 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The probable turning point in the election was the November 1 release of a December 2005 police report detailing a [[9-1-1|9-1-1 call]] by Sweeney's wife, in which she claimed Sweeney was "knocking her around the house." The Sweeney campaign claimed the police report was false and promised to have the official report released by [[New York State Police|State Police]], but did not do so.<ref name=obrien20061109/> The Sweeney campaign did release an ad in which Sweeney's wife initially described Gillibrand's campaign as "a disgrace."<ref>{{cite news |title=John & Gayle Sweeney Stand Side-By-Side, Firing Back |publisher=[[WTEN]] |date=November 2009 |access-date=February 2, 2011 |url=http://www.wten.com/Global/story.asp?s=5622725 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718122142/http://www.wten.com/Global/story.asp?s=5622725 |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several months later, Sweeney's wife said her "disgrace" statement was coerced, and that her husband was physically abusive.<ref name="Gurnett">{{cite web

====2008====

Following Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about possible 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, director of the Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat would be difficult for Gillibrand to hold in 2008, noting Republicans substantially outnumbered Democrats in the district.<ref name=obrien20061109/>

Gillibrand won her bid for reelection in 2008 over former [[Secretary of State of New York|New York Secretary of State]] [[Sandy Treadwell]] by a 62% to 38% margin.<ref>{{cite web |title=2008 Election Results |publisher=New York State Board of Elections |date=December 4, 2008 |access-date=January 26, 2011 |url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/2008ElectionResults.html}}</ref> Treadwell lost by that margin despite significantly outspending Gillibrand and promising never to vote to raise taxes, not to accept a federal salary, and to limit himself to three terms in office.<ref name="hornbeck20081105">{{cite news |title=Gillibrand is Repeat Winner |last=Hornbeck |first=Leigh |work=Times Union |location=Albany |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |date=November 5, 2008 |access-date=February 2, 2011 |page=A13 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=7147108}}</ref> Campaign expenditures were the second highest in the nation for a House race.<ref>[http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2008/oct/28/1028_treadwell/ Gillibrand, Treadwell spending millions], ''The Daily Gazette'' (Schenectady, NY) October 28, 2006.

Upon taking office, Gillibrand joined the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a group of moderate to conservative Democrats.

After taking office, Gillibrand became the first member of Congress to publish her official schedule, listing everyone she met with on a given day. She also published earmark requests she received and her personal financial statement.

Governor [[David Paterson]]'s selection process began with a number of prominent names and high-profile New York Democrats, including [[Andrew Cuomo]], [[Fran Drescher]] and [[Caroline Kennedy]], vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion.
