=== Construction methods ===

When the [[Early history of the IRT subway|IRT subway]] debuted in 1904,<ref name="HISTORY.com 1904" /><ref name=":5" /> the typical tunnel construction method was [[cut-and-cover]].<ref name="Construction">{{cite web |title=www.nycsubway.org: The New York Subway: Chapter 02, Types and Methods of Construction |website=www.nycsubway.org |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_New_York_Subway:_Chapter_02,_Types_and_Methods_of_Construction |accessdate=November 1, 2015}}</ref> The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above.<ref name="Construction" /> Traffic on the street above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-it-was-faster-to-build-subways-in-1900|title=Why It Was Faster To Build Subways in 1900|date=October 22, 2015|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref> Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Design_and_Construction_of_the_IRT:_Civil_Engineering_(Scott)|title=www.nycsubway.org: Design and Construction of the IRT: Civil Engineering (Scott)|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

Contractors in this type of construction faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and groundwater, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/05/04/subway-construction-then-now|title=Subway Construction: Then and Now|website=The New York Public Library|access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

This method worked well for digging soft dirt and gravel near the street surface.<ref name="Construction" /> [[Tunnelling shield]]s were required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and [[East River]] tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]; 116th to 120th Streets under [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]; 145th to [[Dyckman Street]]s (Fort George) under Broadway and [[St. Nicholas Avenue]]; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and [[Lenox Avenue]].<ref name="Construction" />

Since the [[Early history of the IRT subway|opening]] of the original New York City Subway line in 1904,<ref name="HISTORY.com 1904" /><ref name=":5" /> various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. One of the more expansive proposals was the "[[Independent Subway System|IND]] Second System", part of a plan to construct new subway lines in addition to taking over existing subway lines and railroad rights-of-way. The most grandiose IND Second Subway plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND, and was to comprise almost {{frac|1|3}} of the current subway system.<ref name=NYTimes-OurGreatSubway-IND2ndSystem-1929/><ref name="1929-SubwayPlan">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070408_SUBWAY_DOCS/19290916_subway_doc.pdf |title=100 Miles of Subway in New City Project; 52 of them in Queens |date=September 16, 1929 |accessdate=March 25, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included within the plan, which was ultimately never carried out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanshnookenraggen.com/_index/2010/02/the-futurenycsubway-the-ind-second-system/ |title=The futureNYCSubway: The IND Second System |website=vanshnookenraggen |language=en-US|access-date=March 13, 2016|date=February 2010 }}</ref><ref name="nycsubway2">nycsubway.org – [http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/History_of_the_Independent_Subway History of the Independent Subway]</ref> Many different plans were proposed over the years of the subway's existence, but expansion of the subway system mostly stopped during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2012/jan/03/blog-new-yorks-lost-subways |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809093852/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2012/jan/03/blog-new-yorks-lost-subways |archive-date=August 9, 2013 |title=Lost Subways: Abandoned Stations and Unbuilt Lines |date=January 3, 2012|access-date = February 10, 2016 |website=wnyc.org |last=O'Grade |first=Jim}}</ref>

Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the [[History of the Second Avenue Subway|proposals for the Second Avenue Subway]].

Many rapid transit systems run relatively static routings, so that a train "line" is more or less synonymous with a train "route". In New York City, routings change often, for various reasons. Within the [[New York City Subway nomenclature|nomenclature of the subway]], the "line" describes the physical railroad track or series of tracks that a train "route" uses on its way from one terminal to another. "Routes" (also called "services") are distinguished by a letter or a number and "Lines" have names. Trains display their route designation.<ref name=MTA-HowtoRideSubway/>

There are [[List of New York City Subway services|{{NYCS const|routes}} train services]] in the subway system, including [[S (New York City Subway service)|three short shuttles]]. Each route has a color and a local or express designation representing the Manhattan trunk line of the particular service.<ref>{{YouTube|yZ83UhBJFP0|Subway Colors and Names}} MTA YouTube Web Page.

The design of the subway map by [[Massimo Vignelli]], published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-mostly-true-story-of-helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway?pp=1 |title=The (Mostly) True Story of Helvetica and the New York City Subway |work=[[AIGA]] |date=November 18, 2008 |publisher=aiga.org |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Hertz-Gothamist">{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Hogarty |url=http://gothamist.com/2007/08/03/michael_hertz_d.php |title=Michael Hertz, Designer of the NYC Subway Map |work=[[Gothamist]] |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818012400/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/03/michael_hertz_d.php |archive-date=August 18, 2009}}</ref>

With the many different lines in the system, one platform often serves more than one service. Passengers need to look at the overhead signs to see which trains stop there and when, and at the arriving train to identify it.<ref name=MTA-HowtoRideSubway/>

There are a number of common platform configurations. On a double track line, a station may have one [[island platform|center island platform]] used for trains in both directions, or two [[side platform]]s, one for each direction. For lines with three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side platforms and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for each direction. Each island platform provides a [[cross-platform interchange]] between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.<ref name=MTA-HowtoRideSubway/>

Since the majority of the system was built before 1990, the year the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) went into effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be handicapped-accessible.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150608/bushwick/map-subway-map-showing-only-wheelchair-accessible-stations| title = Map Reveals Shortage of Wheelchair-Accessible NYC Subway Stations| website = DNAinfo New York| access-date = February 28, 2016| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306224732/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150608/bushwick/map-subway-map-showing-only-wheelchair-accessible-stations| archive-date = March 6, 2016| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA.

In addition, the MTA identified "key stations", high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated.

== Fares ==
{{Main|New York City transit fares}}

Riders pay a single fare to enter the subway system and may transfer between trains at no extra cost until they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their [[MetroCard]] or tap a contactless payment card or smartphone on an [[OMNY]] reader upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=MTA/New York City Transit – Fares and MetroCard |url=http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm |website=web.mta.info|access-date = February 10, 2016}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, the MTA has started several projects to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] to use [[communications-based train control]], utilizing a [[moving block]] signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/nyregion/14subway.html | title = Subways Run by Computers Start on L Line This Summer | accessdate = May 24, 2007 | first=Sewell | last=Chan | author-link=Sewell Chan | date = January 14, 2005 | newspaper = The New York Times}}</ref> After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/pdf/CP/NeedsAssessment.pdf |title=Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment |website=mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date=August 2009|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capital/sas_docs/feis/chapter02.pdf#page=4 |title=Chapter 2: Project Alternatives|page=4|website=mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref> As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing sections of lines during weekday nights in 2012,

=== Signaling ===
{{Main|Signaling of the New York City Subway}}
Signaling has evolved during a century of operation, and MTA uses a mixture of old and new systems. Most routes use [[block signaling]] but a few routes are also being retrofitted with [[communications-based train control]] (CBTC), which would allow trains to run without conductor input.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjx3S3UjmnA|title=CBTC: Communications-Based Train Control|date=July 20, 2015|author=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|type=video|language=en-US|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=April 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name=rpa-signals/>

==== Wayside block signaling ====
[[File:34 St-Hudson Yards Station (21389427245).jpg|thumb|Example of a wayside block signal at the [[34th Street–Hudson Yards (IRT Flushing Line)|34th Street–Hudson Yards]] station]]

The system currently uses [[automatic block signaling]] with fixed wayside signals and automatic [[train stop]]s in order to provide safe train operation across the whole system.<ref name="rpa-signals">{{cite web|url=http://library.rpa.org/pdf/RPA-Moving-Forward.pdf

 |website=rpa.org|publisher=[[Regional Plan Association]]|date=May 2014|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref> The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its first line opened, and many portions of the current signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s. These signals work by preventing trains from entering a "block" occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are {{convert|1000|ft}} long.<ref name=":10">{{cite web| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/why-dont-we-know-where-all-the-trains-are/415152/

The signals do not register a train's speed, nor where in the block the train is located.<ref name="RPA-Moving Forward">{{cite web | url=http://library.rpa.org/pdf/RPA-Moving-Forward.pdf

Subway trains are stopped mechanically at all signals showing "stop". Although this is a simple principle of [[train protection system|train stops]], that wayside trippers must not be moved to trip ("stop") position until the train has fully passed.<ref name=":10" /><ref name="Trip Stop">{{cite web |title=www.nycsubway.org: Subway Signals: Train Stops

==== Communications-based train control ====
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began automating the subway by installing CBTC, which supplements rather than replaces the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate more closely together with lower [[headway]]s. The [[BMT Canarsie Line]], on which the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}} runs, was chosen for pilot testing because it is a self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/communications/mta-l-line-trains-go-to-full-cbtc.html|title=MTA L Line trains go to full CBTC|first=William C. |last=Vantuono|website=www.railwayage.com|access-date=March 13, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314063159/http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/communications/mta-l-line-trains-go-to-full-cbtc.html|archive-date=March 14, 2016|date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system.<ref name="neuman-May22">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/nyregion/22subway.html |title=For Less Crowding on L Train, Think 2010, Report Says |accessdate=May 24, 2007 |first=William |last=Neuman |date=May 22, 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> The total cost of the project was $340&nbsp;million.<ref name=":10" />

=== Train accidents ===
{{Main|History of the New York City Subway#Accidents|l1=New York City Subway accidents}}
Despite the signal system, there have been at least 64 major train accidents since 1918, when a train bound for [[South Ferry (IRT elevated station)|South Ferry]] smashed into two trains halted near [[Jackson Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Jackson Avenue]] on the [[IRT White Plains Road Line]] in the Bronx.<ref name="Accidents">{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/faq/accidents.html |title=NYC Subway accidents |publisher=nycsubway.org |year=2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2009}}</ref> Several accidents resulted when the train operator ran through red signals and rear-ended the subway train in front of it; this resulted from the signaling practice of "keying by", which allowed train operators to bypass red signals. The deadliest accident, the [[Malbone Street Wreck]], occurred on November 1, 1918 beneath the intersection of [[Flatbush Avenue]], [[Ocean Avenue (Brooklyn)|Ocean Avenue]], and Malbone Street (the latter of which is now Empire Boulevard) near the [[Prospect Park (BMT Brighton Line)|Prospect Park]] station of the then-BRT [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Line]] in Brooklyn, killing 93 people.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Mayor to Begin B.R.T Inquiry Today |newspaper=The New York Times |page=24 |date=November 1, 1918 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/11/04/97041214.pdf |accessdate=December 12, 2009 }}</ref> As a result of accidents, especially more recent ones such as the 1995 Williamsburg Bridge crash, timer signals were installed. These signals have resulted in reduced speeds across the system. Accidents such as [[derailment]]s are also due to broken equipment, such as the rails and the train itself.<ref name="Accidents"/>

====Terrorism prevention====
{{See also|New York City Transit Police}}

On July 22, 2005, in response to [[July 2005 London bombings|bombings in London]], the [[New York City Transit Police]] introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of [[racial profiling]] would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD has come under fire from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of [[threat assessment]] would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the [[NYCLU]], stated, "This NYPD bag search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches in a way that does not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/police/searchseizure/20054prs20050804.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union : NYCLU Sues New York City Over Subway Bag Search Policy |date=November 1, 2009 |access-date=March 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101150005/http://www.aclu.org/police/searchseizure/20054prs20050804.html |archive-date=November 1, 2009 }}</ref> The searches were upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in ''MacWade v.

In November 2017, ''The New York Times'' published its investigation into the crisis. It found that the crisis had arisen as a result of financially unsound decisions by local and state politicians from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties. According to the ''Times'', these decisions included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians' other interventions. By this time, the subway's 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities' transit systems, and every non-shuttle subway route's on-time performance had declined in the previous ten years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html|title=How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York's Subways|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Brian M.|date=November 18, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 18, 2017|last2=Fitzsimmons|first2=Emma G.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=LaForgia|first3=Michael}}</ref>

By early 2016, delays as a result of overcrowding were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be on the edge of the platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. The MTA is considering [[platform screen doors]], which exist on the [[AirTrain JFK]] to prevent passengers falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/nyregion/surge-in-ridership-pushes-new-york-subway-to-limit.html|title=Surge in Ridership Pushes New York Subway to Limit|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=May 3, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref>

==== Expanding service frequency via CBTC ====
{{further|Signaling of the New York City Subway#Automation}}
The [[Second Avenue Subway]], which has provisions for [[communications-based train control]] (CBTC), was built to relieve pressure on the Lexington Avenue Line ({{NYCS trains|Lexington}}) by shifting an estimated 225,000 passengers.<ref name=":4">{{cite web| url = https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/mta-one-day-625-delays.html| title = How a Single Mechanical Failure Sparked 625 MTA Delays| website = Daily Intelligencer| access-date = February 29, 2016| date = February 23, 2016}}</ref> In addition, CBTC installation on the [[IRT Flushing Line|Flushing Line]] is expected to increase the rate of trains per hour on the {{NYCS trains|Flushing}}, but little relief will come to other crowded lines until later.

The MTA is also seeking to implement CBTC on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. CBTC is to be installed on this line in five phases, with phase one ([[50th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|50th Street/8th Avenue]] and [[47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center]] to [[Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike]]) being included in the 2010–2014 capital budget. The $205.8&nbsp;million contract for the installment of phase one was awarded in 2015 to [[Siemens]] and [[Thales Group|Thales]]. Planning for phase one started in 2015, with major engineering work to follow in 2017.<ref name="MTA-CBTC-July2015">{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/news-cbtc-new-york-city-transit-subway-l-7/2015/07/20/2058m-contracts-approved-install |title=MTA – news – $205.8M in Contracts Approved to Install Communications-Based Train Control System |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="MTA-CapitalOversight-July2015">{{cite web|title=Capital Program Oversight Committee Meeting: July 2015|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/150720_1345_CPOC.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906021415/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/150720_1345_CPOC.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 6, 2015|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 11, 2015|location=[[New York City]]|date=July 2015}}</ref> The total cost for the entire Queens Boulevard Line is estimated at over $900&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.info/mta/pdf/2010-14questions_and_answers_v2.pdf |title=MTA 2010–2014 Capital Program Questions and Answers |website=mta.info |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |access-date=March 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302010603/http://mta.info/mta/pdf/2010-14questions_and_answers_v2.pdf |archive-date=March 2, 2012 }}</ref> The Queens Boulevard CBTC project is expected to be completed in 2021.<ref name=":12" /> Funding for CBTC on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] is also provided in the 2015–2019 capital project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/capital/pdf/TYN2015-2034.pdf|title=MTA Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment 2015–2034|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=March 18, 2016}}</ref> The MTA projects that 355 miles of track will receive CBTC signals by 2029, including most of the IND, as well as the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] and the [[BMT Broadway Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/pdf/CP/NeedsAssessment.pdf|title=Twenty Year Capital Needs Assessment 2010–2029|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=March 18, 2016}}</ref> The MTA also is planning to install CBTC equipment on the [[IND Crosstown Line]], the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] and the [[BMT Brighton Line]] before 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capconstr/sas/documents/feis/chapter02.pdf |title=Second Avenue Subway FEIS Chapter 2 |website=mta.info |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |access-date=March 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409063322/http://web.mta.info/capconstr/sas/documents/feis/chapter02.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2014 }}</ref> As part of the installation of CBTC, the whole fleet of subway cars needs to be remodeled or replaced.<ref name=":4" />

==== Service frequency and car capacity ====
Due to an increase of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. This increase will not likely keep up with the growth of subway ridership.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2015/10/26/mta-service-bump-next-june-wont-keep-up-with-growth-in-subway-trips/

==== Platform crowd control ====
The MTA is also testing smaller ideas on some services. Starting in late 2015, 100 "station platform controllers" were deployed for the [[F (New York City Subway service)|F]], [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6]], and [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7]] trains, to manage the flow of passengers on and off crowded trains during morning rush hours. There were a total of 129 such employees, who also answer passengers' questions about subway directions, rather than having conductors answer them and thus delaying the trains.<ref>{{Citation|last=mtainfo

In systems like the [[London Underground]], stations are simply closed off when they are overcrowded, such as the busy [[Oxford Circus tube station]], which had to close more than 100 times in a year. That type of restriction is not necessary yet on the New York City Subway, according to MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz.<ref name=":3" />

Despite these improvements, the transit system continues to experience flooding problems.

In addition, as part of a $130&nbsp;million and an estimated 18-month project, the MTA began installing new subway grates in September 2008 in an attempt to prevent rain from overflowing into the subway system. The metallic structures, designed with the help of architectural firms and meant as a piece of public art, are placed atop existing grates but with a {{convert|3|to|4|in|mm|adj=on}} sleeve to prevent debris and rain from flooding the subway. The racks will at first be installed in the three most flood-prone areas as determined by hydrologists: [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], [[Tribeca]], and the [[Upper West Side]]. Each neighborhood has its own distinct design, some featuring a wave-like deck which increases in height and features seating (as in Jamaica), others with a flatter deck that includes seating and a bike rack.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dunlap |first=David W. |title=New Subway Grates Add Aesthetics to Flood Protection |work=The New York Times |date=September 19, 2008 |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/new-subway-grates-add-aesthetics-to-flood-protection/ |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Jennifer |title=Three in One – Flood Protection, Benches and Bike Parking |work=The New York Times |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/three-in-one-flood-protection-benches-and-bike-parking-in-a-new-design/ |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://secondavenuesagas.com/2010/04/16/new-raised-storm-grates-earn-architectural-praise/|title=New raised storm grates earn architectural praise|website=Second Ave. Sagas|access-date=March 13, 2016|date=April 16, 2010}}</ref>

For the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change that is going to be made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.<ref name="Marshall 2016">{{Cite journal | last=Marshall | first=Aarian | title=Get Ready for Quieter NYC Subway Stations (Yes, It's Possible) | journal=WIRED | date=June 16, 2016 | url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/get-ready-quieter-nyc-subway-stations-yes-possible/ | accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>

=== Subway Series ===
{{main|Subway Series}}

Subway Series is a term applied to any series of baseball games between New York City teams, as opposing teams can travel to compete merely by using the subway system. Subway Series is a term long used in New York, going back to series between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] or [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] and the [[New York Yankees]] in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the term is used to describe the [[Mets–Yankees rivalry|rivalry]] between the Yankees and the [[New York Mets]]. During the [[2000 World Series]], cars on the [[4 (New York City Subway service)|4 train]] (which stopped at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]) were painted with Yankee colors, while cars on the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7 train]] (which stopped at [[Shea Stadium]]) had Mets colors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mets/Yankees Metrocard|url=http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/mtacc/demo/doc205.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970614003443/http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/mtacc/demo/doc205.htm|archive-date=June 14, 1997|date=June 14, 1997|access-date=February 15, 2016}}</ref> The term could also be applied to the rivalry between the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], or the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]] ever since the Nets and the Islanders moved to the [[Barclays Center]] in Brooklyn.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Nets Move to Brooklyn With Legitimacy in Sight |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/sports/basketball/nets-move-to-brooklyn-with-legitimacy-in-sight.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 4, 2012|access-date = February 7, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Harvey |last=Araton}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=The NHL's coming Subway Series: Islanders vs. Rangers|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl-news/4636329-hockeys-new-subway-series-big-apple-new-york-islanders-new-york-rangers-nhl-barclays-center-madison-square-garden-brooklyn-brett-yormark |newspaper=The Sporting News |date=February 21, 2015|access-date = April 11, 2016 |first=Michael |last=McCarthy}}</ref>

===Full train wraps===
Since 2008, the MTA has tested full train wraps on [[42nd Street Shuttle]] rolling stock. In full train wraps, advertising entirely covers the interiors and exteriors of the train, as opposed to other routes, whose stock generally only displays advertising on placards inside the train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://untappedcities.com/2014/03/11/untapped-mailbag-advertising-takeovers-on-the-shuttle-to-times-square/|title=Untapped Mailbag: Advertising Takeovers on the Shuttle to Times Square|work=Untapped Cities|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/a-full-body-wrap-for-times-sq-shuttle/|title=A 'Full Body Wrap' for Times Sq.

Among the more contentious wraps that were withdrawn are a 2015 ad for the TV show ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'', which featured a [[Flag of Germany#Nazi Germany|Nazi flag]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/25/nazi-inspired-ads-for-the-man-in-the-high-castle-pulled-from-new-york-subway|title=Nazi-inspired ads for The Man in the High Castle pulled from New York subway|last=Reuters|date=November 25, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 4, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9793096/amazon-pulls-man-in-the-high-castle-nazi-subway-ads|title=Amazon pulls Nazi symbols from New York subway ad campaign|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=November 24, 2015|work=The Verge|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> and an ad for [[Fox Sports 1]], in which a shuttle train and half of its seats were plastered with negative quotes about the [[New York Knicks]], one of the city's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/hopeless-knicks-greet-nyc-subway-riders-due-fs1-ad-campaign-article-1.3538210|title='Hopeless' Knicks greet NYC subway riders due to FS1 ad campaign|last1=Bodner|first1=Brett|date=October 3, 2017|work=NY Daily News|access-date=October 4, 2017|last2=Becker|first2=Jake|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/10/03/sit-here-if-youre-hopeless-nyc-subway-ads-taunt-knicks-fans/|title=Knicks owner James Dolan reportedly 'furious' at Fox Sports 'hopeless' ads|last1=Bonesteel|first1=Matt|date=October 3, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=October 4, 2017|last2=Bieler|first2=Des|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Other routes have seen limited implementation of full train wraps. For instance, in 2010, one [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]] train set on the [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6]] route was wrapped with a [[Target Corporation|Target]] advertisement.<ref>{{cite web | last=Associated Press | title=MTA Wraps Subway in Train-Length Ad | website=NBC New York | date=June 28, 2010 | url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/MTA-Wraps-Subway-in-Train-Length-Ad-97355324.html | access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref> In 2014, the [[Jaguar F-Type]] was advertised on train sets running on the [[F (New York City Subway service)|F]] route.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vranica |first=Suzanne |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304856504579338704254890072 |title=And Now, Ads for the Super Bowl Ads – WSJ |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=January 28, 2014 |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Dastardly, British and Brand New to the Super Bowl | website=The New York Times | date=January 14, 2014 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/business/media/dastardly-british-and-brand-new-to-the-super-bowl.html | access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref> Some of these wraps have also been controversial, such as a [[Lane Bryant]] wrap in 2015 that displayed lingerie models on the exteriors of train cars.<ref>{{cite web | last=Jennings | first=Rebecca | title=Lane Bryant's #ImNoAngel Subway Ads Causing Controversy in Brooklyn Orthodox Communities | website=Racked NY | date=April 15, 2015 | url=https://ny.racked.com/2015/4/15/8420645/lane-bryant-imnoangel-subway-ads | access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref>
