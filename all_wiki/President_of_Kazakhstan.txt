{{Politics of Kazakhstan}}
The '''president of the Republic of Kazakhstan''' ({{lang-kk|Қазақстан Республикасының Президенті}}, ''Qazaqstan Respýblıkasynyń Prezıdenti''; {{lang-rus|Президент Республики Казахстан}}) is the [[head of state]], [[commander-in-chief]] and holder of the highest office within the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]]. The powers of this position are described in a special section of the [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]].

The position was established on 24 April 1990, a year before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The current president is [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]], who assumed office on 20 March 2019 following the resignation of the first president, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].<ref>[http://www.kazakhembus.com/index.php?page=kazakhstan-president Kazakhstan President] Embassy of Kazakhstan</ref>

None of the presidential elections held in Kazakhstan have been considered free or fair by [[Western world|Western]] standards<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/kazakhstan-president-early-election-nursultan-nazarbayev Kazakhstan's long term president to run in snap election – again], [[The Guardian]], 11 March 2015</ref> with issues noted including ballot tampering, multiple voting, harassment of opposition candidates and press censorship.

He is also provided with medical care, sanatorium, pensions and insurance.
