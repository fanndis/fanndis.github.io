'''West Bengal''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|n|ˈ|ɡ|ɔː|l}}) is a [[States and union territories of India|state]] in the eastern region of India along the [[Bay of Bengal]]. With over 91 million inhabitants, it is the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|fourth-most populous state]] and the [[List of states and union territories of India by area|fourteenth-largest state by area]] in India. Covering an area of {{convert|88752|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is also the [[List of country subdivisions by population|seventh-most populous country subdivision]] of the world. Part of the [[Bengal region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], it borders [[Bangladesh]] in the east, and [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] in the north. It also borders the Indian states of [[Odisha]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Bihar]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Assam]]. The state capital is [[Kolkata]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in India|third-largest metropolis]], and [[List of cities in India by population|seventh largest city by population]] in India. West Bengal includes the [[Darjeeling Himalayan hill region]], the [[Ganges delta]], the [[Rarh region]] and the coastal [[Sundarbans]]. The state's main ethnic group are the [[Bengalis]], with the [[Bengali Hindus]] forming the demographic majority.

The area's early history featured a succession of [[List of Indian monarchs|Indian empires]], internal squabbling, and a tussle between [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] for dominance.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Names of Bengal}}
The origin of the name [[Bengal]] (''Bangla'' and ''Bongo'' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]) is unknown. One theory suggests the word derives from "Bang", the name of a [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] tribe that settled the region around 1000{{nbsp}}BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/4.htm|title = Bangladesh: early history, 1000&nbsp;B.C.–A.D. 1202 |date = September 1988 |work = Bangladesh: A country study |publisher = [[Library of Congress]] |location = Washington, D.C. |access-date = 2 March 2012 |quote = Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang. Their homeland bore various titles that reflected earlier tribal names, such as Vanga, Banga, Bangala, Bangal and Bengal. |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170615070625/http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/4.htm |archive-date = 15 June 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The Bengali word ''Bongo'' might have been derived from the ancient [[Vanga Kingdom|kingdom of ''Vanga'']] (or ''Banga'').

In 1947, at the end of [[British Raj|British rule]] over the [[Indian subcontinent]] the [[Bengal Legislative Council]] and the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] voted on the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, which continued as an [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] and [[East Bengal]], a province of [[Pakistan]], which came to be known be as [[East Pakistan]] and later became the independent Bangladesh.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1987|p=230}}{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=142}}

The main river in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the ''[[Padma River|Padma]]'', or ''Pôdda'', while the other flows through West Bengal as the [[Bhagirathi River]] and [[Hooghly River]].

From a [[phytogeographic]] viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the [[Gangetic plain]] and the [[littoral]] mangrove forests of the Sundarbans.<ref name=Mukherji>{{cite book |last = Mukherji |first = S.J. |year = 2000 |title = College Botany Vol. III: (chapter on Phytogeography) |publisher = New Central Book Agency |location = Calcutta |pages = 345–365 }}</ref> The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile.<ref name=Mukherji /> Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur plateau]] in the adjoining state of Jharkhand.<ref name=Mukherji /> The predominant commercial tree species is ''Shorea robusta'', commonly known as the [[sal tree]]. The coastal region of [[Purba Medinipur]] exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the ''[[Casuarina]]''. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous ''sundari'' (''Heritiera fomes''), from which the forest gets its name.<ref name="vegetation">{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/452 |title = Sundarbans National Park |work = World heritage list |publisher = [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] |access-date = 4 March 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306224515/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/452 |archive-date = 6 March 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the ''[[Dooars]]'', are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees.<ref name=India123>{{cite web |url = http://www.webindia123.com/westbengal/land/forest.htm#N |title = Natural vegetation |access-date = 31 October 2006 |work = West Bengal |publisher = Suni System (P) Ltd |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060523204956/http://www.webindia123.com/westbengal/land/forest.htm#N |archive-date = 23 May 2006 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Above an elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, the forest becomes predominantly subtropical.

3.26% of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks—[[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Buxa Tiger Reserve]], [[Gorumara National Park]], [[Neora Valley National Park]] and [[Singalila National Park]].<ref name="fsiwbforest" /> Extant wildlife includes [[Indian rhinoceros]], [[Indian elephant]], deer, [[leopard]], [[gaur]], tiger and [[crocodile]]s, as well as many bird species.

{{See also|Council of Ministers of West Bengal|List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal}}
West Bengal is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[Calcutta High Court]] and a system of lower courts. [[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal|Chief Minister]] although the titular head of government is the [[Governor of West Bengal|Governor]]. The Governor is the [[Head of State]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is [[unicameral]] with 295 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|members]], or MLAs,<ref name=295mla>{{cite web |url = http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/States%5Cwestbengal%5Cwesbengal-w.htm |title = West Bengal legislative assembly |access-date = 28 October 2006 |work = Legislative bodies in India |publisher = National Informatics Centre, India |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160313022603/http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/states/westbengal/wesbengal-w.htm |archive-date = 13 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> including one nominated from the [[Anglo-Indian]] community.

The Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage it shares with neighbouring Bangladesh.

In the 19th and 20th{{nbsp}}centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period;<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-192109 |title = Bankim Chandra: The First Prominent Bengali Novelist |date = 30 June 2011 |work = [[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |access-date = 12 December 2017 |language = en |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035834/http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-192109 |archive-date = 6 September 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], a pioneer in [[Bengali theatre|Bengali drama]] who introduced the use of [[blank verse]];<ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e_dA0RAwd4oC |title = Dictionary of Indian Biography |last = Buckland |first = C.

There are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts. [[Abanindranath Tagore]], called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including: [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ramkinkar Baij]], [[Jamini Roy]] and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the [[Calcutta Group]] and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.contemporaryart-india.com/art_history_art_in_calcutta_bengal.php |title = contemporaryart-india – Art History: Bengal Region |last = Raychaudhuri |first = Baidehi Chatterjee and Roshmi |website = www.contemporaryart-india.com |access-date = 5 July 2017 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170507050409/http://www.contemporaryart-india.com/art_history_art_in_calcutta_bengal.php |archive-date = 7 May 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |title = Atlas of World Art |last = Onians |first = John |date = 2004 |publisher = [[Laurence King Publishing]] |isbn = 978-1-85669-377-6 |language = en|page=304 }}</ref>

=== Reformist heritage ===
The capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]]. Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like [[Sati (practice)|sati]], [[Dowry#India|dowry]], and [[Caste system in India|caste-based discrimination]], or [[untouchability]], to be abolished.<ref name="Bengali-speaking">''History of the Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 211, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt.

West Bengal produces several varieties of cotton and silk ''saris'' in the country. Handlooms are a popular way for the state's rural population to earn a living through weaving. Every district has weaving clusters, which are home to artisan communities, each specialising in specific varieties of handloom weaving.

[[Pandal]]s are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal. The city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja. It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from [[Kumortuli]], where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay-models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival.
