'''The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour''' was the fifth [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. Announced in February 2013 with initial dates in Europe and North America, the tour contained seven legs and 132 shows. It began in [[Belgrade]], Serbia on April 15, 2013, and concluded in [[Lisbon]], Portugal on March 27, 2014. Its title is a reference to her marriage with American rapper [[Jay-Z|Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter]], who made multiple guest appearances throughout the tour.

The tour featured royal themes with the singer emulating different queens through her fashion for which she collaborated with numerous designers and fashion houses. The [[set list]] of the shows in 2013 included songs from all four studio albums of Beyoncé's solo career. After the release of her [[Beyoncé (album)|eponymous fifth studio album]], the 2014 shows were changed to incorporate tracks from the album. The tour was lauded by [[music journalism|music critics]] who praised Beyoncé for her energetic performances, dancing and vocal abilities.

Following the announcement of the tour, all the tickets made available for the shows sold out, which prompted more dates to be added to the itinerary. The tour grossed $188.6&nbsp;million in 2013 and the 2014 shows grossed $41.1&nbsp;million, bringing the tour's total gross revenue to $229.7&nbsp;million. This made The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour the highest-grossing female and solo tour of 2013. Performances of a number of songs from the tour were broadcast and behind-the-scenes footage was released.

On April 24, 2013, it was announced by Beyoncé's publicist that all photographers except Beyoncé's personal photographer Frank Micelotta, were banned from the tour stating that "no photo credentials" will be present. The ban was interpreted as a reaction to the "unflattering" pictures from Beyoncé's Super Bowl XLVII halftime performance showing her "jubilant exertions", that appeared on websites such as [[Gawker]] and [[BuzzFeed]]. The pictures were not removed even after her publicist Yvette Noel-Schure asked the websites through an e-mail to change their articles, using "some better photos".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/24/beyonce-bans-photographers-mrs-carter|title=Beyoncé bans press photographers from Mrs Carter world tour|work=The Guardian|date=April 24, 2013|first=Sean|last=Michaels|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> On May 13, 2013, the general counsel of the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) Mickey H.

The performances of the songs that had already been performed during the 2013 shows remained the same; however some of them were shortened and mixed together. Many new songs from the singer's fifth album were added to the set list with a specific staging and theme. The projections shown on the stage followed the concept behind the singer's visual album.<ref name="biggerisbetter" /> The performance of "[[Flawless (Beyoncé song)|Flawless]]", the second song on the set, opened with the words from [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]'s [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk projected with big letters on the screen and later Beyoncé performed a choreography with her female dancers similarly to the song's music video.<ref name="2014tel" /><ref name="mtv2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1722773/beyonce-mrs-carter-tour-details/|title=Beyonce Upgrades Her Mrs. Carter Show Tour: New Songs, Sequins, Surprises|publisher=MTV News|first=Sidney|last=Madden|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name="ind" /> A performance of "Yoncé" followed with a new choreography with her dancers.

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Naughty Girl Beyonce 2013.jpg|thumbnail|left|Beyoncé performing "Naughty Girl" with onstage pyrotechnics]]
Mike Wass from the website [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] called the show a "concert extravaganza in the style of [[Michael Jackson]] or [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]" praising the fact that the singer made a progress in the production values compared with her previous performances, mostly due to the expensive and high-quality visual projections which "create atmosphere and add another layer to the production".<ref name="wass" /> He further praised the singer's "extraordinary talent" during the performances hailing her as "the greatest entertainer of her generation" after seeing the show which showcased "an icon at top of her game".<ref name="wass">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7467592/beyonce-mrs-carter-show-live-review|title=Beyonce Raises The Bar at Staples Center: The Mrs. Carter Show Reviewed|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|first=Mike|last=Wass|date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> Tiffany Poole from ''[[The Oklahoman]]'' praised the fashion, video backdrops and "some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube" concluding, "To say that Beyoncé puts on a good show would be grossly understated."<ref name="ok">{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/concert-review-beyonce-brings-her-mrs.-carter-show-to-oklahoma-city/article/3859755|title=Concert review: Beyoncé brings her Mrs. Carter Show to Oklahoma City|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=July 6, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}</ref> ''Billboard'' writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a "musical and visual extravaganza" complete with a kaleidoscope of colorful imagery and dancing, which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer's strong vocals, rather than overshadowing it. He concluded that the tour claimed "the multi-talented artist's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer".<ref name="billlaunch">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1568692/beyonce-shines-on-us-tour-launch-in-la-live-review|title=Beyoncé Shines on U.S. Tour Launch in L.A.: Live Review|work=Billboard|first=Gail|last=Mitchell|date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>

Nick Hasted of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing "big-budget movie clips and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] dance moves, with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras" further hailing it as a "[[Cecil B. DeMille]] spectacle". He finished his reviews by concluding, "what makes this show's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé's tireless physical effort. She has created a literal body of work".<ref name="theindependent">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/gig-review-behold-beyonc-the-cybernetic-goddess-of-rb-8590792.html|title=Gig review: Behold Beyoncé, the cybernetic goddess of R&B|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Nick|last=Hasted|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref>
[[Alexis Petridis]] of ''The Guardian'' who compared the singer's performance with [[Tina Turner]] praised the show's "bombastic" opening and wrote that "there's something powerful and relentless" about it. He concluded "while onstage Beyoncé feels weirdly unassailable".<ref name="guardreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/27/beyonce-mrs-carter-review|title=Beyoncé – review|work=The Guardian|date=April 27, 2013|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|author-link=Alexis Petridis|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref> Mikael Wood of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted, "What left the deepest impression was something far more elemental: Beyoncé's ability to make self-aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility... [Her] ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly."<ref name="latimesrev" /> ''The Observer''{{'}}s Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's "fierce" tireless dancing and concluded, "But for all the hauteur here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range."<ref name="empire" /> Bernadette McNulty from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... [and] of an expensive revue show" in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".<ref name="telegraf" />

Philip Matusavage of [[musicOMH]] praised Beyoncé's abilities to perform live, calling her "insanely talented" and considered the performance at the B-stage a show highlight; however he commented that the production values of the show, consisting solely of a video screen were "relatively low-key" compared to other pop arena concerts. Matusavage further criticized the repetition of the songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during the singer's other concerts as the tour's "most notable problem".<ref name="OMH">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/live/beyonce-o2-arena-london|title=Beyoncé – O2 Arena, London – Live reviews|work=[[musicOMH]]|first=Philip|last=Matusavage|date=May 4, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}</ref> Shirley Halperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt that the singer "tore through her... set with the ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove" and felt that she tried "her damnedest to win the crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and good old-fashioned hyping" further showcasing "unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals" which placed her at the top of R&B music.<ref name="hollywood" />

However Halperin criticized the show's set list mainly due to the majority of the songs from the album ''4'', writing, "Bey sounded terrific on all, of course, but with a... ready-to-party audience angling to groove in the aisles, rather than sway with their hands to the heavens, overall it missed the mark."<ref name="hollywood" /> ''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'}}s Robert Copsey praised the high-energy nature of the show with vigorous dancing and "blistering" pace but felt that there was a lack of hits performed in the show's first half.<ref name="spy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a477446/beyonces-mrs-carter-show-o2-arena-london-live-review.html|title=Beyoncé's 'Mrs Carter Show', O2 Arena London – Live review|work=Digital Spy|first=Robert|last=Copsey|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}</ref> ''NME'' editor Emily Mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for the tour, further criticizing the lack of hits in the set list and adding that only a "paucity of material" was incorporated in the set.

The revamped show in 2014 received acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from ''The Daily Telegraph'' acclaimed the revamped show praising the singer's sex appeal and noted that although the set included many new songs, the singer "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs".<ref name="2014tel">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/10651237/Beyonce-Glasgow-SSE-Hydro-review.html|title=Beyoncé, Glasgow SSE Hydro, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Isabel|last=Mohan|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion.<ref name="mtv2014" /> ''Digital Spy''{{'}}s Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list was better than the original one, describing the tour as "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself."<ref name="biggerisbetter" /> ''The Observer''{{'}}s Kitty Empire praised the singer's raunchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest.
