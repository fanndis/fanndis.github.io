{{Politics of India}}

The '''Parliament of India''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''Bhāratīya Sansad'') is the supreme [[legislature|legislative body]] of the [[India|Republic of India]]. It is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] composed of the [[President of India]] and the two houses: the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States) and the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People). The President in his role as head of legislature has full powers to summon and prorogue either house of Parliament or to dissolve Lok Sabha. The president can exercise these powers only upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and his [[Union Council of Ministers]].

Those elected or nominated (by the President) to either house of Parliament are referred to as [[Member of parliament (India)|Members of Parliament]] (MP). The [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|Members of Parliament, Lok Sabha]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by the Indian public voting in [[Single-member district]]s and the [[Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha|Members of Parliament, Rajya Sabha]] are elected by the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members]] of all [[Vidhan Sabha|State Legislative Assembly]] by [[proportional representation]]. The Parliament has a sanctioned strength of 543 in Lok Sabha and 245 in Rajya Sabha including the 12 nominees from the expertise of different fields of science, culture, art and history. The Parliament meets at [[Parliament House (India)|Sansad Bhavan]] in [[New Delhi]].

==History==
{{Main|Imperial Legislative Council|Constituent Assembly of India}}
The [[Constituent Assembly of India]] was elected to write the [[Constitution of India]]. Following India's independence from Britain in 1947, its members served as the nation's first Parliament.

==Parliament House==
{{Main|Parliament House (India)}}
The ''[[Parliament House (India)|Parliament House]]'' (''Sansad Bhavan'') is located in [[New Delhi]]. It was designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker]], who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi by British government. The construction of building took six years and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]], [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]]. The construction costs for the building were {{INRConvert|8.3|m}}. The parliament is {{convert|560|ft|order=flip}} in diameter and covers an area of {{convert|6|acre|order=flip}}. The Central Hall consists of the chambers of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and the Library hall. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storeyed circular structure providing accommodations for members and houses [[Standing committee (India)|Parliamentary committees]], offices and the [[Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs (India)|Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Parliament, Delhi|url=http://delhiassembly.nic.in/history_assembly.html|publisher=delhiassembly.nic.in|accessdate=13 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006075521/http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/13parl1.html|archivedate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

===General layout of the Parliament===
The centre and the focus of the building is the Central Hall. It consists of chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, and the Library Hall and between them lie garden courts. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storeyed circular structure providing accommodations for ministers, chairmen, parliamentary committees, party offices, important offices of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, and also the offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is {{convert|98|ft|order=flip}} in diameter. It is a place of historical importance. The [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of the erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] Hall. At present, the Central Hall is used for holding joint sittings of both the houses of parliament and also used for address by the President in the commencement of first session after each [[Lok Sabha#Lok Sabha general elections|general election]].

===Proposal for a new building===
A new Parliament building may replace the existing complex. The new building is being considered on account of the stability concerns regarding the current complex.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delhi may see a new Parliament building|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-13/india/32662416_1_heritage-building-parliament-house-mantralaya-fire|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006075521/http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/13parl1.html|archivedate=6 October 2013}}</ref> A committee to suggest alternatives to the current building has been set up by the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Former Speaker]], [[Meira Kumar]]. The present building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag.<ref>{{cite web|author=Firstpost|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/speaker-sets-up-panel-to-suggest-new-home-for-parliament-377345.html|title=Speaker sets up panel to suggest new home for Parliament|publisher=Firstpost|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=15 August 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811003217/http://www.firstpost.com/india/speaker-sets-up-panel-to-suggest-new-home-for-parliament-377345.html|archivedate=11 August 2012}}</ref>
