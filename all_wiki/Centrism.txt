[[File:Political Spectrum Chart NPOV.svg|thumb|253x253px|[[Nolan chart|Two-axis political spectrum chart]] with an economic axis, a socio-cultural axis and ideologically representative colours]]
In [[politics]], '''centrism''' is a political outlook or specific position that involves acceptance or support of a balance of a degree of [[Egalitarianism|social equality]] and a degree of [[social hierarchy]], while opposing political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the [[Left-wing politics|left]] or the [[Right-wing politics|right]].<ref>[[Oliver H. Woshinsky]]. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. Oxon, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2008. Pp. 141, 161.</ref>

Both [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] politics involve a general association with centrism that is combined with leaning somewhat to their respective sides of the [[Left-right political spectrum|spectrum]]. Various political ideologies, such as [[Christian democracy]] and forms of [[liberalism]], can be classified as centrist ones.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=Jonathan|title=Community and the Economy: The Theory of Public Co-operation|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136159015|page=160}}</ref>

== Usage by political parties by country ==
=== Australia ===
There have been centrists in both sides of politics, who serve alongside the various factions within the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] parties.

The [[Australian Democrats]] is the most prominent centrist party in Australian History. The party had representation in the senate from 1977 through to 2007, frequently holding the balance of power in that time. Formed by [[Don Chipp]], on a promise to “Keep the Bastards Honest,” it was known to have represented the “middle ground.”  The party regained registration in 2019.

In addition, there are a number of smaller groups that have formed in response to the bipartisan system who uphold centrist ideals. South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] had launched his own centrist political party called the [[Nick Xenophon Team]] (NXT) in 2014, renamed [[Centre Alliance]] in 2018.

=== Belgium ===
The traditional centrist party of [[Flanders]] was the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] which embraced [[social liberalism]] and aimed to represent Dutch-speaking Belgians who felt culturally suppressed by Francophones. The [[New Flemish Alliance]] is the largest and since 2009 the only extant successor of that party. It is, however, primarily composed of the right wing of the former People's Union, and has adopted a more [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] ideology in recent years.

Among French speaking Belgians the [[Centre démocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] is a centre party as it is considerably less [[conservatism|conservative]] than its Flemish counterpart, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]].

Other parties in the centre of the political spectrum are the liberal [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] and the French-speaking minority party [[DéFI]].

=== Brazil ===
There are several centrist parties in Brazil, such as the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB), which is a [[Big tent|catch-all party]], one of the largest political parties in Brazil.

The [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) is also another example of a centrist party in Brazilian politics, though it was supported by right-wing political parties in the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002]], [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006]], [[2010 Brazilian general election|2010]] and [[2014 Brazilian general election|2014]] elections.

Other centrist parties include [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB), [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil)]] (PSD), [[Avante (political party)|Avante]] (AVANTE), [[Podemos (Brazil)|PODEMOS]] (PODE) and [[Republican Party of the Social Order]] (PROS)

=== Croatia ===
[[Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats]] and [[People's Party - Reformists]] may be considered as centrist parties. Agrarian [[Croatian Peasant Party]] during last years became moderate and centrist, having been centre-right in the past.

=== Czech Republic ===
The [[Czech Republic]] has a number of prominent centrist parties, including the [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] [[populist]] movement [[ANO 2011]] (currently in government), the [[civil libertarian]] [[Czech Pirate Party]], the long-standing [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party]] and the [[localist]] party [[Mayors and Independents]].

=== Estonia ===
{{main|Centrism in Estonia}}

=== France ===
France has a tradition of parties that call themselves "''centriste''", though the actual parties vary over time: when a new political issue emerges and a new political party breaks into the mainstream, the old centre-left party may be de facto pushed rightwards, but unable to consider itself a party of the right, it will embrace being the new centre: this process occurred with the [[Orléanism]], [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Républicanism]], [[Independent Radicals|Radical Republicanism]] and [[Radical-Socialism]].

Currently the most notable centrist party is [[La République En Marche!|La République en marche !]], founded by [[Emmanuel Macron]]; who was elected as [[President of France]] in May 2017. Another party is the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] of [[François Bayrou]], founded in 2007. Which was the successor of [[christian democracy|christian democratic]]  [[Union for French Democracy]].

=== Germany ===
[[File:2010-11-29 JoachimGauck 211.JPG|thumb|In 1990, [[Joachim Gauck]] (who is a former German President, centrist politician and activist without party affiliation) took part in the [[Alliance 90]], having become an independent after [[Alliance 90/The Greens|its merger with The Greens]]]]
''Zentrismus'' is a term only known to experts, as it is easily confused with ''Zentralismus'' ("centralism", the opposite to decentralisation/federalism), so the usual term in German for the political centre/centrism is ''politische Mitte'' (literally "political middle", or "political centre"). Historically, the German party with the most purely centrist nature among German parties to have had current or historical parliamentary representations was most likely the [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918–1933).

There existed during the Weimar Republic (and again after the Nazi period) a ''[[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]'', a party of German [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] founded in 1870. It was called Centre Party not for being a proper centrist party, but because it united left-wing and right-wing Catholics, because it was the first German party to be a ''Volkspartei'' ([[big tent|catch-all party]]) and because his elected representatives sat between the liberals (the left of the time) and the conservatives (the right of the time). However, it was distinctly right-wing conservative in that it was not neutral on religious issues (such as on secular education), being markedly against more liberal and modernist positions.

The main successor of ''Zentrum'' after the return of democracy to West Germany in 1945, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], has throughout its history alternated between describing itself as right-wing or centrist and sitting on the right-wing (with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in its social liberal moments sitting at its left, in the centre and themselves sitting at the centre, with the FDP in its [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] moments sitting at its right, in the right-wing). The representatives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], although they have since the 1990s many times referred to themselves as "the new middle" (under influence of the [[Third way (centrism)|Third way]] of the time), feel less at ease in describing their party as centrist due to their history and socialist identity.

[[Alliance '90/The Greens]] was founded in 1993 as a merger from the East German [[Alliance 90]] (a group of centrist/[[transpartisan|transversalist]] civil rights activists) and the (West) German Greens. The latter was a coalition of various unorthodox-left politicians and more liberal "realists". This [[Bundestag]] party also hesitates in using the term centre, although it does distance itself as well from the tag of left, which identifies it for the moment as a transversalist party. The transversalist moderation of the party and its position in the Bundestag between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (while the FDP has its seats at the right of the Christian Democrats) also points somewhat to The Greens being a more or less centrist party.

In the state parliaments of specific German states there are other specifically regional parties which could be identified as centrist. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], of the Danish and Frisian minorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] has currently a centrist political position, although in the past the party usually leaned to the left. In the German presidential elections of [[2009 German presidential election|2009]], [[2010 German presidential election|2010]] and [[2012 German presidential election|2012]], it supported the candidates of the Social Democrats and the Greens. In Bavaria, the [[Free Voters]] party present at the state parliament may also be seen as a centrist party.

=== Greece ===
In Greece centrism has its roots to centrist politician and founder of [[Agricultural Party of Greece|Agricultural]] and [[Labor Party of Greece|Labour]] Party, [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]. In 1961, [[Georgios Papandreou]] created along with other political leaders the coalition party of [[Centre Union]]. Five parties were merged: Liberal Party, Progressive Agricultural Democratic Union, National Progressive Center Union, Popular Social Party into one, with strong centrist agenda opposed equally to right wing party of National Radical Union and left wing party of United Democratic Left. The Centre Union Party was the last Venizelist party to hold power in Greece. The party nominally continued to exist until 1977 (after the Junta it was known as the [[Centre Union – New Forces|Center Union – New Forces]]), when its successor Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) party was created.

[[Union of Centrists]] was created by [[Vassilis Leventis]] in 1992 under the title "Union of Centrists and Ecologists", though the name was changed shortly after. The Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Center Union. The party strives to become "the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece". Leventis aimed to become part of the Venizelist legacy of some great politicians of the past, such as Eleftherios Venizelos and George Papandreou Sr. However, the party's total influence had been marginal until 2015, with 1.79% of the total votes (in the [[January 2015 Greek legislative election]]) being its highest achievement before finally making its way to the [[Greek Parliament]] in September 2015 with 3.43% of the total votes and 9 members elected.

=== India ===
{{unsourcedsection|date=October 2020}}
The National People's Party is a national-level political party in India, though its influence is mostly concentrated in the state of Meghalaya. The party was founded by P A Sangma after his expulsion from the NCP in July 2012. It was accorded national party status on 7 June 2019. It is the first political party from Northeastern India to have attained this status.
Actor turned politician [[Kamal Haasan]] has launched a party named [[Makkal Needhi Maiam]] meaning People's Centre for Justice.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], both two main political parties ([[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]]) claim the political centre ground, but seem to lean to the centre-right and be mostly made up of centre-right members.<ref name="iran-daily.com">[http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 Iran Daily – Dot Coms – 05-31-07, Bertie's Challenge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018012627/http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 |date=18 October 2007 }}, 5th paragraph</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=John Murray |title=Irish Poll Hits Fianna Fail |url=https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |accessdate=2019-11-28 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=13 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525190855/https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |archive-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> The two parties have shared broadly similar policies in the past, with their primary division being perceived as being steeped in [[Irish Civil War]] politics. Fine Gael is aligned to [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties in Europe via its membership of the [[European People's Party]] and is described internationally as [[centre-right]] by the likes of Reuters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6BB0WA20101212|title=Irish opposition party says IMF/EU deal too costly |work=Reuters|date=12 December 2010}}</ref> The consensus in analysis seems to be that Fianna Fáil is mostly centrist, expanding to the centre-right space and that Fine Gael is mostly centre-rightist, expanding also to the centre space.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, centrism is represented by the [[Yesh Atid]] Party led by [[Yair Lapid]]. The party was founded in 2013 and has remained a major player on the political scene. It served in government between 2013 and 2015 with Lapid serving as Israel's Finance Minister and a member of the Security Cabinet. In 2020, after a year of political turmoil in Israel, Yair Lapid became the [[Leader of the Opposition (Israel)|Leader of the Opposition]] to the fifth government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Yair Lapid published a long political essay entitled ''Only the center can hold: Democracy and the battle of ideas'' <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/only-the-center-can-hold-democracy-and-the-battle-of-ideas/ |title = Only the center can hold: Democracy and the battle of ideas}}</ref> in which he laid out his vision of political centrism in Israel. The essay was originally published in Hebrew in Haaretz under the title "Not, just not Bibi. In this battle of ideas the center has solutions"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/.premium-MAGAZINE-1.8707489 |title = אומרים שאנחנו מפלגת "רק לא ביבי". הנה מה שאנחנו באמת מאמינים בו // יאיר לפיד}}</ref>

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], four moderate centrist to centre-right parties have sent members into the [[Third Rutte cabinet]] since 2017. From them, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) tend to be [[centre-right]] whilst the social liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) are more centrist.<ref>[http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf Politieke Barometer: ''D66 middenpartij bij uitstek''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719123931/http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf |date=19 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant]] [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] is a small [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] party that has transversalist positions less typical in European centrist parties. Whilst it is left-leaning on issues such as immigration, welfare and the environment, it is more conservative on social issues, such as [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[euthanasia]]. They have participated in several coalitions due to their moderate centrist politics.

Another centrist party is the [[populist]] [[List of pensioners' parties|Pensioners' interests]] party [[50PLUS]] which combines [[Social democracy|social democratic]], [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] and [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions.

[[Livable Netherlands]] was originally a centrist political movement of local grass-root parties with an anti-establishment touch similar to early D66. However, the party entered in 2002 national parliament with a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] programme based [[Law and order (politics)|on security]] and immigration as the major issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the 1980s and 1990s, there were two self-described "centre" parties, the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] and the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] who at some point were represented in [[Tweede Kamer|Dutch parliament]]. However these parties were considered as [[far right]] (in the case of the Centre Democrats) or even [[extreme right]] (in the case of the Centre Party) in their opinion about foreign immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/nl/Educatie/monitor/Kronieken/Kroniek-extreemrechts/De-Centrumstroming/De-Centrumpartij/|title=Kroniek extreemrechts: De Centrumpartij|first=Anne Frank|last=Stichting|date=20 January 2011|website=annefrank.org}}</ref> Both parties denied being racist or extremist in character. The party slogan of the Center Party was ''"niet rechts, niet links"'' ("Neither rightist nor leftist"), and in some respect could be seen as a centrist (or more correctly [[Third Position]]) party since it borrowed ideas from the political (far) right (a tough stand on immigration combined with typical racial prejudice) and the political left ([[mixed economy]], green politics). However both of these two parties didn't really have a coherent ideology; they were basically one-issue parties focussed on what the perceived as mass immigration from non-European countries.

=== Nordic countries ===
[[File:Senterpartiet campaining Norwegian Storting elections 2005 Picture from Nærbø at Jæren.JPG|thumb|Campaign for the Norwegian [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] at [[Nærbø]]: like its [[Centre Party (Finland)|Finnish]] and [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Swedish]] counterparts, the party has a strong focus on decentralisation, rural and agrarian issues]]
{{main|Nordic agrarian parties}}
{{see also|Centrism in Finland|Centrism in Iceland|Centrism in Sweden}}
In most of the [[Nordic countries]], there are [[Nordic agrarian parties]]. These share in addition to the centrist position on the socio-economic left-right scale a clear, separate ideology.

This position is centred on [[decentralisation]], a commitment to [[small business]] and [[environmentalism|environmental protection]]. Centrists have aligned themselves with the [[Liberal International]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]. Historically, all of these parties were farmers' parties committed to maintaining rural life. In the 1960s, these parties broadened their scope to include non-farmer-related issues and renamed themselves [[Centre Party (disambiguation)|Centre Party]].

Neither the [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] (a now defunct centrist political party) nor the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] (a political party founded as a centrist social liberal party, but that now is a classical liberal party), both of Denmark, are rooted in centrist agrarianism.

[[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI), founded by [[Imran Khan]], claims to be a centrist political party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/28/survey-imran-khan-most-popular-leader-of-pakistan/|title=Survey: Imran Khan most popular leader of Pakistan|first=Mirza|last=Hassan|date=28 June 2012|work=TheNewsTribe.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Following the [[2013 Pakistani general election|general election of 2013]], PTI emerged as the second-largest political party in Pakistan by number of votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.com.pk/|title=elections.com.pk|access-date=4 April 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064535/http://elections.com.pk/|archive-date=5 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In July 2018 it won the general elections of Pakistan and [[Imran Khan]], its chairman, became Prime Minister.<ref name="PTI_2018Election">{{cite web |last1=Saifi |first1=Sophia |last2=Raja |first2=Adeel |last3=Dewan |first3=Angela |title=Imran Khan's party wins Pakistan election but falls short of majority |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/28/asia/pakistan-election-results-imran-khan-intl/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref>

=== Palestine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The [[Third Way (Palestinian authority)|Third Way]] is a small centrist Palestinian political party active in Palestinian politics. Founded on 16 December 2005, the party is led by [[Salam Fayyad]] and [[Hanan Ashrawi]].

In the January 2006 PLC elections, it received 2.41% of the popular vote and won two of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council|Council]]'s 132 seats. The party presents itself as an alternative to the two-party system of [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]].

=== Poland ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[Civic Platform]] (PO), ruling in 2007–2015, began in 2001 as a liberal conservative party, but later under the leadership of [[Donald Tusk]] turned into typical centrist in order to attract left-leading liberal voters. Depending on the context, it is described as either Christian Democratic (it is a member of [[European People's Party]]), conservative, liberal, or social. Its pragmatism, technocracy and lack of ideology have been nevertheless criticized and currently, under the leader [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] announced that it is returning to the right, but with new leader [[Borys Budka]] and as a part of [[Civic Coalition (Poland)|Civic Coalition]] it turns to progressivism again, as seen by policies proposed by their candidate, [[Rafał Trzaskowski]], in 2020 presidential elections. Other political groups like [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL) may be described as centrist too (in Poland, national-moral right-wing [[Law and Justice]] is [[social conservative]], usually at the same time economical left and favor [[protectionism]] policies). Newest political party present in Polish Parliament, [[Poland 2050]] led by [[Szymon Hołownia]], has been described as ideological centre with strong pragmatic influences.

=== Spain ===
The only national party that defends itself as a centrist party is [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], whose platform is been increasingly perceived as right-wing by the Spanish citizens as the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]] surveys show. In April 2018 Ciudadanos obtained a 6,77, when ranging political parties from 1 to 10, where 1 was farthest left and 10 its equivalent in the right.<ref>[http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3200_3219/3210/es3210mar.pdf] Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas. 27 July 2018</ref> It first entered the [[Cortes Generales]] in 2015.

In Catalonia, where the party was born, many people even consider it as an extreme right-wing party, considering its fierce "opposition to nationalism". Not even the media agree on its place and several newspapers from different ideologies manifest that Citizens is either left or right, depending on their political line. Regardless of subjective opinions, the truth is that Ciudadanos has always tried to reach agreements<ref>[http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2015-06-24/irene-lozano-aboga-por-el-pacto-con-ciudadanos-como-pide-el-tiempo-nuevo-en-su-candidatura-de-upyd_901183/], El Confidencial</ref> with [[Union, Progress and Democracy]] (UPyD), which Spanish voters most traditionally consider to be the closest to the centre according to several opinion polls. This popular perception was pointed out by UPyD, which positions itself simultaneously on the political centre and cross-sectionalism, thus embracing ideas across the political spectrum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://es.reuters.com/article/idESKCN0PL0M120150711|title=Andrés Herzog sucederá a Rosa Díez al frente de UPyD|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=Reuters|language=es|date=11 July 2015|quote=En su último discurso como portavoz de UPyD, Díez reivindicó a su formación -que se define como un partido progresista situado en el centro político-, como el artífice del cambio político en España}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upyd.es/contenidos/noticias/105/105880-UPyD_La_evolucion_de_la_politica_en_Espana|title=UPyD: La evolución de la política en España|last=González Almeida|first=José María|accessdate=22 May 2016|website=upyd.es|language=es|date=12 November 2013|quote=UPyD ofrece entendimiento a través del ''transversalismo'', que bien pueden servir sin necesidad de inclinarse a un lado o a otro, ya que todos tienen algo positivo que aportar y la formación magenta sabe bien sintetizar lo mejor de cada idea, ofreciendo un dulce cóctel al ciudadano|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428024340/http://www.upyd.es/contenidos/noticias/105/105880-UPyD_La_evolucion_de_la_politica_en_Espana|archive-date=28 April 2015}}</ref>

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]] the political centre (in [[German language|German]]: ''die Mitte''; in [[French language|French]]: ''le Centre''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''il Centro'') is traditionally occupied by the so-called "bourgeois" parties: [[FDP.The Liberals]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fdp.ch/aktuell/medienmitteilungen/medienmitteilung-detail/news/es-braucht-eine-starke-liberale-kraft-im-parlament-mehr-denn-je/|title=Es braucht eine starke liberale Kraft im Parlament – mehr denn je|first=WNG agence|last=digitale|website=fdp.ch}}</ref> (centre-right),<ref>The party itself rejects the left-right notion, stating on its FAQ-page that it is a centre party.</ref> the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cvp.ch/index.php/de/news/2015-10-18/die-cvp-ist-die-partei-der-mitte|title=Die CVP ist die Partei der Mitte!|website=cvp.ch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cvp.ch/de/die-cvp/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=CVP Schweiz}}</ref> (centre<ref>In urban and Protestant areas, the party tends to be more centrist than in rural, predominantly Catholic areas.</ref> to centre-right) and the much smaller [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland|Evangelical People's Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evppev.ch/partei/|title=Partei - EVP Schweiz|website=www.evppev.ch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evppev.ch/fr/news/action/News/detail/artikel/im-parlamentarier-rating-steht-die-evp-mit-der-sozialen-mitte-alleine-da-ist-niemand/|title=Im Parlamentarier-Rating steht die EVP mit der sozialen Mitte alleine, da ist niemand!|website=evppev.ch}}</ref> (centre to centre-left).<ref>The party rejects the left-right classification, but it tends to be on the centre or centre-left on social and environmental issues, centrist on economic issues and centre-right on ethical issues.</ref>

Recently, some new parties were founded who claimed to be part of the political centre: the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland|Conservative Democratic Party]] (centre to centre-right), a split from the right-wing populist [[Swiss People's Party]] and a self-styled centre party<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdp.info/schweiz/de/koepfe/einsatzfuereinestarkemitte/|title=BDP Schweiz › Köpfe|website=www.bdp.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smartvote.ch/downloads/edu/sv_edu_parteienportraet_bdp_de_CH.pdf|title=Smartvote Parteienporträt: Bürgerlich-Demokratische Partei (BDP), page 3|website=smartvote.ch|access-date=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163843/https://www.smartvote.ch/downloads/edu/sv_edu_parteienportraet_bdp_de_CH.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the [[Green Liberal Party of Switzerland|Green Liberal Party]] (centre),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grunliberale.ch/partei/geschichte.html|title=Parteigeschichte|first=Magnolia International|last=Ltd.|website=grunliberale.ch}}</ref> a split from the leftist [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party]].

The [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] is considered to be more to the left than to the centre.<ref>http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=721636456&Country=Switzerland&topic=Summary&subtopic=Political+structure The Economist Intelligence Unit (2015).

In Switzerland, the centrist parties tend to co-operate closely in Canton parliaments and municipal councils.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 1970s, the traditionally socialist [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] moved further to the left, causing discomfort to MPs who saw themselves as belonging to the party's social democratic tendency. On 25 January 1981, leading figures from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] ([[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], known collectively as the "Gang of Four") launched the Council for Social Democracy, which later became the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in March, after outlining their policies in what became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]]. The "Gang of Four" were centrists, who had defected from the Labour Party due to what they perceived to be the influence of the [[Militant tendency]] and the "[[hard left]]" within the party.<ref name="ChildsStorry2013">{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75555-4|page=485}}</ref><ref name="Sassoon2010">{{cite book|author=Donald Sassoon|title=One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUkBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA698|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-530-2|page=698}}</ref> After waning electoral success, the SDP merged with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1988 to create the centrist [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the late 1990s, Labour under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] began to move towards a centrist [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] policy platform, adopting the campaign name [[New Labour]]. The new New Labour era is seen as ending when Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] lost the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] to the Conservatives. Brown's successor as leader, [[Ed Miliband]], moved the party slightly to the left of the New Labour era position. Miliband set out his stall to "redefine the political centre", with pundits declaring New Labour "dead".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e9c342ac-c954-11df-b3d6-00144feab49a|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Miliband declares New Labour dead|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=8 August 2018|last=Barker|first=Alex}}</ref> The [[Blue Labour]] movement, launched in 2009, attempted to cultivate a new path for Labour centrism that would appeal to socially conservative working class periods, and was a mild influence on Labour during Miliband's tenure. The party later moved decisively to the left when the socialist [[Jeremy Corbyn]] became leader in 2015, as a result of the introduction of a [[one member one vote]] system under Miliband.

In March 2011, [[Nick Clegg]], the-then leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], stated that he believed that his party belonged to the radical centre, mentioning [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[William Beveridge]], [[Jo Grimond]], [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] as examples of the radical centre that preceded the Liberal Democrats' establishment in 1988. He pointed to liberalism as an ideology of people and described the political spectrum and his party's position as follows: "For the left, an obsession with the state. For the right, a worship of the market. But as liberals, we place our faith in people. People with power and opportunity in their hands. Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre".

In the 2000s, [[David Cameron]] also moved the Conservative Party towards the centre, allowing his party to be [[2010 United Kingdom general election|elected in 2010]] in a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition with the Liberal Democrats]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]], the Conservatives gained a majority and the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats. They regained a small number of seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 election]]. Cameron's successor [[Theresa May]] used left-wing rhetoric on her appointment as Prime Minister, stating her wish to tackle social inequality, and adopted some of Ed Miliband's policies; for example, on regulating energy companies. However, the party's 2017 manifesto was seen as sharp break from the centre ground, appealing to traditionally Tory heartland issues in the aftermath of the UK's [[Brexit referendum]].

Following the [[Brexit referendum]], politics in the UK was seen as having reverted to traditionally polarised "left and right" politics. For the 2017 election, the group [[More United]] was set up in the vein of the US [[Super PAC]] model to support candidates from multiple parties who meet its values; it gave support primarily to Labour and Lib Dem MPs, as well as one Conservative. In April 2018, ''The Observer'' newspaper reported that a group setup by Simon Franks had amassed £50 million to start a new centrist political party in the UK to field candidates at the next general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit|title=New centrist party gets £50m backing to 'break mould' of UK politics|first=Michael|last=Savage|date=8 April 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref> It has reportedly been named [[United for Change]].

In early 2019, difficulties and party clashes regarding Brexit caused a number of Labour and Conservative MPs to leave their parties, forming a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] group named [[The Independent Group]]. They later announced their intention to register as a formal party named [[Change UK]]. The party has been identified as centrist by most sources, with Change UK MP [[Chris Leslie]] describing the party as "offering a home to those on the [[centre-left]]." Former Change UK MP [[Chuka Umunna]] joined the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] shortly after the formation of the party after disappointing results in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]]. He gave the reason there is  "no room for two in the centre ground".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/chuka-umunna-joins-liberal-democrats-after-quitting-change-uk|title=Chuka Umunna joins Lib Dems: 'No room for two in centre ground'|last1=Stewart|first1=Heather|date=2019-06-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-22|last2=Weaver|first2=Matthew|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> After losing all their MPs in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]], the party was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perraudin |first1=Francis |title=Independent Group for Change to be disbanded |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/independent-group-for-change-party-disbanded |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=22 December 2019 |date=19 December 2019}}</ref>

Independent candidate [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]] garnered nearly 19% of the popular vote in the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]]. His "get under the hood" campaign focusing on [[United States federal budget|balancing the budget]] has been one of the most successful centrist efforts in U.S. history,<ref name=elect /> but he did not carry a single state in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

A late-2011 Gallup poll of Americans' attitudes towards government reported that 17% expressed conservative views, 22% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, 17% expressed centrist views and 24% expressed liberal views.<ref name="poll">{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/29/reason-rupe-poll-finds-24-of-a|title=Reason-Rupe Poll Finds 24 Percent of Americans are Economically Conservative and Socially Liberal, 28 Percent Liberal, 28 Percent Conservative, and 20 Percent Communitarian|first=Emily|last=Ekins|date=29 August 2011|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref>

[[Americans Elect]], a coalition of American centrists funded by wealthy donors such as business magnate [[Michael Bloomberg]], former [[High-yield debt|junk-bond]] trader [[Peter Ackerman]] and [[hedge fund]] manager John H. Burbank III, launched an effort in mid-2011 to create a national "virtual primary" that would challenge the current two-party system. The group aimed to nominate a presidential ticket of centrists with names that would be on ballots in all 50 states. The group banked on broad cultural dissatisfaction with the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' has stated that "the political climate couldn't be riper for a serious third-party alternative" such as their effort, but the "hurdles Americans Elect faces are daunting" to get on ballots.<ref name="elect">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0729/Americans-Elect-launches-centrist-third-party-bid-amid-Washington-dysfunction|title=Americans Elect launches centrist third-party bid amid Washington dysfunction|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=1 January 2012|first=Patrik|last=Jonsson|date=29 July 2011}}</ref>

Journalist and political commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] wrote in his book ''Why Americans Hate Politics'', published on the eve of the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], that he believes American voters are looking for a "New Political Center" that intermixes "liberal instincts" and "conservative values". He labelled people in this centre position as "tolerant traditionalists". He described them as believers in conventional social morals that ensure family stability, as tolerant within reason to those who challenge those morals and as pragmatically supportive of government intervention in spheres such as education, child care and [[Health care in the United States|health care]], as long as budgets are balanced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dionne, Jr.|first=E.J.|title=Why Americans Hate Politics: A Reprise|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2000/12/winter-politics-dionne|work=Brookings Research|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=16 April 2014|location=Washington, D.C.|date=Winter 2000}}</ref>
