'''''American Idol''''' is an American singing [[Reality competition|competition television series]] created by [[Simon Fuller]], produced by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle North America]] and [[19 Entertainment]], and distributed by Fremantle North America. It initially aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from June 11, 2002 to April 7, 2016, for 15 seasons. It was on hiatus for two years until March 11, 2018, when a revival of the series aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

It started as an addition to the ''[[Idols (TV series)|Idols]]'' format that was based on ''[[Pop Idol]]'' from British television, and became one of the most successful shows in the history of [[Television in the United States|American television]]. The concept of the series involves discovering [[Recording Artist|recording stars]] from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by American viewers using phones, Internet, and [[SMS]] text voting. The winners of the first eighteen seasons, as chosen by viewers, are [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ruben Studdard]], [[Fantasia Barrino]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Taylor Hicks]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]], [[Kris Allen]], [[Lee DeWyze]], [[Scotty McCreery]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[Candice Glover]], [[Caleb Johnson]], [[Nick Fradiani]], [[Trent Harmon]], [[Maddie Poppe]], [[Laine Hardy]], and [[Just Sam]] respectively.

''American Idol'' employs a panel of vocal judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges, for the first through eighth seasons, were record producer and music manager [[Randy Jackson]], singer and choreographer [[Paula Abdul]], and music executive and manager [[Simon Cowell]]. The judging panel for the last three seasons on Fox consisted of singers [[Keith Urban]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]]<ref name="J-Lo&Connick">[https://ew.com/article/2013/09/03/american-idol-jennifer-lopez-harry-connick-jr/ 'American Idol' officially adds J.Lo and Harry Connick Jr. as judges] ''Entertainment Weekly'', Retrieved November 23, 2019</ref> The sixteenth season brought three new judges: singers [[Lionel Richie]], [[Katy Perry]], and [[Luke Bryan]]. The first season was hosted by radio personality [[Ryan Seacrest]] and comedian [[Brian Dunkleman]], but Seacrest has been the sole [[master of ceremonies]] since the second season.

The success of ''American Idol'' has been described as "unparalleled in broadcasting history".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqt_nxRY7xIC&pg=PA106 |title=Global Media Ecologies: Networked Production in Film and Television |author= Doris Baltruschat |page= 106 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2010 |isbn=978-0415874786 }}</ref> A rival TV executive said the series was "the most impactful show in the history of television".<ref name="carter">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/arts/television/20idol.html |title=For Fox's Rivals, 'American Idol' Remains a 'Schoolyard Bully' |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 13, 2008 |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=February 20, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416211241/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/arts/television/20idol.html| archivedate=April 16, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref> It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]], in its first ten years, "''Idol'' has spawned 345 ''Billboard'' chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, [[Chris Daughtry]], Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Clay Aiken]], [[Adam Lambert]], and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut."<ref name="Billboard2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/ten-years-of-american-idol-chart-dominance-1007290752.story |title=Ten Years of 'American Idol' Chart Dominance: Clarkson, Underwood, Daughtry, Fantasia, More |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
''American Idol'' was based on the British show ''[[Pop Idol]]'' created by [[Simon Fuller]], which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition ''[[Popstars]]''. Television producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.<ref name=guardin>{{Cite news|author=Stephen Armstrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/11/nigel-lythgoe-television-dance |title=Nice work for Nasty Nigel Lythgoe |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= January 11, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Fuller was inspired by the idea from ''Popstars'' of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including [[Televoting|telephone voting]] by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|last=Fuller |first=Simon |url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/news/simon-fuller-on-how-idol-began-2-1118037190/4|title=Simon Fuller on how 'Idol' began |work=Variety |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Pop Idol'' debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as [[showrunner]]{{nsmdns}}the executive producer and production leader{{nsmdns}}and [[Simon Cowell]] as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1787135.stm |title=Pop Idol audience reaches 10&nbsp;million |work=BBC News |date=January 28, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the ''Pop Idol'' format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].<ref name="NYT – American Idol"/> However, [[Rupert Murdoch]], head of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|parent company]], was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth]], who had seen the British show.<ref name="NYT – American Idol">{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/business/yourmoney/30idol.html| title = How a Hit Almost Failed Its Own Audition|work=The New York Times| date = April 30, 2006| author=Bill Carter
}}</ref> Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/more-tv-news/the-masked-scheduler-on-american-idol-part-1-the-origin-story/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306002559/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/more-tv-news/the-masked-scheduler-on-american-idol-part-1-the-origin-story/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2018 |title=The Masked Scheduler on 'American Idol,' part 1: The origin story |date=March 5, 2018 |work=TV by the Number }}</ref> The show was renamed ''American Idol: The Search for a Superstar'' and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1957221.stm |work=BBC News | title=US starts Pop Idol search | date=April 29, 2002}}</ref><ref name="Watching TV: six decades of American television">[https://books.google.com/books?id=A16TTK0vN7sC&pg=PA420&lpg=PA420&dq=go+pound+sand+2003+kelly+clarkson&source=bl&ots=QnSUOWsUOH&sig=UlXJzN4a-12SF33XzxoAK88l1jA&hl=en&ei=oi6GTJnjJ9m5jAe4wpClBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=go%20pound%20sand%202003%20kelly%20clarkson&f=false Watching TV: six decades of American television] By Harry Castleman, Walter J.

===Judges===
The show had originally planned on having four judges following the ''Pop Idol'' format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.<ref name="NYT – American Idol"/> A fourth judge, radio DJ [[Stryker (disc jockey)|Stryker]], was originally chosen but he dropped out citing "image concerns."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/416531/stryker-strikes-out-the-man-who-was-supposed-to-be-the-fourth-idol-judge/ |title=Stryker Strikes Out: The Man Who Was Supposed To Be The Fourth 'Idol' Judge |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120015153/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/416531/stryker-strikes-out-the-man-who-was-supposed-to-be-the-fourth-idol-judge |archivedate=January 20, 2011 }}</ref> In the second season, New York radio personality [[Angie Martinez]] had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.<ref>{{cite news|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/10/31/new-judge-angie-martinez-drops-out-american-idol/|title= New judge Angie Martinez drops out of ''American Idol''|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season.

===Hosts===
The first season was co-hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Brian Dunkleman]] following the format of ''Pop Idol'' of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,<ref>{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kim|title='American Idol: The Untold Story' Book Author Richard Rushfield Talks Past 'Idol' Scandals, Backstage Divas and Season 10|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/01/18/american-idol-the-untold-story-book-author-richard-rushfield/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7cdl2%7csec1_lnk5%7c37044 |publisher=TV Squad|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref> making Seacrest the sole [[emcee]] of the show starting with the second season. Dunkleman did, however, return in the initial series finale on Fox. Seacrest returned for the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth seasons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bacle|first=Ariana|title=Ryan Seacrest returns to American Idol for ABC reboot |url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/20/ryan-seacrest-returns-american-idol-reboot/ |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref> On April 8, 2019, [[Bobby Bones]] subbed for Seacrest when he was out sick.

==Selection process==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}
In a series of steps, the show selected the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.

===Contestant eligibility===
The eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.americanidol.com/auditions/season_10/forms/ai10_auditions_rules.pdf|title=American Idol 10 Audition Rules|accessdate=February 24, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133435/http://media.americanidol.com/auditions/season_10/forms/ai10_auditions_rules.pdf|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> (in previous years by the audition stage).<ref name="season 4 rules"/>
{{wide image|American Idol Denver auditions panorama.jpg|700px|Season nine's Denver audition, at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]].}}

===Initial auditions===
Contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-01-19/secret-rituals-of-american-idol-auditions-exposed/|title=Secret Rituals of ''American Idol'' Auditions Exposed|publisher=Thedailybeast.com|date=January 19, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Hollywood week and Las Vegas round===
Once in Hollywood, the contestants performed individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together. In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice [[a cappella]] or accompanied by a band{{nsmdns}}depending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.

In the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists. At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty. In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called "Hollywood or Home" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood. In the fourteenth season, the "Hollywood or Home" round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at a LA nightclub or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24. In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii.

===Audience voting===
From the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants was decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a [[toll-free telephone number]] for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanidol.com/faq/ |title=American Idol FAQS |publisher=Americanidol.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110222034734/http://www.americanidol.com/faq/| archivedate= February 22, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110&nbsp;million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via [[text message|text messaging]] was made available in the second season when [[AT&T Wireless Services|AT&T Wireless]] joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5&nbsp;million text messages were sent to ''American Idol'' that season.<ref name="ATT 2003">{{cite web | title=AT&T Wireless and American Idol Set Global Records in Text Messaging; AT&T Wireless | publisher=Business Wire | url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030604005186/en/ATT-Wireless-American-Idol-Set-Global-Records |date=June 4, 2003}}</ref> The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178&nbsp;million texts by the eighth season.<ref name="ATT 2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=26832 |title=AT&T Announces the Eighth Season of 'American Idol' Smashes All-Time Record for Fan Engagement through Text Messaging |publisher=Att.com |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season.

===Semi-finals===
In the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.

From the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.

The wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward – the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer – for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at [[The Fillmore Detroit]], starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at [[Cathedral of Saint Vibiana]] in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the show repeated the process again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the [[Wiltern Theatre]] in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the [[COVID-19 outbreak]], the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, the judges were offered a Judges' Save, saving one of the bottom 10 from elimination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/idol-worship/9360756/american-idol-producers-explain-live-shows |title= How Is 'American Idol' Going to Go Live During the Pandemic?

===Finals===
The finals were broadcast in prime time from [[CBS Television City]] in Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as [[Motown]], [[disco]], or [[big band]], songs by artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]], or more general themes such as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. In the tenth season, [[Jimmy Iovine]] was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.

The most popular contestants were usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05012009/tv/adam_really_was_in_the_bottom_3_167038.htm |title=Adam Really Was in the Bottom 3 |author=Maxine Shen |work=New York Post |date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the [[American Idol (season 6)|sixth season]], during the series' first ever [[Idol Gives Back]] episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, starting in [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season]], the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a "Judges' Save" if they unanimously agreed to. "The save" could only be used once, and only up through the top five. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.

The "Fan Save" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.

===Season finale===
The finale was the two-hour last episode of the season, culminating in revealing the winner. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the [[Dolby Theatre]], which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]], which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the [[Nokia Theatre L.A. Live|Nokia Theater]], which holds an audience of over 7,000. In the sixteenth and seventeenth seasons, the venue did not change from the Finals. In the eighteenth season, the venue was at the contestants' homes.

===Rewards for winner and finalists===
The winner received a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2010/05/12/american-idol-contract-sex-judges-simon-cowell/ |title='Idol' Contestants – No Shtupping the Judges |publisher=Tmz.com |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NYT 02-24-2010">{{Cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/arts/television/24idol.html |title=Idol' Winners: Not Just Fame but Big Bucks |work=The New York Times |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |date=February 23, 2010}}</ref> and secures a management contract with ''American Idol''-affiliated [[19 Management]] (which has the [[right of first refusal]] to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts.

==Series overview and season synopses==
{{Main|List of American Idol episodes}}
Each season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.

With the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is [[Kristopher Pooley|Kris Pooley]], who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the ''American Idol'' band was led by [[Rickey Minor]] (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and [[Ray Chew]] (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and [[Debra Byrd]] to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.

===2002–2016: Fox===

====Season 1====
{{Main|American Idol (season 1)}}
[[File:Kelly Clarkson 57th Presidential Inauguration-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Kelly Clarkson]], the [[American Idol (season 1)|first season]] winner]]
The first season of ''American Idol'' debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.

In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, [[Tamyra Gray]], was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdirt.com/christina-christian-voted-off-american-idol-while-hospitalized/6496/ |title=Christina Christian Voted Off 'American Idol' While Hospitalized |publisher=Popdirt.com |date=August 8, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> [[Jim Verraros]] was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWUEAAAAMBAJ&q=teen%20idol's%20 |title=Teen Idol's Dream |publisher=The Advocate |date=January 21, 2003 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

The final showdown was between [[Justin Guarini]], one of the early favorites, and [[Kelly Clarkson]]. Clarkson was not initially thought of as a contender,<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/417463/fun-with-facts-things-you-didnt-know-about-american-idol-but-were-too-glued-to-your-tv-set-to-ask/ |title=Fun With Facts: Things You Didn't Know About 'American Idol' But Were Too Glued To Your TV Set To Ask |publisher=Yahoo Music Blogs: Reality Rocks |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122113040/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/417463/fun-with-facts-things-you-didnt-know-about-american-idol-but-were-too-glued-to-your-tv-set-to-ask |archivedate=January 22, 2011 }}</ref> but impressed the judges with some good performances in the final rounds, such as her performance of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman|Natural Woman]]", and [[Betty Hutton]]'s "[[Stuff Like That There]]", and eventually won the crown on September 4, 2002.

In what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, "[[A Moment Like This]]", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by [[The Beatles]] for the biggest leap to number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'', which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful ''Idol'' contestants internationally,<ref name="bronson 100"/> with worldwide album sales of more than 23&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2009/12/04/carrie-underwood-moves-past-kelly-clarkson-in-top-us-album-sales-by-an-american-idol-artist.htm |title=Carrie Underwood Moves Past Kelly Clarkson In Top US Album Sales By An ''American Idol'' Artist |publisher=Top40.about.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

Starting September 30, 2006, this season was repackaged as "''[[American Idol Rewind]]''" and syndicated directly to stations in the U.S.

====Season 2====
{{Main|American Idol (season 2)}}
[[File:Ruben Studdar 2 cropped.JPG|right|thumb|upright|[[Ruben Studdard]], the [[American Idol (season 2)|second season]] winner]]
Following the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Seacrest as the lone host. [[Kristin Adams]] was a correspondent for this season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/dailynews/extra/11_02/11_20b.html |title=American Idol |author=EXTRA |date=November 20, 2002}}</ref>

[[Corey Clark]] was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/after-probe-paula-abdul-remain-idol-wbna8931265 |title=After probe, Paula Abdul to remain on 'Idol' |agency=Associated Press |date=August 24, 2005 | work=[[Today (NBC program)|Today]] }}</ref> Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and [[Frenchie Davis]] for having previously modelled for an adult website.<ref name="mtv – screening">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484799/20040203/story.jhtml |title='American Idol' Steps Up Screening Process For Contestants |publisher=Mtv |date=February 4, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Ruben Studdard]] emerged as the winner, beating [[Clay Aiken]] by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.<ref name="Your Vote Doesn't Count">{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/153439-American_Idol_Outrage_Your_Vote_Doesn_t_Count.php |title=''American Idol'' Outrage: Your Vote Doesn't Count |author=Deborah Starr Seibel |date=May 17, 2004}}</ref> In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article9455.art&page=6 |title="It's Going to be a Very Strong Season, I Think": An Interview with American Idol Producer Nigel Lythgoe |author=Logan Martin |date=January 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220342/http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article9455.art&page=6 |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}</ref>

Both finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song "[[Flying Without Wings#Ruben Studdard version|Flying Without Wings]]" with his single release from the show "[[This Is the Night (Clay Aiken song)|This Is the Night]]", as well as in their subsequent album releases.

====Season 3====
{{Main|American Idol (season 3)}}
[[File:Fantasia Barrino.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Fantasia Barrino]], the [[American Idol (season 3)|third season]] winner]]
The third season premiered on January 19, 2004. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was [[William Hung]] whose off-key rendition of [[Ricky Martin]]'s "[[She Bangs]]" received widespread attention. His exposure on ''Idol'' landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the [[American Idol alumni album sales|third best-selling]] singer from that season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 24 American Idols of All Time |work=Billboard |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/reality-check/513688/top-24-american-idols-of-all-time |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112110915/http://www.billboard.com/features/top-24-american-idols-of-all-time-1004088662.story |archivedate=November 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, [[Fantasia Barrino]], [[LaToya London]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]], dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/buzz-over-jennifer-hudson-ouster-from-american-idol-3-continues-2518.php |title=Buzz over Jennifer Hudson's ouster from 'American Idol 3' continues |publisher=Realitytvworld.com |date=April 26, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes "incredibly racist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/040427/11/oqwi.html |title=Elton John Says 'American Idol' Vote Is 'Racist' |accessdate=April 29, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040429072819/http://au.news.yahoo.com/040427/11/oqwi.html |archivedate=April 29, 2004 |df=mdy }}, ''[[Reuters]] via Yahoo.com'', 2004-04-28, Retrieved on March 2, 2007.</ref> The prolonged stays of [[John Stevens (singer)|John Stevens]] and [[Jasmine Trias]] in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1536.art&page=1 |title="Simon Kept Me in My Place": An Interview with John Stevens |publisher=Foxesonidol.com |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227013627/http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1536.art&page=1 |archivedate=December 27, 2010 }}</ref>

The performance of "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]" by Barrino, later known simply as "Fantasia", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite ''Idol'' moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2010/05/simon_cowells_favorite_idol_moment.php |title=Simon Cowell's Favorite 'Idol' Moment |publisher=Extratv.warnerbros.com |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Fantasia and [[Diana DeGarmo]] were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner.

The fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition, although the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,<ref name="season 4 rules">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanidol.com/archive/season3/showinfo/rules.htm |title=Season 4 rules |date=April 22, 2006 |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422104846/http://www.americanidol.com/archive/season3/showinfo/rules.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2006 }}</ref> and among those who benefited from this new rule were [[Constantine Maroulis]] and [[Bo Bice]], the two rockers of the show.

The top 12 finalists originally included [[Mario Vazquez]], but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1498063/20050314/mario_vazquez.jhtml |title=Mario Vazquez Quits 'Idol' – 'It Wasn't Right For Me' Favored finalist drops out 'to focus on personal things.' |publisher=Mtv |date=March 14, 2005 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Nikko Smith]]. Later, an employee of Freemantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/03/12/fallen-idol-accused-of-masturbating-in-front-of-male-employe/ |title="A.I."

During the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.

In May 2005, [[Carrie Underwood]] was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song "[[Inside Your Heaven]]", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carrie-underwoods-inside-your-heaven-debuts-as-best-selling-song-in-the-nation-and-breaks-chart-history-54811132.html |title=Carrie Underwood's 'Inside Your Heaven' Debuts as Best Selling Song in the Nation and Breaks Chart History |publisher=[[PRNewswire]] |date=June 23, 2005}}</ref> As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful ''Idol'' contestant in the U.S.,<ref name="bronson 100">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1550614/american-idol-top-100-hits-of-all-time |title=Top 100 'American Idol' Hits of All Time|first= Fred |last=Bronson|date= May 12, 2015 |work=Billboard }}</ref> selling 16 million albums in the country,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jim Asker|title=Rewinding the Country Charts: 10 Years Ago, Carrie Underwood Motored to Her First No. 1|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6844256/rewinding-the-country-charts-10-years-ago-carrie-underwood|website=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=January 24, 2016|date=January 21, 2015}}</ref> while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/readers-poll-10-best-carrie-underwood-songs-20150310 |title=Readers' Poll: 10 Best Carrie Underwood Songs |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 10, 2015 |author=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/disqualified-brittenum-twins-return-for-american-idol-7-auditions-5681.php |title=Disqualified Brittenum twins return for 'American Idol 7' auditions |publisher=Realitytvworld.com |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Chris Daughtry]]'s performance of [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]'s "[[Hemorrhage (In My Hands)]]" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-05-12-daughtry-fuel_x.htm |title=Chris Daughtry gets job offer from Fuel |work=USA Today |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> His performance of [[Live (band)|Live]]'s version of "[[I Walk the Line]]" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526988/20060324/cash_johnny.jhtml |title=Did 'Idol' Contender Daughtry Go Over The Line With 'Walk The Line' Cover? |publisher=Mtv |date=March 24, 2006 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.

On May 30, 2006, [[Taylor Hicks]] was named ''American Idol'', with [[Katharine McPhee]] the runner-up. "[[Do I Make You Proud]]" was released as Hicks' first single and McPhee's was "[[My Destiny (Katharine McPhee song)|My Destiny]]".

Despite being eliminated earlier in the season, Chris Daughtry (as lead of the band [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]]) became the most successful recording artist from this season.<ref name="usatoday 2014">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/01/14/tv-singing-shows-stars-story/4478095/ |title=TV Singing Shows Fail To Create Stars |author=Bill Keveney |date=January 14, 2014 |work= USA Today }}</ref> Other contestants, such as Hicks, McPhee, [[Bucky Covington]], [[Mandisa]], [[Kellie Pickler]], and [[Elliott Yamin]] have had varying levels of success.

This season saw the first ''Idol Gives Back'' telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76&nbsp;million in corporate and viewer donations.<ref name="idol gives back"/> No contestant was eliminated that week, but two ([[Phil Stacey]] and [[Chris Richardson]]) were eliminated the next.

In the May 23 season finale, [[Jordin Sparks]] was declared the winner with the runner-up being [[Blake Lewis]]. Sparks has had some success as a recording artist post-''Idol''.

This season also saw the launch of the ''American Idol'' Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the "coronation song". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, "[[This Is My Now]]", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eonline.com/news/55228/jordin-sparks-idol-finale |title=Jordin Sparks Idol Finale |author= Natalie Finn |date= May 23, 2007 |work=E Online }}</ref>

The seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere.

For the finals, ''American Idol'' debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]]'s performance of "[[Billie Jean]]" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the [[Chris Cornell]] arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version.

[[David Archuleta]]'s performance of John Lennon's "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2011/01/jennifer-lopez-says-new-idol-judges-are-more-collaborative/1 |title=Jennifer Lopez says new 'Idol' judges are 'more collaborative' |work=USA Today |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Mansfield}}</ref> [[Jason Castro (singer)|Jason Castro]]'s semi-final performance of "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" also received considerable attention, and it propelled [[Jeff Buckley]]'s version of the song to the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Digital Songs|digital song]] chart.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeff-buckleys-hallelujah-becomes-americas-number-one-digital-song-56916532.html |title= Jeff Buckley's 'Hallelujah' Becomes America's Number One Digital Song |publisher= PRNewswire |date= March 13, 2008 |accessdate= November 6, 2012 }}</ref>  This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto [[iTunes]] after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickey.org/?p=7483 |title=David Cook – "Billie Jean" – # 1 Song on iTunes |publisher=Rickey.org |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=Musdan77 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.<ref name="usatoday 2014"/>

The ''American Idol'' Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the "coronation song". The winning song, "[[The Time of My Life (David Cook song)|The Time of My Life]]", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.

====Season 8====

[[File:Kris Allen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kris Allen]], the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season]] winner]]
The eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009.

In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] who left to focus on the international versions of his show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (American TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nigel Lythgoe leaving 'American Idol' |url=https://ew.com/article/2008/08/06/nigel-lythgoe-leaving-american-idol/ |website=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. ''Idol Gives Back'' was canceled for this season due to the [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]] at the time.

There were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the "Judges' Save", and [[Matt Giraud]] was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, [[Lil Rounds]] and [[Anoop Desai]] were eliminated.

The two finalists were [[Kris Allen]] and [[Adam Lambert]], both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season.

The ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. The upheaval at the judging panel continued. Ellen DeGeneres joined as a judge to replace Paula Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week.

One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General [[Larry Platt]] whose performance of "[[Pants on the Ground]]" became a viral hit song.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singh |first=Anita |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6998810/Pants-On-The-Ground-video-American-Idols-General-Larry-Platt-is-overnight-star.html |title=Pants On The Ground video: American Idol's General Larry Platt is overnight star |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Michael Lynche]] was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week [[Katie Stevens]] and [[Andrew Garcia]] were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first ''Idol'' alum to do so. ''Idol Gives Back'' returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.<ref name="idol gives back"/>

A special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.

The final two contestants were [[Lee DeWyze]] and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song – DeWyze chose [[U2]]'s "[[Beautiful Day]]", and Bowersox chose [[Patty Griffin]]'s "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/10/21/crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze-dropped-rca-scotty-mccreery-lauren-alaina/|title=Crystal Bowersox, Lee DeWyze both dropped by their record label: For 'Idol', what a difference a year makes |first= Grady|last=Smith |date= October 21, 2011 |work=EW }}</ref>

The tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of ''[[The X Factor (American TV series)|The X Factor]]''), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres,<ref name="newjudges">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1648433/american-idol-adds-jennifer-lopez-steven-tyler-as-judges/|title='American Idol' Adds Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler As Judges |publisher=MTV|date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> while [[Nigel Lythgoe]] returned as executive producer.

One of the more prominent contestants this year was [[Chris Medina]], whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1656795/chris-medina-american-idol/|title=Chris Medina's 'American Idol' Story Recalls Danny Gokey's |author=Gil Kaufman |date=January 27, 2011 |work=MTV }}</ref> Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. [[Casey Abrams]], who suffers from [[ulcerative colitis]], was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, [[Naima Adedapo]] and [[Thia Megia]] were both eliminated.

[[Pia Toscano]], one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former ''Idol'' contestants, as well as actor [[Tom Hanks]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Us Weekly |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jennifer-hudson-tom-hanks-outraged-over-pia-toscanos-idol-elimination-20110408 |title=Jennifer Hudson, Tom Hanks Outraged Over Pia Toscano's 'Idol' Elimination|work=Rolling Stone |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>

The two finalists in 2011 were [[Lauren Alaina]] and [[Scotty McCreery]], both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win ''American Idol''. McCreery released his first single, "[[I Love You This Big]]", as his coronation song, and Alaina released "[[Like My Mother Does]]". McCreery's debut album, ''[[Clear as Day]]'', became the first debut album by an ''Idol'' winner to reach No. 1 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since [[Ruben Studdard]]'s ''[[Soulful (Ruben Studdard album)|Soulful]]'' in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466103/idols-scotty-mccreery-makes-history-at-no-1-on-billboard-200 |title='Idol's' Scotty McCreery Makes History at No. 1 on Billboard 200 |magazine=Billboard |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

[[Jessica Sanchez]] received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their "save" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, [[Colton Dixon]] was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.

Phillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. Fifth season finalist [[Ace Young]] proposed marriage to third season runner-up [[Diana DeGarmo]] on stage – which she accepted.

Phillips released "[[Home (Phillip Phillips song)|Home]]" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released "[[Change Nothing (song)|Change Nothing]]".

[[File:Candice Glover 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Candice Glover]], the [[American Idol (season 12)|twelfth season]] winner]]
The twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj. This was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to [[TMZ (website)|TMZ]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/01/23/american-idol-nicki-minaj-mariah-carey-fight-country/|title='American Idol': Nicki Minaj-Mariah Carey brawl sparked by disagreement over 'country thing' |first=Annie|last=Barrett |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref>

The top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' "save" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.

23-year-old [[Candice Glover]] won the season with [[Kree Harrison]] taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win ''American Idol'' since [[Jordin Sparks]]. Glover released "[[I Am Beautiful]]" as a single while Harrison released "[[All Cried Out (Kree Harrison song)|All Cried Out]]" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aa-ways-american-idol-is-trying-to-win-you-back-20140113 |title=10 Ways 'American Idol' is Trying to Win You Back|work= RollingStone |first=Lyndsey|last=Parker|date=January 13, 2014 }}</ref>

''American Idol'' premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9&nbsp;million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30&nbsp;pm spot in over a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2044410.stm|title=US Pop Idol proves ratings hit|work=BBC News|date=June 14, 2002|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23&nbsp;million, with more than 40&nbsp;million watching some part of that show.<ref name="NY Times – September 6, 2002">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-success-of-american-idol-to-spawn-many-copycats.html|title=Success of 'American Idol' To Spawn Many Copycats|author=Bill Carter|author2= Stuart Elliott|date=September 6, 2002|work=The New York Times}}</ref> That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the [[key demographic|18–49 demographic]], the age group most valued by advertisers.<ref name="Watching TV: six decades of American television"/>

The sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of ''American Idol.'' During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,<ref name="carter"/> as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. The show was dubbed "the [[Graveyard slot#Opposite dominant television series|Death Star]]",<ref name="death star"/> and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.<ref name="carter"/> However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.<ref name="realitytvworld_5/24/2007"/>

The loss of viewers continued into the seventh season.

The eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/arts/television/american-idol-ponders-a-ratings-dip-on-fox.html?_r=1|title='Idol' Grapples With Its Own Competition|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 22, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012|first=Brian|last1=Stelter}}</ref> The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16–21% in overall viewer numbers and 24–27% in the 18/49 demo,<ref name="week1">{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=TV Ratings Broadcast Top 25: Giants-49ers, 'American Idol,' 'Big Bang Theory' Top Week 18|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/24/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-giants-49ers-american-idol-big-bang-theory-top-week-18/117360/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126162514/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/24/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-giants-49ers-american-idol-big-bang-theory-top-week-18/117360/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 26, 2012|publisher=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=January 25, 2012|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18–49 demo.<ref name="may2012"/> The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo.

The loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18–49 demo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/03/22/american-idol-how-low-will-the-ratings-go/|title='American Idol' drops again: How low will the ratings go?|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=Entertainment Weekly|date= March 24, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18–49 demo.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/american-idol-finale-tumbles-on-a-very-crowded-thursday-1200482948/|title='American Idol' Finale Down 44% From Last Year|work=Variety|author=Rick Kissell|date=May 17, 2013}}</ref> The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/05/21/american-idol-judges-fired-mariah-carey-nicki-minaj/|title= 'American Idol' at a crossroads: Next season to bring fresh judges, many changes|first=Hollie|last=McKay|work=Fox News|date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18–49 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and ''American Idol'' lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013–14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.<ref name="judges_season_14">{{cite news|url= https://ew.com/article/2014/06/23/american-idol-judges-season-14/|title=All the 'American Idol' judges will return for season 14|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

The continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of [[Coca-Cola]] as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).<ref name="variety-idolsing">{{cite web|title=Fox Faces Challenge to Make 'American Idol' Sing|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/features/fox-faces-challenge-to-rejuvenate-american-idol-1201379994/|website=Variety|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref><ref name="deadline-idolcancelled">{{cite web|title='American Idol' Renewed For Final Season|url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/american-idol-renewed-final-season-15-1201424278/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name="bosglobe-idol2015">{{cite web|title=In season 14, 'American Idol' hoping to bounce back|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2015/01/05/american-idol-the-search-for-next-pop-star-and-its-growing-pains/QmQXmq0nNqZw7RJfp9K6BI/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate= January 7, 2015}}</ref> On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of ''American Idol'' would be its last.<ref name="Idol Cancellation (May 2015)"/> Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply.

For the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox.

===Critical reception===
Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' considered that "As TV, ''American Idol'' is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential".<ref>{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker |url= https://ew.com/article/2002/07/04/american-idol-2/ |title= American Idol: Read EW's original review|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 4, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Others, however, thought that "the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed".<ref name="Watching TV: six decades of American television"/> It was also described as a "sadistic musical bake-off",<ref>{{cite web|author=Carina Chocano |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/diary/2002/09/04/american_idol |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908193257/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/diary/2002/09/04/american_idol |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |title=How to make an "American Idol" |work=Salon.com |date=September 4, 2002 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 }}</ref> and "a romp in humiliation".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Jewel |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/jun02/jun10/5_fri/news3friday.html |title='American Idol,' so needlessly cruel |work=Medialife|date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103205541/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/jun02/jun10/5_fri/news3friday.html |archivedate=November 3, 2009 }}</ref> Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms.

Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of ''Entertainment Weekly'', thought that "for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, ''Idol'' provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business."<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/fashion/16Idol.html| title = Worshiping at the 'Idol' Church| first=Michael|last=Slezak|work=The New York Times| date = May 14, 2010}}</ref> Singer [[Sheryl Crow]], who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show "undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/american-idol/sheryl-crow-doesnt-get-america-4988.aspx |title=Sheryl Crow Doesn't get American Idol |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=March 14, 2007 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> Pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] nevertheless suggested that Idol has "reshaped the American songbook", "led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture", and connects "the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2012/05/23/153316590/the-end-of-idol-there-are-no-more-songs-left-to-be-sung |title=The End Of 'Idol': There Are No More Songs Left To Be Sung |author=Ann Powers |publisher=NPR |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2012 }}</ref> Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of ''[[Newsweek]]'' accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that "Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ramin Setoodeh |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/05/24/it-s-a-cruel-cruel-world.html |title=It's a Cruel, Cruel World |work=Newsweek |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120012437/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/05/24/it-s-a-cruel-cruel-world.html| archivedate= January 20, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Some such as singer [[John Mayer]] disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on ''Idol'' are not real artists with self-respect.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hiatt |first=Brian |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/04/01/john-mayer-disses-american-idol/|title=John Mayer disses ''American Idol''|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 1, 2003 |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref>

Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show.

The show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch ''American Idol'' during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as [[Kentucky]], were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.<ref name="MSNBC10"/> Data from [[Nielsen SoundScan]], a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47&nbsp;million CDs sold by ''Idol'' contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.<ref name="MSNBC10"/>

Theories given for the success of Southerners on ''Idol'' have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the [[Bible Belt]], where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.<ref name="MSNBC10"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/17/AR2006041701758.html |title=Who Put The Y'all In 'Idol'?|author=Neely Tucker |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= April 18, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/25/american-idol-winner-south |title=American Idol: why do southerners always seem to win? |author= Harry J Enten |newspaper=Guardian |date=May 25, 2012 }}</ref> Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.<ref name="MSNBC04">{{Cite news|url=http://www.today.com/id/5053569|title=Rise of the South on 'American Idol'|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Today.com|date=May 26, 2004|accessdate=April 15, 2010}}</ref> According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of [[Alabama]], "People in the South have a lot of pride ...
