"'''Picture to Burn'''"  is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was written by Swift and [[Liz Rose]], and produced by [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. It was released on February 3, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]] and [[Republic Records]] as the fourth [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] (2006). It was inspired by the narcissistic and cocky nature of her former high school classmate and ex-boyfriend Jordan Alford with whom Swift never established a formal relationship. In retrospect, Swift has stated that she has evolved on a personal level and as a songwriter, claiming she processed emotions differently since "Picture to Burn". The song was chosen as a single based on the audience's reaction to it in concert. Musically, the track is of the [[country rock]] genre with prominent usage of [[guitar]], [[banjo]], and [[drumkit|drums]]. The lyrics concern setting fire to photographs of a former boyfriend.

"Picture to Burn" was praised by music critics, some who supported the feminist message. The single was commercially successful, peaking at number 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number three on the [[Hot Country Songs|country-genre chart]]. It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold over one million downloads. In Canada, it charted within the top 50 and was certified gold. The [[music video]] for "Picture to Burn" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]] and features Swift fantasizing about taking revenge on her ex-boyfriend after she discovers him with another woman. The video also has Swift and her band performing with [[pyrotechnics]] as a backdrop. Swift promoted "Picture to Burn" via live performances, including numerous while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. It was also performed on her first headlining tour, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009–10).

==Background and release==
"Picture to Burn" was inspired by her high school boyfriend Jordan Alford with whom Swift did not establish a formal romantic relationship. She was his classmate at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee and they went out before he dated classmate Chelsea who would later become his wife. She was frequently frustrated by his narcissistic and cocky nature, and decided to write a song about how she felt at her after school job, writing songs for [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[ATV Music]].<ref name="gacblog">{{cite web|title=Ask the Artist: Detective Swift, at Your Service|first=Taylor|last=Swift|work=[[Great American Country]]|publisher=[[Scripps Networks Interactive]]|date=February 12, 2007}}</ref> It was co-written with [[Liz Rose]] on [[guitar]], and given a comedic edge (an idea of Swift's). Swift found herself sitting, playing her guitar, and saying, "I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!', a line that was ultimately developed into the song's chorus.<ref name="gacblog" /> Swift described it as brutally honest,

"It's OK to be mad after a breakup or after something goes wrong with a relationship", Swift said.<ref name="flamesto" /> The subject of "Picture to Burn" remains unaware that he is the inspiration behind the song.<ref name="gacblog" /> The song was chosen as a [[single (music)|single]] based on the reactions it garnered at concerts. Swift recalled that, although "[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]" (2006) was her only single at the time she began opening for [[Rascal Flatts]]' Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07), "Picture to Burn" was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it "at the top of their lungs".<ref name="onset">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'Picture to Burn'|minutes=22:06|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>

In retrospect, Swift has stated that the song was something typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding "I didn't know anything then."<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1664730/taylor-swift-songwriting.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Explains How Her Songwriting Has Grown|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|author2=Sway Calloway|date=May 27, 2011|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> She explained, "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different."<ref name="mtv" /> Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.<ref name="mtv" /> "Picture to Burn" was released as the fourth single from ''Taylor Swift'' on February 3, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]] and [[Republic Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=69239#2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HkD4d8lG?url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=69239|archive-date=2013-06-29|work=[[FMQB|Friday Morning Quarterback]]|title=Format Rooms: CHR: 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gfa.radioandrecords.com/publishGFA/GFANextPage.asp?sDate=02/03/2008&Format=4|title=R&R :: Going For Adds :: Country (Week Of: February 3, 2008)|work=[[Radio & Records]]|accessdate=May 19, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130828091347/http://gfa.radioandrecords.com/publishGFA/GFANextPage.asp?sDate=02/03/2008&Format=4|archive-date=August 28, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Music video==
The accompanying [[music video]] for "Picture to Burn" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed all three of Swift's prior music videos. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos, she knew how to deviate from it and what new grounds to cover.<ref name="onset" /> As opposed to their previous collaborations, the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical.<ref name="flamesto" /> Swift herself was styled edgier than usual, sporting clothing, hair, and jewelry she was not accustomed to.<ref name="flamesto" /><ref name="onset" /> She was intended to wear thigh-length boots, but was not able to find a pair to correspond with her height. Instead, her stylist sewed black fabric to strap onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh-length boots.<ref name="flamesto" /> The video's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend.<ref name="onset" /> Swift chose football player [[Justin Sandy]] to portray her ex-boyfriend in the video, believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor;<ref>{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'White Horse'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country }}</ref> she described him as "real life [[Ken (doll)|Ken]]".<ref name="onset" /> Swift desired to portray her backup band's sense of humor, and thus enlisted them for the video. Swift's real-life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the video.<ref name="onset" />

The video was filmed over the course of two days in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. On the first day, performance scenes were filmed inside the [[Sommet Center]] (now named the Bridgestone Arena), and involved [[pyrotechnic]]s.<ref name="onset" /> Swift was at first nervous about the shoot, as it was her first experience with pyrotechnics. "There are some things I'm nervous about. My hair could very well catch on fire", she said.<ref name="onset" /> She was later assured of its safety and explained to about the discrepancy in the distance of the fire in reality than on camera: on camera, it appears to be quite close to her, whereas, in actuality, it was placed far behind her.<ref name="onset" /> On the second day, the remaining scenes were filmed at a suburban house in Nashville. Props were provided by the video personnel.<ref name="onset" /> On the set, Fanjoy suggested using [[binoculars]] for the primary scenes, but Swift disagreed, believing it could come across as cheesy depending on how it was filmed. She ultimately succumbed to the idea due to Fanjoy explaining how it would translate on camera.<ref name="onset" />

The video premiered on March 14, 2008 on [[AOL]]'s The Boot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2008/03/14/video-premiere-picture-to-burn-taylor-swift/|title=Video Premiere: 'Picture to Burn,' Taylor Swift|date=March 14, 2008|work=The Boot|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> It commences with Swift and her best friend in a grey [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)#45th Anniversary Edition (2009 GT)|2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition]], parked behind a tree. Swift reminiscences, looking at a photograph of her and her ex-boyfriend together, and states, "Would you look at how happy we were back then? I can't believe he turned out to be such a jerk." Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars, and spots Swift's ex-boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s [[Ford F-150]] pick-up truck. She notes the other woman is driving the truck, and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it. As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, the music begins and the video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed in a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an [[electric guitar]], alongside her backup band. During the song's chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights. Swift is sitting on a brown couch, sporting a black tank top, black leather pants and a [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairdo, as the band ransacks the house. They throw darts at photographs of Swift's ex, envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper, mess his mirror with the word "loser", lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash. Suddenly, the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house, and, seeing this, Anderson informs Swift and the band via [[walkie-talkie|handheld transceiver]]. He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked, and repeats the name "Taylor". The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang, with Anderson also repeating "Taylor". She then suggests leaving, and Swift says, "You know what? I'm over it." The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames, thrown in the sidewalk. Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room, Swift singing on the couch, or Swift dancing in front of a backdrop of a shower of [[Spark (fire)|sparks]]. {{As of|2020|April}}, the video has 105 million views on [[YouTube]].
