A '''conjugal visit''' is a scheduled period in which an inmate of a [[prison]] or [[jail]] is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with a visitor, usually their legal spouse. The parties may engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  The generally recognized basis for permitting such visits in modern times is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to ordinary life after release from prison. They also provide an incentive to inmates to comply with the various day-to-day rules and regulations of the prison.

Conjugal visits usually take place in designated rooms or a structure provided for that purpose, such as a trailer or a small cabin. Supplies such as soap, condoms, lubricant, bed linens, and towels may be provided.

===Germany===
[[Germany]] allows prisoners and their spouses or partners to apply for conjugal visits. Those who are approved are allowed unsupervised visits so that prisoners can preserve intimate bonds with their partners. However, prisoners{{clarify<!--the prisoners or the visitors?-->|date=August 2017}} are searched before being allowed a visit. In 2010, an inmate murdered his girlfriend and attempted suicide during a visit, leading to additional criticism of the lax security in German prisons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/outrage-over-lax-security-prisoner-murders-girlfriend-during-conjugal-visit-a-688736.html|title=Outrage over Lax Security: Prisoner Murders Girlfriend During Conjugal Visit|work=spiegel.de}}</ref>

===Israel===
The [[Israel Prison Service]] (IPS) allows standard conjugal visits to inmates who are married or are in a common-law relationship or if their partner has been visiting them frequently for at least two years, and have a record of good behavior. Inmates who receive prison furloughs are not eligible for conjugal visits. Conjugal visits can be withheld on security grounds or as a means of punishment for misbehavior. IPS guidelines were clarified in July 2013 to allow conjugal visits of same-sex partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/179785/gay-israeli-prisoners-win-right-to-conjugal-visits/|title=Gay Israeli Prisoners Win Right to Conjugal Visits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4291171,00.html|title=Conjugal visits for gay prisoners?

===Netherlands===
Per December 2015, The Netherlands allows for one conjugal visit ('Bezoek zonder Toezicht' - 'Unsupervised Visit') per month, provided the imprisonment period is at least six months and there's a close and durable relation between the partners. This does not apply to maximum security penitentiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commissievantoezicht.nl/dossiers/contact_buitenwereld/contact_buitenwereld_gedetineerden/bezoek|title=Bezoek gedetineerden}}</ref>

===Russia===
In the [[Russia]]n penal system, since a campaign of prison reform that began in 2001, well-behaved prisoners are granted an eighteen-day holiday furlough from incarceration to see loved ones. Prisoners also get extended on-site family visits, approximately once per month.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article670530.ece?token=null&offset=0 | work=The Times | location=London | title=After the Gulag conjugal visits computers and a hint of violence | first=Giles | last=Whittell | date=2 June 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], prisoners are allowed conjugal visits every four to eight weeks. They are held in private rooms and can last up to three hours. Couples are provided with condoms, shower facilities, and clean towels.<ref name="BBC News Sex on sentence"/>

=== Turkey ===
Since April 2013, the Turkish General Directorate of Prisons and Detention offers conjugal visits as a reward to well-behaved prisoners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/example-conjugal-visit-rooms-introduced-in-eastern-province.aspx?pageID=238&nID=44059&NewsCatID=339|title=RIGHTS - Example 'conjugal visit' rooms introduced in eastern province|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
The [[England|English]], [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] prison systems do not allow conjugal visits. However, home visits, with a greater emphasis on building other links with the outside world to which the prisoner will be returned, are allowed. These home visits are usually only granted to prisoners who have a few weeks to a few months remaining of a long sentence. Furthermore, home visits are more likely to be granted if the prisoner is deemed to have a low risk of absconding (i.e. prisoners being held in [[open prison]]s have a better chance of being granted home visits than prisoners being held in closed conditions).

===United States ===
In ''Lyons v. Gilligan'' (1974), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that prisoners have no federal constitutional right to conjugal visits with their spouses during sentences.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Lyons v. Gilligan|vol=382|reporter=F. Supp.|opinion=198|court=[[N.D. Ohio]]|date=1974|url=https://casetext.com/case/lyons-v-gilligan}}</ref>

The [[United States Federal Bureau of Prisons]] does not allow conjugal visits for prisoners in federal custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/inmate_locator/conjugal.jsp|title=Conjugal Visits: General Information|website=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref> For prisoners in state custody, the availability of conjugal visits is governed by the law of the particular state.  Where conjugal visits are allowed, inmates must meet certain requirements to qualify for this privilege:

The visitor may be required to undergo a background check, and the inmate must also be free of any [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. As a matter of procedure, both visitor and inmate are searched before and after the visit, to ensure that the visitor has not attempted to smuggle any items into or out of the facility.

The first state to implement conjugal visits was Mississippi in the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] (Parchman). It was enacted to convince black male prisoners to work harder in their manual labor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=The Dark Origins of Conjugal Visits|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-dark-origins-of-conjugal-visits/|website=Priceonomics|accessdate=22 June 2020}}</ref> [[Jorja Leap]], a professor of social welfare at the [[Luskin School of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] stated that criminologists believe allowing conjugal visits would build family ties and reduce recidivism.<ref name=Sanburn>{{cite web|last=Sanburn|first=Josh|url=http://nation.time.com/2014/01/13/mississippi-ending-conjugal-visits-for-prisoners/|title=Mississippi Ending Conjugal Visits for Prisoners|website=[[TIME (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> Over the last 40 years, most new prisons included special buildings specifically designed for "Sunday visits."<ref name=Legalzoom>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/marriage-divorce-family-law/marriage-domestic-partnership/conjugal-visits-preserving-family-bonds|title=Conjugal Visits: Preserving family bonds behind bars|first=Patrick|last=Rodgers|publisher=[[LegalZoom]]|date=September 2009|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>

By the early 1990s, 17 states had conjugal programs. According to Leap, conjugal visits declined after an increase in attitudes that prison should be a place for punishment and that conjugal visits were not appropriate for people being punished, and also because academic literature in the 1980s and 1990s argued that it was not possible to rehabilitate some criminals.<ref name=Sanburn/>

In June 2007, the [[California Department of Corrections]] announced it would allow same-sex conjugal visits. The policy was enacted to comply with a 2005 state law requiring state agencies to give the same rights to domestic partners that heterosexual couples receive. The new rules allow for visits only by registered married same sex couples or domestic partners who are not themselves incarcerated. Further, the same-sex marriage or domestic partnership must have been established before the prisoner was incarcerated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18994457|title=Calif. gay inmates get conjugal visits|work=[[Associated Press]] at [[NBC News]]|date=2 June 2007|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>

As of 2008, conjugal visitation programs are now known as the extended-family visits or family-reunion visits because mothers, fathers, and other family members may attend these visits. The focus is on family ties and rehabilitation.<ref name=Legalzoom/>

In April 2011, New York adopted legislation to allow family visits for married partners.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/23/2011-04-23_paint_the_clinks_pink_conjugal_visits_allowed_for_gay_inmates_and_partners.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Conjugal visits allowed for inmates and partners in same-sex marriages, civil unions}}</ref>
In January 2014, the head of the [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]], Chris Epps, terminated the state conjugal program.<ref name=Sanburn/> New Mexico announced it was also ending its program in May 2014. The four states that currently allow conjugal visits are California, Connecticut, New York, and Washington.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dopplr.com/social-atlas/|title=Conjugal Visits: Rules and History|website=[[Dopplr]]|date=15 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424091505/http://www.dopplr.com/social-atlas/|archivedate=24 April 2016}}</ref>
