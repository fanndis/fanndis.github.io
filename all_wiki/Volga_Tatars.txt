The '''Volga Tatars''' are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group native to the [[Idel-Ural|Volga-Ural region]] of [[Russia]]. They are subdivided into various subgroups. Volga Tatars are Russia's second-largest [[ethnicity]] after the [[Russians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermag.com/kazan-tatars-see-no-future-for-themselves-in-putins-russia/|title=Kazan Tatars See No Future for Themselves in Putin’s Russia|publisher=The Interpreter|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> They compose 53% of the population of [[Tatarstan]] and 25% of the population of [[Bashkortostan]].

==Volga Tatar history==
{{Further|Tartary|Tatarstan}}
Tatars inhabiting the Republic of Tatarstan, a federal subject of Russia, constitute one third of all Tatars, while the other two thirds reside outside Tatarstan. Some of the communities residing outside Tatarstan developed before the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, as Tatars were specialized in trading.<ref name="princeton">{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm|title=TATAR. THE LANGUAGE OF THE LARGEST MINORITY IN RUSSIA|publisher=Princeton University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213002624/http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm|archive-date=2006-12-13}}</ref>

The emergence of the ethnonym "Tatar" is disputed: two theories independently explain its origins. The Mongol thesis, according to which its etymology can be traced back to the Chinese ''"Ta-Tan"'' or ''"Da-Dan"'', is more widely accepted than the Turkic one.<ref name="rorlich"/> The ethnonym "Tatar" first emerged in the fifth century CE/AD.<ref name="brittanica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tatar|title=Tatar|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

During the 14th century, [[Sunni Islam]] was adopted by many of the Tatars.<ref name="brittanica"/> Tatars became subjects of Russia after the [[Siege of Kazan]] in 1552.<ref name="gorenburg"/> Since Russians associated Tatars with the Mongol [[Golden Horde]] (which ruled Russia in the 13th century), they began to negatively stereotype the Tatar people. Such negative stereotypes have persisted into modern Russian society. Some Tatar intellectuals have tried to link Tatar heritage with the historic [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] population of today's Tatarstan.

Russians were using the Tatar ethnonym during the 18th and 19th centuries to denote all Turkic inhabitants of the Russian Empire,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Tatars|volume=26|pages=448–449|first=Peter|last=Kropotkin|authorlink=Peter Kropotkin|first2=Charles|last2=Eliot|author2link=Charles Eliot (diplomat)}}</ref> but, before the emergence of the Soviet Union, the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire  did not generally identify as Tatars.<ref name="gorenburg">{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no7_ses/chapter04.pdf|title=TATARS AS MESO-NATION|author=DMITRY GORENBURG}}</ref> Up to the end of the 19th century, Volga Tatars mainly identified as Muslims, until the rehabilitation of the ethnonym Tatar occurred.<ref name="rorlich">{{cite web|url=http://groznijat.tripod.com/fadlan/rorlich1.html|title=1. The Origins of the Volga Tatars|author=Azade-Ayshe Rorlich|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref> Russian officials used literary Tatar language to interact with the [[Turkic peoples]] of the [[Russian Empire]] before the end of the 19th century. The Volga Tatar role in the Muslim national and cultural movements of the Russian Empire before the 1917 Revolution is significant and this continued even after 1917.<ref name="princeton"/> Tatar authorities have attempted since the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to reverse the [[Russification]] of Tatarstan that took place during the Soviet period.<ref name="gorenburg"/>

==Volga Tatar subgroups==
===Kazan Tatars===
[[File:Aida Garifullina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|190px|Volga Tatar operatic soprano [[Aida Garifullina]]]]
The majority of Volga Tatars are Kazan Tatars. They form the bulk of the Tatar population of Tatarstan. Traditionally, they inhabit the left bank of [[Volga|Volga river]].<ref>Татары (Серия «Народы и культуры» РАН). М.: Наука, 2001. — P.36.</ref>

[[Khazar]] invasions forced the Bulgars, Turkic people, to migrate from the [[Azov]] steppes to the Middle Volga and lower [[Kama River|Kama]] region during the first half of the eighth century.<ref name="rorlich"/> In the period of 10th–13th centuries, Turkic peoples, including Kipchaks, migrated from Southern [[Siberia]] to Europe. They played a significant role in the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus']] in the 13th century. Tatar ethnogenesis took place after Turkic peoples, who were mixed with the Bulgars and other local inhabitants of the Volga River area, kept Kipchak dialect and became Muslims. Several new Tatar states had emerged by the 1500s after the Golden Horde fell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CquTz6ps5YgC|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|editor=James S. Olson|year=1994|pages=624–625}}</ref> These states were [[Khanate of Kazan]], [[Astrakhan Khanate]], [[Khanate of Sibir]] and [[Crimean Khanate]].<ref name="brittanica"/>

Controversy surrounds the origin of the Tatar people, whether they are descended either from Bulgars or Golden Horde.<ref name="princeton"/> According to one theory, [[Kazan]] Tatar heritage can be traced back to Kipchaks of the Golden Horde, yet according to another theory, the Tatars emerged from the Bulgar culture that survived the Mongol conquest of 1236–1237.<ref name="rorlich"/>

===Mishars===
[[Mishars]] (or Mişär-Tatars)  are an ethnographic group of Volga Tatars speaking [[Mishar Tatar dialect|Mishar]] dialect of the [[Tatar language]]. They comprise approximately one third of the Volga Tatar population. They are descendants of Cuman-Kipchak tribes who mixed with the [[Burtas]] in the Middle [[Oka River]] area and Meschiora. Nowadays, they live in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhegorodskaya]] oblasts of Russia and in Tatarstan, [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Mordovia]].

===Qasím Tatars===
The Qasím Tatars have their capital in the town of Qasím ([[Kasimov]] in Russian transcription) in [[Ryazan Oblast]]. See "[[Qasim Khanate]]" for their history. Today, there are 1,100 Qasím Tatars living in Kasimov. There is no reliable information about their number elsewhere.

===Noqrat Tatars===
Noqrat Tatars live in Russia's Republic of [[Udmurtia]] and [[Kirov Oblast]]. In 1920s their number was around 15,000 people.

===Perm (Ostyak) Tatars===
Ethnographic subgroup of Kazan Tatars that lives in Russia's [[Perm Krai]]. Some Tatar scholars (as Zakiev) name them ''[[Ostyak]] Tatars''. Their number is (2002) c.130,000 people.

===Keräşens===
{{main|Kryashens}}

A policy of Christianization of the Muslim Tatars was enacted by the Russian authorities, beginning in 1552, resulting in the emergence of Keräşens (Christianized Tatars).{{sfn|Brower|2001|p=271}}

Many Volga Tatars were forcibly Christianized by [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] during the 16th century, and continued to face forced baptisms and conversions under subsequent Russian rulers and Orthodox clergy up to the 60s of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yemelianova|first=Galina M.|title=Russia and Islam: A Historical Survey|url=https://archive.org/details/russiaislamhisto00yeme|url-access=limited|publisher=Palgrave|year=2002|isbn=0-333-68354-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/russiaislamhisto00yeme/page/n60 36]–41}}</ref>

Some public figures suppose that the [[Sabir people|Suars]] were ancestors of the Keräşen Tatars, and had been converted to Christianity by [[Armenians]] in the 6th century while they lived in the [[Caucasus]]. Suars, like other tribes which later converted to Islam, became Volga Bulgars, and later the modern [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] (who are Orthodox Christians) and Kazan Tatars (who are [[Muslims]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Keräşen Tatars live in much of the Volga-Ural area.  Today, they tend to be assimilated among the Chuvash,{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Russians and Tatars.  Eighty years of [[Atheism|Atheistic]] Soviet rule made Tatars of both faiths not as religious as they once were. Russian names are largely the only remaining difference between Tatars and Keräşen Tatars.

Some Cuman tribes in the Golden Horde were converted to Christianity in the 13th and 14th centuries ([[Nestorianism]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}  Some prayers, written during that time in the ''[[Codex Cumanicus]]'', sound like modern Keräşen prayers, but the connection between Christian Cumans and modern Keräşens is unknown.{{Importance inline|date=April 2020}}

==1921–22 famine in Tatarstan==
{{main|1921–22 famine in Tatarstan}}
The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar ASSR]] as a result of [[war communism]] policy,{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=18}}<ref>{{Citation|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|date=October 1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1jsgYCoRioC|last1=Werth|last2=Panné|last3=Paczkowski|last4=Bartosek|last5=Margolin|first1=Nicolas|first2=Jean-Louis|first3=Andrzej|first4=Karel|first5=Jean-Louis|author1-link=Nicolas Werth|author3-link=Andrzej Paczkowski|pages=92–97; 116–21|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|editor-last=Courtois|editor-first=Stéphane|editor-link=Stéphane Courtois|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2}}</ref> in which 500,000{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=98}} to 2,000,000{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=281}} peasants died. The event was part of the greater [[Russian famine of 1921–22]] that affected other parts of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]],{{sfn|Millar|2004|p=56}} in which up 5,000,000 people died in total.{{sfn|Millar|2004|p=270}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2011/pr-famine-040411.html|title=How the U.S. saved a starving Soviet Russia: PBS film highlights Stanford scholar's research on the 1921-23 famine|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=4 April 2011|website=Stanford News Service|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref>

==Population figures==
In the 1910s, they numbered about half a million in the area of [[Kazan]].<ref name=EB1911/> Nearly 2 million Volga Tatars died in the [[1921–22 famine in Tatarstan]]. Some 15,000 belonging to the same stem had either migrated to [[Ryazan]] in the center of Russia (what is now European Russia) or had been settled as prisoners during the 16th and 17th centuries in [[Lithuania]]<ref name=EB1911/> ([[Vilnius]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], and [[Podolia]]). Some 2,000 resided in [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]].
Volga-Ural Tatars number nearly 7 million, mostly in Russia and the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]. While the bulk of the population is found in Tatarstan (around 2 million) and neighbouring regions, significant number of Volga-Ural Tatars live in [[Siberia]], Central Asia, and the Caucasus.  Outside of Tatarstan, urban Tatars usually speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as their first language (in cities such as [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Nizhniy Novgorod]], [[Ufa]], and cities of the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] and Siberia).
