== Background ==
{{Main|History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi}}
=== Leadership ===
[[Muammar Gaddafi]] was the head of the Free Officers, a group of Arab nationalists that deposed [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] in 1969 in a "bloodless coup."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Qaddafi Is No Mubarak as Regime Overthrow May Trigger a 'Descent to Chaos' |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/qaddafi-is-no-mubarak-overthrow-may-mean-descent-to-chaos-.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226160548/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/qaddafi-is-no-mubarak-overthrow-may-mean-descent-to-chaos-.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2011 |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011 |work=Bloomberg L.P. |author=Viscus, Gregory}}</ref> He abolished the [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|Libyan Constitution of 1951]], considering it a neocolonial document. From 1969 until 1975 standards of living, life expectancy and literacy grew rapidly. In 1975 he published his manifesto ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''. He officially stepped down from power in 1977, and subsequently claimed to be merely a "symbolic figurehead" until 2011, with the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan government]] up until then also denying that he held any power.<ref name="telegraph_gaddafi">{{cite news|last=Wynne-Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Libyan minister claims Gaddafi is powerless and the ceasefire is 'solid'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8393285/Libyan-minister-claims-Gaddafi-is-powerless-and-the-ceasefire-is-solid.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=19 March 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref name="jazeera_gaddafi">{{cite news|title=Gaddafi: Libya dignity under attack|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201132113120236750.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=2 March 2011}}</ref>

Libya was officially run by a system of people's committees which served as local governments for the country's subdivisions, an indirectly elected [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] as the legislature, and the [[Cabinet of Libya|General People's Committee]], led by a Secretary-General, as the executive branch.

According to several Western media sources, Gaddafi feared a military coup against his government and deliberately kept Libya's military relatively weak. The [[Libyan Army (1951-2011)|Libyan Army]] consisted of about 50,000 personnel. Its most powerful units were four crack brigades of highly equipped and trained soldiers, composed of members of Gaddafi's tribe or members of other tribes loyal to him. One, the [[Khamis Brigade]], was led by his son [[Khamis Gaddafi|Khamis]]. Local militias and Revolutionary Committees across the country were also kept well-armed. By contrast, regular military units were poorly armed and trained, and were armed with largely outdated military equipment.<ref name="KFMBChannel8">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/14084125/clampdown-in-libyan-capital-as-protests-close-in|title=Qaddafi Survival Means Weak Army, Co-Opted Tribes |agency=Associated Press|work=KFMB-TV|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134404618/gadhafis-military-muscle-concentrated-in-elite-units |title=Gadhafi's Military Muscle Concentrated In Elite Units |publisher=[[NPR]] |date= 10 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115955467 |title=Video Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi's Forces Facing Modern Firepower From RAF |publisher=Sky News |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322213900/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115955467 |archive-date=22 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment portfolios amounting to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies.<ref name="lib.ohchr.org">{{cite web|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session9/LY/A_HRC_WG.6_9_LBY_1_Libya_E.pdf |title=U.N.

In December 2009, Gaddafi reportedly told government officials that Libya would soon experience a "new political period" and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He also promised that international monitors would be included to ensure fair elections. His speech was said to have caused a stir. These elections were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya's usual periodic elections for the Popular Committees, [[General People's Committee|Basic People's Committees]], [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congress]]es, and [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congresses]], in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/libya-wikileaks/8294906/AL-QADHAFI-SUGGESTS-LIBYAN-ELECTIONS-MAY-BE-IN-THE-OFFING.html |title=Al-Qadhafi Suggests Libyan Elections May Be In The Offing |work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=WikiLeaks |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

In June 2011, a more detailed investigation by Amnesty International found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to be false or to lack any credible evidence, saying that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence.<ref name="AmnestyRape"/>

In July 2011, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] had an interview with [[Russia Today]] in which he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He said that he was not a member of the government or the military and therefore had no authority to give such orders. He also said that his father made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], who later defected to the rebel forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which he said Fatah Younis responded that protesters were attacking a military site and soldiers were acting in self-defense.<ref name="Smith">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|work=The Guardian|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}</ref>

=== Prison sites and torture ===
Gaddafi reportedly imprisoned thousands or tens of thousands of residents in Tripoli, with Red Cross denied access to these hidden prisons.

In late April, [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Susan Rice]] alleged that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to commit rapes in rebel-held or disputed areas.

The three columnists reported anonymous sources described as "people familiar with the shipments" who confirmed that 18 weapons shipments were delivered to rebel forces between spring and summer 2011, mostly independently from the mediation of the National Transitional Council.

=== International media ===
After the uprising began, Libyan students studying in the United States allegedly received phone calls from the Libyan embassy, instructing them to join pro-Gaddafi rallies, and threatening the loss of their government-funded scholarships if they refused. Gaddafi's ambassador denied the reports.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/2011217184949502493.html| title=Libyans in US Allege Coercion| publisher=Al Jazeera|last=Hill|first=Evan| date=17 February 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>

Gaddafi's aides also organized tours for foreign journalists in Tripoli. ''[[The Economist]]'' correspondent in Tripoli noted "The picture presented by the regime often falls apart, fast. Coffins at funerals have sometimes turned out to be empty. Bombing sites are recycled. An injured seven-year-old in a hospital was the victim of a car crash, according to a note passed on surreptitiously by a nurse.

''[[The Guardian]]'' described journalism in Gaddafi's Libya as "[[North Korea]] with palm trees". Journalists were not allowed to go anywhere, or talk to anyone, without authorization from Gaddafi's officials who always followed them. Journalists who did not report events the way Gaddafi's officials instructed faced problems and sudden deportations.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/foreign-journalists-rixos-hotel-tripoli | title=No freedom for foreign press at Tripoli's Rixos hotel |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=14 April 2011| first=Harriet | last=Sherwood}}</ref>

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] criticized "Western [[Media bias|media coverage]]" which "has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime's security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge."<ref name="AmnestyRape"/>

=== Human shields ===
Gaddafi forces reportedly surrounded themselves with civilians to protect themselves and key military sites like the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli from air strikes.<ref>{{cite news| author=Haynes, Deborah | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/muammar-gaddafi-using-civilians-to-protect-key-sites/story-e6frg6so-1226025907998 |title=Muammar Gaddafi Using Civilians To Protect Key Sites |work=The Australian|date=22 March 2011 | accessdate =11 August 2011}}</ref> Amnesty International cited claims that Gaddafi had placed his tanks next to civilian facilities, using them as shields.<ref name="amnesty1"/>

In June 2011, Muammar Gaddafi and his son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]] announced that they were willing to hold elections and that Gaddafi would step aside if he lost.

In July 2011, Saif al-Islam accused NATO of bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected.

Heads of the rebellion reported on 21 August that Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, was under arrest and that they had encircled the leader's compound, suggesting that the war had reached its endgame with an imminent rebel victory. By 22 August, rebel fighters had gained entrance into Tripoli and occupied Green Square, which was promptly renamed [[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Martyrs' Square]] in memory of those who had died fighting in the civil war.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-converging-on-tripoli/2011/08/21/gIQAbF3RUJ_story.html|title=Gaddafi's rule crumbling as rebels enter heart of Tripoli | work=The Washington Post|location=Tripoli|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Liz|last2=Sly|accessdate=25 January 2012 | date=21 August 2011}}</ref> Early on 23 August, Saif al-Islam appeared at the Gaddafi-controlled [[Rixos Hotels|Rixos Hotel]] in central Tripoli and boasted his father was still in control.<ref>{{cite news|title=Qaddafi's Son Taunts Rebels in Tripoli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/world/africa/23libya.html|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2011|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick|first2=Kareem|last2=Fahim}}</ref> Later the same day, rebels blasted open the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli through its north gates and stormed inside.

Early the following day, 24 August, Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local radio station in which he said the withdrawal from Bab al-Azizia had been a "tactical" move. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported rebel leaders as saying they believed the only areas still under Gaddafi's control, other than the immediate neighbourhood of Bab al-Azizia, were al-Hadhba and Abu Salim, the latter including the Rixos Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days. However, the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli.

Efforts to mop up pro-Gaddafi forces in northwestern Libya and toward [[Sirte]] began even before the rebels fully consolidated control of Tripoli. Rebels took the city of [[Ghadames]] near the borders of Tunisia and Algeria on 29 August. Members of the Gaddafi family took flight to Algeria.

Despite the defeat of Gaddafi's [[loyalists]], the capture of his last cities and Gaddafi's death, Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's son and successor, remained hiding in the southern region of Libya until his capture in mid-November. In addition, some loyalist forces crossed into Niger, though the escape attempts exploded into violence when detected by Nigerien troops.

The NTC has functioned as an interim legislature during the transitional period. In early May 2012, it passed its most sweeping measures to date, granting immunity to former rebel fighters for acts committed during the civil war and ordering that all detainees accused of fighting for Gaddafi should be tried or released by 12 July 2012. It also adopted Law 37, prohibiting the publication of "[[propaganda]]" criticising the revolution, questioning the authority of Libya's governing organs, or praising Muammar Gaddafi, his family, his government, or the ideas of the ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|Green Book]]''.<ref name="immunity">{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Libya grants immunity to 'revolutionaries'|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

A September 2013 report by ''[[The Independent]]'' shows that Libya had plunged into its worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi.

Independent numbers of dead and injured in the conflict have still not been made available. Estimates have been widely varied.
On 24 February, Libya's ambassador to Malta said that Gaddafi's government believed the number of dead to be about 300, including civilians, police officers, and soldiers.<ref name="maltatoday.com.mt"/> The exact same day, the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] reported that the [[International Criminal Court]] estimated 10,000 had been killed.<ref name="Irib">{{cite web|date=24 February 2011 |url=http://english.irib.ir/news/political/item/71535-death-toll-in-libyan-popular-uprising-at-10000 |title=Death Toll in Libyan Popular Uprising at 10,000 |work=[[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] |accessdate=5 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728152435/http://english.irib.ir/news/political/item/71535-death-toll-in-libyan-popular-uprising-at-10000 |archive-date=28 July 2011}}</ref> The numbers of injured were estimated to be around 4,000 by 22 February.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2011/02/22/live-blog-libya-feb-22|title=Al Jazeera Live Blog Libya – February 22 |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref>

On 2 March, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated approximately 2,000 killed.

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] stated that earlier estimates of the initial clashes in February were exaggerated. It estimated that during the first few days of the conflict, 100 to 110 people were killed in Benghazi and 59 to 64 were killed in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]].<ref name="AmnestyRape"/>

On 8 September, Naji Barakat, the Health Minister of the [[National Transitional Council]], stated that about half of an estimated 30,000 dead were believed to have been pro-Gaddafi fighters. War wounded were estimated as at least 50,000, of which about 20,000 were serious injuries, but this estimate was expected to rise.<ref name=ap-20110908>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9835879 |title=Libyan estimate: At least 30,000 died in the war |author=Karin Laub |agency=Associated Press |work=The Guardian |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref> However, there was no independent verification of the Health Minister's statement and, one month later, the NTC reduced the estimated number of killed to 25,000.<ref name=autogenerated12>{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/residents-flee-gaddafi-hometown-20111003-1l49x.html |title=Residents flee Gaddafi hometown |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011|agency=Agence France-Presse|first1=Rory|last1=Mulholland|first2=Jay|last2=Deshmukh}}</ref>

In January 2013, the new Libyan government, based on figures still being checked, estimated the number of killed to be actually far lower than previous estimates, with 4,700 rebel supporters and a similar number of Gaddafi supporters killed during the conflict. An estimated 2,100 people on both sides were missing.<ref name="revolutioncasualties">{{cite news|author=Ian Black, Middle East editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/libyan-revolution-casualties-lower-expected-government |title=Libyan revolution casualties lower than expected, says new government |publisher=Guardian |date= 8 January 2013|accessdate=2 October 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], a public data resource that includes information on different types of organized violence (e.g. actors involved, casualties, date, location, etc.), reported that between 1,914 and 3,466 people were killed during the 2011 fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=95&regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa# |title=Uppsala conflict data program, Libya, Libya: government (entire conflict), viewed April 2013 |publisher=Ucdp.uu.se |accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref> In addition their data shows that between 152 and 168 civilians were deliberately killed by the pro-Gaddafi forces in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=95&regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa# |title=Uppsala conflict data program, Libya, 2011, viewed April 2013 |publisher=Ucdp.uu.se |accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref>

There were no combat casualties amongst the coalition forces, although one RAF airman was killed in an accident in Italy.

=== Legal qualification ===
[[File:President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University 9.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University.]]
Legal qualification of an armed conflict determines which rules of [[international humanitarian law]] apply to the conduct of the parties during that conflict. In general, the normative framework applicable to international conflicts is broader and more detailed than the sum of rules that apply in conflicts not of an international character.<ref>See, e.g., Kolb, Robert and Hyde, Richard. ''An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts''. Hart Publishing, 2008, pp. 69–70.</ref>

The qualification of the Libyan conflict is the subject of some academic controversy. While most agree that the intensity of the fighting and the organization of the insurgents quickly rose to the level required for the existence of a non-international armed conflict under [[Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions|Common Article 3]] of the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]],<ref name="Macak1">{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=406–410 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conflict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238}}</ref><ref name="Johnston1">{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Conflict & Security Law |year=2012 |volume=17 |pages=92–93 |title=Transformations of Conflict Status in Libya |author=Johnston, Katie A. |doi=10.1093/jcsl/krs009 |url= http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/81.abstract |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> the exact date when these conditions were considered fulfilled ranges from late February<ref name="Macak2">{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=410 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conflict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238}}</ref> to 10 March 2011.<ref name="ICRC_10032011" />

It is generally accepted that the military intervention by a multi-state coalition acting under the [[Security Council]] mandate since 19 March 2011 occasioned an international armed conflict between Libya and the intervening states.<ref name="Macak3">{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=411–413 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conflict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238}}</ref><ref name="Johnston2">{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Conflict & Security Law |year=2012 |volume=17 |page=95 |title=Transformations of Conflict Status in Libya |author=Johnston, Katie A. |doi=10.1093/jcsl/krs009 |url= http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/81.abstract |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> Some academics believe that this intervention transformed the legal nature of the conflict as a whole, with the result that even the rebels should have been considered as one of the parties to an overarching international conflict spanning the whole Libyan territory.<ref name="Johnston2" /> Others doubt this on account of both legal and factual considerations.<ref name="Macak4">{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=413–415, 418–423 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conflict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238}}</ref>

Finally, it remains unsettled whether or not the rebels' overthrow of Gaddafi's government following the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|fall of Tripoli]] in August 2011 changed the nature of the conflict again. Some academics believe that as the rebels were now the legitimate and effective government of the state of Libya, the conflict was "deinternationalised" and thus non-international in nature again.<ref name="Milanovic">Milanovic, Marko and Hadzi-Vidanovic, Vidan.

The town of [[Tawergha]], which supported Gaddafi prior to its [[Battle of Tawergha|capture]] by anti-Gaddafi fighters in August, has been emptied of its mostly black inhabitants in what appeared to be a "major reprisal against supporters of the Gaddafi regime", according to an 11 September report from ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', and commanders of the [[Misrata Brigade]] are refusing to allow the displaced townspeople to return. One commander was quoted as saying, "Tawergha no longer exists."<ref name=autogenerated11>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8754375/Gaddafis-ghost-town-after-the-loyalists-retreat.html|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=12 September 2011|title=Gaddafi's ghost town after the loyalists retreat|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>

In 2014 a former [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] officer reported to the ''[[New York Times]]'' that the civil war was now an "ethnic struggle" between Arab tribes (like the Zintanis) against those of [[Turks in Libya|Turkish ancestry]] (like the Misuratis), as well as against the [[Berbers]] and [[Circassians]].<ref name=Kirkpatrick>{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|year=2014|title=Strife in Libya Could Presage Long Civil War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/world/africa/libyan-unrest.html|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref>

Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road, as many as 4,000 refugees were crossing the Libya–Tunisia border daily during the first days of the uprising. Among those, escaping the violence, were native Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians, Tunisians and Turks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/live-update-thousands-flee-across-libya-tunisia-border/article1918670/ |title=Live Update: Thousands Flee Across Libya–Tunisia Border |work=The Globe and Mail|date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}</ref> In February, Italian Foreign Minister Frattini expressed his concerns that the amount of Libyan refugees trying to reach Italy might reach between 200,000 and 300,000 people.<ref>{{cite news| author =Squires, Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8343963/Libya-Italy-fears-300000-refugees.html |title=Libya: Italy Fears 300,000 Refugees |work =The Daily Telegraph|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate= 7 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref> By 1 March, officials from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] had confirmed allegations of discrimination against sub-Saharan Africans who were held in dangerous conditions in the no-man's-land between Tunisia and Libya.<ref name=tgam>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/at-a-tense-border-crossing-a-systematic-effort-to-keep-black-africans-out/article1925955/|title = At a Tense Border Crossing, a Systematic Effort To Keep Black Africans Out|author=Saunders, Doug |date=1 March 2011 |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=3 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}</ref> By 3 March, an estimated 200,000 refugees had fled Libya to either Tunisia or Egypt. A provisional refugee camp set up at [[Ras Ajdir]] with a capacity for 10,000 was overflowing with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees. Many tens of thousands were still trapped on the Libyan side of the frontier. By 3 March, the situation was described as a logistical nightmare, with the [[World Health Organization]] warning of the risk of epidemics.<ref>Sayar, Scott; [[Alan Cowell|Cowell, Alan]] (3 March 2011).

To continue responding to the needs of people staying at the [[Ras Ajdir]] crossing point in Tunisia, the WFP and [[Secours Islamique-France]] were upgrading a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families. Separately, the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the [[Tunisian Red Crescent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/libya-update-2011-04-15.htm |title=Libya: More Aid To Reach Misrata and Other Areas |publisher= [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> Since 24 March, the WFP supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the Saloum border. A total of 1,650 cartons of fortified date bars (equivalent of 13.2 metric tons) had also been provided to supplement these meals.<ref name="reliefweb1"/>

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported on 11 September that almost the entire population of [[Tawergha]], a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by anti-Gaddafi fighters after their [[Battle of Tawergha|takeover of the settlement]]. The report suggested that Tawergha, which was dominated by [[black people|black]] Libyans, may have been the subject of [[ethnic cleansing]] provoked by a combination of [[racism]] and bitterness on the part of [[Misrata]]n fighters over the town's support for Gaddafi during the [[Battle of Misrata|siege of Misrata]].<ref name=autogenerated11/>

=== Economic, religious and tribal ===
Oil prices around the world increased during the Libyan conflict, due to [[oil reserves in Libya|the country's significant oil reserves]]. The [[Arabian Gulf Oil Company]], the second-largest state-owned oil company in Libya, announced plans to use oil funds to support anti-Gaddafi forces.<ref>{{cite news|date=11 March 2011|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL3E7EB03B20110311|title=Libya's Arabian Gulf Oil Co Hopes To Fund Rebels Via Crude Sales-FT|agency=Reuters Africa|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> Islamic leaders and clerics in Libya, notably the [[Network of Free Ulema – Libya]] urged all Muslims to rebel against Gaddafi.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE71K1TQ20110221 |title=Update 1-Libyan Islamic Leaders Urge Muslims To Rebel|agency=Reuters Africa|date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and [[Magarha]] tribes announced their support of the protesters.<ref name=aljazeeradefiant/><ref name="bbc-hussein-22-02-2011"/> The [[Zuwayya]] tribe, based in eastern Libya, threatened to cut off oil exports from fields in its part of Libya if Libyan security forces continued attacking demonstrators.<ref name="bbc-hussein-22-02-2011">{{Cite news|author=Hussein, Mohammed|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12528996|title = Libya Crisis: What Role Do Tribal Loyalties Play?|publisher=BBC News|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>

Many states and [[supranational union|supranational]] bodies condemned Gaddafi's government over disputed allegations of air attacks on civilian targets within the country. Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic relations with Gaddafi's government over disputed reports of an aerial bombing campaign in February and March, and a number of other countries led by [[Peru]] and [[Botswana]] did likewise. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970]] was adopted on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle and restricting their travel. The resolution also referred the actions of the government to the [[International Criminal Court]] for investigation,<ref name=autogenerated13 /> and an arrest warrant for Gaddafi was issued on 27 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13927208 |title=Libya: Muammar Gaddafi Subject to ICC Arrest Warrant |publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2011|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref> This was followed by an arrest warrant issued by [[Interpol]] on 8 September.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/09/us-libya-gaddafi-interpol-idUSTRE7882D220110909 |agency=Reuters|first=John | last=Irish | title=Interpol issues arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>

The disputed allegations about the Libyan government's use of the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]] to strike civilians led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] to create a [[Libyan no-fly zone]] on 17 March, though several countries involved in the resolution's enforcement have also carried out regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the [[Libyan Army (1951-2011)|Libyan Army]] and destroy the government's [[command and control]] capabilities, effectively acting in ''[[de facto]]'' support of [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] on the ground. The later British parliament's [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] inquiry concluded that by summer 2011 British policy had become one of [[regime change]].<ref name=bbc-20160914>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37356873 |title=MPs attack Cameron over Libya 'collapse' |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=hoc-libya>{{cite report |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf |title=Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK's future policy options |work=Foreign Affairs Committee (House of Commons) |publisher=UK Parliament |date=6 September 2016 |id=HC 119 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20160914>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention |title=MPs deliver damning verdict on Cameron's Libya intervention |author=Patrick Wintour |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> 

China and Russia, originally abstaining on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] due to the influence of the Arab League, pointed out that the implemented "no-fly-zone" had gone much further out of the originally agreed aims.<ref name=tco-libya>{{cite report |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8393950/Libya-attacks-criticised-by-Arab-League-China-Russia-and-India.html |title=Libya: Libya attacks criticised by Arab League, China, Russia and India |date=21 March 2011|id=HC 119 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>

100 countries recognized the anti-Gaddafi [[National Transitional Council]] as Libya's legitimate representative, with many of those countries explicitly describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi's government, though the National Transitional Council never obtained authority and security across all of Libya.<ref name=hoc-libya/>

Many states also either issued [[travel advisory|travel advisories]] or attempted evacuations. Some evacuations were successful to [[Malta]] or via land borders to [[Egypt]] or [[Tunisia]]; other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at [[Benghazi]]'s airport or refusals of permission to land in [[Tripoli]]. There were also several solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan [[expatriates]]. Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the instability, with oil prices rising to a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year high.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.smh.com/business/markets/oil-jumps-after-western-attacks-on-libya-20110319-1c101.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=Oil jumps after Western attacks on Libya | date=21 March 2011}}</ref>
