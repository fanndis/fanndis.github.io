'''4Music''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[free-to-air]] television channel launched on 15 August 2008 as a replacement for [[The Hits]]. It is the only [[Channel 4]]-branded channel to be operated by its music division [[The Box Plus Network]]. Its programming focuses on music as well as entertainment and Channel 4 programming. It broadcasts from 07:00 to 03:00 daily.

On 2 April 2013, all Box Television channels went [[free-to-air]] on satellite, apart from 4Music which went [[free-to-view]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/2013/04/bauers-box-channels-appear-free-to-air.html|title=Bauer's Box channels appear free-to-air on satellite|publisher=a516digital|date=2 April 2013}}</ref> As a result, the channels were removed from the Sky EPG in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube video showing the channels removed from the Sky EPG in Ireland|date=3 April 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaB9otgbEEE|access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref> Eventually, 4Music also went free-to-air on 7 February 2017 and launched on Freesat, replacing [[The Box (UK and Ireland TV channel)|The Box]], but reverted to being free-to-view on 12 December 2018. On 25 September 2017, 4Music received an update to its on-screen graphics, revolving around four squares which extend to create the 4Music logo and animate to form the artist credit. Since 2018 4Music rebranded it's logo to add the current Channel 4 logo on it, with '4' and 'Music' mashed up together. This change happened to its other channels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/27/channel-4-airs-eclectic-unpredictable-rebrand-across-all-its-channels|title=Channel 4 airs 'eclectic, unpredictable' rebrand across all of its channels|work=The Drum|accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref>

From 16 April 2018, the channel now shows more entertainment programmes as well as archive Channel 4 programming to coincide with a change in the EPG numbers on Sky from 1 May 2018.

== Launch night ==
4Music began its broadcast with an on-screen countdown which lasted for ten minutes. During the countdown, clips from popular music videos were faded through the screen, including clips from promotions for the channel. The channel then launched at 7&nbsp;pm with a promotional advert before fading into "[[Davina McCall|Davina (McCall)]] and [[Steve Jones (Welsh presenter)|Steve (Jones)]]'s 20 Big Ones"; the first song at number 20 being "[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]" by [[Foo Fighters]], and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" at number 1.

Kylie Minogue's [[KYLIEX2008]] tour was broadcast, and completing the launch night line-up was ''[[Big Brother Live]]'', where [[Rachel Rice]] was given a 'favourite things party' for surviving that night's eviction. She and her chosen favourite housemate, [[Kathreya Kasisopa]], were taken to a private room where Rachel's top 10 favourite songs were played. Live coverage of the 2008 [[V Festival]] was shown on 16 and 17 August and highlights were shown on subsequent days. These highlights sparked complaints, however, as to the overall quality of coverage, due to the main headliners not getting their full sets played out.

Despite the arguments between Davina and Steve as to whose face appeared first on the channel, the first face seen on 4Music was Kylie Minogue, introducing her live concert at 9&nbsp;pm on the launch night (as they later explained).

The launch also saw a new [[Digital on-screen graphic]] appear on the screen, and new [[idents]] with a woman swivelling on a chair with the channel's logo in the background. The concept for the channel's on-air presentation was similar to the previous idea The Hits had, with a TV suddenly filling with colour throughout the room.
