'''National Harbor''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], [[Maryland]], United States, located along the [[Potomac River]] near the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] and just south of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. It originated as a {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} multi-use waterfront development. The population was 3,788 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==

===Land use and rezoning===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
The land developed for National Harbor was previously Salubria Plantation,<ref name=gz0>{{cite news|last1=Waite|first1=Andrew|title=Forgotten Oxon Hill plantation celebrates county's black heritage, historians say|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/03032011/uppenew161303_32540.php|accessdate=April 27, 2016|work=Gazette|publisher=Post Community Media, LLC|date=March 3, 2011}}</ref> built in 1827 by Dr. John H. Bayne. The plantation house burned down in 1981 and was offered for sale along with the surrounding land. The land was sold in 1984 and in 1994 was rezoned for mixed-use development.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In the fall of 1997, the [[Maryland Department of the Environment]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] approved new developer permits, granted for the PortAmerica project in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-01-07/news/1998007084_1_potomac-river-national-harbor-oxon-hill|title=National Harbor a threat to the Potomac|work=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

This development has caused considerable controversy due to its [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]]. The [[Sierra Club]] voiced strong objections in 1999 saying that construction of National Harbor would "prevent forever the completion of the [[Potomac Heritage Trail]]".<ref>{{Cite journal| journal=The Sierra Club, Maryland Chapter| title=The Wilson Crossing: A Better Vision| date=April 26, 1999| accessdate=2009-03-15| url=http://maryland.sierraclub.org/archive/1999/mayjun/wilson.html| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610210358/http://maryland.sierraclub.org/archive/1999/mayjun/wilson.html| archivedate=June 10, 2009}}</ref> The site was linked to hundreds of thousands of gallons of untreated sewage being discharged into the Potomac River in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/22/AR2008062201983.html|accessdate=2009-03-15 | newspaper=Washington Post| title=Residents Blame National Harbor for Sewage Spills| last=Zapotosky| first=Matt| date=June 23, 2008}}</ref> In 2006, Peterson Companies withdrew plans to build a Target department store where the remaining plantation building, the slave quarters, still stand.<ref name="gz0" />

[[The Walt Disney Company]] had announced that it would build a new resort hotel at National Harbor, but backed out of the project in November 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Thomas|title=In a blow to Prince George’s, Disney backs out of National Harbor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-a-blow-to-prince-georges-disney-backs-out-of-national-harbor/2011/11/25/gIQAM2OKxN_story.html|accessdate=November 25, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> In 2011, Bonnie Bick, a member of the Campaign to Reinvest in the Heart of Oxon Hill suggested preserving the remaining plantation building, and making it a part of a proposed historical loop of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, as a draw for the development.<ref name="gz0" />

A location for the [[National Children's Museum]] opened in December 2012.

An [[MGM Resorts International|MGM]]-branded [[casino]], called [[MGM National Harbor]], opened at National Harbor on December 8, 2016, following voters' approval of an expansion to the state's gambling program in the November 2012 elections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=John|title=MGM confirms plans to bid for Prince George’s County casino|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/mgm-confirms-plans-to-bid-friday-for-prince-georges-county-casino/2013/05/08/59a06974-b7fa-11e2-aa9e-a02b765ff0ea_story.html?hpid=z5|accessdate=8 May 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=8 May 2013}}</ref> It was built on the south side of the [[Capital Beltway|Beltway]], about a mile northeast of the National Harbor waterfront.

==Demographics==

As of the [[census]] of [[2010 United States Census|2010]], there were 3,788 people, 1,598 households, and 868 families residing in the census-designated place.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://planning.maryland.gov/msdc/census/cen2010/SF1/GenProf/Place/cdp_55018.pdf| title=GENERAL PROFILE 1: PERSONS BY RACE, AGE, AND SEX; URBAN AND RURAL: National Harbor CDP, Maryland| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref>  As of 2016, an estimated 7,000 staff work at National Harbor, with 3,000 more expected after the MGM Casino opens in the Fall of 2016.<ref>Washington Post, Metro, April 3, 2016, "Eight years after opening, National Harbor anticipates new life after MGM"</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], National Harbor has a total area of {{convert|4.8|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|3.7|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.0|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 21.7% (consisting of the [[Potomac River]]), is water; 300 acres are in the actual development itself.

===Access===

National Harbor has direct road access to [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Interstate 95/495]] (the Capital Beltway), [[Interstate 295 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]] (Anacostia Freeway), and [[Maryland Route 414|Oxon Hill Road]]. Commuters traveling via [[Maryland Route 210|Indian Head Highway]] may access National Harbor by utilizing the Oxon Hill Road exits.<ref name=roadways>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/08/AR2007060802735.html|title=Direct Access Planned For National Harbor|last=Wiggins|first=Ovetta|date=2007-06-09|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref> Early critics of National Harbor argued that the site is not accessible enough to the [[Washington Metro]], the Washington area's [[rapid transit]] system. However, local civic groups dropped a lawsuit against National Harbor's developer in exchange for assurances of greater investment in the surrounding community and better access to mass transit.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58152-2004Aug11|title=National Harbor Suit Dropped|last=Wiggins|first=Ovetta|date=2004-08-12|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref> Three years later, the state funded over $500 million in road improvements in order to handle the 10,000 cars expected to commute daily to National Harbor.<ref name=roadways />

The new [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]], which forms part of the Capital Beltway near National Harbor, was built to allow capacity for a future [[Washington Metro]] line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/24/senator-mark-warner-new-potomac-bridge_n_979123.htmle |title=Region Needs New Potomac River Bridge |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> However, there are no current plans to extend rail over the bridge to development. Instead, the state of Maryland pays $312,000 annually for bus access to National Harbor from the [[Southern Avenue station|Southern Avenue]] Metro station. In June 2008, the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center asked the state to fund additional transit service because employees found it difficult to reach National Harbor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/03/AR2008060303249.html|title=Gaylord Resort Asks for More Transit Service|last=Wiggins|first=Ovetta|date=2008-06-04|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref>  In 2011, Metro began considering the possibility of building a rail extension to National Harbor off the [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green Line]] as part of its long-term plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/10965/metro-planners-contemplate-systems-second-generation/|title=Metro planners contemplate system's second generation|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

A [[water taxi]] line run by the ''Potomac Riverboat Company'' connects the National Harbor to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The City of Alexandria also runs shuttles from the water taxi terminal to [[King Street – Old Town (WMATA station)|King Street – Old Town]] Metro station.
