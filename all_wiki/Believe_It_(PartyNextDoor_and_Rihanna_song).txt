"'''Believe It'''" is a song by Canadian singer [[PartyNextDoor]] and Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released as the fourth single from PartyNextDoor's third studio album ''[[Partymobile]]'' on March 27, 2020, and was produced by Bizness Boi, [[Cardiak]], Ninetyfour and DJ Prince. The song marks Rihanna's first appearance on a single in three years, following [[N.E.R.D.]]'s "[[Lemon (N.E.R.D and Rihanna song)|Lemon]]" (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/rihanna-partynextdoor-new-song-believe-it-listen-1203547056/|title=Listen to PartyNextDoor's Rihanna-Featuring New Song 'Believe It'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=''Variety'' staff|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}</ref> The song debuted at number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and at number 23 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9352114/the-weeknd-blinding-lights-number-one-second-week-hot-100|title=The Weeknd No. 1 on Hot 100 for Second Week|date=2020-04-06|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

==Background==
PartyNextDoor has previously co-written several songs with Rihanna, including "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]", "[[Sex with Me]]" and "[[Wild Thoughts]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/rihanna-and-partynextdoor-share-new-song-believe-it-listen/|title=Rihanna and PARTYNEXTDOOR Share New Song "BELIEVE IT": Listen|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Pierre|first=Alphonse|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

==Writing and recording==
American record producer [[Cardiak]] created the instrumental of the song, which features "intertwining guitar and [a] pitched-up vocal sample". He then sent it to his co-producer Bizness Boi, who was at a writing camp in [[Paris]]; despite working on the track with an unnamed artist, he passed it on to Ninetyfour, who fleshed the song out and sent it to PartyNextDoor upon the advice of a friend. PartyNextDoor put placeholder vocals from his girlfriend on the track while waiting to hear back from Rihanna. Rihanna finished her vocals in the week of the album's release. Bizness Boi and Ninetyfour did not hear Rihanna's finished vocals on the track until the album's release on March 27.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/partynextdoor-rihanna-believe-it-making-of-972815/|title=How Rihanna Ended Up on PartyNextDoor's 'Believe It'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

==Lyrics and composition==
"Believe It" is a "sensual" [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] "slow burner" about a relationship, with PartyNextDoor and Rihanna singing to each other as lovers "imploring each other to believe in the power of their connection".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9344596/rihanna-partynextdoor-believe-it|title=Rihanna Jumps Back to Music With Partynextdoor on Grooving 'Believe It'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Jessica McKinney of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' included the song among their list of Best New Music of the week, calling it a "breezy R&B record" and noting how Rihanna takes a backseat to Party, "only offering raspy vocals on the chorus", singing, "Best make me believe it/Believe you won't deceive me".<ref name="ComplexBest">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/best-new-music-this-week-partynextdoor-rihanna-future|title=Best New Music This Week: PARTYNEXTDOOR, Fivio Foreign, Murda Beatz, and More|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=McKinney|first=Jessica|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>
