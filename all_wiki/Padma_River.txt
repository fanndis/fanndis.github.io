The '''Padma''' or '''Podda''' ({{lang-bn|পদ্মা}} [[Romanization of Bengali|''Pôdda'']]) is a major river in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]] (downstream of [[Giria, India|Giria]]). It is the main [[distributary]] of the [[Ganges]], flowing generally southeast for {{convert|120|km|mi}} to its confluence with the [[Meghna River]] near the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name="Geologic Framework"/> The city of [[Rajshahi]] is situated on the banks of the river.<ref name="হোসেইন" >Hossain ML, Mahmud J, Islam J, Khokon ZH and Islam S (eds.)

==History==

===Etymology===
The Padma, [[Sanskrit]] for [[lotus flower]], is mentioned in [[Hindu mythology]] as a byname for the Goddess [[Lakshmi]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George M. |date=2008 |title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC&pg=PA198 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2 |page=198}}</ref> <!--including the [[Veda]]s, the [[Purana]]s,<ref>[[Padma Purana]]</ref> the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In all the epic stories, the river is-->

The name ''Padma'' is given to the lower part of the course of the Ganges (Ganga) below the point of the off-take of the Bhagirathi River (India), another Ganges River distributary also known as the [[Hooghly River]]. Padma had, most probably, flowed through a number of channels at different times. Some authors contend that each distributary of the Ganges in its deltaic part is a remnant of an old principal channel, and that starting from the western-most one, the Bhagirathi (in West Bengal, India), each distributary to the east marks a position of a newer channel than the one to the west of it.

===Geographic effects===
[[File:Padma River 1860.jpg|thumb|Padma River and boats (1860)]]
Eighteenth-century geographer [[James Rennell]] referred to a former course of the Ganges north of its present channel, as follows:

{{quote|text=Appearances favour very strongly the opinion, that the Ganges had its former bed in the tract now occupied by the lakes and morasses between Nattore and Jaffiergunge, striking out of the present course at Bauleah ... to a junction with the Burrampooter or Megna near Fringybazar; where the accumulation of two such mighty streams probably scooped out the present amazing bed of the Megna.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Rennell |first=James |date=January 1783 |title=Account of the Ganges and Burrampooter Rivers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_I7AQAAMAAJ |magazine=The Scots Magazine |volume=45 |page=62 |access-date=16 October 2014}}</ref>
}}

The places mentioned by Rennell proceeding from west to east are [[Rampur Boalia|Rampur]] [[Boali]], the headquarters of [[Rajshahi district]], [[Puthia]] and [[Natore District|Natore]] in the same district and Jaffarganj in the district of [[Dhaka]]. The place last named were shown in a map of the [[Mymensingh]] district dated 1861, as a subdistrict (thana) headquarters, about {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|0}} south-east of [[Bera Upazila]] police station. It is now known as Payla Jaffarganj and is close to Elachipur opposite [[Goalunda]]. According to Rennell's theory, therefore, the probable former course of the Ganges would correspond with that of the present channel of the [[Baral River]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Authorities agree that the Ganges has changed its course and that at different times, each of the distributaries might have been the carrier of its main stream.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The bed of the Padma is wide, and the river is split up into several channels flowing between constantly shifting sand banks and islands. During the rains the current is very strong and even steamers may find difficulty in making headway against it. It is navigable at all seasons of the year by steamers and country boats of all sizes and until recently ranked as one of the most frequented waterways in the world. It is spanned near [[Paksey]] by the great [[Hardinge Bridge]] over which runs one of the main lines of the [[Bangladesh Railway]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Geography==
The Padma enters Bangladesh from India near [[Chapai Nawabganj District|Nawabganj]] and meets the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] ({{lang-bn|যমুনা}} ''Jomuna'') near Aricha and retains its name, but finally meets with the [[Meghna River|Meghna]] ({{lang-bn|মেঘনা}}) near Chandpur and adopts the name "Meghna" before flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]].

[[Rajshahi]], a major city in western Bangladesh, is situated on the north bank of the Padma.

The Ganges originates in the [[Gangotri]] Glacier of the Himalaya, and runs through India and Bangladesh to the Bay of Bengal. The Padma enters [[Bangladesh]] at [[Shibganj]] in the district of [[Chapai Nababganj]]. The Ganges branches into two distributaries, the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]] and the [[Padma]] at [[Giria, India|Giria]] in [[Murshidabad district]] of [[India]] . The Hooghly River, which continues southwards in India is also known as the Ganga(traditionally) and Bhagirathi.

Further downstream, in Goalando, {{convert|2200|km|mi}} from the source, the Padma is joined by the Jamuna (Lower [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]) and the resulting combination flows with the name Padma further east, to [[Chandpur District|Chandpur]]. Here, the widest river in Bangladesh, the Meghna joins the Padma, continuing as the Meghna almost in a straight line to the south, ending in the Bay of Bengal.

===Pabna District===
[[File:Padma river in summer.jpg|thumb|A view of Padma river in summer near [[Rajshahi]]]]
The Padma forms the whole of the southern boundary of the [[Pabna District]] for a distance of about {{convert|120|km|mi}}.

===Kushtia District===
The [[Jalangi River]] is thrown off at the point where the mighty Padma touches the district at its most northernly corner, and flows along the northern border in a direction slightly southeast, until it leaves the district several kilometres to the east of [[Kushtia]]. It carries immense volumes of water and is very wide at places, constantly shifting its main channel, eroding vast areas on one bank, throwing chars on the other, giving rise to many disputes as to the possession of the chars and islands which are thrown up.

===Murshidabad District===
Murshidabad District situated on the western bank of The Padma. It flows dividing the Rajshahi and [[Murshidabad District]] of [[West Bengal]] and created a natural river border between [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.bdfish.org/2011/11/the-padma-river/|title=The Padma River|access-date=February 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/featured/story/ganga-padma-erosion-poses-security-concerns-in-bengal-mamata-to-demand-additional-funds-210045-2013-08-19|title=Ganga-Padma erosion poses security concerns in Bengal|date=August 19, 2013|access-date=February 11, 2018}}</ref> [[Jalangi]] area of the district was seriously affected by [[River bank erosion along the Ganges in Malda and Murshidabad districts|River bank erosion]] of Padma.<ref name="erosion3">{{cite web|url=http://lrlr.landscapeonline.de/Articles/lrlr-2014-3/articlese6.html|title=River Bank Erosion Induced Human Displacement and Its Consequences - Impact of Ganges River Bank Erosion|work=Tuhin K.

===Rajshahi District===

Rajshahi is the largest city among the cities which is situated on the bank of Padma river. It is the third largest city in Bangladesh. It is a major city in the north Bengal. Rajshahi has a decorated embankment of Padma. Rajshahi Collegiate School is one of the oldest schools in Indian Subcontinent, situated on Padma river bank. The school was endangered three times by the disintegration of the Padma river. Padma Food Garden, A.H.M. Kamaruzzaman Central Park and Zoo, Barokuthi Nandan Park, Muktamancha, and 'T' shaped embankment (Bengali: টি বাঁধ) are best tourist spot in Rajshahi which are situated on the bank of Padma river.

=== Damming ===
After the construction of the [[Farakka Barrage]] on the Ganges River in [[West Bengal]], the maximum flows in the Padma River were reduced significantly. The flow reduction caused many problems in Bangladesh, including the loss of fish species, the drying of Padma's distributaries, increased saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal, and damage to the mangrove forests of the [[Sundarbans]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Islam |first=Nazrul |date=29 April – 5 May 2006|title=IRLP or the Ecological Approach to Rivers? |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=41 |number=17 |pages=1693–1702 |jstor=4418148}}</ref>

=== Padma Bridge ===
The [[Padma Bridge]] would be Bangladesh's largest, estimated at US$2.3 billion to finish. It was supposed to be open to the public in 2013. However, the future of the project became uncertain when in June 2012 the [[World Bank]] cancelled its $1.2 billion loan over corruption allegations.<ref>{{cite press release|title=World Bank Statement on Padma Bridge|publisher=World Bank Group|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/06/29/world-bank-statement-padma-bridge|date=29 June 2012|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> In June 2014, the government of Bangladesh, proceeding without the loan, hired a Chinese firm to construct the {{convert|6.15|km|mi|adj=on}} main part of the bridge; in October 2014, it hired a South Korean firm to supervise construction, with the aim of finishing the project by 2018.<ref name ="Korean Firm">{{cite news |last=Kallol |first=Assif Showkat |date=14 October 2014 |title=Korean Firm Gets Padma Bridge Construction Supervision Job |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/oct/14/korean-firm-gets-padma-bridge-construction-supervision-job |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> In 2009, government plans also included rail lines on both sides of the Padma with a connection via the new bridge.<ref>{{cite news |title=Plan to Lay 80km Rail Line on Both Sides of Padma Bridge |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=101453 |newspaper=The Daily Star |agency=BSS |date=15 August 2009}}</ref>

The [[Lalon Shah Bridge]] and [[Hardinge Bridge]] also crosses the Padma further upstream.
