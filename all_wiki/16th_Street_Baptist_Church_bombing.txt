The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing marked a turning point in the United States during the [[civil rights movement]] and contributed to support for passage by Congress of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

==Background==
In the years leading up to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, Birmingham had earned a national reputation as a tense, violent and racially segregated city, in which even tentative [[racial integration]] of any form was met with violent resistance. Martin Luther King described Birmingham as "probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/letter-from-birmingham-city-jail-excerpts/ |work=TeachingAmericanHistory.org |title=Letter From Birmingham City Jail (Excerpts) |publisher=[[Ashland University]] |author-link=Martin Luther King Jr. |first=Martin Luther, Jr. |last=King |date=April 16, 1963 |access-date=May 27, 2019 }}</ref>

The city had no black police officers or firefighters. Given the state's [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most blacks]] since the turn of the century, by making voter registration essentially impossible, few of the city's black residents were registered to vote. Bombings at black homes and institutions were a regular occurrence,<ref>{{cite news|title=New Bomb Blast Hits Birmingham|date=September 25, 1963|newspaper=The Miami News}}<!--|access-date=November 21, 2010--></ref> with at least 21 separate explosions recorded at black properties and churches in the eight years before 1963, although none of these explosions had resulted in fatalities.<ref name="Washington Post Sept. 16, 1963">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/churches/archives1.htm |title=Six Dead After Church Bombing |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 16, 1963 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=United Press International }}</ref> These attacks earned the city the nickname "[[Bombingham]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/addie-mae-collins |title=Addie Mae Collins |work=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography.com]] |date=n.d. |access-date=May 27, 2019 }}</ref>

===Birmingham Campaign===
{{main|Birmingham campaign}}
The three-story 16th Street Baptist Church was a rallying point for civil rights activities through the spring of 1963. When the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) and the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] became involved in a campaign to register African Americans to vote in Birmingham, tensions in the city increased. The church was used as a meeting-place for civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], for organizing and educating marchers. It was the location where students were organized and trained by [[James Bevel]] to participate in the [[Birmingham campaign|1963 Birmingham campaign's Children's Crusade]] after other marches had taken place.

On Thursday, May 2, more than 1,000 students, some reportedly as young as eight, opted to leave school and gather at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Demonstrators present were given instructions to march to downtown Birmingham and discuss with the mayor their concerns about racial segregation in the city, and to integrate buildings and businesses currently segregated. Although this march was met with fierce resistance and criticism, and 600 arrests were made on the first day alone, the Birmingham campaign and its Children's Crusade continued until May 5. The intention was to fill the jail with protesters. These demonstrations led to an agreement, on May 8, between the city's business leaders and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to [[Racial integration|integrate]] public facilities, including schools, in the city within 90 days. (The first three schools in Birmingham to be integrated would do so on September 4.)<ref name="William O. Bryant">{{cite news |title=Six Negro Children Killed in Alabama Sunday |newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]] |date=1963-09-11 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TEMaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7126,662830 |first=William O. |last=Bryant |access-date=2010-11-21}}</ref>

These demonstrations and the concessions from city leaders to the majority of demonstrators' demands were met with fierce resistance by other whites in Birmingham. In the weeks following the September 4 integration of public schools, three additional bombs were detonated in Birmingham.<ref name="Washington Post Sept. 16, 1963"/> Other acts of violence followed the settlement, and several staunch Klansmen were known to have expressed frustration at what they saw as a lack of effective resistance to integration.<ref name="Observer-Reporter Nov. 19, 1977">{{cite news |title=Former Klansman Is Guilty Of Bomb Deaths |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19771119&id=8_ddAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nF8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2755,3260312 |work=[[Observer–Reporter]] |date=November 19, 1977 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

As a known and popular rallying point for [[civil rights]] activists, the 16th Street Baptist Church was an obvious target.

Hundreds of individuals, some of them lightly wounded, converged on the church to search the debris for survivors as police erected barricades around the church and several outraged men scuffled with police.

Within 24 hours of the bombing, a minimum of five businesses and properties had been firebombed and numerous cars—most of which were driven by whites—had been stoned by rioting youths.<ref name="Washington Post Sept. 16, 1963"/>

In response to the church bombing, described by the Mayor of Birmingham, [[Albert Boutwell]], as "just sickening", the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] dispatched 25 FBI agents, including explosives experts, to Birmingham to conduct a thorough [[Forensic science|forensic]] investigation.

Some civil rights activists blamed [[George Wallace]], Governor of Alabama and an outspoken segregationist, for creating the climate that had led to the killings.

==Initial investigation==
Initially, investigators theorized that a bomb thrown from a passing car had caused the explosion at the 16th Street Baptist church. But by September 20, the FBI was able to confirm that the explosion had been caused by a device that was purposely planted beneath the steps to the church,<ref>{{cite news |title=Find Church Bomb Was Planted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19630921&id=uFYaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SScEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7260,18195 |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=September 21, 1963 |access-date=May 27, 2019 }}</ref> close to the women's lounge. A section of wire and remnants of red plastic were discovered here, which could have been part of a timing device. (The plastic remnants were later lost by investigators.)<ref name=terror/>{{rp|63}}

Within days of the bombing, investigators began to focus their attention upon a KKK [[Schism|splinter group]] known as the "Cahaba Boys". The Cahaba Boys had formed earlier in 1963, as they felt that the KKK was becoming restrained and impotent in response to concessions granted to black people to end racial segregation. This group had previously been linked to several bomb attacks at black-owned businesses and the homes of black community leaders throughout the spring and summer of 1963.<ref name=terror>{{cite book |title=1963 Birmingham Church Bombing: The Ku Klux Klan's History of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRSljuExVuIC&pg=PT31 |isbn=9780756540920 |first=Lisa |last=Klobuchar |year = 2009}}</ref>{{rp|57}} Although the Cahaba Boys had fewer than 30 active members,<ref name=ghosts>{{cite news |title=The ghosts of Alabama: After 37 years, two men are indicted for a bombing that transfigured the civil rights movement |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/2000/05/22/ghosts.html |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 22, 2000 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |first=Christopher John |last=Farley }}</ref> among them were Thomas Blanton Jr., Herman Cash, Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Cherry.

Investigators also gathered numerous witness statements attesting to a group of white men in a turquoise [[1957 Chevrolet]] who had been seen near the church in the early hours of the morning of September 15.<ref name=painful>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-apr-14-mn-50901-story.html |title=Birmingham's Painful Past Reopened |first=Mike |last=Clary |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 14, 2001 |access-date=May 27, 2019 }}</ref> These witness statements specifically indicated that a white man had exited the car and walked toward the steps of the church.

===FBI closure of case===
The FBI encountered difficulties in their initial investigation into the bombing. A later report stated: "By 1965, we had [four] serious suspects—namely Thomas Blanton Jr., Herman Frank Cash, Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry, all Klan members—but witnesses were reluctant to talk and [[Real evidence|physical evidence]] was lacking. Also, at that time, information from our surveillance was not admissible in court.

On May 13, 1965, local investigators and the FBI formally named Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry as the perpetrators of the bombing, with Robert Chambliss the likely ringleader of the four.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blackhistorycollection.org/2014/09/30/murderer-of-4-birmingham-girls-found-guilty-38-yrs-later/ |access-date=May 28, 2019 |work=blackhistorycollection.org |first=Chris |last=Preitauer |title=Murderer Of 4 Birmingham Girls Found Guilty (38 yrs later) |date=September 30, 2014 }}</ref> This information was relayed to the Director of the FBI, [[J.

In 1968, the FBI formally closed their investigation into the bombing without filing charges against any of their named suspects. The files were [[Record sealing|sealed]] by order of J. Edgar Hoover.

The Birmingham campaign, the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in August, the September bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church, and the November [[assassination of John F.

Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, newly-[[Inauguration|inaugurated]] President [[Lyndon Johnson]] continued to press for passage of the civil rights bill sought by his predecessor.

On July 2, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed into effect the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

==Formal reopening of investigation==
Officially, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing remained unsolved until after [[Bill Baxley|William Baxley]] was elected Attorney General of Alabama in January 1971. Baxley had been a student at the University of Alabama when he heard about the bombing in 1963, and later recollected: "I wanted to do something, but I didn't know what."<ref>{{cite news |title=Birmingham Church Bombing Conviction Ended an Obsession of the Prosecutor |first=Ray |last=Jenkins |newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] |date=1977-11-21 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zAoiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qnIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1080,4019968 |access-date=2010-11-21}}</ref>

===Prosecution of Robert Chambliss===
On November 14, 1977, Robert Chambliss, then aged 73, stood trial in Birmingham's Jefferson County Courthouse.

Before his trial, Chambliss remained free upon a $200,000 bond raised by family and supporters and posted October 18.<ref name=changed/><ref>{{cite news |title=Trial Set For Nov. 14 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19771029&id=-HMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M9YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1078,4507733 |work=[[Gadsden Times]] |date=October 29, 1977 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

Chambliss pleaded [[Not guilty (plea)|not guilty]] to the charges, insisting that although he had purchased a case of dynamite less than two weeks before the bombing, he had given the dynamite to a known Klan member named [[Gary Thomas Rowe|Gary Thomas Rowe Jr.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19781004&id=RggdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_p0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6171,1342250 |work=[[Tuscaloosa News]] |date=October 4, 1978 |title=Rowe Will Fight Extradition To State |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

To discredit Chambliss's claims that Rowe had committed the bombing, prosecuting attorney William Baxley introduced two law enforcement officers to testify as to Chambliss's inconsistent claims of innocence. The first of these witnesses was Tom Cook, a retired Birmingham police officer, who testified on November 15 as to a conversation he had had with Chambliss in 1975. Cook testified that Chambliss had acknowledged his guilt regarding his 1963 arrest for possession of dynamite, but that he (Chambliss) was insistent he had given the dynamite to Rowe before the bombing. Following Cook's testimony, Baxley introduced police sergeant Ernie Cantrell.<ref>{{cite book|first=Elizabeth H.|last=Cobbs|author2=Smith, Petric J.|date=1994|title=Long Time Coming: An Insider's Story of the Birmingham Church Bombing that Rocked the World|publisher=Crane Hill Publishers|isbn=978-1-881548-10-2|url=https://archive.org/details/longtimecoming00petr}}</ref> He testified that Chambliss had visited his headquarters in 1976 and that he had attempted to affix the blame for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing upon an altogether different member of the KKK. Cantrell also stated that Chambliss had boasted of his knowledge of how to construct a "drip-method bomb" using a [[fishing float]] and a leaking bucket of water. (Upon cross-examination by defense attorney Art Hanes Jr., Cantrell conceded that Chambliss had emphatically denied bombing the church.)

One individual who went to the scene to help search for survivors, Charles Vann, later recollected that he had observed a solitary white man whom he recognized as Robert Edward Chambliss (a known member of the Ku Klux Klan) standing alone and motionless at a barricade. According to Vann's later testimony, Chambliss was standing "looking down toward the church, like a firebug watching his fire".<ref name="CrimeLibrary.com p. 5"/>

One of the key witnesses to testify on behalf of the prosecution was the Reverend Elizabeth Cobbs, Chambliss's niece. Reverend Cobbs stated that her uncle had repeatedly informed her he had been engaged in what he referred to as a "one-man battle" against blacks since the 1940s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chambliss is Identified |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&dat=19771116&id=wyFUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OI0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5737,2303047 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |date=November 16, 1977 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=United Press International }}</ref> Moreover, Cobbs testified on November 16 that, on the day before the bombing, Chambliss had told her that he had in his possession enough dynamite to "flatten half of Birmingham".

In his [[rebuttal]] closing argument, defense attorney Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence presented by the prosecution as being purely [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]],<ref name="Rome News-Tribune Nov. 18, 1977">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=19771118&id=2fUuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BDMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5876,2757715 |title=Chambliss Guilty |work=[[Rome News-Tribune]] |date=November 18, 1977 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref> adding that, despite the existence of similar circumstantial evidence, Chambliss had not been prosecuted in 1963 of the church bombing. Hanes noted conflicting testimony among several of the 12 witnesses called by the defense to testify as to Chambliss's whereabouts on the day of the bombing. A policeman and a neighbor had each testified that Chambliss was at the home of a man named Clarence Dill on that day.

Following the closing arguments, the jury retired to begin their deliberations, which lasted for over six hours and continued into the following day.

On the same afternoon that Chambliss's guilty verdict was announced, prosecutor Baxley issued a [[subpoena]] to Thomas Blanton to appear in court about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Although Baxley knew he had insufficient evidence to charge Blanton at this stage, he intended the subpoena to frighten Blanton into confessing his involvement and negotiating a plea deal to turn state evidence against his co-conspirators. Blanton, however, hired a lawyer and refused to answer any questions.<ref name=carry/>{{rp|574}}

Chambliss appealed his conviction, as provided under the law, saying that much of the evidence presented at his trial—including testimony relating to his activities within the KKK—was circumstantial; that the 14-year delay between the crime and his trial violated his [[constitutional right]] to a speedy trial; and the prosecution had deliberately used the delay to try to gain an advantage over Chambliss's defense attorneys. This appeal was dismissed on May 22, 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19790523&id=1HMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N9YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2768,4097430 |title=Ex-Klansman Loses Appeal |work=[[Gadsden Times]] |date=May 23, 1979 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

==Later prosecutions==
In 1995, ten years after Chambliss died, the FBI reopened their investigation into the church bombing. It was part of a coordinated effort between local, state and federal governments to review cold cases of the civil rights era in the hopes of prosecuting perpetrators.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/23/usa.duncancampbell |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 23, 2002 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |title=Former Klansman convicted of deadly Alabama church bombing 40 years on |first=Duncan |last=Campbell}}</ref> They unsealed 9,000 pieces of evidence previously gathered by the FBI in the 1960s (many of these documents relating to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had not been made available to DA William Baxley in the 1970s). In May 2000, the FBI publicly announced their findings that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had been committed by four members of the KKK splinter group known as the ''Cahaba Boys.'' The four individuals named in the FBI report were Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry.<ref name=ghosts /> By the time of the announcement, Herman Cash had also died;  however, Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry were still alive. Both were arrested.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leith |first=Sam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1395117/Klansman-convicted-of-killing-black-girls.html |title=Klansman convicted of killing black girls |website=The Telegraph |date=2002-05-23 |access-date=2013-09-16 |location=London}}</ref>

On May 16, 2000, a [[grand jury]] in Alabama indicted Thomas Edwin Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry on eight counts each in relation to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Both named individuals were charged with four counts of first-degree murder, and four counts of universal malice.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/13/us/1963-birmingham-church-bombing-fast-facts/ |work=[[CNN]] |date=September 7, 2018 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |title=1963 Birmingham Church Bombing Fast Facts }}</ref> The following day, both men surrendered to police.<ref name=lastchance>{{cite book|first=T.

The state prosecution had originally intended to try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due to the findings of a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation.<ref>{{cite news |title=As Church Bombing Trial Begins in Birmingham, the City's Past Is Very Much Present |first=Kevin |last=Sack |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2001-04-25 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/us/church-bombing-trial-begins-birmingham-city-s-past-very-much-present.html |access-date=2010-11-21}}</ref> It concluded that [[vascular dementia]] had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in his own defense.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=20010426&id=pF1IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xgMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2769,2868949 |title=A Long Time Coming |work=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=April 26, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>

On April 10, 2001, Judge James Garrett indefinitely postponed Cherry's trial, pending further medical analysis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=20010601&id=fUogAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J6YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5553,42631 |title=Cherry Found Mentally Sound |work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |date=June 1, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref> In January 2002, Judge Garrett ruled Cherry mentally competent to stand trial and set an initial trial date for April 29.

===Thomas Edwin Blanton===
Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. was brought to trial in Birmingham, Alabama, before Judge James Garrett on April 24, 2001.<ref name="wsws.org May 5, 2001"/> Blanton pleaded not guilty to the charges and chose not to testify on his behalf throughout the trial.

In his [[opening statement]] to the jurors, defense attorney John Robbins acknowledged his client's affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan and his views on racial segregation. But, he warned the jury: "Just because you don't like him, that doesn't make him responsible for the bombing."<ref name="Lakeland Ledger Apr. 25, 2001"/>

The prosecution called a total of seven witnesses to testify in their case against Blanton, including relatives of the victims, John Cross, the former pastor of the 16th Street Baptist Church; an FBI agent named William Fleming, and Mitchell Burns, a former Klansman who had become a paid FBI informant. Burns had secretly recorded several conversations with Blanton in which the latter (Blanton) had gloated when talking about the bombing, and had boasted the police would not catch him when he bombed another church.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=20021123&id=L1wpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d6YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5456,7112358 |work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |date=November 23, 2002 |title=Former Klansman who was Key Witness at Bombing Trial Dies |agency=Associated Press |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>

The most crucial piece of evidence presented at Blanton's trial was an audio recording secretly taped by the FBI in June 1964, in which Blanton was recorded discussing his involvement in the bombing with his wife, who can be heard accusing her husband of conducting an affair with a woman named Waylen Vaughn two nights before the bombing. Although sections of the recording—presented in evidence on April 27—are unintelligible, Blanton can twice be heard mentioning the phrase "plan a bomb" or "plan the bomb". Most crucially, Blanton can also be heard saying that he was not with Miss Vaughn but, two nights before the bombing, was at a meeting with other Klansmen on a bridge above the [[Cahaba River]].<ref name="Star-News Apr. 28, 2001">{{cite news |title=Secret Tape Played at Trial |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=20010428&id=SQlPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RR8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6533,3381307 |work=[[Star-News]] |date=April 28, 2001 |first=Jay |last=Reeves |agency=Associated Press |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> He said: "You've got to have a meeting to plan a bomb."<ref name="Star-News Apr. 28, 2001"/>

In addition to calling attention to flaws in the prosecution's case, the defense exposed inconsistencies in the memories of some prosecution witnesses who had testified. Blanton's attorneys criticized the validity and quality of the 16 tape recordings introduced as evidence,<ref>{{cite news |title=Church Bombing Verdict Hinges on how Jurors Understand Tapes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20010429&id=l7oeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A9AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6433,11863857 |first=Bob |last=Johnson |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |date=April 29, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> arguing that the prosecution had edited and spliced the sections of the audio recording that were secretly obtained within Blanton's kitchen, reducing the entirety of the tape by 26 minutes. He said that the sections introduced as evidence were of poor audio quality, resulting in the prosecution presenting text transcripts of questionable accuracy to the jury. About the recordings made as Blanton conversed with Burns, Robbins emphasized that Burns had earlier testified that Blanton had never expressly said that he had made or planted the bomb.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jury Hears More Old Tapes in Church Bombing Trial |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=20010429&id=-YsvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=otwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4971,8096242 |work=[[Southeast Missourian]] |date=April 29, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press]] }}</ref> The defense  portrayed the audiotapes introduced into evidence as the statements of "two [[redneck]]s driving around, drinking" and making false, ego-inflating claims to one another.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/05/01/church.bombing.05/index.html |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 1, 2001 |title=Birmingham church bomber guilty, gets four life terms |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>

The trial lasted for one week. Seven witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution, and two for the defense. One of the defense witnesses was a retired chef named Eddie Mauldin, who was called to testify to [[Discrediting tactic|discredit]] prosecution witnesses' statements that they had seen Blanton in the vicinity of the church before the bombing. Mauldin testified on April 30 that he had observed two men in a [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] station wagon adorned with a Confederate flag repeatedly drive past the church immediately before the blast, and that, seconds after the bomb had exploded, the car had "burned rubber" as it drove away. (Thomas Blanton had owned a Chevrolet in 1963;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/us/testimony-concludes-in-trial-on-birmingham-church-blast.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 1, 2001 |title=Testimony Concludes in Trial On Birmingham Church Blast |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref> neither Chambliss, Cash nor Cherry had owned such a vehicle.)

Both counsels delivered their closing arguments before the jury on May 1. In his closing argument, prosecuting attorney and future U.S. Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] said that although the trial was conducted 38 years after the bombing, it was no less important, adding: "It's never too late for the truth to be told ... It's never too late for a man to be held accountable for his crimes." Jones reviewed Blanton's extensive history with the Ku Klux Klan, before referring to the audio recordings presented earlier in the trial. Jones repeated the most damning statements Blanton had made in these recordings, before pointing at Blanton and stating: "That is a confession out of this man's mouth."<ref>''Crimes and Trials of the Century'' {{ISBN|978-0-313-34110-6}} p. 280</ref>

Defense attorney John Robbins reminded the jury in his closing argument that his client was an admitted segregationist and a "loudmouth", but that was all that could be proven. He said this past was not the evidence upon which they should return their verdicts. Stressing that Blanton should not be judged for his beliefs, Robbins again vehemently criticized the validity and poor quality of the audio recordings presented, and the selectivity of the sections which had been introduced into evidence. Robbins also discredited the testimony of FBI agent William Fleming, who had earlier testified as to a government witness claiming he had seen Blanton in the vicinity of the church shortly before the bombing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=20010501&id=pm4qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5VIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3211,8452 |title=Testimony Wraps up in Bombing Trial |work=[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]]|agency=Associated Press |date=May 1, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>

His first parole hearing was held on August 3, 2016. Relatives of the slain girls, prosecutor Doug Jones, Alabama Chief Deputy Attorney General [[Alice Martin]], and Jefferson County district attorney Brandon Falls each spoke at the hearing to oppose Blanton's parole. Martin said: "The cold-blooded callousness of this hate crime has not diminished by the passage of time." The Board of Pardons and Paroles debated for less than 90 seconds before denying parole to Blanton.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/07/sixteenth_street_baptist_churc.html |title=Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bomber up for parole next month |first=Kent |last=Faulk |date=July 14, 2016 |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=July 16, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/08/alabama_board_considering_paro.html |title=16th Street Baptist Church bomber Thomas Blanton denied parole |first=Kent |last=Faulk |date=August 3, 2016 |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=August 6, 2016 }}</ref>

===Bobby Frank Cherry===
Bobby Frank Cherry was tried in Birmingham, Alabama, before Judge James Garrett, on May 6, 2002.<ref>{{cite book |title=Race, Law and Public Policy |isbn=978-1-58073-019-8 |page=426 |first=Robert, Jr. |last=Johnson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRYDK0baMa4C&pg=PA426 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |publisher=[[Black Classic Press]] |year=1998 }}</ref> Cherry  pleaded not guilty to the charges and did not testify on his own behalf during the trial.

In his opening statement for the prosecution, Don Cochran presented his case: that the evidence would show that Cherry had participated in a conspiracy to commit the bombing and conceal evidence linking him to the crime and that he had later gloated over the deaths of the victims. Cochran also added that although the evidence to be presented would not conclusively show that Cherry had personally planted or ignited the bomb, the combined evidence would illustrate that he had [[aiding and abetting|aided and abetted]] in the commission of the act.<ref name=lastchance/>{{rp|ch. 35}}

Cherry's defense attorney, Mickey Johnson, protested his client's innocence, citing that much of the evidence presented was circumstantial. He also noted that Cherry had initially been linked to the bombing by the FBI via an informant who had claimed, fifteen months after the bombing, that she had seen Cherry place the bomb at the church shortly before the bombing. Johnson warned the jurors they would have to distinguish between evidence and proof.

Following the opening statements, the prosecution began presenting witnesses. Crucial testimony at Cherry's trial was delivered by his former wife, Willadean Brogdon, who had married Cherry in 1970. Brogdon testified on May 16 that Cherry had boasted to her that he had been the individual who planted the bomb beneath the steps to the church, then returned hours later to light the fuse to the dynamite. Brogdon also testified that Cherry had told her of his regret that children had died in the bombing, before adding his satisfaction that they would never reproduce. Although the credibility of Brogdon's testimony was called into dispute at the trial, forensic experts conceded that, although her account of the planting of the bombing differed from that which had been discussed in the previous perpetrators' trials, Brogdon's recollection of Cherry's account of the planting and subsequent lighting of the bomb could explain why no conclusive remnants of a timing device were discovered after the bombing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/17/us/witnesses-say-ex-klansman-boasted-of-church-bombing.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Witnesses Say Ex-Klansman Boasted of Church Bombing |first=Rick |last=Bragg |date=May 17, 2002 |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> (A fishing float attached to a section of wire, which may have been part of a timing device, was found {{convert|20|ft|m}} from the explosion crater<ref name="Rome News-Tribune Nov. 18, 1977"/> following the bombing.

Barbara Ann Cross also testified for the prosecution. She is the daughter of the Reverend John Cross and was aged 13 in 1963. Cross had attended the same Sunday School class as the four victims on the day of the bombing and was slightly wounded in the attack. On May 15,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&dat=20020515&id=K9wfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WNkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1567,3065168 |work=[[Nevada Daily Mail]] |date=May 15, 2002 |first=Bob |last=Johnson |title=Explosives Expert Testifies In Church Bombing Trial |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref> Cross testified that prior to the explosion, she and the four girls killed had each attended a Youth Day Sunday School lesson in which the theme taught was how to react to a physical injustice. Cross testified that each girl present had been taught to contemplate how Jesus would react to affliction or injustice, and they were asked to learn to consider, "What Would Jesus Do?"<ref name=lastchance/> Cross testified that she would usually have accompanied her friends into the basement lounge to change into robes for the forthcoming sermon, but she had been given an assignment. Shortly thereafter, she had heard "the most horrible noise", before being struck on the head by debris.

Throughout the trial, Cherry's defense attorney, Mickey Johnson, repeatedly observed that many of the prosecution's witnesses were either circumstantial or "inherently unreliable". Many of the same audiotapes presented in Blanton's trial were also introduced into evidence in the trial of Bobby Cherry. A key point contested as to the validity of the audiotapes being introduced into evidence, outside the hearing of the jury, was the fact that Cherry had no grounds to contest the introduction of the tapes into evidence, as, under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], neither his home or property had been subject to discreet recording by the FBI. Don Cochran disputed this position, arguing that Alabama law provides for "conspiracies to conceal evidence" to be proven by both inference and circumstantial evidence.<ref name=lastchance/> In spite of a rebuttal argument by the defense, Judge Garrett ruled that some sections were too prejudicial, but also that portions of some audio recordings could be introduced as evidence. Through these rulings, Mitchell Burns was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. His testimony was restricted to the areas of the recordings permitted into evidence.

On May 21, 2002, both prosecution and defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments to the jury. In his closing argument for the prosecution, Don Cochran said the victims' "Youth Sunday [sermon] never happened ... because it was destroyed by this defendant's hate."<ref name=washingtontimes2002>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/may/22/20020522-025235-4231r/ |title=Prosecutor says justice 'overdue' in '63 bombing |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=May 22, 2002 }}</ref> Cochran outlined Cherry's extensive record of racial violence dating back to the 1950s, and noted that he had experience and training in constructing and installing bombs from his service as a Marine demolition expert. Cochran also reminded the jury of a secretly obtained FBI recording, which had earlier been introduced into evidence, in which Cherry had told his first wife, Jean, that he and other Klansmen had constructed the bomb within the premises of business the Friday before the bombing. He said that Cherry had signed an [[affidavit]] in the presence of the FBI on October 9, 1963, confirming that he, Chambliss, and Blanton were at these premises on this date.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/us/more-than-just-a-racist-now-the-jury-must-decide.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 22, 2002 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |first=Rick |last=Bragg |title=More Than Just a Racist? Now the Jury Must Decide }}</ref>

In the closing argument for the defense, attorney Mickey Johnson argued that Cherry had nothing to do with the bombing, and reminded the jurors that his client was not on trial for his beliefs, stating: "It seems like more time has been spent here throwing around the [[nigger|n-word]] than proving what happened in September 1963."<ref name=washingtontimes2002/> Johnson reiterated that there was no hard evidence linking Cherry to the bombing, but only evidence attesting to his racist beliefs dating from that era, adding that the family members who had testified against him were all estranged and therefore should be considered unreliable witnesses. Johnson urged the jury against convicting his client by [[Association fallacy|association]].

Following these closing arguments, the jury retired to consider their verdicts. These deliberations continued until the following day.

On the afternoon of May 22, after the jury had deliberated for almost seven hours, the forewoman announced they had reached their verdicts: Bobby Frank Cherry was convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name="CherryObitNYT">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/us/bobby-frank-cherry-74-klansman-in-bombing-dies.html | title=Bobby Frank Cherry, 74, Klansman in Bombing, Dies | work=[[The New York Times]] |date= 2004-11-19 | first=Michelle | last=O'Donnell | access-date = 2009-02-05}}</ref> Cherry remained stoic as the sentence was read aloud.

When asked by the judge whether he had anything to say before sentence was imposed, Cherry motioned to the prosecutors and stated: "This whole bunch lied through this thing [the trial]. I told the truth. I don't know why I'm going to jail for nothing. I haven't done anything!"<ref name="Al.com May 23, 2002"/>

Bobby Frank Cherry died of cancer on November 18, 2004, at age 74, while incarcerated at the [[Kilby Correctional Facility]].<ref name="CherryObitNYT" />

Following the convictions of Blanton and Cherry, Alabama's former Attorney General, William Baxley, expressed his frustration that he had never been informed of the existence of the FBI audio recordings before they were introduced in the 2001 and 2002 trials. Baxley acknowledged that typical juries in 1960s Alabama would have likely leaned in favor of both defendants, even if these recordings had been presented as evidence,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-05-07/news/0105070214_1_blanton-justice-denied-birmingham |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=May 7, 2001 |archive-date=2016-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327232736/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-05-07/news/0105070214_1_blanton-justice-denied-birmingham |title=Delayed, not Denied |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> but said that he could have prosecuted Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry in 1977 if he had been granted access to these tapes. (A 1980 Justice Department report concluded that J. Edgar Hoover had blocked the prosecution of the four bombing suspects in 1965,<ref name="Times Daily May 23, 2002"/> and he officially closed the FBI's investigation in 1968.<ref name="wsws.org May 5, 2001"/>)

==A possible fifth conspirator==
Although both Blanton and Cherry denied their involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, until his death in 1985, Robert Chambliss repeatedly insisted that the bombing had been committed by Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. Rowe had been encouraged to join the Klan by acquaintances in 1960. He became a paid FBI [[informant]] in 1961.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19800218&id=z_tLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Oe4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6777,1768735 |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=February 18, 1980 |title=Hoover Let 4 Off Hook In Murders |first=Howell |last=Raines |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> In this role, Rowe acted as an [[agent provocateur]] between 1961<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/us/gary-t-rowe-jr-64-who-informed-on-klan-in-civil-rights-killing-is-dead.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 4, 1998 |title=Gary T. Rowe Jr., 64, Who Informed on Klan In Civil Rights Killing, Is Dead |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> and 1965. Although informative to the FBI, Rowe participated in violence against both black and white civil rights activists. By Rowe's own later admission, while serving as an FBI informant, he had shot and killed an unidentified black man and had been an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of [[Viola Liuzzo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19781003&id=qWdPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cyQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6790,3991996 |work=The Times-News |date=October 3, 1978 |title=Long Fight Predicted In Case Against Rowe |access-date=May 28, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

Investigative records show that Rowe had twice failed [[polygraph]] tests when questioned as to his possible involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions.<ref name=informer>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PP4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0wUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6080%2C3226591 |title=Paid FBI Informer Tells Of Murder, Silence |first=Howell |last=Raines |work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=July 11, 1978 |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> These polygraph results had convinced some FBI agents of Rowe's culpability in the bombing. Prosecutors at Chambliss's 1977 trial had initially intended to call Rowe as a witness; however, DA William Baxley had chosen not to call Rowe as a witness after being informed of the results of these polygraph tests.

Although never formally named as one of the conspirators by the FBI, Rowe's record of deception on the polygraph tests leaves open the possibility that Chambliss's claims may have held a degree of truth.<ref name=informer /> Nonetheless, a 1979 investigation cleared Rowe of any involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3379 |website=encyclopediaofalabama.org |title=Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. |first=Keith S. |last=Hebert |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>

* Following the bombing, the 16th Street Baptist Church remained closed for over eight months, as assessments and, later, repairs were conducted upon the property. Both the church and the bereaved families received an estimated $23,000 in cash donations from members of the public.<ref name="crimes and trials"/> Gifts totalling over $186,000 were donated from around the world. The church reopened to members of the public on June 7, 1964, and continues to remain an active place of worship today, with an average weekly attendance of nearly 2,000 worshippers.

* Welsh craftsman and artist John Petts was inspired to construct and deliver the iconic stained-glass ''Welsh Window'' to the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1965. The ''Welsh Window'' is a large stained-glass edifice depicting a black Jesus, with arms outstretched, reminiscent of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. Erected at the church in 1965,<ref name=younge/> the Welsh Window stands over the front door of the sanctuary.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA1029 |section=Sixteenth Street Baptist Church |title=Encyclopedia of African-American History |page=1029 |isbn=9780195167795 |last1=Alexander |first1=Leslie M. |author2=Walter C Rucker JR |date=February 9, 2010 }}</ref>
* The American sculptor [[John Henry Waddell]] has created a memorial symbolizing those killed in the bombing. Entitled ''That Which Might Have Been: Birmingham 1963'', the sculpture—depicting four adult women in differing postures—was created over a period of 15 months.<ref name=waddell /> The four women in the sculpture are each depicted in symbolic terms; representing the four victims of the bombing, had they been allowed to mature to womanhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artbyjohnwaddell.com/JHW/That_which_might_have_been.html |title=That which might have been |publisher=Artbyjohnwaddell.com |access-date=2013-09-16 }}</ref> The sculpture was originally displayed at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1969. A second casting of the sculpture was intended for display in Birmingham; however, due to controversy over the nudity of the women in the sculpture, this second casting is now on display at the George Washington Carver Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM8ZFV_That_Which_Might_Have_Been_Birmingham_1963_Phoenix_Arizona |website=Waymarking.com |title=That Which Might Have Been, Birmingham 1963 - Phoenix, Arizona - Smithsonian Art Inventory Sculptures on Waymarking.com |access-date=May 28, 2019 }}</ref>
* The names of the four girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing are engraved upon the [[Civil Rights Memorial]].
