==Etymology==
There are three established theories regarding the origin of the toponym "Madrid" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explain the phonetic evolution of the toponym along history), namely:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pérez Orozco|title=El origen del topónimo Madrid|first=Santiago|journal=Anales del Instituto de Estudios Madrileños|publisher=[[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]]|location=Madrid|volume=XLVII|year=2007|pages=701–703|issn=0584-6374|url=http://xn--institutoestudiosmadrileos-4rc.es/pdf/Tomo_XLVII_2007.pdf}}</ref>
* A [[Continental Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin (Madrid < * ''Magetoritum'';{{Sfn|Pérez Orozco|2007|p=701}} with the root "-ritu" meaning "[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]").
* From the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''maǧrà'' (meaning "water stream").{{Sfn|Pérez Orozco|2007|p=701}}
* A [[Mozarabic]] variant of the Latin ''matrix'', ''matricis'' (also meaning "water stream").{{Sfn|Pérez Orozco|2007|p=701}}
<!--
{{lang|ar|مجريط}} ''Majrīṭ'' (AFI {{IPA|[madʒriːtˤ]}}) is the first documented reference to the city. It is recorded in [[Andalusi Arabic]] during the [[al-Andalus]] period. The name ''Magerit'' ({{IPA|[madʒeˈɾit]}}) was retained in [[Old Spanish language|Medieval Spanish]]. The most ancient recorded name of the city "Magerit" (for ''*Materit'' or ''*Mageterit''?) comes from the name of a fortress built on the Manzanares River in the 9th century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and means "Place of abundant water" in Arabic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indigoguide.com/spain/madrid-history.htm |title=Madrid History&nbsp;– Museums&nbsp;– Suggested Itineraries Madrid |publisher=Indigoguide.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101205922/http://www.indigoguide.com/spain/madrid-history.htm |archive-date=1 January 2011 }}</ref>  A wider number of theories have been formulated on possible earlier origins.

According to legend, Madrid was founded by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tyrrhenius of Tuscany and [[Mantua]]) and was named "Metragirta" or "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the original name of the city was "Ursaria" ("land of [[bear]]s" in [[Latin]]), because of the many bears that were to be found in the nearby forests, which, together with the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (Spanish ''madroño''), have been the emblem of the city since the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=autogenerated>{{cite web |url=http://elmadridmedieval.jmcastellanos.com/ |title=El Madrid Medieval (Medieval Madrid). Includes Pre-historic, Roman and medieval up to the Catholic Monarchs|work=History of Madrid. |publisher=José Manuel Castellanos |accessdate=28 October 2007 |language= es}}</ref>

Nevertheless, it is also speculated that the origin of the name of the city comes from the 2nd century BC. The [[Roman Empire]] established a settlement on the banks of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]] river. The name of this first village was "Matrice" (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). Following the invasions carried out by the Germanic [[Suebi|Sueves]] and [[Vandals]], as well as the Sarmatic [[Alans]] during the 5th century AD, the Roman Empire no longer had the military presence required to defend its territories on the Iberian Peninsula, and as a consequence, these territories were soon occupied by the [[Vandals]], who were in turn dispelled by the [[Visigoths]], who then ruled [[Hispania]] in the name of the Roman emperor, also taking control of "Matrice". In the 8th century, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] saw the name changed to "Mayrit", from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term {{lang|ar|ميرا}} ''Mayra''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} (referencing water as a 'tree' or 'giver of life') and the Ibero-Roman suffix ''it'' that means 'place'. The modern "Madrid" evolved from the [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] "Matrit", which is still in the Madrilenian [[Demonym|gentilic]].<ref name="El origen del nombre">{{cite news|url=http://www.nova.es/~jlb/mad_es05.htm|publisher=JLL & JRP|date=16 August 2006|title=El origen del nombre.}}</ref>

After the disintegration of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the [[Taifa of Toledo]].

In the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]], who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo,{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|p=9}} in turn conquered in 1085.

Since the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the ''concejo'' of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the ''concejo'' of [[Segovia]], a powerful town north of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its husbandry-based economy, contrasted by the agricultural and less competent in repopulation town of Madrid.{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|pp=11–12}} After the decline of [[Sepúlveda, Segovia|Sepúlveda]], another ''concejo'' north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the [[Lozoya (river)|Lozoya]] and [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]] rivers to the north of Madrid and along the [[Guadarrama (river)|Guadarrama river]] course to its west.{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|pp=11–12}}

In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]], and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435.

===Modern Age===
During the [[revolt of the Comuneros]], led by [[Juan de Padilla]], Madrid joined the revolt against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Holy Roman Emperor]], but after defeat at the [[Battle of Villalar]], Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of ''Coronada'' (Crowned) and ''Imperial''.

The number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices.

=== Second Republic and Civil War ===
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]] was the first to legislate the location of the country's capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid.

A staple of the Post-war Madrid (''Madrid de la posguerra'') was the widespread use of [[Rationing|ration coupons]].{{Sfn|García Ballesteros|Revilla González|2006|p=16}} Meat and fish consumption was scarce, and starvation and lack of proteins were a cause of high mortality.{{Sfn|García Ballesteros|Revilla González|2006|pp=17–18}} As the protracted right-wing despise towards the city nurtured during the Second Republic turned up to eleven during the war, the victors toyed with the possibility of moving the capital elsewhere (most notably to [[Seville]]), yet such plans did not materialize, and the Francoist regime conducted then an attempt to resignificate the city, stemming from the Spanish Imperial ideal.{{Sfn|Faraldo|Rodríguez-López|2019|pp=107–124}}

The intense demographic growth experienced by the city via mass immigration from the rural areas of the country led to the construction of plenty of housing in the peripheral areas of the city to absorb the new population (reinforcing the processes of social polarization of the city),{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|p=175}} initially comprising substandard housing (with as many as 50,000 [[shack]]s scattered around the city by 1956).{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|p=175; 178}} A transitional planning intended to temporarily replace the shanty towns were the ''poblados de absorción'', introduced since the mid-1950s in locations such as [[Canillas (Madrid)|Canillas]], [[San Fermín (Madrid)|San Fermín]], Caño Roto, [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], {{ill|Pan Bendito|es}}, [[El Zofío|Zofío]] and [[Fuencarral]], aiming to work as a sort of "high-end" shacks (with the destinataries participating in the construction of their own housing) but under the aegis of a wider coordinated urban planning.{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|pp=179–180}}

The municipality grew through the annexation of neighbouring municipalities, achieving the present extension of {{convert|607|km²|2|abbr=on}}. The south of Madrid became very industrialised, and there were massive [[Human migration|migrations]] from rural areas of Spain into the city. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of the new thriving middle class that appeared as result of the [[Spanish miracle|1960s Spanish economic boom]], while the south-eastern periphery became an extensive working-class settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform.<ref name="History of Madrid 2"/>

=== Recent history ===
After the death of Franco and the start of the democratic regime, the 1978 constitution confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain. The [[1979 Madrid City Council election|1979 municipal election]] brought Madrid's first democratic mayor since the Second Republic.

Madrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the failed coup, [[23-F]], on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the centre-left PSOE ([[Enrique Tierno Galván]], [[Juan Barranco Gallardo]]). Since the late 1970s and through the 1980s Madrid became the center of the cultural movement known as ''[[Movida madrileña|la Movida]]''. Conversely, just like in the rest of the country, a [[Opioid epidemic|heroin crisis]] took a toll in the poor neighborhoods of Madrid in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jotdown.es/2018/10/quinquis-un-vistazo-rapido-a-las-barriadas-espanolas-de-los-ochenta/|title=Quinquis: un vistazo rápido a las barriadas españolas de los 80|first=Nacho|last=Carretero|date=October 2018|website=Jot Down}}</ref>

==Geography==
=== Location ===
[[File:Madrid ESA354454 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Madrid as seen by the [[Sentinel-2]] satellite in February 2016]]
Madrid lies on the southern Meseta Central, 60&nbsp;km south of the [[Guadarrama mountain range]] and straddling the [[Jarama]] and [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]] river sub-drainage basins, in the wider [[Tagus River]] catchment area. There is a considerable difference in altitude within the city proper ranging from the {{convert|700|m|0|abbr=on}} around [[Plaza de Castilla]] in the north of city to the {{convert|570|m|0|abbr=on}} around ''La China'' wastewater treatment plant on the Manzanares' riverbanks, near the latter's confluence with the Fuente Castellana thalweg in the south of the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Rafael|last=Fraguas|journal=[[El País]] |title=Siete colinas bajo el asfalto |date=3 March 2007 |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/03/04/madrid/1173011061_850215.html}}</ref> The [[Monte de El Pardo]] (a protected forested area covering over a quarter of the municipality) reaches its top altitude ({{convert|843|m|0|abbr=on}}) on its perimeter, in the slopes surrounding {{ill|El Pardo reservoir|es|Embalse de El Pardo}} located at the north-western end of the municipality, in the [[Fuencarral-El Pardo]] district.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Estudio de la cartografía antigua de El Monte de El Pardo|last1=Gonzalo Muñoz|first1=A.|last2=González Doncel|first2=I. |publisher=Sociedad Española de Ciencias Forestales |location=Plasencia |isbn=978-84-941695-2-6|title=VII Congreso Forestal Español|page=1 |chapter-url=http://secforestales.org/publicaciones/index.php/congresos_forestales/article/view/19237/18954}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Madrid}}
Madrid has an inland [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/92/|title=Climate: Madrid - Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table - Climate-Data.org|work=climate-data.org}}</ref> in the western half of the city transitioning to a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') in the eastern half.<ref>{{cite web|author=J.

Summers are hot, in the warmest month, July, average temperatures during the day range from {{convert|32|to|34|C}} depending on location, with maxima commonly climbing over {{convert|35|C}} during the frequent heat waves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal ranges]] are often significant during the summer. The highest recorded temperature was on 24 July 1995, at {{convert|42.2|C}}, and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 at {{convert|−15.3|C}}. These records were registered at the airport, in the eastern side of the city.<ref>{{cite web | last=Meteorología | first=Agencia Estatal de | title=Extreme values.

It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms during the season.

===Water supply===
[[File:Comienza la restauración del Viaje de Agua de Amaniel para permitir visitas didácticas 04.jpg|thumb|right|Viaje de Amaniel]]
In the 17th century, the so-called "''viajes de agua''" (a kind of water channels or ''[[qanat]]'') were used to provide water to the city. Some of the most important ones were the {{ill|Viaje de Amaniel|es|Viaje de Amaniel}} (1610–1621, sponsored by the Crown), the {{ill|Viaje de Fuente Castellana|es|Viaje de la Castellana}} (1613–1620) and {{ill|Abroñigal Alto|es|Abroñigal Alto}}/{{ill|Abroñigal Bajo|es|Bajo Abroñigal}} (1617–1630), sponsored by the City Council. They were the main infrastructure for the supply of water until the arrival of the [[Canal de Isabel II]] in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM010691.pdf|chapter=Introducción|publisher=Fundación Canal|location=Madrid|first=Virgilio|last=Pinto Crespo|pages=7–9|isbn= 978-84-932119-6-7|title=Los viajes de agua de Madrid durante el antiguo régimen|year=2010}}</ref>

Madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its [[water supply]] from dams and reservoirs built on the [[Lozoya (river)|Lozoya River]], such as the [[El Atazar Dam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historialia.com/detalle/243/presa-de-el-atazar-madrid|title=HISTORIALIA – Presa de El Atazar. Madrid|work=historialia.com}}</ref> This water supply is managed by the Canal de Isabel II, a public entity created in 1851. It is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the natural water resources of the Madrid region.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Madrid}}
The population of Madrid has overall increased since the city became the capital of Spain in the mid-16th century, and has stabilised at approximately 3&nbsp;million since the 1970s.

From 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper.

The [[Population growth|demographic boom]] accelerated in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to [[immigration]] in parallel with a surge in Spanish [[economic growth]].

The wider Madrid region is the EU region with the highest average life expectancy at birth. The average life expectancy was 82.2 years for males and 87.8 for females in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_statistics_at_regional_level|title=Population statistics at regional level - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>

As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world, with most of the immigrants coming from [[Latin America]]n countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telemadrid.es/noticias/madrid/Crece-poblacion-extranjera-Madrid-llegar-0-2038596138--20180810061051.html|publisher=[[Telemadrid]]|title=Crece un 6% la población extranjera en Madrid hasta llegar al 21,5%|date=10 August 2018}}</ref> In 2020, around 76 % of the registered population was Spain-born,<ref name=foreignborn /> while, regarding the foreign-born population (24 %),<ref name=foreignborn>{{Cite web|url=https://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/UDCEstadistica/Nuevaweb/Demograf%C3%ADa%20y%20poblaci%C3%B3n/Poblaci%C3%B3n%20extranjera/Nacimiento/Poblaci%C3%B3n%20a%201%20de%20enero/C4120320.xlsx|format=[[xlsx|.xslx]]|access-date=7 July 2020|publisher=[[Ayuntamiento de Madrid]]|title=Población por País de nacimiento}}</ref> the bulk of it relates to [[Americas|the Americas]] (around 16 % of the total population), and a lesser fraction of the population is born in other [[Europe|European]], [[Asia|Asian]] and [[Africa|African]] countries.

As of 2019 the highest rising national group of immigrants was Venezuelans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/espana/madrid/abci-exodo-venezolano-empuja-madrid-record-historico-poblacion-extranjera-201904170054_noticia.html|website=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|title=El éxodo venezolano empuja a Madrid a su récord histórico de población extranjera|date=17 April 2019|first=Luis|last=Cano}}</ref>

Regarding religious beliefs, according to a 2019 [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]] (CIS) survey with a sample size of 469 respondents, 20.7% of respondents in Madrid identify themselves as practising [[Catholic]]s, 45.8% as non-practising Catholics, 3.8% as believers of another religion, 11.1% as [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], 3.6% as indifferent towards religion, and 12.8% as [[Atheism|atheists]]. The remaining 2.1% did not state their religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datos.cis.es/pdf/Es3253marMT_MMadrid_A.pdf|title=Postelectoral Elecciones Autonómicas y municipales 2019.

The City Council (''Ayuntamiento de Madrid'') is the body responsible for the government and administration of the municipality. It is formed by the Plenary (''Pleno''), the Mayor (''alcalde'') and the Government Board (''Junta de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Madrid'').

The Plenary of the Ayuntamiento is the body of [[representation (politics)|political representation]] of the citizens in the [[Local government|municipal government]]. Its 57 members are elected for a 4-year mandate. Some of its attributions are: fiscal matters, the election and deposition of the mayor, the approval and modification of decrees and regulations, the approval of budgets, the agreements related to the limits and alteration of the municipal term, the services management, the participation in supramunicipal organisations, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munimadrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid/menuitem.5fbdbaf471a1b0aa7d245f019fc08a0c/?vgnextoid=da51a5a66b2ce010VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=f4ea39b48936c010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD |title=Pleno de Madrid (Spanish Only) |language= es |publisher=Munimadrid.es |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

The mayor, the supreme representative of the city, presides over the [[Ayuntamiento (Spain)|''Ayuntamiento'']]. He is charged with giving impetus to the municipal policies, managing the action of the rest of bodies and directing the executive municipal administration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/2006/BOE-A-2006-12057-consolidado.pdf|page=13|publisher=[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]]|title=Ley 22/2006, de 4 de julio, de Capitalidad y de Régimen Especial de Madrid}}</ref> He is responsible to the ''Pleno''. He is also entitled to preside over the meetings of the ''Pleno'', although this responsility can be delegated to another municipal councillor. [[José Luis Martínez-Almeida]], a member of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], serves as Mayor since 2019.

The Government Board consists of the mayor, the deputy mayor(s) and a number of delegates assuming the portfolios for the different government areas. All those positions are held by municipal councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munimadrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/El-Ayuntamiento/Gobierno-y-Administracion/Junta-de-Gobierno-de-la-Ciudad-de-Madrid/Junta-de-Gobierno-de-la-Ciudad-de-Madrid?vgnextfmt=especial3&vgnextoid=f22aad613938d010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD&vgnextchannel=18b9e3d5d3e07010VgnVCM100000dc0ca8c0RCRD |title=Local Government Organization (Spanish Only) |language= es |publisher=Munimadrid.es |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

Little medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the [[Almendra Central]], including the [[Church of San Nicolás (Madrid)|San Nicolás]] and [[San Pedro el Real, Madrid|San Pedro el Viejo]] church towers, the church of [[San Jerónimo el Real]], and the [[Chapel of Obispo de Madrid|Bishop's Chapel]]. Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the [[Bridge of Segovia (Madrid)|Bridge of Segovia]] and the [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]].

Philip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. During the Early Hapsburg period, the import of European influences took place, underpinned by the monicker of ''Austrian style''. The Austrian style featured not only Austrian influences but also Italian and Dutch (as well as Spanish), reflecting on the international preeminence of the Hapsburgs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arquitectura y espacio urbano en Madrid en los siglos XVII y XVIII|year=2007|first=Jesús<!--|pages=50–65-->|last=Escobar|publisher=[[Ayuntamiento de Madrid]]|chapter=Arquitectura y urbanismo en el Madrid del siglo XVII: proceso, adorno y experiencia|url=https://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/MuseosMunicipales/MuseoDeHistoriaDeMadrid/EspecialInformativo/05_Publicaciones/ConferenciasArquitectura/conferenciasarquitectura2.pdf|page=54}}</ref> During the second half of the 16th-century the use of pointy slate [[spire]]s in order to top structures such as church towers was imported to Spain from Central Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|page=4|url=http://oa.upm.es/43387/1/RAIMUNDO_ESTEPA_GOMEZ_01.pdf|publisher=[[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid]]|location=Madrid|title=Chapiteles del siglo XVI al XVIII en Madrid y su entorno: sus armaduras de madera|last=Estepa Gómez|first=Raimundo|year=2015}}</ref> Slate spires and roofs consequently became a staple of the Madrilenian architecture at the time.<ref name=lib>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edicioneslalibreria.es/arquitectura-en-el-madrid-de-los-austrias/|publisher=Ediciones La Librería|title=Arquitectura en el Madrid de los Austrias|date=18 January 2016}}</ref>

Stand out architecture in the city dating back to the early 17th-century includes several buildings and structures (most of them attributed to [[Juan Gómez de Mora]]) such as the [[Palacio de los Concejos|Palace of the Duke of Uceda]] (1610), the [[Royal Monastery of La Encarnación|Monastery of La Encarnación]] (1611–1616); the [[Plaza Mayor de Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] (1617–1619) or the ''Cárcel de Corte'' (1629–1641), currently known as the [[Santa Cruz Palace, Madrid|Santa Cruz Palace]].{{Sfn|Blasco Esquivias|2016|p=280}} The century also saw the construction of the former City Hall, the [[Casa de la Villa]].{{sfn|Escobar|2007|p=60–63}}

The [[Colegio Imperial de Madrid|Imperial College]] church model dome was imitated in all of Spain. [[Pedro de Ribera]] introduced [[Churrigueresque]] architecture to Madrid; the [[Cuartel del Conde-Duque]], the [[Our Lady of Montserrat Church, Madrid|church of Montserrat]], and the [[Bridge of Toledo (Madrid)|Bridge of Toledo]] are among the best examples.
[[File:Palacio Real Jardines.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace of Madrid]] built in the 18th century.]]
The reign of [[Bourbon Spain|the Bourbons]] during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanisation of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, as well as other buildings such as [[St. Michael's Basilica (Madrid)|St. Michael's Basilica]] and the [[Church of Santa Barbara, Madrid|Church of Santa Bárbara]].
King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the [[Puerta de Alcalá]], the [[Royal Observatory of Madrid|Royal Observatory]], the [[Basilica of San Francisco el Grande]], the Casa de Correos in [[Puerta del Sol]], the [[Real Casa de la Aduana]], and the General Hospital (which now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music). The [[Paseo del Prado]], surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The [[Duke of Berwick]] ordered the construction of the [[Liria Palace]].

During the early 19th century, the [[Peninsular War]], the [[Spanish American wars of independence|loss of viceroyalties]] in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development ([[Teatro Real|Royal Theatre]], the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|National Library of Spain]], the Palace of the Senate, and the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)#Congress of Deputies building|Congress]]). The [[Segovia Viaduct]] linked the Royal Alcázar to the southern part of town.
[[File:Estatua de Atenea - Círculo de Bellas Artes (Madrid).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]]]]
The list of key figures of madrilenian architecture during the 19th and 20th centuries includes authors such as [[Narciso Pascual Colomer|Narciso Pascual y Colomer]], {{ill|Francisco Jareño y Alarcón|es}}, [[Francisco de Cubas]], [[Juan Bautista Lázaro de Diego]], [[Ricardo Velázquez Bosco]], [[Antonio Palacios]], [[Secundino Zuazo]], [[Luis Gutiérrez Soto]], {{ill|Luis Moya Blanco|es}} and [[Alejandro de la Sota]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=García Gutiérrez-Mosteiro|first=Javier|chapter-url=http://oa.upm.es/51042/1/1996_diez_JM.pdf|chapter=Diez arquitectos en Madrid|year=1996|title=Madrid y sus arquitectos: 150 años de la escuela de arquitectura|publisher=Dirección General del Patrimonio Cultural de la Comunidad de Madrid|location=Madrid|pages=75–96|isbn=84-89162-73-5}}</ref>

From the mid-19th century until the Civil War, Madrid modernised and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. The expansion of Madrid developed under the [[Ensanche|Plan Castro]], resulting in the neighbourhoods of [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]], [[Moncloa-Aravaca|Argüelles]], and [[Chamberí]]. [[Arturo Soria]] conceived the [[linear city]] and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]] was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist.
[[Antonio Palacios]] built a series of buildings inspired by the [[Viennese Secession]], such as the [[Palace of Communication]], the [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]], and the [[Río de La Plata Bank]] (now [[Instituto Cervantes]]). Other notable buildings include the [[Bank of Spain]], the neo-Gothic [[Almudena Cathedral]], [[Atocha Station]], and the Catalan art-nouveau [[Palace of Longoria]]. [[Las Ventas]] Bullring was built, as the [[Market of San Miguel]] (Cast-Iron style).
[[File:Edificio España - 05.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Edificio España]].]]
Following the Francoist takeover that ensued the end of Spanish Civil war, architecture experienced an involution, discarding rationalism and, eclecticism notwithstanding, going back to an overall rather "outmoded" architectural language, with the purpose of turning Madrid into a capital worthy of the "Immortal Spain".<ref name=torrus>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publico.es/politica/huella-del-fascismo-patrio-arquitectura.html|website=[[Público (Spain)|Público]]|title=La huella del fascismo patrio en la arquitectura de Madrid|date=13 January 2017|first=Alejandro|last=Torrús}}</ref> Iconic examples of this period include the [[Ministry of the Air]] (a case of [[herrerian]] revival) and the [[Edificio España]] (presented as the tallest building in Europe when it was inaugurated in 1953).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hoy.es/v/20110223/sociedad/simbolo-centro-madrid-20110223.html|website=Hoy|date=23 February 2011|title=Un símbolo en el centro de Madrid|first=Julián|last=Méndez}}</ref><ref name=torrus /> Many of these buildings distinctly combine the use of brick and stone in the façades.<ref name=torrus /> The [[Casa Sindical]] marked a breaking point as it was the first to reassume rationalism, although that relinking to modernity was undertaken through the imitation of the Italian Fascist architecture.<ref name=torrus />

With the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as [[Torre Picasso]], Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the [[Gate of Europe]], appeared in the late 20th century in the city. During the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built and together form the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/08/12/negocio/1186923803_850215.html/|title=La altura sí importa

Madrid is the European city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are {{convert|16|m²|0|abbr=on}} of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the {{convert|10|m²|0|abbr=on}} per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.

A great bulk of the most important parks in Madrid are related to areas originally belonging to the royal assets (including El Pardo, Soto de Viñuelas, Casa de Campo, El Buen Retiro, la Florida and the [[Príncipe Pío (hill)|Príncipe Pío hill]], and the Queen's Casino).{{Sfn|Galiana Martín|1994|pp=46; 50}} The other main source for the "green" areas are the ''{{ill|bienes de propios|es}}'' owned by the municipality (including the Dehesa de la Villa, the Dehesa de Arganzuela or Viveros).{{Sfn|Galiana Martín|1994|p=50}}

[[File:MADRID_051116_MXALX_041.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Retiro Park]]]]
Madrid is the European city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are {{convert|16|m²|0|abbr=on}} of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the {{convert|10|m²|0|abbr=on}} per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.

[[Buen Retiro Park]] (''Parque del Buen Retiro'', or simply ''Parque del Retiro''), formerly the grounds of the palace built for [[Philip IV of Spain]], is the largest park in central Madrid. Its area is more than {{convert|1.4|km²|1|abbr=on}} (350 acres) and it is located very close to the [[Puerta de Alcalá]] and not far from the [[Prado Museum]]. The park is entirely surrounded by the present-day city. Its lake in the middle once staged mini naval sham battles to amuse royalty; these days the more tranquil pastime of pleasure boating is popular. Inspired by London's Crystal Palace, the [[Palacio de Cristal del Retiro|Palacio de Cristal]] can be found at the south-eastern end of the park.

In the Buen Retiro Park is also the [[Forest of the Departed]] (''Bosque de los Ausentes''), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|11 March 2004 Madrid attacks]].

[[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha Railway Station]] (''Estación de Atocha'') is the city's first and most [[central station]], and is also home to a {{convert|4,000|m2|0|abbr=off|adj=mid}} indoor garden, with more than 500 species of plant life and ponds with turtles and goldfish in.

[[File:Casa de Campo Lago y vista.jpg|thumb|[[Casa de Campo]] park]]
[[Casa de Campo]] is an enormous urban parkland to the west of the city, the largest in [[Spain]] and Madrid's main green lung. Its area is more than 1,700 hectares (6.6 sq mi). It is home to a fairground, the [[Zoo Aquarium de Madrid|Madrid Zoo]], an amusement park, the [[Parque de Atracciones de Madrid]], and an outdoor municipal pool, to enjoy a bird's eye view of the park and city take a cable car trip above the tree tops. Casa de Campo's vegetation is one of its most important features. There are, in fact, three different ecosystems: oak, pine and river groves. The oak is the dominant tree species in the area and, although many of them are over 100 years old and reach a great height, they are also present in the form of chaparral and bushes. The pine-forest ecosystem boasts many trees that have adapted perfectly to the light, dry conditions in the park. In addition, mushrooms often emerge after the first rains of autumn. Finally, the river groves, or riparian forests, are made up of various, mainly deciduous, species that grow in wetter areas. Examples include poplars, willows and alder trees. As regards fauna, this green space is home to approximately 133 vertebrate species.

The [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid]] (''Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid'') is an 8-hectare [[botanical garden]] located in the Plaza de Murillo, next to the [[Prado Museum]]. It was an 18th-century creation by [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] and it was used as a base for the plant species being collected across the globe. There is an important research facility that started life as a base to develop [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] and to house the species collected from the new-world trips, today it is dedicated to maintaining Europe's ecosystem.

[[File:Campo del Moro (Madrid) 04.jpg|thumb|left|The Campo del Moro gardens near the Royal Palace]]
The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] (''Palacio Real'') is surrounded by three green areas. In front of the palace, are the gardens of the Plaza de Oriente; to the north, the gardens of Sabatini and to the west up to the Manzanares River, the famous Campo del Moro. [[Royal Palace of Madrid#Campo del Moro Gardens|Campo del Moro gardens]] has a surface area of 20 hectares and is a scenic garden with an unusual layout filled with foliage and an air of English romanticism. The [[Sabatini Gardens]] have a formal Neoclassic style, consisting of well-trimmed hedges, in symmetric geometrical patterns, adorned with a pool, statues and fountains, with trees also planted in a symmetrical geometric shape. [[Royal Palace of Madrid#Plaza de Oriente|Plaza de Oriente]] can distinguish three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged around the central monument to Philip IV, in a grid, following the barroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each packed with box hedges, forms of cypress, yew and magnolia of small size, and flower plantations, temporary. These are bounded on either side by rows of statues paths, popularly known as the Gothic kings, and mark the dividing line between the main body of the plaza and the Cabo Noval Gardens at north, and the Lepanto Gardens at south.

[[File:Cuenca del río Manzanares Monte del Pardo 03.jpg|thumb|right|The Manzanares flowing through the ''Monte de El Pardo''.]]
Mount of [[El Pardo]] (''Monte de El Pardo'') is a mediterranean forest inside the city of Madrid. It is one of the best preserved [[Mediterranean Forests]] in Europe. The European Union has designated the Monte de El Pardo as a [[Special Protection Area]] for bird-life. This meadow, which has been used as hunting grounds by the royalty given the variety of game animals that have inhabited it since the Middle Ages, is home to 120 flora species and 200 vertebrae species. Rabbits, red partridges, wild cats, stags, deer and wild boars live among ilexes, cork oaks, ash trees, black poplars, oaks, junipers and rockroses. Monte del Pardo is part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares, spreading out from the [[Guadarrama Mountains]] range to the centre of Madrid, and protected by strong legal regulations. Just before crossing the city, the [[River Manzanares]] forms a valley composed by sandy elements and detritus from the mountain range.

{{main|Economy of Madrid}}
[[File:Bolsa-madrid-010711-3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Bolsa de Madrid|Madrid Stock Exchange]]]]
After it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city's own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as [[bank]]ing and [[publishing]].

A large [[industrial sector]] did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]]. A major European financial center, its stock market is the third largest stock market in Europe featuring both the [[IBEX 35]] index and the attached {{ill|Latibex|es}} stock market (with the second most important index for [[Latin America]]n companies).<ref name=routledgespanish>{{Cite book|chapter=Local and global elements of Spanish in Madrid|first=Francisco|last=Moreno-Fernández|editor-first=Andrew|editor-last=Lynch|title=The Routledge Handbook of Spanish in the Global City|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceChDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT55|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2020|location=Oxon & New York|isbn=978-1-138-86066-7}}</ref> It concentrates about the 75 % of banking operations in the country.<ref name=routledgespanish />

===Economic history===
As the capital city of the [[Spanish Empire]] from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.

The [[Bank of Spain]] is one of the oldest European central banks. Originally named as the Bank of San Carlos as it was founded in 1782, it was later renamed to Bank of San Fernando in 1829 and ultimately became the Bank of Spain in 1856.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/EstudiosHistoriaEconomica/Files/roja73e.pdf|page=1|first=Pablo|last=Martín-Aceña|title=The Banco de España, 1782-2017.

===Literature===
[[File:Noort-quevedo en el parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chalcography for an edition of [[Francisco de Quevedo]]'s ''El Parnaso Español'' (1648)]]
Madrid has been one of the great centres of Spanish literature. Some of the best writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Spanish Golden Century]] were born in Madrid, including: [[Lope de Vega]] ''([[Fuenteovejuna]]'', ''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Dog in the Manger]]'', ''The Knight of Olmedo''), who reformed the Spanish theatre, a work continued by [[Calderon de la Barca]] (''[[Life is a Dream]]''), [[Francisco de Quevedo]], Spanish nobleman and writer known for his satires, which criticised the Spanish society of his time, and author of ''[[El Buscón]]''. And finally, [[Tirso de Molina]], who created the character [[Don Juan]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] and [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]] also lived in the city, although they were not born there. The homes of Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Gongora and Cervantes are still preserved, and they are all in the Barrio de las Letras (District of Letters).

Other writers born in Madrid in later centuries have been [[Leandro Fernandez de Moratín]], [[Mariano José de Larra]], [[Jose de Echegaray]] (Nobel Prize in Literature), [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]], [[Dámaso Alonso]], [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]] and [[Pedro Salinas]].
[[File:Perez galdos.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Portrait of Benito Pérez Galdós]]'', by [[Joaquín Sorolla]], 1894]]
The "Barrio de las Letras" (Quarter of Letters) owes its name to the intense literary activity developed over the 16th and 17th centuries. Some of the most prominent writers of the Spanish Golden Age settled here, as [[Lope de Vega]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]] or [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]], and the theatres of Cruz and Príncipe, two of the major comedy theatres of that time. At 87 Calle de Atocha, one of the roads that limit the neighbourhood, was the printing house of Juan Cuesta, where the first edition of the first part of [[Don Quixote]] (1604) was published, one of the greatest works of Spanish literature. Most of the literary routes are articulated along the Barrio de las Letras, where you can find scenes from novels of the [[Siglo de Oro]] and more recent works like "[[Bohemian Lights]]". Although born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, [[Spanish Realist literature|realist]] writer [[Benito Pérez Galdós]] is credited with making Madrid the setting for many of his stories, underpinning what has come to be known as the ''Madrid Galdosiano''.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-84-451-3131-2|pages=11–12|title=Guía del Madrid galdosiano|edition=2nd|year=2005|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM001795.pdf|last=García-Posada|first=Miguel}}</ref>

Madrid is home to the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Academy of Spanish Language]] (RAE), an internationally important cultural institution dedicated to language planning by enacting legislation aimed at promoting linguistic unity within the Hispanic states; this ensures a common linguistic standard, in accordance with its founding statutes "to ensure that the changes undergone [by the language] [...] not break the essential unity that keeps all the Hispanic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/rd1109-1993.html |title=Real Decreto 1109/1993, de 9 de julio, por el que se aprueba los Estatutos de la Real Academia Española |publisher=Noticias.juridicas.com |date= 21 January 2011 |accessdate= 14 April 2011}}</ref>

Madrid is also home to another international cultural institution, the [[Instituto Cervantes]], whose task is the promotion and teaching of the [[Spanish language]] as well as the dissemination of the culture of [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]].

The [[Complutense University of Madrid]] (''Universidad Complutense de Madrid''; UCM) is the second largest university in Spain after UNED and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has over 11,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Most of the academic staff is Spanish. It is located on two campuses, the main one of [[Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria]] in the [[Moncloa-Aravaca]] district, and the secondary campus of Somosaguas, located outside the city limits in [[Pozuelo de Alarcón]] and founded in 1971.<ref>{{Cite journal|page=190|title=Universidad y territorio en el área metropolitana de Madrid|first1=Guillermo|last1=Morales Matos|first2=Daniel|last2=Marías Martínez|journal=Ería|publisher=[[University of Oviedo]]|volume=80|year=2009|issn=0211-0563|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3211759.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Universidad Complutense">{{cite news

}}</ref> The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in [[Alcalá de Henares]], old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back to 1293, when King [[Sancho IV of Castile]] built the General Schools of Alcalá, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. During the course of 1509–1510 five schools were already operative: ''Artes y Filosofía'' (Arts and Philosophy), ''Teología'' (Theology), ''Derecho Canónico'' (Canonical Laws), ''Letras'' (Liberal Arts) and ''Medicina'' (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]], the University was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new [[University City of Madrid|University City]] (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] to this purpose. The [[Spanish Civil War]] turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage.
In 1970 the Government reformed the High Education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. It was then when the new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcalá campus was reopened as the independent UAH, [[University of Alcalá]], in 1977. Complutense also serves to the population of students who select Madrid as their residency during their [[study abroad]] period. Students from the United States for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion into the Spanish Language. After studying at the University, students return home with a fluent sense of Spanish as well as culture and diversity.<ref name="Universidad Complutense de Madrid">{{cite news|url=http://portal.ucm.es/en/web/en-ucm/seven-centuries-of-history|publisher=UCM|title=Complutense University of Madrid|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316165924/http://portal.ucm.es/en/web/en-ucm/seven-centuries-of-history|archive-date=16 March 2011}}</ref>

{{Main|Transport in Madrid}}
[[File:M-30 (Madrid, Spain) 04.jpg|thumb|The M-607 meets the M-30 north of the municipality.]]
Madrid is served by several roads and three modes of public surface transport, and two airports, one of them being almost two different airports. A great many important road, rail and air links converge on the capital, providing effective connections with other parts of the metropolitan region and with the rest of Spain and other parts of Europe.

;Radial roads
[[File:Red alta capacidad españa.svg|thumb|right|The network of high capacity roads in Spain features its most important node in Madrid.]]
Madrid is the centre of the most important roads of Spain. Already in 1720, the ''Reglamento General de Postas'' enacted by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] configurated the basis of a radial system of roads in the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM000078.pdf|page=64|title=Madrid y los Borbones en el siglo XVIII.

Madrid features a number of the most prominent ''[[autovía]]s'' (fast dualled highways), part of the {{ill|State Road Network|es|Red de Carreteras del Estado}}. Clock-wise starting from the north: the [[Autovía A-1|A-1]] (Madrid–[[Irún]]–[[France|French border]]), [[Autovía A-2|A-2]] (Madrid–[[Zaragoza]]–[[Barcelona]]–French border), [[Autovía A-3|A-3]] (Madrid–[[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]), [[Autovía A-4|A-4]] (Madrid–[[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]–[[Sevilla]]–[[Cádiz]]), [[Autovía A-5|A-5]] (Madrid–[[Badajoz]]–[[Portugal|Portuguese border]]) and the [[Autovía A-6|A-6]] (Madrid–[[A Coruña]]). The [[Autovía A-42|A-42]], another highway connecting Madrid to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], is also part of the State Network.

The [[M-607]] connects Madrid to the [[Puerto de Navacerrada]]. It is a fast dualled highway in its initial stretch from Madrid to [[Colmenar Viejo]], and part of the {{ill|Regional Road Network|es|Anexo:Red de Carreteras de la Comunidad de Madrid}} (in relation to the concerning administration, not to the technical features of the road).

Due to the large amount of traffic, new toll highways were built parallel to the main national freeways. Their names are {{ill|R-2 motorway (Spain)|lt=R-2|es|Autopista Radial 2}}, [[R-3 motorway (Spain)|R-3]], [[R-4 motorway (Spain)|R-4]] and {{ill|R-5 motorway (Spain)|lt=R-5|es|Autopista Radial 5}} and they were intended to provide a paid alternative to the often overcrowded free radials. However, except the R-3, they do not end close to the M-30 innermost ring road, as the R-2 finishes in the M-40, the R-4 in the M-50 and the R-5 in the M-40.

;Orbital roads
[[File:M 30 tunel.jpg|thumb|M-30 tunnel parallel to the Manzanares]]
Also Madrid road network includes four [[ring road|orbital]] ones at different distances from the centre.
The innermost ring-road, the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-30|M-30]], is the only one with its path strictly located within the Madrid municipal limits. It is owned by the [[Madrid City Council]] and operated by Madrid Calle 30, S.A. It is the busiest Spanish road, famous for its traffic jams. A significant portion of the southern part runs underground parallel to the [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]], with tunnel sections of more than {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction.

The second ring-road, the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-40|M-40]] (part of the State Road Network) circles the city, while also extending to other surrounding municipalities. A NW stretch of the road runs underground, below the southern reaches of the [[Monte de El Pardo]] protected area.

The [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-45|M-45]] partially circles the city, connecting the M-40 and M-50, passing through areas like Villaverde and Vallecas in the South-East of the municipality.

The [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-50|M-50]], the Madrid's outer ring road, connects municipalities and cities in the metropolitan area, like [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Móstoles]], [[Getafe]], [[Leganés]] in the South and [[Boadilla del Monte]] and [[Las Rozas de Madrid|Las Rozas]] in the West.

;Cercanías
{{Main|Cercanías Madrid}}
Cercanías Madrid is the [[commuter rail]] service used for longer distances from the suburbs and beyond into Madrid, consisting of nine lines totalling {{convert|578|km|abbr=off}} and more than 90 stations. With fewer stops inside the centre of the city they are faster than the Metro, but run less frequently. This system is connected with Metro (presently 22 stations) and Light Metro. The lines are named: [[C-1 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-1]], [[C-2 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-2]], [[C-3 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-3]], [[C-4 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-4]], [[C-5 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-5]], [[C-7 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-7]], [[C-8 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-8]], [[C-9 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-9]], [[C-10 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-10]], respectively.

;Buses
There is a dense network of [[bus]] routes, run by the municipal company [[Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid|Empresa Municipal de Transportes]] (or EMT Madrid), which operates 24 hours a day; special services called "N lines" are run during nighttime. The special Airport Express Shuttle line connecting the airport with the city centre features distinctively yellow buses. In addition to the urban lines operated by the EMT, the green buses (''interurbanos'') connect the city with the suburbs. The later lines, while also regulated by the CRTM, are often run by private operators.

Almost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.<ref name=Estructura/>{{rp|62–4}}
Madrid has 15723 taxis around all the city.

;Taxi
The taxicabs are regulated by a specific sub-division of taxi service, a body dependent of the [[Madrid City Council]].

In terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of ''[[autovía]]s'', giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of one of the world's three largest [[high-speed rail]] systems, ''Alta Velocidad Española'' ([[AVE]]), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. There are now {{convert|2,900|km|abbr=off}} of AVE track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.<ref name=Estructura/>{{rp|72–75}}

Also Spain business are designing new high speed trains which will be the new generation [[AVE]] like [[Talgo AVRIL]].
