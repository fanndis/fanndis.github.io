'''''Wired''''' (stylized as '''''WIRED''''') is a monthly American [[magazine]], published in print and [[online magazine|online]] editions, that focuses on how [[emerging technologies]] affect [[culture]], the [[economy]], and [[politics]]. Owned by [[Condé Nast]], it is headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]], and has been in publication since March/April 1993.<ref name=mfloss>{{cite news |first= Alex |last= French |title= The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines |accessdate= August 10, 2015 |work=[[Mental Floss]] |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Several spin-offs have been launched, including ''[[Wired UK]]'', ''Wired Italia'', ''Wired Japan'', and ''Wired Germany''. Condé Nast's parent company [[Advance Publications]] is also the major shareholder of [[Reddit]], an internet information conglomeration website.<ref>{{cite news |last= Greenberg |first= Juliane |title= For the Record: The Relationship Between WIRED and Reddit |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/wired-conde-nast-reddit |accessdate= 29 January 2019 |work= Wired |date= 28 July 2015 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

In its earliest [[colophon (publishing)|colophons]], ''Wired'' credited Canadian media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] as its "[[patron saint]]". From its beginning, the strongest influence on the magazine's editorial outlook came from [[techno-utopian]] cofounder [[Ian Charles Stewart]] and his associate [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Stahlman |first= Mark |title= The English ideology and Wired Magazine |work= Imaginary Futures |accessdate= June 15, 2011 |year= 1996 |url= http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/21/the-english-ideology-and-wired-magazine/ |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

From 1998 to 2006, ''Wired'' magazine and ''Wired News'', which publishes at Wired.com, had separate owners. However, ''Wired News'' remained responsible for republishing ''Wired'' magazine's content online due to an agreement when Condé Nast purchased the magazine. In 2006, Condé Nast bought ''Wired News'' for $25&nbsp;million, reuniting the magazine with its website.

''Wired'' contributor [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] is known for popularizing the term "the [[long tail]]",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2195151/ |title= Long Tails and Big Heads |first= Farhad |last= Manjoo |date= July 14, 2008 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |df= mdy-all }}</ref> as a phrase relating to a "power law"-type graph that helps to visualize the 2000s emergent new media business model. Anderson's article for ''Wired'' on this paradigm related to research on power law distribution models carried out by [[Clay Shirky]], specifically in relation to bloggers. Anderson widened the definition of the term in capitals to describe a specific point of view relating to what he sees as an overlooked aspect of the traditional market space that has been opened up by new media.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/05/the_origins_of_.html |title= The Long Tail |first= Chris |last=Anderson |author-link= Chris Anderson (writer) |date= May 8, 2005 |work= Wired |accessdate= July 11, 2017 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The magazine coined the term ''[[crowdsourcing]]'',<ref name=HiredGuns>{{cite news |url= https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2007/03/01/8402019/index.htm |title= Hired Guns on the Cheap |work=[[Fortune Small Business]] |first= David |last= Whitford |publisher=[[CNN]] |date= March 22, 2007 |accessdate= August 7, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> as well as its annual tradition of handing out [[Vaporware]] Awards, which recognize "products, videogames, and other nerdy tidbits pitched, promised and hyped, but never delivered".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/01/vaporware-2010-the-great-white-duke |title= Vaporware 2010: The Great White Duke |date=March 11, 2011 |work=Wired |first=Michael |last=Calore |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Wikia and Wired Building location-9387.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|''Wired'' building located in San Francisco]]

The magazine was founded by American journalist [[Louis Rossetto]] and his partner [[Jane Metcalfe]], along with [[Ian Charles Stewart]], in 1993 with initial backing from software entrepreneur [[Charlie Jackson (software)|Charlie Jackson]] and [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] academic [[Nicholas Negroponte]] of the [[MIT Media Lab]], who was a regular columnist for six years (through 1998), wrote the book ''[[Being Digital]]'', and later founded [[One Laptop per Child]]. The founding designers were John Plunkett and Barbara Kuhr (Plunkett+Kuhr), beginning with a 1991 prototype and continuing through the first five years of publication, 1993–98.

''Wired'', which touted itself as "the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' of technology",<ref>{{cite news |page= 29 |last= Cobb |first= Nathan |title= Terminal Chic: Technology is moving out of computers and into the culture |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date= November 24, 1992 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> made its debut at the [[Macworld]] conference on January 2, 1993.<ref>{{cite news |last= Carr |first= David |author-link= David Carr (journalist) |title= The Coolest Magazine on the Planet |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= July 27, 2003 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/books/the-coolest-magazine-on-the-planet.html?pagewanted=all |df= mdy-all }}</ref> A great success at its launch, it was lauded for its vision, originality, innovation, and cultural impact.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In its first four years, the magazine won two [[National Magazine Awards]] for General Excellence and one for Design.

[[File:Cover of Wired issue 1.04 September October 1993.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.85|Cover of ''Wired'' issue 1.4 September/October 1993]]The founding executive editor of ''Wired'', Kevin Kelly, was an editor of the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' and brought with him contributing writers from those publications. Six authors of the first ''Wired'' issue (1.1) had written for ''Whole Earth Review'', most notably [[Bruce Sterling]] (who was highlighted on the first cover)<ref name=mfloss/> and Stewart Brand. Other contributors to ''Whole Earth'' appeared in ''Wired'', including [[William Gibson]], who was featured on ''Wired''{{'}}s cover in its first year and whose article "[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]]" in issue 1.4 resulted in the publication being banned in Singapore.<ref name="b&">{{cite news |title= Multimedia Animal Wired Visionary Nicholas Negroponte is MIT's Loud Voice of the Future |date= March 1, 1995 |first= David |last= Mehegan |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/21442249.html?FMT=ABS&date=Mar%201,%201995 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

''Wired'' cofounder Louis Rossetto claimed in the magazine's first issue that "the Digital Revolution is whipping through our lives like a Bengali typhoon,"<ref>{{Cite news |last= Leonard |first= Andrew |author-link= Andrew Leonard |title= Wired: The book |work=[[Salon.com]] |accessdate= June 24, 2011 |date= August 18, 1998 |url= http://www.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/20featureb.html |df= mdy-all }}</ref> yet despite the fact that Kelly was involved in launching [[the WELL]], an early source of public access to the Internet and even earlier non-Internet online experience, ''Wired''{{'}}s first issue de-emphasized the Internet and covered interactive games, cell-phone hacking, digital special effects, military simulations, and Japanese [[otaku]]. However, the first issue did contain a few references to the Internet, including online dating and Internet sex, and a tutorial on how to install a [[bozo filter]]. The last page, a column written by Nicholas Negroponte, was written in the style of an email message but contained obviously fake, non-standard email addresses. By the third issue in the fall of 1993, the "Net Surf" column began listing interesting [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] sites, [[Usenet newsgroup]]s, and email addresses, at a time when the numbers of these things were small and this information was still extremely novel to the public. ''Wired'' was among the first magazines to list the email address of its authors and contributors.

Lyman, along with Simon Ferguson (''Wired''{{'}}s first advertising manager), introduced revolutionary ad campaigns by a diverse group of industry leaders—such as Apple Computer, [[Intel]], [[Sony]], [[Calvin Klein]], and [[Absolut Vodka|Absolut]]—to the readers of the first technology publication with a lifestyle slant.

The magazine was quickly followed by a companion website ([[HotWired]]), a book publishing division (HardWired), a Japanese edition, and a short-lived British edition (''Wired UK''). ''Wired UK'' was relaunched in April 2009.<ref name="wireduk-relaunch">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/30/condenast.pressandpublishing |title= Condé Nast to launch Wired in the UK |work=[[The Guardian]] |first= Stephen |last= Brook |date= June 30, 2008 |location= London |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 1994, [[John Battelle]], cofounding editor, commissioned [[Jules Marshall]] to write a piece on the [[Zippies]]. The cover story broke records for being one of the most publicized stories of the year and was used to promote ''Wired''{{'}}s HotWired news service.<ref>''Wired''. July 1994. p. 133.</ref>

HotWired spawned websites [[Webmonkey]], the [[search engine]] [[HotBot]], and a [[weblog]], [[Suck.com]]. In June 1998, the magazine launched a stock index, the Wired Index, called the Wired 40 since July 2003.

The fortune of the magazine and allied enterprises corresponded closely to that of the [[dot-com bubble]]. In 1996, Rossetto and the other participants in Wired Ventures attempted to take the company public with an [[initial public offering|IPO]]. The initial attempt had to be withdrawn in the face of a downturn in the stock market, and especially the Internet sector, during the summer of 1996. The second try was also unsuccessful.

Rossetto and Metcalfe lost control of Wired Ventures to financial investors [[Providence Equity Partners]] in May 1998, which quickly sold off the company in pieces. ''Wired'' was purchased by Advance Publications, which assigned it to Advance's subsidiary, New York–based publisher [[Condé Nast Publications]] (while keeping ''Wired''{{'}}s editorial offices in San Francisco).<ref>{{Cite news |last= Leibovich |first= Lori |title= Wired nests with Condé Nast: Will the magazine's new owners dull its edge? |work=[[Salon.com]] |accessdate= June 24, 2011 |date= May 8, 1998 |url= http://www.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/05/08featureb.html |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Wired Digital (wired.com, hotbot.com, webmonkey.com, etc.) was purchased by [[Lycos]] and run independently from the rest of the magazine until 2006, when it was sold by Lycos to Advance Publications, returning the websites to the same company that published the magazine.

===Anderson era===
[[File:Wired Wilco.jpg|thumb|[[Wilco]] at the ''Wired'' Rave Awards in 2003]]
''Wired'' survived the dot-com bubble and found new direction under [[editor-in-chief]] [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] in 2001, making the magazine's coverage "more mainstream".<ref>{{Cite news |last= Clifford |first= Stephanie |title= Wired Struggles to Find Niche in Magazine World |work=[[The New York Times]] |location= New York |accessdate= June 23, 2011 |date= May 18, 2009 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/business/media/18wired.html?pagewanted=all |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

Under Anderson, ''Wired'' has produced some widely noted articles, including the April 2003 "Welcome to the Hydrogen Economy" story, the November 2003 "Open Source Everywhere" issue (which put [[Linus Torvalds]] on the cover and articulated the idea that the [[open-source model|open-source]] method was taking off outside of software, including encyclopedias as evidenced by Wikipedia), the February 2004 "Kiss Your Cubicle Goodbye" issue (which presented the outsourcing issue from both American and Indian perspectives), and an October 2004 article by Chris Anderson, which coined the popular term "the Long Tail".

The November 2004 issue of ''Wired'' was published with ''[[The Wired CD]]''. All of the songs on the CD were released under various [[Creative Commons]] licenses in an attempt to push [[alternative copyright]] into the spotlight. Most of the songs were contributed by major artists, including the [[Beastie Boys]], [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Paul Westerberg]], and [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]].

In 2005, ''Wired'' received the [[National Magazine Award]] for General Excellence in the category of 500,000 to 1,000,000 subscribers.<ref name="edge-bio-chris">{{cite web |url= http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/andersonw.html |title= Edge: Chris Anderson |accessdate= July 19, 2007 |publisher=[[Edge Foundation]] |df= mdy-all }}</ref> That same year, Anderson won [[Advertising Age]]'s editor of the year award.<ref name="edge-bio-chris" /> In May 2007, the magazine again won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2007-national-magazine-award-winners-announced-57797287.html |title= 2007 National Magazine Award Winners Announced |publisher=[[American Society of Magazine Editors]] |date= May 1, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 2008, ''Wired'' was nominated for three National Magazine Awards and won the ASME for Design.
