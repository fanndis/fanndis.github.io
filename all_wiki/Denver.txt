In the summer of 1858, during the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]], a group of gold prospectors from [[Lawrence, Kansas]] established [[Montana City, Colorado|Montana City]] as a [[mining town]] on the banks of the [[South Platte River]] in what was then western [[Kansas Territory]]. This was the first historical settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of [[Auraria, Denver|Auraria]] (named after the gold-mining town of [[Auraria, Georgia]]) and St. Charles City.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 1, 2006 |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain metropolis time line |publisher=The City and County of Denver |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |access-date=August 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813180204/http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |archive-date=August 13, 2006 }}

On November 22, 1858,{{contradict-inline|reason=Infobox says city was founded on November 17|date=December 2019}} [[William Larimer, Jr.|General William Larimer]] and Captain Jonathan Cox, Esquire, both land speculators from eastern [[Kansas Territory]], placed [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]] logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria, and on the site of the existing townsite of St. Charles. Larimer named the townsite Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor [[James W.

</ref> Larimer hoped the town's name would help it be selected as the [[county seat]] of Arapaho County but, unbeknownst to him, Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]]. The site of these first towns is now occupied by [[Confluence Park]] near downtown Denver.

Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria.<ref name="DenverHistArapaho"/> In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for "passengers, mail, freight, and gold", the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, [[Western Union]] furthered Denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus.

The [[Colorado Territory]] was created on February 28, 1861,<ref name= StateGovHistCO>{{cite web|date = April 18, 2001|url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/arcgov.html|title = State Government History|publisher = State of Colorado, Department of Personnel & Administration, Colorado State Archives|access-date =November 28, 2006}}</ref> [[Arapahoe County, Colorado Territory|Arapahoe County]] was formed on November 1, 1861,<ref name= StateGovHistCO /> and Denver City was incorporated on November 7, 1861.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|date = December 1, 2004|url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/muninc.html|title = Colorado Municipal Incorporations|publisher = State of Colorado, Department of Personnel & Administration, Colorado State Archives|access-date =November 28, 2006}}</ref> Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat from 1861 until [[consolidated city-county|consolidation]] in 1902.<ref name=DenverHist /> In 1867, Denver City became the acting [[Capital city|territorial capital]], and in 1881 was chosen as the permanent state capital in a [[1881 Colorado state capital referendum|statewide ballot]].

Although by the close of the 1860s, Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. The transcontinental railroad passed a daunting 100 miles away, but citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to it. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]], [[David Moffat]], and [[Walter Cheesman]], fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the [[Denver Pacific]] completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''Denver'', HarborTown Histories. Santa Barbara, California, p. 31-33, {{ISBN|9780971098442}} (print), 9780987903860 (on-line)</ref>

Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, attracting millionaires with their mansions, as well as a mixture of crime and poverty of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when [[Horace Tabor]], the Leadville mining millionaire, built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer, as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]], soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires, such as the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant.<ref>Baker, p. 39-48</ref> Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and attracted laborers to work in these factories.

Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of immigrant German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African Americans from the Deep South and Hispanic workers. The influx of the new residents strained available housing. In addition, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances. Competition among the different ethnic groups was often expressed as bigotry, and social tensions gave rise to the Red Scare. Americans were suspicious of immigrants who were sometimes allied with socialist and labor union causes. After World War I, a revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted white native-born Americans who were anxious about the many changes in society. Unlike the earlier organization that was active in the rural South, KKK chapters developed in urban areas of the Midwest and West, including Denver, and into Idaho and Oregon. Corruption and crime also developed in Denver.<ref>Baker, p. 51-55</ref>

Between 1880 and 1895 the city underwent a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as [[Soapy Smith]], worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections, gambling, and [[Lou Blonger|bunco gangs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapysmith.net|title=Information from The Soapy Smith Preservation Trust website|access-date=October 29, 2006}}</ref> The city also suffered a [[Denver Depression of 1893|depression in 1893]] after the crash of silver prices.

A bill proposing a state constitutional amendment to allow [[home rule]] for Denver and other municipalities was introduced in the legislature in 1901 and passed.

From 1953 to 1989, the [[Rocky Flats Plant]], a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] nuclear weapon facility that was about 15 miles from Denver, produced [[fissile]] [[plutonium]] "[[pit (nuclear weapon)|pits]]" for [[nuclear warhead]]s. A major fire at the facility in 1957, as well as leakage from [[nuclear waste]] stored at the site between 1958 and 1968, resulted in the [[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|contamination of some parts of Denver]], to varying degrees, with [[plutonium-239]], a harmful radioactive substance with a half-life of 24,200 years.<ref name="Moore2007">{{cite book | title=Ethics of Research on Health Impacts of Nuclear Weapons Activities in the United States | publisher=Collaborative Initiative for Research Ethics and Environmental Health (CIREEH) at [[Syracuse University]] | last=Moore | first=LeRoy | year=2007 | pages=55–97 | editor1-last=Quigley | editor1-first=Dianne | editor2-last=Lowman | editor2-first=Amy | editor3-last=Wing | editor3-first=Steve | url=http://www.rockyflatsnuclearguardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/leroy-moore-papers/dem-public-heath-at-rf-12-10.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331142610/http://www.rockyflatsnuclearguardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/leroy-moore-papers/dem-public-heath-at-rf-12-10.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=March 31, 2012 | access-date=September 17, 2011 | chapter=Democracy and Public Health at Rocky Flats: The Examples of Edward Martell and Carl J.

As of January 2013, the City and County of Denver has defined 78 official [[neighborhood]]s that the city and community groups use for planning and administration.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://data.denvergov.org/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-statistical-neighborhoods |title = Denver Open Data Catalog: Statistical Neighborhoods |author= City and County of Denver, Community Planning and Development |publisher= DenverGov.org}}</ref> Although the city's delineation of the neighborhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary, it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents. These "neighborhoods" should not be confused with cities or suburbs, which may be separate entities within the metro area.

The character of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one to another and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are [[new urbanism|new urbanist]] developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods.

Denver does not have larger area designations, [[Community areas in Chicago|unlike the City of Chicago]], which has larger areas that house the neighborhoods (e.g., Northwest Side). Denver residents use the terms "north", "south", "east", and "west".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metroseeker.com/denver/where-to-live|title=Find A City To Love – Where to Live in Denver|publisher=MetroSeeker.com|accessdate=September 15, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829035537/http://www.metroseeker.com/denver/where-to-live|archive-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>

Well-known non-administrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy [[LoDo]] (short for "Lower Downtown"), part of the city's [[Union Station, Denver|Union Station neighborhood]]; Uptown, straddling [[North Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado|North Capitol Hill]] and [[City Park West, Denver|City Park West]]; Curtis Park, part of the [[Five Points (Denver)|Five Points]] neighborhood; [[Alamo Placita, Denver|Alamo Placita]], the northern part of the [[Speer, Denver|Speer neighborhood]]; [[Park Hill, Denver|Park Hill]], a successful example of intentional racial integration;<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research |url=http://www.luc.edu/curl/projects/past/documents/cityscpe/vol4num2/ch5.html |title=Park Hill, Denver |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=1998 |last=Woods |first=Katherine |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |pages=89–103 |accessdate=January 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904083433/http://www.luc.edu/curl/projects/past/documents/cityscpe/vol4num2/ch5.html |archive-date=September 4, 2006 }}</ref> and [[Golden Triangle, Denver|Golden Triangle]], in the Civic Center.

December, the coldest month of the year, has an average daily high temperature of {{convert|46|°F|1}}. Winters consist of periods of snow and very low temperatures alternating with periods of milder weather due to the warming effect of [[Chinook wind]]s. In winter, daytime highs can exceed {{convert|60|°F|0}}, but they also often fail to reach {{convert|32|°F|0}} during periods of cold weather.

[[Tornado]]es are rare west of the I-25 corridor; however, one notable exception was an [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado that struck 4.4 miles south of downtown on June 15, 1988. On the other hand, the suburbs east of Denver and the city's east-northeastern extension ([[Denver International Airport]]) can see a few tornadoes, often weak [[landspout]] tornadoes, each spring and summer especially during June with the enhancement of the [[Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone]] (DCVZ). The DCVZ, also known as the Denver Cyclone, is a variable vortex of storm-forming air flow usually found north and east of downtown, and which often includes the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Colorado/Adams/map|title=Adams County, Colorado|publisher=Tornado History Project|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Tornado: Its Structure, Dynamics, Prediction, and Hazards|last=Church|first=Christopher R.|publisher=American Geophysical Union|year=1993|page=353|isbn=9780875900384}}</ref> Heavy weather from the DCVZ can disrupt airport operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/zdv/zdvtstms.pdf|title=Denver Air Route Traffic Control Thunderstorm Patterns|last1=Meyer|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Bobb|first2=William R.|last3=Dulong|first3=Thomas W.|publisher=Denver Center Weather Service Unit, Longmont, Colorado.

Denver’s official weather station is at Denver International Airport, roughly 20 miles from downtown. A 2019 analysis showed the average temperature at Denver International Airport, {{convert|50.2|°F|0}}, was significantly cooler than downtown, {{convert|53.0|°F|0}}. Many of the suburbs also have warmer temperatures and there is controversy regarding the location of the official temperature readings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bianchi |first1=Chris |title=Denver weather: How official measurements compare at DIA, downtown and Stapleton |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/12/denver-weather-measurement-site-comparison/ |website=The Denver Post |accessdate=3 August 2020}}</ref>

The Denver [[Metropolitan statistical area|MSA]] has a gross metropolitan product of $157.6 billion in 2010, making it the 18th largest metro economy in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gross Metropolitan Product|url=http://greyhill.com/gross-metropolitan-product|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within {{convert|500|mi|km|-2}}, it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the [[Mountain States]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest states]], as well as all [[Western United States|western states]]. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as Chicago and [[St. Louis]] and some large cities of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Over the years, the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. [[AIMCO]] (NYSE: AIV)—the largest owner and operator of apartment communities in the United States, with approximately 870 communities comprising nearly 136,000 units in 44 states—is headquartered in Denver, employing approximately 3,500 people. Also [[Samsonite]] Corp., the world's largest luggage manufacturer, began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to [[Massachusetts]] after a change of ownership in 2006. The [[Qwest Corporation|Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company]], founded in Denver in 1911, is now a part of telecommunications giant [[Lumen Technologies]] (previously [[CenturyLink]]).

On October 31, 1937, [[Continental Airlines]], now [[United Airlines]], moved its headquarters to [[Stapleton Airport]] in Denver, Colorado. [[Robert F. Six]] arranged to have the headquarters moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas because Six believed that the airline should have its headquarters in a large city with a potential base of customers.
[[MediaNews Group]] purchased the ''[[Denver Post]]'' in 1987; the company is based in Denver. The [[Gates Corporation]], the world's largest producer of automotive belts and hoses, was established in S. Denver in 1919. [[Russell Stover Candies]] made its first chocolate candy in Denver in 1923, but moved to Kansas City in 1969. The Wright & McGill Company has been making its Eagle Claw brand of fishing gear in NE Denver since 1925. The original [[Frontier Airlines (1950–1986)|Frontier Airlines]] began operations at Denver's old [[Stapleton International Airport]] in 1950; [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]] was reincarnated at [[Denver International Airport|DIA]] in 1994. Scott's Liquid Gold, Inc., has been making furniture polish in Denver since 1954. [[Village Inn]] restaurants began as a single pancake house in Denver in 1958. [[Big O Tires]], LLC, of [[Centennial, Colorado|Centennial]] opened its first franchise in 1962 in Denver. [[The Shane Company]] sold its first diamond jewelry in 1971 in Denver. In 1973 [[Re/Max]] made Denver its headquarters. [[Johns-Manville|Johns Manville]] Corp., a manufacturer of insulation and roofing products, relocated its headquarters to Denver from New York in 1972. [[CH2M Hill]], an engineering and construction firm, relocated from Oregon to the [[Denver Technological Center]] in 1980. The [[Ball Corporation]] sold its glass business in Indiana in the 1990s and moved to suburban [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]; Ball has several operations in greater Denver.

[[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] established its U.S. headquarters in Denver in 2005, but announced its departure in 2019. Its subsidiary and regional [[wholesale]] distributor, Coors Distributing Company, is in NW Denver. The [[Newmont Mining Corporation]], the second-largest gold producer in North America and one of the largest in the world, is headquartered in Denver. [[MapQuest]], an online site for maps, directions and business listings, is headquartered in Denver's LoDo district.

Large Denver-area employers that have headquarters elsewhere include [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp., [[United Airlines]], [[Kroger]] Co. and [[Xcel Energy]], Inc.

Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of [[Colorado]]. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]], the [[Denver Federal Center]], [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse]], the [[Denver Mint]], and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]].

In 2005, a $310.7 million expansion for the [[Colorado Convention Center]] was completed, doubling its size. The hope was the center's expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/conventioncenter/ci_0002809415 |title=Finally, it's built.

Denver's position near the mineral-rich [[Rocky Mountains]] encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and governor [[John Hickenlooper]], a former geologist), and the nation's highest office vacancy rate (30%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain Metropolis History |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline_short.asp |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608124619/http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_timeline_short.asp |archive-date=June 8, 2006 |publisher=The City and County of Denver |access-date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegedegreereport.com/city-data/petroleum-engineers/denver-aurora |title=Welcome collegedegreereport.com – BlueHost.com |publisher=Collegedegreereport.com |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}</ref> Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as [[Ovintiv]], [[Halliburton]], [[Smith International]], [[Rio Tinto Group]], [[Newmont Mining]], and [[Chevron Corporation]], headquartered or having significant operations. Denver is in 149th place in terms of the cost of doing business in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/places/co/denver/|title=The Best Places For Business And Careers}}</ref>

[[File:University of Denver campus pics 107.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]], near the campus of the [[University of Denver]]]]
Denver's west-central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC−7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia in the same business day. Denver's location on the 105th meridian at over one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a "one-bounce" real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. [[Qwest Communications]] now part of [[CenturyLink]], [[Dish Network Corporation]], [[Starz (TV network)|Starz]], [[DIRECTV]], and [[Comcast]] are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s. After a rise in unemployment in the [[Great Recession]], Denver's unemployment rate recovered and had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 2.6% in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrodenver.org/metro-denver-economy/monthly-summary |title=Monthly Economic Summary |author=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation |publisher=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation|date=January 2017 |accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref> As of December 2016, the unemployment rate for the Denver-Aurora-Broomfield MSA is 2.6%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.co_denver_msa.htm |title=Denver-Aurora-Broomfield, CO Economy at a Glance |author=The Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=The Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref> The Downtown region has seen increased real estate investment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primedb.co/top-reasons-behind-denvers-booming-real-estate-market/ |title=The Top Reasons behind Denver's Booming Real Estate Market – Home Renovations|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> with the construction of several new skyscrapers from 2010 onward and major development around [[Denver Union Station]].

Denver has also enjoyed success as a pioneer in the fast-casual restaurant industry, with many popular national chain restaurants founded and based in Denver. [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]], [[Quiznos]], and [[Smashburger]] were founded and headquartered in Denver. [[Qdoba Mexican Grill]], [[Noodles & Company]], and [[Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard]] originated in Denver, but have moved their headquarters to the suburbs of [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], and [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], respectively.

Denver has several additional professional teams. In 2006, Denver established a Major League Lacrosse team, the [[Denver Outlaws]]. They play in [[Empower Field at Mile High]]. In 2006, the Denver Outlaws won the Western Conference Championship, and then won their first championship in 2014 eight years later. They also won in 2016 and 2018. The [[Colorado Mammoth]] of the National Lacrosse League play at Ball Arena. They won their first and only championship in 2006.

In 2018, the Denver Bandits were established as the first professional football team for women in Colorado, and will be a part of the initial season for the Women's National Football Conference [[WNFC]] in 2019.

Denver submitted the winning bid to host the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] but subsequently withdrew, giving it the dubious distinction of being the only city to back out after having won its bid to host the Olympics.<ref name=1970Olympics/> Denver and Colorado Springs hosted the [[1962 World Ice Hockey Championships]].

[[File:Carla Madison Recreation Center.JPG|thumb|left|The Carla Madison Recreation Center, completed in 2017.]] Many of Denver's parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the [[City Beautiful]] movement, and Denver mayor [[Robert W. Speer|Robert Speer]] (1904–12 and 1916–18) set out to expand and beautify the city's parks. Reinhard Schuetze was the city's first [[landscape architect]], and he brought his German-educated landscaping genius to [[Washington Park, Denver|Washington Park]], [[Cheesman Park, Denver|Cheesman Park]], and [[City Park, Denver|City Park]] among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] and [[Saco Rienk DeBoer]] to design not only parks such as [[Civic Center, Denver|Civic Center Park]], but many city parkways and tree-lawns. All of this greenery was fed with [[South Platte River]] water diverted through the city ditch.<ref>Etter, Carolyn and Don. City of Parks: The Preservation of Denver's Park and Parkway System.

Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city, and with Central Park and [[Bluff Lake Nature Center]] in the [[Central Park, Denver|Central Park]] neighborhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green. Denver is also home to a large network of public [[community gardens]], most of which are managed by [[Denver Urban Gardens]], a non-profit organization.[[File:Dmp.JPG|thumb|[[Genesee Park (Colorado)|Genesee Park]] is the largest of the Denver Mountain Parks.]]

Since 1974, Denver and the surrounding jurisdictions have rehabilitated the urban South Platte River and its tributaries for recreational use by hikers and cyclists. The main stem of the South Platte River Greenway runs along the South Platte from [[Chatfield Dam|Chatfield Reservoir]] {{convert|35|mi|km}} into Adams County in the north. The Greenway project is recognized as one of the best urban reclamation projects in the U.S., winning, for example, the Silver Medal [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]] in 2001.<ref name="Bruner Foundation">{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba|publisher=Bruner Foundation|accessdate=September 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914092210/http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/|archive-date=September 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Denver}}

[[File:Coloradocapitolhill2.JPG|thumb|[[Colorado State Capitol]] looking east.]]

Denver is a [[consolidated city-county]] with a mayor elected on a [[nonpartisan]] ballot, a 13-member [[city council]] and an [[auditor]]. The [[Denver City Council]] is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing, and can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is [[Michael Hancock (Colorado politician)|Michael Hancock]].

Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any ordinances or [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Our City Government Works |url=https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/city-of-denver-home/government/city-overview.html |date=2016 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707133025/http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/city-of-denver-home/government/city-overview.html |archive-date=July 7, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Denver Department of Safety oversees three branches: the [[Denver Police Department]], [[Denver Fire Department]], and [[Denver Sheriff Department]]. The Denver County Court is an integrated [[Colorado County Courts|Colorado County Court]] and Municipal Court and is managed by Denver instead of the state.

===Politics===
While Denver elections are non-partisan, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have long dominated the city's politics; most citywide officials are known to be Democrats. The mayor's office has been occupied by a Democrat since the 1963 municipal election. All of the city's seats in the state legislature are held by Democrats.

In statewide elections, the city also tends to favor Democrats, though Republicans can occasionally be competitive. The last Republican to win Denver in a gubernatorial election was [[John A. Love]] in [[1970 Colorado gubernatorial election|1970]] by a narrow majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1970&off=5&elect=0&fips=8&f=0|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|publisher=US Election Atlas |accessdate=September 27, 2020}}</ref> [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] in [[2002 Colorado gubernatorial election|2002]] remains the last Republican governor to receive at least 40% of Denver's vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2002&off=5&elect=0&fips=8&f=0|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|publisher=US Election Atlas |accessdate=September 27, 2020}}</ref> The last Republican Senator to carry Denver was [[William L.

In federal elections, Denverites also tend to vote for Democratic candidates, voting for the Democratic Presidential nominee in every election since 1960, excluding 1972 and 1980. At the federal level, Denver is the heart of {{ushr|CO|1}}, which includes all of Denver and parts of [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]]. It is represented by Democrat [[Diana DeGette]].

[[Benjamin F. Stapleton]] was the mayor of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was responsible for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the [[New Deal]]. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed [[Stapleton International Airport]] in his honor. Today, the airport has been replaced by a neighborhood initially named Stapleton.  However, because of Stapleton's demonstrated racism and prominent membership in the [[Ku Klux Klan]], during the [[George Floyd protests]], residents of the neighborhood [[List of name changes due to the George Floyd protests|changed the name]] to "Central Park" in 2020.<ref>https://archive.is/DQPqL</ref><ref>https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/08/01/stapleton-neighborhood-central-park/</ref>  Stapleton Street continues to bear his name. 

During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the centers of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The boxer-turned-activist [[Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales]] formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515043644/http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 15, 2011 |title=History Timeline |publisher=Chicanomoratorium.org |accessdate=September 15, 2013 }}</ref>

In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become [[Homelessness|homeless]], particularly under the administrations of mayors [[John Hickenlooper]] and [[Wellington Webb]]. At a rate of 19 homeless per 10,000 residents in 2011 as compared to 50 or more per 10,000 residents for the four metro areas with the highest rate of homelessness,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endhomelessness.org/page/-/files/4361_file_Appendix_One.pdf |title=Homelessness in Large Metro Areas |publisher=Endhomelessness.org |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115013843/http://www.endhomelessness.org/page/-/files/4361_file_Appendix_One.pdf |archive-date=January 15, 2016 }}</ref> Denver's homeless population and rate of homeless are both considerably lower than many other major cities. However, residents of the city streets suffer Denver winters – which, although mild and dry much of the time, can have brief periods of extremely cold temperatures and snow.

In 2005, Denver became the first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private possession of less than an ounce of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legal for adults 21 and older.<ref name="DenverPot">O'Driscoll, Patrick.[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-11-03-pot_x.htm Denver votes to legalize marijuana possession].

In May 2019, Denver became the first U.S. city to [[Decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[psilocybin mushrooms]] after an initiative passed with 50.6% of the vote. The measure prohibits Denver from using any resources to prosecute adults over 21 for personal use of psilocybin mushrooms, though such use remains illegal under state and federal law.<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver, Colorado, Initiated Ordinance 301, Psilocybin Mushroom Initiative (May 2019) |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Denver,_Colorado,_Initiated_Ordinance_301,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Initiative_(May_2019) |website=Ballotpedia |publisher=Ballotpedia |accessdate=19 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5585635/denver-magic-mushrooms-vote/|title=Denver Approves Decriminalizing Psilocybin Mushrooms in Unofficial Results, as Public Support for Psychedelic Drug Research Grows|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>

Denver hosted the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], which was the centennial of the city's first hosting of the landmark 1908 convention. It also hosted the [[G8|G7]] (now G8) summit between June 20 and 22 in 1997 and the 2000 National Convention of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html |title=List of Summit Meetings |publisher=MOFA |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic National Convention |url=http://www.pepsicenter.com/Events/Event.aspx?eid=jBjB9FSNi20 |date=2008 |publisher=[[Pepsi Center]] |access-date=February 3, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 1972, 1981, and 2008, Denver also played host to the [[Libertarian Party of the United States]] National Convention. The [[Libertarian National Convention#1972|1972 Convention]] was notable for nominating [[Tonie Nathan]] as the Vice Presidential candidate, the first woman, as well as the first [[Jews|Jew]], to receive an [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral vote]] in a [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|United States presidential election]].

On October 3, 2012, [[The University of Denver]] in Denver hosted the first of the three 2012 presidential debates during the election that year. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Illescas |first1=Carlos |title=University of Denver to host first presidential debate in October |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2011/10/31/university-of-denver-to-host-first-presidential-debate-in-october/ |publisher=Denver Post |date=October 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Taxes===
The City and County of Denver levies an Occupational Privilege Tax (OPT or head tax) on employers and employees.
*If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.
*The employer is liable for $4 per employee per month and the employee is liable for $5.75 per month.
*It is the employer's responsibility to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.

Denver's many colleges and universities range in age and study programs. Three major public schools constitute the [[Auraria Campus]]: the [[University of Colorado Denver]], [[Metropolitan State University of Denver]], and [[Community College of Denver]]. The private [[University of Denver]] was the first institution of higher learning in the city and was founded in 1864. Other prominent Denver higher education institutions include [[Johnson & Wales University]], Catholic ([[Jesuit]]) [[Regis University]] and the city has Roman Catholic and Jewish institutions, as well as a health sciences school. In addition to those schools within the city, there are a number of schools throughout the surrounding metro area.[[File:CU Denver Student Wellness Center and Student Commons Building on the Downtown Denver Campus .jpg|thumb|University of Colorado-Denver in downtown|alt=|left]][[File:Ritchie Center sunrise 2006.jpg|thumb|The Ritchie Center at University of Denver|alt=|none|233x233px]]

==Media==
{{Main|Media in Denver}}
The Denver Metropolitan Area is served by a variety of media outlets in print, radio, television, and the Internet.

===Television stations===
Denver is the 16th-largest market in the country for television, according to the 2009–2010 [http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/1149-million-us-television-homes-estimated-for-2009-2010-season rankings] from [[Nielsen Media Research]].

===Radio stations===
Denver is also served by over 40&nbsp;AM and FM radio stations, covering a wide variety of formats and styles. Denver-Boulder radio is the No. 19 market in the United States, according to the Spring 2011 [http://www.arbitron.com/radio_stations/mm001050.asp Arbitron] ranking (up from No. 20 in Fall 2009).
For a list of radio stations, see [[List of radio stations in Colorado|Radio Stations in Colorado]].

===Print===
After a continued rivalry between Denver's two main newspapers, the ''[[Denver Post]]'' and ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', the papers merged operations in 2001 under a Joint Operating Agreement that formed the Denver Newspaper Agency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvernewspaperagency.com |title= Denver Newspaper Agency|accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> until February 2009 when [[E. W. Scripps Company]], the owner of the ''Rocky Mountain News'', closed the paper. There are also several alternative or localized newspapers published in Denver, including the ''[[Westword]]'', ''[[Law Week Colorado]]'', ''[[Out Front Colorado]]'' and the ''[[Intermountain Jewish News]]''. Denver is home to multiple regional magazines such as ''[[5280]]'', which takes its name from the city's mile-high elevation ({{convert|5280|ft|m|0|disp=or|sp=us}}).

==Transportation==
[[File:Sunrise Over Denver Skyline.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.45|Dawn over downtown Denver, viewed from the north with Pikes Peak and the southern [[Front Range]] to the south.]]

===City streets===
{{Main|Street system of Denver}}
[[File:Colfaxatbroadway.JPG|thumb|upright|Colfax Avenue at Broadway, where the downtown street grid and the "normal" city grid meet. Colfax Avenue carries [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]] through Denver.]]

Most of Denver has a straightforward [[street grid]] oriented to the four [[cardinal direction]]s. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as "00", which are Broadway (the east–west median, running north–south) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north–south median, running east–west). [[Colfax Avenue]], a major east–west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Montview Blvd.), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.

There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]]. Most of the streets downtown and in [[LoDo]] run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]]. There is now a plaque across the street from the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]] that honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after [[William Larimer, Jr.]], the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of [[LoDo]], is the oldest street in Denver.
[[File:Denver skyline from Speer Blvd near I-25, April 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|440x440px|Speer Boulevard runs north and south through downtown Denver.]]
All roads in the downtown grid system are streets (e.g. [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]], Stout Street), except for the five NE-SW roads nearest the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway: Cheyenne Place, Cleveland Place, Court Place, Tremont Place and Glenarm Place. Roads outside that system that travel east/west are given the suffix "avenue" and those that head north and south are given the "street" suffix (e.g. Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction (more commonly north and south). Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives (though not all drives are smaller capacity roads, some are major thoroughfares) or courts. Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city's center.

Some Denver streets have [[bicycle lanes]], leaving a patchwork of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over 850 miles<ref name="denver.org">{{cite web |title=Denver's 850 Miles of Off-Road Bike Trails |url=http://www.denver.org/metro/features/bike-trails |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821123833/http://denver.org/metro/features/bike-trails |archive-date=August 21, 2008 |publisher=Denver Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This allows for a significant portion of Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city.<ref name="League of American Bicylistsl">{{cite web |title=Bicycle Friendly Communities: Denver |url=http://www.bicyclefriendlycommunity.org/Images/bfc_pdf_pages/denver.pdf |date=2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822182922/http://www.bicyclefriendlycommunity.org/Images/bfc_pdf_pages/denver.pdf |archive-date=August 22, 2007 |publisher=[[League of American Bicyclists]] |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Some residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle&nbsp;– a citywide bicycle sharing program&nbsp;– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch, boasting 400 bicycles.<ref name="Cnet">{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20003054-1.html|title=B-cycle bike sharing to be the largest in U.S. |publisher=Cnet |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

===Cycling===
The League of American Bicyclists has rated Colorado as the sixth most bicycle-friendly state in the nation for the year 2014. This is due in large part to Front Range cities like Boulder, Fort Collins and Denver placing an emphasis on legislation, programs and infrastructure developments that promote cycling as a mode of transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/2014_state_ranking_chart.pdf |title=Bicycle Friendly State : 2014 Ranking |publisher=Bike League |accessdate=April 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Walk Score|Walk score]] has rated Denver as the fourth most bicycle-friendly large city in the United States.<ref name="walkscore" />
According to data from the 2011 American Community Survey, Denver ranks 6th among US cities with populations over 400,000 in terms of the percentage of [[List of U.S. cities with most bicycle commuters|workers who commute by bicycle]] at 2.2% of commuters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denverurbanism.com/2011/10/denver-hits-2-2-bicycle-commuter-mode-share-for-2010.html |title=Denver Hits 2.2% Bicycle Commuter Mode Share for 2010 " DenverUrbanism Blog |publisher=Denverurbanism.com |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref> B-Cycle&nbsp;– Denver's citywide bicycle sharing program&nbsp;– was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch in 2010, boasting 400 bicycles.<ref name="Cnet"/> B-Cycle ridership peaked in 2014, then steadily declined.

=== Electric rental scooters ===
In 2018, [[electric scooter]] services began to place scooters in Denver. Hundreds of unsanctioned LimeBike and Bird electric scooters appeared on Denver streets in May, causing an uproar. In June, the city ordered the companies to remove them<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/13/denver-electric-scooter-rentals/|title=Denver officials seize more than 250 electric scooters from city streets, levy fines|date=2018-06-14|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref> and acted quickly to create an official program, making a requirement that scooters be left at RTD stops and out of the public right-of-way. Lime and Bird scooters then reappeared in late July, with limited compliance. [[Uber]]'s Jump e-bikes arrived in late August, followed by [[Lyft]]'s nationwide electric scooter launch in early September.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/lyft-launches-its-scooter-business-in-denver/|title=Lyft launches its scooter business in Denver|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Lyft offers ride-sharing, electric scooter, and e-bike services all from its app. It says that it will, each night, take the scooters to the warehouse for safety checks, maintenance and charging.

===Walkability===
2017 rankings by [[Walk Score]] placed Denver twenty-sixth among 108 U.S. cities with a population of 200,000 or greater.<ref name=walkscore>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2017 City & Neighborhood Ranking |publisher=Walk Score |year=2017 |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> City leaders have acknowledged the concerns of walkability advocates that Denver has serious gaps in its sidewalk network.

===Modal characteristics===
In 2015, 9.6 percent of Denver households lacked a car, and in 2016, this was virtually unchanged (9.4 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Denver averaged 1.62 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Freeways and highways===
Denver is primarily served by the interstate freeways [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] and [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|I-70]]. The problematic intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as "[[Mousetrap (Denver)|the mousetrap]]" because, when viewed from the air, the junction (and subsequent vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap.

* [[File:Colorado 470.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''State Highway 470''' ('''C-470''', '''SH 470''') is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro area's beltway. Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s, the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built. The portion of "Interstate 470" built as a [[state highway]] is the present-day SH 470, which is a [[freeway]] for its entire length.

Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as "the 470's". These are [[SH 470 (CO)|SH 470]] (also known as C-470), a freeway in the southwest Metro area, and two toll highways, [[E-470]] (from southeast to northeast) and [[Northwest Parkway]] (from terminus of E-470 to [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]). SH 470 was intended to be I-470 and built with federal highway funds, but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver's [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]] to a pedestrian mall. As a result, construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Matthew E. Salek |url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/denvers470.html |title=C-470?

[[Public transport|Mass transportation]] throughout the [[Denver metropolitan area]] is managed and coordinated by the [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD). RTD operates more than 1,000 [[bus]]es serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area|Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas]]. Additionally, RTD operates eleven [[RTD Bus & Rail|rail]] lines, the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, L, N, R, W, and H with a total of {{convert|57.9|mi|km}} of track, serving 44 stations. The C, D, E, F, L, R, W and H lines are [[light rail]] while the [[A Line (RTD)|A Line]], [[B Line (RTD)|B Line]], [[G Line (RTD)|G Line]] and [[N Line (RTD)|N Line]] are [[commuter rail]].

[[FasTracks]] is a commuter rail, light rail, and bus expansion project approved by voters in 2004, which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The [[W Line (RTD)|W Line]], or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center. The commuter rail A Line from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport opened in April 2016 with ridership exceeding RTD's early expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.progressiverailroading.com/passenger_rail/news/Denvers-RTD-marks-A-Line-commuter-rail-ridership-growth--56571 |title=Denver's RTD marks A Line commuter-rail ridership growth |publisher=Progressive Railroading |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> The light rail [[R Line (RTD)|R Line]] through Aurora opened in February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/02/24/rtd-opens-new-light-rail-line/|title=RTD Opens New Light Rail Line|publisher=CBS Denver|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> The [[G Line (RTD)|G Line]] to the suburb of Arvada opened on April 26, 2019 after being originally planned to open in the Fall of 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/01/rtd-g-line-opening/|title=RTD: Long-delayed G-Line from Denver to Wheat Ridge will open April 26 |newspaper=Denver Post|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> The [[N Line (RTD)|N Line]] to Commerce City and Thornton opened on September 21, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-22|title=All Aboard: RTD's N Line Starts Rolling From Denver To Thornton|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/09/22/rtd-n-line-starts-denver-thornton/|access-date=2020-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

An express bus service, known as the [[Flatiron Flyer]], serves to connect Boulder and Denver. The service, billed as [[bus rapid transit]], has been accused of [[bus rapid transit creep]] for failing to meet the majority of BRT requirements, including level boarding and all-door entry. A commuter rail connection to Boulder and its suburb of Longmont, also part of the FasTracks ballot initiative and an extension of the [[B Line (RTD)|B Line]], is planned to be finished by RTD, but no construction funds have yet been identified prior to 2040.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_32583756/rtd-recommits-completing-train-service-boulder-longmont-considering |title=RTD recommits to completing train service to Boulder, Longmont, considering interim plan |newspaper=Daily Camera |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> RTD is currently considering an interim commuter service which would run rush-hour trains from Longmont to Denver.

The [[Colorado Department of Transportation]] runs [[Bustang]], a bus system that offers weekday and weekend service connecting Denver with [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado Springs]], [[Fort Collins]] and [[Gunnison, Colorado|Gunnison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ridebustang.com/routes-maps/ |title=Bustang Routes |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>

[[Greyhound Lines]], the [[intercity bus]] operator, has a major hub in Denver, with routes to New York City, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Las Vegas]], and their headquarters, [[Dallas]]. Subsidiary [[Autobuses Americanos]] provides service to [[El Paso]]. Allied bus operators Black Hills Trailways, and [[Burlington Trailways]] provide service to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]].

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' multiple times every week in both directions between [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[Emeryville, California]], across the bay from San Francisco. The service usually runs daily but due to [[COVID-19 pandemic|the COVID-19 pandemic]], the service was cut by Amtrak. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 the Colorado legislature reinvigorated studies of passenger rail service along the Front Range, potentially connecting Denver to Fort Collins and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], or further to Amtrak connections in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] and [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2019/06/13/colorado-serious-look-passenger-rail-service-front-range/1442541001/  |title=Backers believe this Front Range passenger rail plan is the real deal

At Albuquerque, New Mexico, Denver Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak ''[[Southwest Chief]]''. Additionally, the [[Ski Train]] operated on the former [[Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad]], which took passengers between Denver and the [[Winter Park, Colorado|Winter Park]] Ski Resort, but it is no longer in service. The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29, 2009. The service was revived on a trial basis in 2016 with a great amount of local fanfare. Further development of a mountain corridor rail option, though publicly popular, has been met with resistance from politicians, namely the director of [[Colorado Department of Transportation]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.5280.com/news/magazine/2017/02/can-i-70s-mountain-corridor-ever-be-fixed|title=Can I-70's Mountain Corridor Ever Be Fixed?|date=2017-02-15|work=5280|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2017}}. The Ski Train did return to service under [[Amtrak]] with the name "[[Ski Train|Winter Park Express]]" in 2017, and currently runs only on Saturdays, Sundays, and major holidays during the winter ski seasons.

Denver's early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at historic [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]], where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]] will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at the completion of [[FasTracks]]. The city also plans to invest billions to bringing frequent public transit within one-fourth of a mile of most of its residents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver Moves: Transit |url=https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/Denveright/documents/transit/Denver-Moves-Transit-Plan-2019.pdf |website=Denver Department of Public Works |publisher=City and County of Denver |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>

As of 2017, [[Denver International Airport]] has been rated by [[Skytrax]] as the 28th best airport in the world, falling to second place in the United States behind only [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]]. Skytrax also named DIA as the second best regional airport in North America for 2017, and the fourth best regional airport in the world.

Three [[general aviation]] airports serve the Denver area. [[Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport]] (KBJC) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north-northwest, [[Centennial Airport]] (KAPA) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south-southeast, and [[Colorado Air and Space Port]] formerly, Front Range Airport (KCFO) is {{convert|23.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} east of the state capitol.

In the past, Denver has been home to several other airports that are no longer operational. [[Stapleton International Airport]] was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. Both Stapleton and Lowry have since been redeveloped into primarily residential neighborhoods. [[Buckley Air Force Base]], a former [[Air National Guard]] base, is the only military facility in the Denver area.
