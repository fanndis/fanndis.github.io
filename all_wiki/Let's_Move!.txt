'''Let's Move!''' was a [[public health]] campaign in the United States, led by [[Michelle Obama]], wife of then-President [[Barack Obama]]. The campaign aimed to reduce [[childhood obesity]] and encourage a healthy lifestyle in children.<ref>{{cite web|title=America's Move to Raise A Healthier Generation of Kids: Learn the Facts|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity|accessdate=November 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410034600/http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity|archivedate=April 10, 2011}}{{failed verification|date=April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdage.com/news/regis-kelly-welcome-michelle-obama-raise-obesity-awareness_2-8-2011 |title=Regis & Kelly Welcome Michelle Obama to Raise Obesity Awareness |publisher=ThirdAge |date=February 8, 2011 |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913165752/http://www.thirdage.com/news/regis-kelly-welcome-michelle-obama-raise-obesity-awareness_2-8-2011 |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
The campaign was announced on February 9, 2010 by Michelle Obama. The campaign was funded by diverting money away from the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (food stamps).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/11/11/obama-takes-from-kids-dinners-to-fund-michelles-project/|title=Obama using food-stamp cash to fund Michelle's 'Let's Move'|first=Peyser|last=Andrea|date=11 November 2013|publisher=}}</ref> Obama indicated the campaign would encourage healthier food in schools, better food labeling and more physical activity for children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michelle Obama says 'Let's Move' on obesity in American kids|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0209/Michelle-Obama-says-Let-s-Move-on-obesity-in-American-kids|accessdate=July 30, 2010|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> On the same date, Obama signed a [[presidential memorandum]] creating the [[Task Force on Childhood Obesity]] to review current programs and develop a national action plan. The Task Force reviews policy and programs related to child nutrition and physical activity. It hopes to create change through a national action plan with five goals: 
*Creating a healthy start for children
*Empowering parents and caregivers
*Providing healthy food in schools
*Improving access to healthy, affordable foods
*Increasing physical activity

The White House Task Force hoped to bring the childhood obesity rate down to five percent by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|title=White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/white-house-task-force-childhood-obesity-report-president|website=Let's Move|accessdate=December 8, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116041051/http://www.letsmove.gov/white-house-task-force-childhood-obesity-report-president|archivedate=January 16, 2013}}</ref>

A song, "Move Your Body", was released to promote the campaign called Let's Move! Flash Workout. The song was by [[Beyoncé]] and [[Swizz Beatz]], and the video was filmed in a school cafeteria where Beyoncé was dancing with children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/04/26/video-beyonce-move-your-body/#more-82746 |title=Video: Beyoncé – 'Move Your Body' |publisher=Rap-Up |date=April 26, 2011 |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

The initiative was led for several years by [[Sam Kass]], the [[personal chef]] to the Obamas who became the first-ever [[White House]] Senior Policy Advisor on Nutrition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/08/white-house-announces-departure-sam-kass |title=White House Announces the Departure of Sam Kass |publisher=The White House |date=December 8, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> He was succeeded in 2015 as both Executive Director of Let's Move! and Senior Policy Advisor on Nutrition by Debra Eschmeyer, a cofounder of [[FoodCorps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-lets-move-leader-met-20150108-story.html |title=First lady names food activist as new head of anti-obesity drive |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |date=January 8, 2015 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

Since the Let's Move initiative was a collaboration of many government agencies and private entities, it lacked full-time employees. Department heads, business executives, volunteers, teachers, legislators, and others carry out the mission and goals of Let's Move in conjunction with their primary work obligations. Michelle Obama is the chief spokeswoman and promoter, but she does not have staff solely dedicated to carrying out the Let's Move initiative.<ref>Let's Move. Learn the Facts.

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) is a measurement of weight in relation to height that can help to determine weight status.  In children, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) determine that is overweight if he/she is above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile and obese if at or above the 95th percentile.<ref name="basics">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html |title=Basics About Childhood Obesity |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

The CDC indicates that there are several factors that can contribute to childhood obesity: genetic factors; behavioral factors including energy intake, physical activity and sedentary behavior; and environmental factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/problem.html |title=A Growing Problem |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> Overweight and obesity pose many potential risks and consequences: psychological; [[cardiovascular disease]]; among additional risks including [[asthma]], [[hepatic steatosis]], [[sleep apnea]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].<ref name="basics"/> Today nearly one in five children in the U.S. between ages 6–19 are obese, and one in three are overweight.

==Nutrition==
To promote healthy eating, the ''Let's Move!'' initiative emphasizes nutrition information, a [[MyPlate|next generation food "icon"]], food nutrition labeling and having pediatricians as partners.<ref name="letsmove2">{{cite web |url=http://www.letsmove.gov/eat-healthy |title=Eat Healthy |publisher=Let's Move! |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410141820/http://www.letsmove.gov/eat-healthy |archive-date=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) presents its Let's Move food choice guidelines on the webpage called MyPlate, located at ChooseMyPlate.gov.<ref>{{cite web|title=ChooseMyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref>  Guidelines take the form of "half all grains eaten should be whole grains" <ref>{{cite web|title=ChooseMyPlate|url=http://choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains-amount.html|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=31 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604210549/http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains-amount.html|archivedate=4 June 2014}}</ref> and 37 nutrition tips.<ref>{{cite web|title=ChooseMyPlate|url=http://choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/ten-tips.html/food-groups/grains-amount.html|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=31 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140617233118/http://choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/ten-tips.html/food-groups/grains-amount.html|archivedate=17 June 2014}}</ref> ''Let's Move!'' also provides consumers with nutrition information through the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (or FDA)'s  "New Front-of-Package Labeling Initiative" and "New Menu and Vending Machines Labeling Requirements".<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Labeling and Nutrition|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/default.htm|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

{{quote|The HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) is a voluntary initiative established in 2004 to recognize those schools participating in the National School Lunch Program that have created healthier school environments through promotion of nutrition and physical activity.

In February 2010, First Lady Michelle Obama introduced Let's Move!, incorporating the HealthierUS School Challenge into her campaign to raise a healthier generation of kids. At the time, monetary incentive awards became available for each HUSSC award level: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Gold Award of Distinction.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service: HealthierUS School Challenge|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/healthierus/index.html|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>}}

==Community involvement==
For Let's Move to work effectively, communities would need to be involved, schools would need to implement health programs, and parents would need to teach their children healthy habits. The following sections describe how organizations and businesses had gotten involved in this nationwide movement.

===Chefs Move to Schools===
''Chefs Move to Schools'' was founded in May 2010 as part of First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign.<ref name="CMtF">{{cite web|title=Chefs Move to Schools|url=http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> The Chefs Move to Schools program is a nationwide effort to teach culinary skills to school children and to get them to try new, healthful food options.<ref name="CMtF" /> Professional chefs volunteer a specified amount of their time to cook with students and/or to help train school workers in how to prepare and provide food in a healthier manner.<ref name="CMtFGetStarted">{{cite web|title=Get Started|url=http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/get-started.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416010134/http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/get-started.html|archivedate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> As of February 2, 2012 about 3,500 schools were partnered with professional chefs in an effort to educate students about a healthier diet in an entertaining and appealing way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sam Kass - Chefs Move to Schools|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhPMBhG0JHI|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

The program is also figure headed by Chef Sam Kass, an assistant chef at the White House and the Senior Policy Advisor for Healthy Food Initiatives.<ref name="CMtFPartners">{{cite web|title=Partners|url=http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/partners.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315200648/http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/partners.html|archivedate=March 15, 2012}}</ref> [[Food Network]] star [[Rachael Ray]] also publicly supports the program and has encouraged children to be involved in the kitchen on episodes of her show ''[[Rachael Ray (TV series)|Rachael Ray]]''.<ref name="CMtFPartners" /> Other partners of the program include the School Nutrition Association, the [[American Culinary Federation]], Cooking Matters, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the Culinary Trust, the [[Partnership for a Healthier America]], [[Cornell University]], [[Philip Lempert]] the Supermarket Guru, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], the International Corporate Chefs Association, and the [[Food Service Management Institute]].<ref name="CMtFPartners" />

Chefs can sign up to participate in the program on the website on the official Chefs Move to Schools website to be matched with a school in their area.<ref name="CMtFGetStarted" /> They can select any or all of what they are interested in: helping to plant a school garden, teaching children about healthier living in the classroom, helping officials to develop school lunch menu items, and training students about culinary skills in the kitchen.<ref name="CMtFGetStarted" /> On the application, chefs are also asked to provide information about their qualifications and training.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/chef-registration.html |title=Chefs Registration |publisher=Chefs Move to Schools |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330201811/http://www.chefsmovetoschools.org/chef-registration.html |archivedate=March 30, 2012 }}</ref> Chefs are asked to specify how many hours they can devote to the program and which days of the week they can volunteer. These profiles are matched with other profiles that are created by schools to become an official partnership.  Once the partnership is created, Chefs Move to Schools provides schools and chefs with resources to help them get started and to help guide both parties through a successful process.<ref name="CMtFGetStarted" />

===Business involvement===
Private businesses have also decided to make changes to improve healthy habits for kids. For example, Disney now requires that all foods sold and advertised have to follow nutritional guidelines of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption while decreasing calorie count. Also, Walgreens, Superval, and Walmart have announced building or expanding stores in areas that have limited access to healthy foods.<ref name="letsmove.gov"/>

==Physical activity==
[[File:DSC 0003 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|Students at the Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] practice their choreography for a new student-produced fitness video]]

The CDC recommends that children engage in one hour or more of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] every day.  It states that children should do three different types of activity: [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic activity]], muscle strengthening, and bone strengthening.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Physical Activity for Everyone: How much physical activity do children need?|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/children.html|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

''Let's Move!'' looks to promote physical activity through the support and cooperation of families, schools, and communities.  On children, the initiative states, "Those who feel supported by friends and families or are surrounded by others interested in physical activity, are more likely to participate."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letsmove.gov/active-families |title=Active Families |publisher=Let's Move! |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412234106/http://www.letsmove.gov/active-families |archive-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Let's Move!'' also provides several guidelines for schools to promote physical activity, including strong [[physical education]] programs, and indicates the subsidizing of such guidelines with several government programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letsmove.gov/active-schools |title=Active Schools |publisher=Let's Move! |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423172843/http://www.letsmove.gov/active-schools |archive-date=April 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Guidelines by which physical activity can be promoted in communities are also outlined on the ''Let's Move!'' website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letsmove.gov/active-communities |title=Active Communities |publisher=Let's Move! |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419180810/http://www.letsmove.gov/active-communities |archive-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Impact evaluation==
The Center for Disease Control publishes obesity rates broken down by age group. The report found that between 2009 and 2012, the obesity rate dropped by 3.7 percentage points among children aged 2–5, dropped by 0.3 points among those aged 6–11, and increased by 2.1 points among those aged 12–19. By 2015, childhood obesity rates had not changed much since 2008 but had dropped significantly among the youngest children;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/06/politics/michelle-obamas-lets-move-turns-5-is-it-working/index.html|title=Let's Move reaches 5 after criticism -- progress|first=Kevin Liptak, CNN White House|last=Producer|publisher=}}</ref> the exact impact that ''Let's Move!'' has had on these trends is uncertain.

==Collaboration==
Let's Move faces a challenge: effective coordination between all involved agencies, companies, non-profits, and levels of government. Dr. Susanna Campbell, an international relations scholar, and Michael Harnett, an international business professional, conducted research and discussed the barriers to coordination, the main concepts of coordination, and recommendations for improving coordination. Rodrigo Serrano also provides insight into creating incentive programs to promote coordination.<ref>Campbell, Susanna P. and Michael Hartnett. 2005. A framework 	for improved coordination. https://www.regjeringen.no/ 	globalassets/ upload/UD/Vedlegg/missions/framework.pdf 	(accessed November 25, 2015).</ref>

Organizations are sovereign and the individuals within are accountable first to their organization and second to the coordination effort. Conflicts can arise when the goals of the coordination process don't align well with an agency's main goals. If there is a pressing problem to solve, it acts as its own incentive for coordination as long as the problem involves a possibility to find a coordinated solution.<ref>Serrano, Rodrigo. 2005. What makes inter-agency coordination 	work? Insights from the literature and two case studies. Inter-American Development Bank Sustainable Development Department Social Development Division. www.iadb.org/sds/soc (accessed November 25, 2015).</ref> Of all the incentive programs proposed, an incentive system involving recognition may be the most effective and efficient. Agencies and organizations associated with Let's Move could receive an award as a result of making a positive impact according to Let's Move's goals and mission. Organizations could report their impact to the Task Force, and Michelle Obama could recognize the organizations that engaged the most and had the greatest impact. The award would also help remind organizations of the importance of working together to solve the problem of childhood obesity.

Let's Move could also improve its coordination process by establishing clear field officers in each associated organization and have them report to a central authority figure, like the Task Force on Childhood Obesity. The improved coordination process would make sure each organization or agency is accountable and that there isn't overlap or redundancy
