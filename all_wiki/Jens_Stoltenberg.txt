In the [[2001 Norwegian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its worst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.

The 2001, election met with instability for the Labour Party.

Several analysts have pointed out that one of the reasonable causes for their loss was that with only one year in power until the next election, more time was spent initiating or trying to start reforms than telling the people why they had to be done. Such reforms included selling down in state-owned companies, re-organisation of health care and public hospitals and changes in sick pay. The changes made from the 2001 election to the 2005 election were described by Norwegian newspaper ''VG'' as an "extreme makeover."<ref name="Extreme makeover">{{cite news|first=Eirik |last=Mosveen |title=Ekstrem forvandling |trans-title=Extreme makeover |work=VG |date=11 August 2005 |language=no |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=106643 |access-date=12 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-date=13 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001303/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=106643 }}</ref>

'''Party leader election'''
The bad election result in 2001 was quickly followed by a leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators as a sign that he probably would seek the leadership position.<ref>{{cite news|author=Marie Melgård, Tommy H.

{{Main|Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet}}
Stoltenberg's second cabinet governed Norway from 17 October 2005 to 16 October 2013. The [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]] saw a vast improvement for Labour, and the party gained a majority in parliament together with the other "Red-Green" parties, the [[Sosialistisk Venstreparti|Socialist Left Party]] and the [[Senterpartiet|Centre Party]]. This paved the way for a historic first in Norway, with Labour joining in a coalition government, the [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|Red-Green Coalition]], after a [[First Declaration of Soria Moria|coalition deal]] with Stoltenberg was struck. Since the government's formation, key political issues such as [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norwegian military]] participation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], petroleum activities in the [[Barents Sea]], [[LGBT]] rights, immigration and the quality of standard education were greatly debated by the public. Following [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|Stoltenberg's re-election in 2009]], he worked on the Swedish response to the [[Late-2000s recession|ongoing global recession]] and championed for [[environmentalism|environmentalist policies]] through private and corporate taxation.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=15 September 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8253849.stm |title=Norway's government is re-elected |work=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=14 September 2009 |language=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914100558/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8253849.stm |archive-date=14 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Financial crisis'''

Stoltenberg took an international role during the financial crisis by promoting international financial cooperation. This was among other arenas done through the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and a meeting in Chile 27–29 March 2009 where social democratic leaders from around the world met at a Progressive Governance Conference, just prior to the first G20 summit on the financial crisis. President [[Bill Clinton]] was among the delegates and panel that would chart a way out of the financial crisis, which included the host [[Michelle Bachelet]], Britain's finance minister [[Gordon Brown]], Brazil's President [[Lula da Silva]] and Stoltenberg. A special emergency meeting of the European Social Democratic Forum (PES) was gathered in Oslo in May 2011, on an initiative from Stoltenberg and the think tank Policy Network.

Both nationally and internationally, Stoltenberg emphasised the enormous costs the financial crisis had in the form of a high unemployment rate, and appealed for better international coordination, the balance between austerity and economic growth stimulus, active labor market measures for young people, and investments for increased innovation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Norway came out of the financial crisis with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe.<ref name=Db>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/05/01/nyheter/innenriks/arbeidsledighet/jens_stoltenberg/1_mai/11529483/ |language=no |title=Norge har lavest arbeids-ledighet i Europa |trans-title=Norway has the lowest unemployment in Europe |work=Dagbladet |date=1 May 2010 |archive-date= 4 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504043235/http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/05/01/nyheter/innenriks/arbeidsledighet/jens_stoltenberg/1_mai/11529483/ }}</ref>

'''Environment and climate change'''

Partnering with tropical countries to preserve more of their rainforest to bind carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] was a policy of the Stoltenberg government. In 2007, the government received support from the opposition to a long-term agreement to finance forest conservation with 3 billion NOK annually.<ref name=NRK>{{cite news

Stoltenberg through his governing advocated that international agreements with global taxes or quotas are the most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the [[UN Climate Change Conference 2009]], a separate proposal on the preservation of rainforests with funding from rich countries, advanced by Stoltenberg and Brazilian [[President of Brazil|Pres]]. [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2009 obtained support from among others U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] during COP15 in Copenhagen.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The summit in Copenhagen ended without a binding agreement, but before the subsequent COP16 in [[Cancún]], Stoltenberg succeeded then-British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] in the leadership of the committee dealing with the financing of climate actions in developing countries, also consisting of Ethiopian [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] [[Meles Zenawi]]. Under a separate forest and climate conference in Oslo in May 2010, a proposal was presented to a number of countries, with final delivery of the report in autumn 2010.

In January 2014 Jens Stoltenberg became [[United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change]]. During the meeting there he met with Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] as well as [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention]] director [[Christiana Figueres]] and both [[Achim Steiner]] and [[Helen Clark]] of the [[United Nations Development Programme]].<ref>{{cite news

'''Vaccines'''

Stoltenberg has been an advocate for having all the world's children vaccinated against infectious diseases. The first speech he gave in his second term as Prime Minister was during Norway's "Pharmaceutics days" in 2005 under the title "Vaccination against poverty". Stoltenberg was director of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ([[GAVI]]) from 2002 to 2005 and was awarded the Children's Health Award in 2005.

An international initiative, with the UK, the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] and Norway in the lead, that GAVI received more than $3.7 billion until 2015 for their work against child mortality.<ref>{{cite news

In his New Year speech on 1 January 2013, Stoltenberg spoke about vaccination of the world's children as a personal matter of the heart. "Small jabs are giving millions of children the gift of life. Simple medicines can save their mothers. The fact that all these mothers' and children's lives can be saved is – as I see it – a miracle of our time," Stoltenberg said in his speech.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 January 2013 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Office-of-the-Prime-Minister/taler-og-artikler/2013/prime-minister-jens-stoltenbergs-new-yea.html?id=710868 |title=Stoltenbergs New Year speech |language=no |accessdate=12 March 2014 |archive-date=13 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001014/http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Office-of-the-Prime-Minister/taler-og-artikler/2013/prime-minister-jens-stoltenbergs-new-yea.html?id=710868 }}</ref>
