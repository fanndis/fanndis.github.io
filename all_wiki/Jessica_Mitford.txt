'''Jessica Lucy "Decca" Freeman-Mitford''' (11 September 1917 &ndash; 23 July 1996) was an English author, one of the six aristocratic [[Mitford sisters]] noted for their sharply conflicting politics.

Jessica married her second cousin [[Esmond Romilly]], who was killed in World War II, and then American civil rights lawyer [[Robert Treuhaft]], with whom she joined [[Communist Party USA|the American Communist Party]] and worked closely in the [[Civil Rights Congress]]. Both refused to testify in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and later resigned from the party out of disillusion with [[Stalinism]].

Her memoirs ''[[Hons and Rebels]]'', and a social commentary ''[[The American Way of Death]]'', both became classics.

==Early life and ancestry==
Born at [[Asthall Manor]], Oxfordshire,<ref name=Chisholm>Anne Chisholm, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-jessica-mitford-1330361.html "Obituary: Jessica Mitford"], ''The Independent'',  25 July 1996.</ref> the sixth of seven children, Jessica Mitford was the daughter of [[David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale]], and his wife Sydney (daughter of politician and publisher [[Thomas Gibson Bowles|Thomas Bowles]]), and grew up in a series of her father's country houses. She had little formal education, but nevertheless did a great deal of reading. Her sisters [[Unity Mitford|Unity]] and [[Diana Mitford|Diana]] were well-known members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and ultimately became close friends of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Diana married the British Union of Fascists' Leader, Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]. Upon the outbreak of war between the UK and [[Nazi Germany]], Unity tried to commit suicide in [[Munich]] and Diana and her husband were interned without trial for the duration of the war.

Jessica (always known as Decca) later described her father as "one of nature's [[fascism|fascists]]", renounced her privileged background at an early age and became an adherent of [[Stalinism]].<ref name=hons>{{cite book|last=Mitford|first=Jessica |title=Hons and Rebels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6VIAAAAYAAJ| year=1960| publisher=Isis|isbn=978-1-85089-441-4}}</ref> Mitford said that her parents had "appeased Hitler and Nazism. ... He had crushed the trade unions, he had crushed the communist party and he had crushed the Jews ... and don’t forget there’s a huge strain of anti-Semitism that runs through that class in England".<ref name="outsiders"/> She was known as the "[[black sheep|red sheep]]" of the family.<ref name="redsheep">Thomas Mallon, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016crbo_books1?currentPage=all "Red Sheep: How Jessica Mitford found her voice"], ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', 16 October 2006.</ref>

==Marriages and family==
===Life with Esmond Romilly===
At the age of 19, Mitford met her second cousin, [[Esmond Romilly]], who was recuperating from [[dysentery]] caught during a stint with the [[International Brigades]] defending [[Madrid]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Romilly was a nephew (by marriage) of [[Winston Churchill]].<ref name="Romilly1937">{{cite book|last=Romilly|first=Esmond Mark David |author-link=Esmond Romilly|title=Boadilla. (A Personal Record of the English Group of the Thaelmann Battalion of the International Brigade in Spain.).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODvtngEACAAJ|year=1937|location=London}}</ref> The cousins immediately fell in love and decided to elope to Spain, where Romilly picked up work as a reporter for the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. After some legal difficulties caused by their relatives' opposition, they [[cousin marriage|married]]. They moved to London and lived in the [[East End of London|East End]], then mostly a poor industrial area. Mitford [[home birth|gave birth at home]] to a daughter, Julia Decca Romilly, on 20 December 1937. The baby died in a [[measles]] epidemic the following May. Jessica Mitford rarely spoke of Julia in later life and she is not referred to by name in Mitford's 1960 autobiography, ''[[Hons and Rebels]]''.<ref name=hons/>

In 1939, Romilly and Mitford emigrated to the United States. They travelled around, working odd jobs, perpetually short of money.<ref name=hons/> At the outset of World War II, Romilly enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]; Mitford was living in Washington D.C., and considered joining him once he was posted to England. While living in D.C, with contemporaries [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and [[Clifford Durr]], she gave birth to another daughter, Constancia Romilly ("the Donk" or "Dinky") on 9 February 1941.<ref name="Salmond1990">{{cite book|last=Salmond|first=John A. |title=The Conscience of a Lawyer: Clifford J.

===Life with Robert Treuhaft===
Mitford threw herself into war work. Through this, she met and married the American [[civil rights]] lawyer [[Robert Treuhaft]] in 1943 and eventually settled in [[Oakland, California]].<ref name="Tocsin">{{Cite news | title = Communist on The Hit Parade | newspaper= Tocsin|volume=5|issue=9|page=1 Col A|location =Oakland, CA | date = 4 March 1964 | accessdate = 25 May 2018 | url = http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Magazines%20And%20Articles/Tocsin/03-04-64.pdf }}</ref> She became an American citizen in 1944.<ref name="Lovell2008">{{cite book|last=Lovell|first=Mary S. |title=The Mitford Girls: The Biography of an Extraordinary Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oZ2mxtiCy0C|year=2008|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-7481-0921-0|page=403}}</ref>

There, the couple had two sons; Nicholas, born in 1944 (who was killed in 1955 when hit by a bus), and Benjamin, born in 1947.<ref name=Chisholm/> Mitford approached her motherhood in a spirit of "benign neglect", described by her children as "matter-of-fact" and "not touchy-feely".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/14/DDG6PMAKDA34.DTL | title=Great writer. But as a mother? Jessica Mitford's children recall the woman they called Decca | first=Edward | last=Guthmann | date=17 November 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> She became closer to her own mother by letter over the decades but remained estranged from her sister Diana for the rest of her life.

==Career and politics==
===Communism and left-wing politics===
Mitford spent much of the early 1950s working as executive secretary of the local [[Civil Rights Congress]] chapter. Through this and her husband's legal practice, she was involved in a number of civil rights campaigns, notably the failed attempt to stop the execution of [[Willie McGee (convict)|Willie McGee]], an African-American convicted of raping a white woman. Mitford and Treuhaft became active members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. In 1953, at the height of [[McCarthyism]] and the '[[Red Scare]]', they were summoned to testify in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Both refused to name radical groups and friends or testify about their participation in Communist organisations, and were dismissed as 'unresponsive'.<ref name="Vangen2011">{{cite book|last=Vangen|first=A. D. |title=Honoring God to the Very, Very, Very End!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFDbgRIhDYQC&pg=PA113|year=2011|publisher=Xulon Press|isbn=978-1-61379-893-5|page=113}}</ref><ref name="outsiders">{{cite web |title=The Outsiders: Jessica Mitford |url=http://johnpilger.com/videos/the-outsiders-jessica-mitford |website=johnpilger.com |accessdate=23 August 2020}}</ref>

In 1956, Mitford published a pamphlet, "Lifeitselfmanship or How to Become a Precisely-Because Man". In response to ''[[Noblesse Oblige (book)|Noblesse Oblige]]'', the book her sister [[Nancy Mitford|Nancy]] co-wrote and edited on the class distinctions in [[British English]], popularising the phrases "[[U and non-U English]]" (upper class and non-upper class), Jessica described L and non-L (Left and non-Left) English, mocking the clichés used by her comrades in the all-out [[class struggle]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Severo | first = Richard | date = 23 July 1996 | title = Jessica Mitford, Mordant Critic of American Ways, and a British Upbringing, Dies at 78 | work = The New York Times | publisher = Jessica Mitford Memorial Site | url = http://www.mitford.org/nytimes.htm | accessdate = 28 October 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012232315/http://www.mitford.org/nytimes.htm | archive-date = 12 October 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Cohen | first = Nick | author-link = Nick Cohen | date = 20 August 2001 | title = Do you speak New Labour? | work = [[New Statesman]] | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200108200009 | accessdate = 28 October 2007}}</ref>  (The title alludes to [[Stephen Potter]]'s satirical series of books that included ''Lifemanship''.)

Disillusioned by the revelations of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[crimes against humanity]] in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 [[Secret Speech]], Mitford and Treuhaft resigned from the American Communist Party in 1958.<ref name="Mitford1977">{{cite book|last=Mitford|first=Jessica |title=A Fine Old Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mpy2AAAACAAJ|year=1977|publisher=M. Joseph|isbn=978-0-7181-1617-0|page=279}}</ref>

In 1960, Mitford published her first book ''Hons and Rebels'' (US title: ''Daughters and Rebels''), a memoir covering her youth in the Mitford household.

===Investigative journalism===
In May 1961, Mitford travelled to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], while working on an article about [[Southern United States|Southern]] attitudes for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. While there, she and a friend went to meet the arrival of a group of [[Freedom Riders]] and became caught up in a riot when a mob, led by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], attacked the civil rights activists. After the riot, Mitford proceeded to a rally led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] The church at which this was held was also attacked by the Klan, and Mitford and the group spent the night barricaded inside until the siege was ended by the arrival of [[Alabama National Guard]] troops.

Through his work with unions and death benefits, Treuhaft became interested in the funeral industry and persuaded Mitford to write an investigative article on the subject. Though the article, "[[Saint Peter]] Don't You Call Me" published in ''Frontier'' magazine, was not widely disseminated, it caught considerable attention when Mitford appeared on a local television broadcast with two industry representatives. Convinced of public interest, she wrote ''[[The American Way of Death]]'', which was published in 1963. In the book, Mitford harshly criticised the industry for using unscrupulous business practices to take advantage of grieving families. The book became a major best-seller and led to Congressional hearings on the funeral industry. The book was one of the inspirations for filmmaker [[Tony Richardson]]'s 1965 film ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'', which was based on  [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s short satirical 1948 [[The Loved One|novel of the same name]],<ref name="Hill2010">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Lee |title=A Grand Guy: The Art And Life of Terry Southern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzJtFBXwBsEC&pg=PA135|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-201283-8|page=135}}</ref> tellingly subtitled "An Anglo-American Tragedy".

After ''The American Way of Death'', Mitford continued with her [[investigative journalism]]. In 1970, she published an article in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', "Let Us Now Appraise Famous Writers", an exposé of the [[Famous Writers School]], a [[correspondence course]] of questionable business practices founded by [[Bennett Cerf]]. She published ''The Trial of [[Dr. Spock]], the Rev. [[William Sloane Coffin]], Jr., [[Michael Ferber]], [[Mitchell Goodman]] and [[Marcus Raskin]]'', an account of the five men's 1970 trial on charges of conspiracy to violate the [[conscription|draft laws]], followed by a harsh critique of the American prison system entitled ''Kind and Usual Punishment: The Prison Business'' (1973), an allusion to the phrase "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]".

Mitford was a distinguished professor for the one semester in 1973 at [[San Jose State University]], where she taught a course called "The American Way" that covered the [[Watergate scandal]] and the [[McCarthy era]]. Because of disagreements with the dean over her taking a [[loyalty oath]] and submitting to fingerprinting, the campus was thrown into protests and she was forced to go to court to remain able to teach.<ref name="Mitford 1974">{{cite web | last=Mitford | first=Jessica | title=My Short and Happy Life As a Distinguished Professor | website=The Atlantic | date=1 October 1974 | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1974/10/my-short-and-happy-life-as-a-distinguished-professor/5320/ | accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>

===Books and music===
[[File:Jessica Mitford appearing on "After Dark, 20 August 1988.jpg|thumb|Mitford appearing on British TV show ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' in 1988]]

Mitford's second memoir, ''A Fine Old Conflict'' (1977), comically describes her experiences joining and eventually leaving the Communist Party USA. Mitford titled the book after what, in her youth, she [[Mondegreen|thought were the lyrics]] to the Communist anthem, "[[The Internationale]]", which actually are "Tis the '''final''' conflict". Mitford recounts how she was invited to join the Communist Party by her co-worker Dobby, to whom she responded "We thought you'd never ask!"  She bristled against the conservative structure in the CP, at one point upsetting the women's caucus by printing a poster with "Girls! Girls! Girls!" to draw people to an event. She mercilessly teased an elder Communist about what she perceived as his paranoia when he wrote out the name of a town where she could get chickens donated from "loyal party members" for a fund raiser. When he wrote [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] on a scrap of paper to avoid being overheard by possible bugs, she asked in jest how the chickens should be prepared, and wrote, "Fried or broiled".

In addition to writing and activism, Mitford tried her hand at music as singer for "Decca and the Dectones," a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] and [[kazoo]] orchestra. She performed at numerous benefits and opened for [[Cyndi Lauper]] on the roof of the [[Virgin Records]] store in [[San Francisco]]. She recorded two short albums: one<ref>[http://cdbaby.com/cd/mitford CD Baby: JESSICA MITFORD: Decca and the Dectones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> contains her rendition of "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]" and "[[Grace Darling]]",<ref>Patricia Holt, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/02/26/RV22908.DTL "Jessica Mitford Does the Beatles"], ''SF Gate'', 2 February 1995.</ref> and the other, two duets with friend and poet [[Maya Angelou]].<ref>[http://www.dqydj.com/prod2.htm "Maya Angelou & Jessica Mitford: 'There Is a Moral to It All'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802200919/http://www.dqydj.com/prod2.htm |date=2 August 2014 }}, "Don't Quit Your Day Job" Records.</ref> Her last work was an update entitled ''The American Way of Death Revisited''.

==Death==
Mitford died of [[lung cancer]] aged 78. In keeping with her wishes, she had an inexpensive funeral, costing $533.31 – she was cremated without a ceremony, her ashes scattered at sea, the cremation itself costing $475.<ref name="redsheep" /><ref>An expensive way to go. (The Business of Bereavement), ''[[The Economist]]'' (US edition), 4 January 1997.</ref> At the time of her death, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' [[columnist]] [[Herb Caen]] wrote "In this strangely flat era of 'diversity,' she was the rarest of birds, an exotic creature who rose each morning to become the sun around whom thousands of lives revolved." <ref>Herb Caen, [http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/HERB-CAEN-The-Mourning-Fog-2973275.php "The Mourning Fog"], ''SF Gate'', 26 July 1996</ref>

Her widower survived her by five years.

==Descendants==
Two of her four children pre-deceased her.

Her surviving daughter, Constancia Romilly, continued the activist tradition, working for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which campaigned for African-American civil rights; she eventually became an [[emergency room]] nurse. Romilly had two children with Committee director [[James Forman]]: [[James Forman Jr.]], a [[Yale University|Yale]] professor and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author, and Chaka Forman, an actor.

==Legacy and influence==
[[John Pilger]], who had interviewed Mitford in 1983 for his series ''Outsiders'', said she "combined a finely honed social conscience and a wonderful gallows humour. She inverted stereotypes. I liked her enormously".<ref name="outsiders" />
 
The author [[Christopher Hitchens]] expressed his admiration for Jessica Mitford and praised ''Hons and Rebels''.<ref>{{YouTube|_fZj6ydAk7k|"Christopher Hitchens interviews Jessica Mitford (1988)"}}</ref>

[[J. K. Rowling]], author of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, stated in 2002:

{{quote|My most influential writer, without a doubt, is Jessica Mitford. When my grand-aunt gave me ''Hons and Rebels'' when I was 14, she instantly became my heroine. She ran away from home to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]], taking with her a camera that she had charged to her father's account. I wished I'd had the nerve to do something like that. I love the way she never outgrew some of her adolescent traits, remaining true to her politics &mdash; she was a self-taught socialist &mdash; throughout her life. I think I've read everything she wrote. I even called my daughter Jessica Rowling Arantes after her.<ref>Fraser, Lindsay, [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2002/1102-fraser-scotsman.html "Harry Potter - Harry and me"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205213016/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2002/1102-fraser-scotsman.html |date= 5 February 2012 }}, ''The Scotsman'', November 2002.<!--"'Accio Quote!', the Largest Archive of J.K.

Rowling reviewed Mitford's book of letters, ''Decca'', in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' in 2006.<ref>J. K. Rowling, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3656769/The-first-It-Girl.html "The first It Girl"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 26 November 2006.</ref>
