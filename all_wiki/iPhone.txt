{{iPhone models}}
The '''iPhone''' is a line of [[touchscreen]]-based [[smartphone]]s designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] that use Apple's [[iOS]] [[mobile operating system]]. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was announced by Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] on January 9, 2007. Since then Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.

The iPhone's [[user interface]] is built around a [[multi-touch]] screen with a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone connects to [[cellular network]]s or [[Wi-Fi]], and can make calls, [[web browser|browse the web]], [[camera phone|take pictures]], [[portable media player|play music]] and send and receive [[email]]s and [[text messaging|text messages]]. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger screen sizes, [[video camera|shooting video]], [[waterproofing]] and the ability to install third-party [[mobile app]]s through an [[app store]], as well as [[Computer accessibility|accessibility support]]. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to the [[Springboard (iPhone)|home screen]]. Since 2017, more expensive iPhone models have switched to a nearly [[Screen bezel|bezel-less]] front screen design with app switching activated by [[gesture recognition]].

The first-generation iPhone was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have also garnered praise. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and [[slate phone|slate form factor]], and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or "[[Mobile app development|app economy]]". {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications for the iPhone.

The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone [[Computing platform|platforms]] in the world alongside [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android]], forming a large part of the [[Luxury goods|luxury market]]. The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|most valuable publicly traded companies]].

For the eight largest phone manufacturers in Q1 2012, according to [[Horace Dediu]] at Asymco, Apple and Samsung combined to take 99% of industry profits (HTC took the remaining 1%, while RIM, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Nokia all suffered losses), with Apple earning 73 cents out of every dollar earned by the phone makers.

The continued top popularity of the iPhone despite growing Android competition was also attributed to Apple being able to deliver [[iOS]] updates over the air, while [[Android (operating system)|Android]] updates are frequently impeded by carrier testing requirements and hardware tailoring, forcing consumers to purchase a new Android smartphone to get the latest version of that OS.<ref>{{cite web |first=Natasha |last=Lomas |title=iPhone Brand Outshines Samsung's Galaxy As iPhone 5 Becomes Best-Selling Smartphone Globally In Q4, iPhone 4S 2nd – Analyst |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/iphone-brand-outshines-samsungs-galaxy-as-iphone-5-becomes-best-selling-smartphone-globally-in-q4-iphone-4s-2nd-analyst/ |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=February 20, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> However, by 2013, Apple's market share had fallen to 13.1%, due to the surging popularity of the Android offerings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple's smartphone market share slips |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/07/26/apples-smartphone-market-share-slips/2589047/ |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 26, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

Apple announced on September 1, 2013, that its iPhone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the US. For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive a credit to be used at a later date. A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple Rolls Out iPhone Trade-In Program Nationwide|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/30/apple-iphone-trade-ins/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|access-date=September 1, 2013|last=Fiegerman|first=Seth|date=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

An [[Apple Store]] located at the [[Christiana Mall]] in [[Newark, Delaware]], claimed the highest iPhones sales figures in November 2013.

=== iPhone Upgrade Program ===
The iPhone Upgrade Program is a 24-month program designed for consumers to be able to get the latest iPhone every year, without paying the whole price up-front. The program consists of "low monthly payments", where consumers will gradually pay for the iPhone they have over a 24-month period, with an opportunity to switch (upgrade) to the new iPhone after 12 months of payment have passed. Once 12 months have passed, consumers can trade their current iPhone with a new one, and the payments are transferred from the old device to the new device, and the program "restarts" with a new 24-month period.<ref name="iPhone Upgrade Program"/>

Additional features of the program include unlocked handsets, which means consumers are free to pick the network carrier they want, and two-year AppleCare+ protection, which includes "hardware repairs, software support, and coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage".<ref name="iPhone Upgrade Program">{{cite web |title=iPhone Upgrade Program |url=https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |access-date=November 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Cole | first=Lauren Lyons | title=Apple's iPhone X starts at $999 — and there's a smarter way to buy it | work=Business Insider | date=October 26, 2017 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-upgrade-program-2017-8 | access-date=December 31, 2017}}</ref>

Criticism of the program includes the potential endless cycle of payments, with ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Damon Beres writing, "Complete the full 24-month payment cycle, and you're stuck with an outdated phone. Upgrade every 12 months, and you'll never stop owing Apple money for iPhones". Additionally, the program is limited to just the iPhone hardware; cell phone service from a network operator is not included.<ref>{{cite web |first=Damon |last=Beres |title=Apple Could Trap You Forever With Its New 'Upgrade Program' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-upgrade-plan-trap_us_55f719cfe4b063ecbfa52b95 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=November 28, 2016}}</ref>

Apple's marketing, building on successful iPod campaigns, helped the phone become a mass-market product with many buyers on launch day. Some market research has found that, compared to other products, a greater proportion of iPhone users are female.<ref name="Women more likely to own an iPhone than men">{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Rhiannon|title=Women more likely to own an iPhone than men|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/11335574/Women-more-likely-to-own-an-iPhone-than-men.html|website=Daily Telegraph|access-date=August 15, 2015|location=London|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> In 2012, ''[[Ars Technica]]'' wrote that Apple had avoided the kind of "patronizing" marketing that competitors used to sell low-quality, high-priced products to women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Johnston |title=Does this smartphone make me look stupid?

The dominant mobile operating systems at the time such as [[Symbian]], [[BlackBerry OS]], and [[Windows Mobile]] were not designed to handle tasks beyond communication and basic functions. These operating systems never focused on applications and developers, and due to infighting among manufacturers as well as the complexity of developing on their low-memory hardware, they never developed a thriving ecosystem like Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]]'s [[Google Play]].<ref name="Symbian_collapse"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Streitfeld|first=David|title=As Boom Lures App Creators, Tough Part Is Making a Living|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html|access-date=April 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> [[iPhone OS]] (renamed iOS in 2010) was designed with capabilities such as multitasking and graphics to meet future consumer demands.<ref name="theglobeandmail.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rims-long-road-to-reinvent-the-blackberry/article7901031/ |title=RIM's long road to reinvent the BlackBerry |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=June 13, 2013 |location=Toronto |date=January 28, 2013}}</ref> Many services were provided by mobile carriers, who often extensively customized devices.

Before the iPhone, "Handsets were viewed largely as cheap, disposable lures, massively subsidized to snare subscribers and lock them into using the carriers' proprietary services."  However, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' wrote, "Apple retained complete control over the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the iPhone", meaning that it and not the carrier would control the software updates, and by extension security patches.  By contrast, Google has allowed carriers and OEMs to dictate the "pace of upgrades and pre-load phones with their own software on top of [[Android (operating system)|Android]]". As a result, many Android OEMs often lag months behind Google's release of the next iteration of Android; although Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed two years of operating system updates and a third additional year for security. However, Apple has supported older iterations of iPhones for over four years.<ref name="arstechnica.com"/> Some of the newer generations of iPhone have hit six years of support.<ref>{{Cite web|title=These Are the iPhones That Can Upgrade to iOS 14|url=https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/these-are-iphones-can-upgrade-ios-14-0315141/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Gadget Hacks|language=en}}</ref>

==Production==
Up to the [[iPhone 4]], all iPhone models, as well as other [[iOS device]]s were manufactured exclusively by [[Foxconn]], based in [[Taiwan]]. In 2011, after [[Tim Cook]] became CEO of the company, Apple changed its outsourcing strategy, for the first time increasing its supply partners. The [[iPhone 4s]] in 2012 was the first model which was manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn as well as [[Pegatron]], also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn is still responsible for the larger share of production, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased, with the company being tasked with producing a part of the [[iPhone 5C]] line in 2013, and 30% of the [[iPhone 6]] devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model is being produced solely by Foxconn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taiwan's Pegatron to get most iPhone 6S orders in 2015: brokerage|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201412020006.aspx|publisher=Focus Taiwan|access-date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> In 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones, and that Apple was investigating the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/18/iphones-made-from-rejected-parts/|title=$43M fraud by Foxconn managers selling iPhones made from rejected parts|first=Ben|last=Lovejoy|date=December 18, 2019|website=9to5Mac}}</ref>

===Screen and input===
The [[touchscreen]] on the first five generations is a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|-1}} [[liquid crystal display]] with scratch-resistant glass; The one on the iPhone 5, 5C, 5S, and first generation SE is {{convert|4|in|mm}};  The size of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 8, and second generation SE is {{convert|4.7|in|mm}}; the iPhone 6 Plus, 6S Plus, 7 Plus, and 8 Plus is {{convert|5.5|in|mm}}; The iPhone X, XS, and 11 Pro with {{convert|5.8|in|mm}}; The iPhone XR, and 11 with {{convert|6.1|in|mm}}; and the iPhone XS Max and 11 Pro Max with {{convert|6.5|in|mm}}.<ref name="jun18PressRelease" /> The [[capacitive touchscreen]] is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for [[multi-touch]] sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320×480 ([[HVGA]]) at 163&nbsp;[[pixel density|ppi]]; those on the [[iPhone 4]] and [[iPhone 4S]] have a resolution of 640×960 at 326&nbsp;ppi; the {{convert|4|in|mm}} models, with 640×1136 at 326&nbsp;ppi; the {{convert|4.7|in|mm}} models, with 750×1334 at 326&nbsp;ppi; the {{convert|5.5|in|mm}} models, with 1080×1920 at 401&nbsp;ppi; and the {{convert|5.8|in|mm}} model X, with 1125×2436 at 458&nbsp;ppi. The initial models were using [[twisted nematic|twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs]]. Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to [[IPS panel|in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs]]. The iPhone 5 model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9. The [[iPhone X]] is the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] display. It has a near bezel-less screen with a ≈19.5:9 aspect ratio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/specs/|title=iPhone X – Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>

[[File:Iphone back.jpg|thumb|The backs of a gold [[iPhone 6S]], a silver [[iPhone 6 Plus]], and a rose gold iPhone 6S.]]

The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, with most models featuring five [[Push-button|buttons]]. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display and is called the "Home button" because its primary function is to close the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. Earlier models included a [[Squircle|rounded square]], reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen, however, new models which include Apple's [[fingerprint recognition]] feature [[Touch ID]] (which use the Home button as the fingerprint sensor) have no symbol. The [[iPhone X]] and later with the exception of the [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)]] don't have a Home button but instead [[Face ID]], a facial recognition authentication method.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=iPhone X: new Apple smartphone dumps home button for all-screen design|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/iphone-x-release-date-apple-home-button-screen|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=September 12, 2017|date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

A multi-function sleep/wake button is located on top of the device on earlier models. In the newer models starting with the iPhone 6, it is on right of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls [[#Phone|phone calls]]. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.

Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.<ref>[http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308105745/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf |date=March 8, 2012 }}.

Since the iPhone 3G generation, the iPhone employs [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] operated by the United States. Since the iPhone 4S generation the device also supports the [[GLONASS]] global positioning system, which is operated by Russia. Since the iPhone 8 it supports [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://galileognss.eu/is-your-phone-using-galileo/|title=Is your phone using Galileo? {{!}} GALILEO|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref>

The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, introduced in 2015, feature [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] displays which allow the screen to recognize how hard it is being pressed using pressure-sensitive multi-touch technology.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Betters |first1=Elyse |title=What is Force Touch?

Haptic Touch retains some of 3D Touch's features but cannot detect pressure, as the display lacks integrated capacitive sensors.

===Sensors===
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2017}}
iPhones feature a number of sensors, which are used to adjust the screen based on operating conditions, enable motion-controlled games, [[location-based service]]s, unlock the phone, and authenticate purchases with [[Apple Pay]], among many other things.

====Proximity sensor====
A [[proximity sensor]] deactivates the display and [[touchscreen]] when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-proximity-sensor-iphone|title=How to fix or reset the proximity sensor on your iPhone if it's not working properly|last=John|first=Steven|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-11-13|date=August 20, 2019}}</ref>

====Ambient light sensor====
An [[photodetector|ambient light sensor]] adjusts the display brightness which saves battery power and prevents the screen from being too bright or too dark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/sensors-that-make-iphone-so-cool-2000370|title=All About the Sensors That Make the iPhone So Cool|last=Costello|first=Sam|date=12 September 2019|website=Lifewire|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

====Accelerometer====
A 3-axis [[accelerometer]] senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between [[page orientation|portrait and landscape]] mode.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input (generally for [[undo]] functionality).<ref name="3.0 official" /><ref name="3.0 Macworld" /> The accelerometer can also be used to control [[#Third-party applications|third-party apps]], notably games. It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a [[pedometer]]. Starting with the iPhone 5S, this functionality was included in the M7 [[Motion coprocessor]] and subsequent revisions of the embedded chip.

====Magnetometer====
A [[magnetometer]] is built-in since the iPhone 3GS, which is used to measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device. Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re-calibrate by moving the device in a figure-eight motion. Since the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone also features a Compass app, which was unique at time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field.

====Gyroscopic sensor====
Beginning with the iPhone 4, Apple's smartphones also include a [[vibrating structure gyroscope|gyroscopic sensor]], enhancing its perception of how it is moved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/all-the-sensors-in-your-smartphone-and-how-they-work-1797121002|title=All the Sensors in Your Smartphone, and How They Work|website=Gizmodo|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

==== Radio ====
Some previous iPhone models contained a chip capable of receiving [[radio|radio signals]];<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/phones-fm-chips-radio-smartphone/|title=Your Phone Has an FM Chip.

==== Fingerprint sensor ====
Until 2017, iPhone models starting from [[iPhone 5S]] (excluding the [[iPhone 5C]]) featured Apple's [[fingerprint recognition]] sensor. It is used for unlocking the device and authenticating Apple Pay purchases (since the [[iPhone 6]]) using [[Touch ID]]. It is located in the home button. Touch ID has been replaced by Face ID (excluding the [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)]]), starting with the [[iPhone X]].

==== Barometer ====
Included on the [[iPhone 6]] and later (excluding the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)]]), a [[barometer]] is used to determine air pressure, and elevation from the device.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonetricks.org/iphone-6-barometer-sensor-features/|title=iPhone 6 Barometer Sensor Features {{!}} iPhoneTricks.org|website=www.iphonetricks.org|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref>

==== Facial recognition sensor ====
Starting with the [[iPhone X]], a [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] sensor, named the TrueDepth camera system, is featured. It is used for unlocking the device and for authenticating purchases using [[Face ID]]. It can also be used for [[Animoji]]s and [[augmented reality|AR]].

===Audio and output===

===Battery===
[[File:IPhone Internals.jpg|thumb|Replacing the battery requires disassembling the iPhone unit and exposing the internal hardware]]

Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or "wall charger", also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC outlet]]. Some models of the iPhone support wireless charging.<ref>{{cite web | title=How to wirelessly charge your iPhone X, iPhone 8, or iPhone 8 Plus | publisher=Apple Inc. | date=December 7, 2017 | url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208078 | access-date=2017-12-29}}</ref>

Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life. Apple's website says that the battery life "is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html|title=Batteries—iPhone|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=June 6, 2008}}</ref> which is comparable to iPod batteries.

Since [[iOS 10]].2.1, Apple has instituted a [[Batterygate|policy]] of employing "performance management" techniques (including [[Dynamic frequency scaling|CPU throttling]]) on iPhone devices whose batteries are degraded, in order to maintain device stability and prolong their lifespan. These changes came in the wake of reported issues with unexpected shutdowns on certain iPhone models following the release of iOS 10.1.1. In response to criticism over the practice, including concerns over this being a form of [[planned obsolescence]], Apple announced that it would offer discounted battery replacements for iPhone 6 and newer in 2018, and that it would add additional battery health information on a future version of iOS ([[iOS 11]].3, which also allows users to disable this throttling).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-slowing-down-older-iphones-to-prevent-battery-issues/|title=Apple: Some older iPhones slowed to prevent battery issues|last=Smith|first=Jake|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref name="verge-iosreplacement">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology|title=Apple apologizes for iPhone slowdown drama, will offer $29 battery replacements for a year|last=Patel|first=Nilay|date=December 27, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=September 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16984234/how-to-iphone-throttling-ios-11-3|title=How to turn off iPhone throttling in iOS 11.3|last=Byford|first=Sam|date=2018-02-07|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>

These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the first generation iPhone has been [[solder]]ed in.

A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets' power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.<ref>{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/ |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=July 25, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

The iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max introduced an [[Wide-angle lens|ultrawide]] lens; the latter two became the first triple-camera iPhones. The 11 has a dual-lens setup, lacking the telephoto lens of the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. The front camera is now capable of recording video at 4K as a result of a new 12 MP sensor, and can also capture slow-motion footage.

The second-generation iPhone SE's camera hardware is the same as the iPhone 8, but adds Portrait mode, Portrait lighting, Smart HDR, extended dynamic range for video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization.

===SIM card===
[[File:IPhone sim slot.jpg|thumb|An iPhone 5S with the SIM slot open. The SIM ejector is still placed in the eject hole.]]

[[GSM]] models of the iPhone use a [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a [[paper clip]] or the "SIM ejector tool" (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS in the United States and with all models elsewhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1438|title=Removing SIM card|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 10, 2008|access-date=June 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|title=iPhone 3G's New SIM Ejector Tool Makes It Instant Must-Buy|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=June 9, 2008|url=https://gizmodo.com/5014767/iphone-3gs-new-sim-ejector-tool-makes-it-instant-must+buy|access-date=June 24, 2008}}</ref> Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed "[[Liquidmetal]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Neil|title=Liquidmetal created SIM ejector tool for Apple's iPhone, iPad|work=AppleInsider|date=August 17, 2010|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/08/17/liquidmetal_created_sim_ejector_tool_for_apples_iphone_ipad.html|access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref> In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a [[#SIM unlocking|SIM lock]], which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network.<ref name="Carrier unlocking list">{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204039|title=Wireless carrier support and features for iPhone|date=December 23, 2016|publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=January 28, 2017}}</ref>

The [[GSM]] iPhone 4 features a [[MicroSIM]] card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.<ref>{{cite web|author=Apple Inc.|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html|title=iPhone 4&nbsp;– Size, weight, battery life, and other specs|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=June 23, 2010}}</ref>

The [[CDMA]] model of the iPhone 4, just the same as any other CDMA-only cell phone, does not use a SIM card or have a SIM card slot.

An iPhone 4S activated on a CDMA carrier, however, does have a SIM card slot but does not rely on a SIM card for activation on that CDMA network. A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only. The SIM slot is locked to only use the roaming SIM card provided by the CDMA carrier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slivka|first=Eric|title=Sprint Offers Clarification on iPhone 4S International Micro-SIM Unlocking|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/13/sprint-offers-clarification-on-iphone-4s-international-micro-sim-unlocking/|work=MacRumors|access-date=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

In the case of Verizon, for example, one can request that the SIM slot be unlocked for international use by calling their support number and requesting an international unlock if their account has been in good standing for the past 60 days.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Matthew|title=International travelers: Here is how to SIM unlock your Verizon Apple iPhone 4S|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/cell-phones/international-travelers-here-is-how-to-sim-unlock-your-verizon-apple-iphone-4s/6712|publisher=ZDNet|access-date=July 13, 2012}}</ref> This method only unlocks the iPhone 4S for use on international carriers. An iPhone 4S that has been unlocked in this way will reject any non-international SIM cards (AT&T Mobility or T-Mobile USA, for example).

The iPhone 5 and later iPhones use [[Subscriber identity module#Formats|nano-SIM]] in order to save space internally. The iPhone XS and later iPhones added [[eSIM]] support in addition to nano-SIM, therefore they support Dual SIM functionality.

===Liquid contact indicators===
All iPhones (as well as many other devices by Apple) have a small disc at the bottom of the headphone [[jack (connector)|jack]] that changes from white to red on contact with water; the iPhone 3G and later models also have a similar indicator at the bottom of the [[dock connector]].<ref>{{cite web|title=iPhone and iPod: Liquid damage is not covered by warranty|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=August 27, 2010|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3302?viewlocale=en_US|access-date=December 25, 2010}}</ref> Because Apple warranties do not cover water damage, employees examine the indicators before approving [[AppleCare|warranty repair or replacement]].  However, with the adoption of water resistance as a feature of the iPhone, this practice is no longer in use by Apple.

The iPhone's indicators are more exposed than those in some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover. These indicators can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat,<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Martin |title=Sweaty workouts killing iPhones? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/sweaty-workouts-killing-iphones/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=April 19, 2009 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Respers|first=Lisa|title=Moisture, cold irritate some smart phone users|publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2009|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/14/smart.phones.buggy/index.html|access-date=November 5, 2009}}</ref> Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/09/apple-amends-internal-ipod-water-damage-policy/|title=Apple Amends Internal iPod Water Damage Policy|last=Epstein|first=Zach|date=November 9, 2010|work=Boy Genius Report|access-date=January 7, 2011}}</ref>

===Included items===
[[File:IPhone 4 box no lid.JPG|thumb|The contents of the box of an iPhone 4. From left to right: iPhone 4 in plastic holder, written documentation, and (top to bottom) headset, USB cable, wall charger.]]
All [[iPhone models]] include written documentation, and a [[dock connector]] to [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable. The first generation and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The first generation iPhone includes a stereo [[Headset (audio)|headset]] ([[headphones|earbuds]] and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone [[IPhone 3G|3G]] includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the first generation model requires a [[Paper clip|paperclip]]). The iPhone [[IPhone 3GS|3GS]] includes the [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions).<ref name="Earbuds with volume" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MB770G/B?fnode=MTY1NDA1MA&mco=MTM3NTMyNDQ|title=Apple&nbsp;Earphones&nbsp;with&nbsp;Remote&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mic|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>

=== Payments ===
{{Main|Apple Pay}}
In September 2014, with the launch of the [[iPhone 6]], Apple announced [[Apple Pay]], a mobile payment system. The feature, aimed to "revolutionize" the way users pay, uses an [[Near field communication|NFC]] chip, [[Touch ID]] fingerprint scanner ([[Face ID]] on iPhone X and later), Apple's [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]] app, and a dedicated "Secure Element" chip for encrypted payment information to make purchases at participating stores, both physical and online.<ref>{{cite web |first=Adrianne |last=Jeffries |title=Apple Pay allows you to pay at the counter with your iPhone 6 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6084211/apple-pay-iphone-6-nfc-mobile-payment |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 9, 2014 |access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref>

===Taptic Engine===
All iPhone models have a haptic engine to vibrate when a notification or alert, incoming call, etc. iPhone models before the iPhone 4S use an eccentric rotating mass motor. The iPhone 4S uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator, which usually uses less power and creates a quieter vibration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ye |first1=Shen |title=The science behind Force Touch and the Taptic Engine |url=https://www.imore.com/science-behind-taptics-and-force-touch |website=iMore |access-date=November 19, 2018 |date=April 8, 2015 }}</ref> However, the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S uses an eccentric rotating mass motor. It is unsure as to why Apple decided to switch back. However, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator.

iPhone 6S and after uses taptic engine for vibration and haptic feedback, which works similar to the eccentric rotating mass motor.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wuerthele |first1=Mike |title=Inside the iPhone 7: Apple's Taptic Engine, explained |url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/27/inside-the-iphone-7-apples-taptic-engine-explained |website=AppleInsider}}</ref>

===Interface===
The [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time. Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.<ref>applications</ref> However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models, with the exception of the second-generation iPhone SE, instead use touch-based gestures.

The original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iPhone OS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iPhone OS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduced Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduced Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.

Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|access-date=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create "Web Clips", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name="Update 1.1.3">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archive-date=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 3GS|3GS]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update added a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name="3.0 official"/><ref name="3.0 Macworld"/>

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]".

Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a "down" control to move the view "downwards", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a "plank of wood floating on the water", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name="Siracusa Frontier">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Apple's Mousetrap">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|access-date=August 1, 2017}}</ref>

Other [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.

===Phone===
[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]
The iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out and fades back in when the call has ended.

The [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support [[Videophone|video calling]] or [[videoconferencing]] on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Donald |last=Melanson |title=Mirror-based video conferencing developed for iPhone |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/13/mirror-based-video-conferencing-developed-for-iphone/ |work=[[Engadget]] |date=August 13, 2007 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.

A music [[ringtone]] feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be three to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or [[infinite loop|loop continuously]]. All customizing can be done in iTunes,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/09/05itunes.html|title=Apple Unveils the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store|date=November 5, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=May 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423162242/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/09/05itunes.html|archive-date=April 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> or with Apple's [[GarageBand]] software 4.1.1 or later (available only on [[Mac OS X]])<ref name=GarageBand1>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307108|title=How to create custom ringtones in GarageBand 4.1.1|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=December 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215060626/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307108|archive-date=December 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> or third-party tools.<ref name="third party ringtones">{{cite news|last=Gilbertson|first=Scott|title=How to Make Custom IPhone Ringtones Without Paying Apple $2|url=https://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092956/http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2008|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=September 12, 2007|access-date=March 8, 2008}}</ref>

With the release of [[iOS 6]], which was released on September 19, 2012, Apple added features that enable the user to have options to decline a phone call when a person is calling them. The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|title=iOS 6 Preview|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=June 11, 2012}}</ref>

===Multimedia===
The layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]]. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.

Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name="Voice_Control"/>

The iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |title=What is Gapless Playback? |access-date=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.

The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but since 2012, it can be used on a cellular data network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#thu-27-wifi|title=The Reason It's Called the Wi-Fi Music Store|date=September 30, 2007|access-date=January 6, 2008|first=John|last=Gruber|work=[[Daring Fireball]]|author-link=John Gruber }}</ref>

The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows PC.

The iPhone did not support [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recording]] until the 3.0 software update.<ref name="3.0 official"/><ref name="3.0 Macworld"/>

===Internet connectivity===
[[File:Safari on iOS 12 iPhone X Landscape.png|thumb|Wikipedia on the iPhone [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]] in landscape mode]]

Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area [[Wi-Fi]] or a wide area [[GSM]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] network, both second-generation ([[2G]]) wireless data standards.

By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered [[Wi-Fi]] networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306249|title=iPhone: About Connections Settings|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019015540/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306249|archive-date=October 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305711|title=iPhone: Connecting to the Internet with EDGE or Wi-Fi|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011042909/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305711|archive-date=October 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, the iPhone 3G and onwards prefer [[3G]] to [[2G]], and Wi-Fi to either.<ref name="3GSpeeds">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/wireless.html|title=Apple – iPhone&nbsp;– Features&nbsp;– 3G|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=December 14, 2008}}</ref>

Wi-Fi, [[Bluetooth]], and 3G (on the iPhone 3G onwards) can all be deactivated individually. [[Airplane mode]] disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.

Safari is the iPhone's native [[web browser]], and it displays pages similar to its Mac and Windows counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899|title=iPhone: Zooming In to See a Page More easily|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225113959/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899|archive-date=December 25, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://solution.allthingsd.com/20070626/the-iphone-is-breakthrough-handheld-computer/|title=The iPhone Is a Breakthrough Handheld Computer|author=Walter S.

The iPhone does not support [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], which was still popular when the iPhone was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chartier|first=David|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/12/its-official-no-flash-support-on-the-iphone-yet/|title=It's official: No Flash support on the iPhone (yet)|publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|date=June 12, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008}}</ref> Consequently, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|UK's Advertising Standards Authority]] adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access "all parts of the internet" should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of [[false advertising]]. In a [[Thoughts on Flash|rare public letter]] in April 2010, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and [[iPad]]).<ref name="Thoughts on Flash">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/|title=Thoughts on Flash|last=Jobs|first=Steve|date=April 2010|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> The iPhone supports [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[HTML]] [[Canvas element|Canvas]], and [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Wilson |title=iPhone OS 2.0 will include Bonjour, full-screen Safari mode, more |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-os-2-0-will-include-bonjour-full-screen-safari-mode-more/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=December 5, 2008 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> [[Google Chrome]] was introduced to the iOS on June 26, 2012, and Opera mini is also available.

The Maps application can access [[Google Maps]] in map, [[satellite imagery|satellite]], or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby [[Starbucks]] locations and then placing a [[prank call]] to one with a single tap.<ref name="keynoteMacworld">{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Peter|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php|title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update|work=Macworld|date=January 9, 2007|access-date=February 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |author-link=Ryan Block |title=Live from Macworld 2007: Steve Jobs keynote |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/ |work=[[Engadget]] |date=January 9, 2007 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> Support for walking directions, public transit, and [[Google Street View|street view]] was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.<ref name="2.2" />

iPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places.

With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using the internet while on the phone was brought to the public's attention. Under the two U.S. carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on AT&T networks, whereas Verizon networks only support the use of each separately.<ref name="TUAW">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-cant-handle-data-and-voice-simultaneously|title=Verizon iPhone Can't Handle Data and Voice Simultaneously|last=Sande|first=Steven|date=January 11, 2011|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog }}</ref>

===Text input===
[[File:IPhone keyboard unblurred.jpg|thumb|The [[virtual keyboard]] on the first generation iPhone [[touchscreen]]]]

For text input, the iPhone implements a [[virtual keyboard]] on the touchscreen. It has automatic [[spell checker|spell checking]] and correction, [[Predictive text|predictive word]] capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.<ref name=hasAKeyboard>{{cite news|author-link=John Markoff|last=Markoff|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/technology/13phone.ready.html|title=That iPhone Has a Keyboard, but It's Not Mechanical|work=The New York Times|date=June 13, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008}}</ref>

The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in [[landscape mode]], which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a [[magnifying glass]], allowing users to place the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.<ref name="Keyboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#quickType-keyboard-language-support|title=Apple&nbsp;– iPhone&nbsp;– Features&nbsp;– Keyboard|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=December 15, 2008}}</ref>

Alternative characters with accents (for example, letters from the alphabets of other languages) and [[emoji]] can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for two seconds and selecting the alternative character from the popup.<ref name="KeyboardAlternateLetters">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/|title=Apple – iPhone – Tips and Tricks|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> The 3.0 update brought support for [[cut, copy, and paste|cut, copy, or pasting]] text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.<ref name="3.0 official" /><ref name="3.0 Macworld" /> On iPhone 4S and above, Siri allows dictation.

===Email and text messages===
The iPhone also features an email program that supports [[HTML email]], which enables the user to embed photos in an email message. [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs-3g.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612042413/http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs-3g.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 12, 2009 |title=Apple&nbsp;– iPhone&nbsp;– Technical Specifications |publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=June 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Yahoo!]] offers a free push-email service for the iPhone.

Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to [[iChat]]) under each recipient's name.

At [[Worldwide Developers Conference#WWDC 2007|WWDC 2007]] on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support [[third-party developer|third-party]] web applications using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.<ref name="Web apps">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html|title=iPhone to Support Third-Party Web 2.0 Applications|date=June 11, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=December 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230338/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html|archive-date=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's "Hot News" [[weblog]], announced that a [[software development kit]] (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hot News |url=https://www.apple.com/hotnews |website=Apple |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018221832/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/ |archive-date=October 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 9, 2017 }}</ref> The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |author-link=Ryan Block |title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/ |work=[[Engadget]] |date=March 6, 2008 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an "iPhone simulator". However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an [[Apple Developer Connection]] membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], of which they will receive a 70% share.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Quinn|title=Apple will open App Store in bid to boost iPhone sales|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-iphone10-2008jul10,0,3798678.story|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 10, 2008|access-date=July 10, 2008}}</ref>

Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iPhone OS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.<ref name=releasedate>{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G|quote=iPhone 2.0 software will be available on July 11 as a free software update via iTunes 7.7 or later for all iPhone customers|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=June 9, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501035135/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|archive-date=May 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/134502/2008/07/ipodtouch.html|title=Is the iPod touch 2.0 update worth $10?|last=Breen|first=Christopher|date=July 15, 2008|work=Macworld|access-date=May 16, 2009}}</ref>

Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution. Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example, [[I Am Rich]], a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user.<ref name="wsj_article">{{cite news|url=http://wsj.com/article/SB121842341491928977.html|title=IPhone Software Sales Take Off: Apple's Jobs|access-date=September 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108093119/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121842341491928977.html|archive-date=January 8, 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 11, 2008|first=Nick|last=Wingfield}} [http://justamp.blogspot.com/2008/08/iphone-software-sales-take-off-apples.html Alt URL]</ref> Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected [[Podcaster]], which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135527/2008/09/appstore.html|date=September 12, 2008|title=Podcasting app rejected from App Store|work=Macworld|access-date=January 23, 2009}}</ref> Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability.<ref name="2.2">{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137023/2008/11/iphone_22.html|title=Apple releases iPhone 2.2 update|last=Snell|first=Jason|date=November 21, 2008|work=Macworld|access-date=June 10, 2009}}</ref>

Starting with the iPhone 4S, Apple added an [[accessibility]] feature to optimize the function of the iPhone with [[hearing aid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202186|title=About Hearing Aid Compatibility (HAC) requirements for iPhone |publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>  Apple released a program of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201466|title=Use Made for iPhone hearing aids |publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref> These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience and allow the user to manage the hearing aid right from the iPhone. Made for iPhone hearing aids also feature [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT203990 Live Listen].

The [[Refreshable braille display|Braille Displays]] for the iOS program was announced by Apple coinciding with the release of the iPhone 3GS, [[iPad]] and [[IPod Touch (3rd generation)|iPod Touch (3rd Generation)]].  This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless braille displays that work with iOS out of the box. The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with [[VoiceOver]] without any additional software. iOS supports [[Braille|braille tables]] for more than 25 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/braille-display.html|title=Accessibility – iOS – Braille Displays |publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref>

With the release of iOS 9 for all iPhones, users have the ability to choose between two different screen view options. The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.

AssistiveTouch helps to adapt the [[Multi-touch|Multi-Touch]] screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a [[wheelchair]].<ref name="Accessibility – iOS – Apple"/>

Guided Access helps people with [[autism]] or other [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention]] and [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory challenges]] stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.

In 2019 Apple began developing satellites so that the iPhone could skip wireless carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Axon |first1=Samuel |title=Report: Apple is developing satellites so the iPhone can skip wireless carriers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/report-apple-is-developing-satellites-so-the-iphone-can-skip-wireless-carriers/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |access-date=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>

==Restrictions==
{{see also|Hardware restrictions#Apple devices}}
Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. According to [[Jonathan Zittrain]], the emergence of [[Proprietary hardware|closed devices]] like the iPhone have made computing more [[proprietary software|proprietary]] than early versions of [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Braiker|title=A Killer Product: Will closed devices like Apple's iPhone murder the Web?|date=May 2, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/135150|access-date=June 16, 2009|quote=Through historical accident, we've ended up with a global network that pretty much allows anybody to communicate with anyone else at any time. Devices could be reprogrammed by them at any time, including code written by other people, so you don't have to be a nerd to get the benefits of reprogramming it. [But] this is a historical accident. Now, I see a movement away from that framework—even though it doesn't feel like a movement away. [For example,] an iPhone can only be changed by Steve Jobs or soon, with the software development kit, by programmers that he personally approves that go through his iPhone apps store. Or whimsical applications that run on the Facebook platform or the new Google apps. These are controllable by their vendors in ways that Bill Gates never dreamed of controlling Windows applications. [...] That's the ironic thing. Bill Gates is Mr. Proprietary. But for my purposes, even under the standard Windows operating system from 1990, 1991, you write the code, you can hand it to somebody else and they can run it. Bill Gates has nothing to say about it. So it's funny to think that by moving in Steve Jobs's direction it actually ends up far more proprietary.}}</ref>

===Activation===
The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007, [[Jon Lech Johansen]] reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/|title=iPhone Independence Day|work=nanocr.eu|first=Jon Lech|last=Johansen|author-link=Jon Lech Johansen|date=July 3, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008}}</ref>

The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and [[iPod Touch]] users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide [[Web server#Overload causes|overload]] of Apple's [[server (computing)|servers]] on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as [[MobileMe]] were released.

===SIM unlocking===

====United States====
[[File:IPhone sim slot.jpg|thumb|[[iPhone 5S]] shown with the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] tray partially ejected and SIM ejector tool in the eject hole.]]

Most iPhones were and are still{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} sold with a [[SIM lock]], which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized [[GSM]] phones. Unlike most GSM phones, however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} per [[International Mobile Equipment Identity|IMEI]] and is set when the iPhone is activated.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to unlock your iPhone|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201328|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=Doesn't mention code or where locked/unlocked state is stored|date=December 2017}}

===Mexico===
In 2003, four years before the iPhone was officially introduced, the trademark iFone was registered in [[Mexico]] by a communications systems and services company, iFone.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/11/apple-losing-the-battle-over-the-iphone-brand-name-in-mexico|title=Apple Losing The Battle Over The iPhone Brand Name In Mexico|last=Author|first=AppAdvice Staff|date=2012-11-02|work=AppAdvice|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref> Apple tried to gain control over its brand name, but a Mexican court denied the request.

The [[Supreme Court (Mexico)|Supreme Court of Mexico]] upheld that iFone is the rightful owner and held that Apple iPhone is a trademark violation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mexican Supreme Court upholds iFone ruling|url=http://www.worldipreview.com/news/mexican-supreme-court-upholds-ifone-ruling|access-date=November 11, 2013|newspaper=WIPR|date=March 19, 2013}}{{Subscription required}}</ref>

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the brand IPHONE was registered in 2000 by the company then called Gradiente Eletrônica S.A., now IGB Eletrônica S.A. According to the filing, Gradiente foresaw the revolution in the convergence of voice and data over the Internet at the time.<ref name=reuters-2012>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/18/snippet-idUSL1E8NI2BR20121218|title=STXNEWS LATAM-Brazil's IGB says registered brand 'IPHONE' in Brazil-filing|date=December 18, 2012|agency=Reuters|access-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

In Brazil, the final battle over the brand name concluded in 2008. On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market.<ref name=reuters-2012/> In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as "Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletrônica, not Apple, owned the "iPhone" mark in Brazil. The "iPhone" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone. This decision came three months after Gradiente Eletrônica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vergara del Carril|first=Marcos|title=Apple is Fighting Back in Brazilian Courts to Get its iPhone Trademark|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/apple-fighting-back-brazilian-courts-to-get-its-iphone-trademark|access-date=November 6, 2013|newspaper=[[National Law Review]]|date=October 11, 2013|author2=Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP}}</ref>

In June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brand name in Brazil. The court ruling determined that the Gradiente's registration does not own exclusive rights on the brand. Although Gradiente intended to appeal, with the decision Apple can use freely the brand without paying royalties to the Brazilian company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple volta a vencer Gradiente em ação pela marca iPhone (English: ''Apple defeats Gradiente again in lawsuit for the iPhone brand'') |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/vida-digital/apple-vence-gradiente-na-justica-e-pode-usar-marca-iphone-no-brasil/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414060613/http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/vida-digital/apple-vence-gradiente-na-justica-e-pode-usar-marca-iphone-no-brasil |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |access-date=August 27, 2015 |newspaper=Veja |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], Solid Group launched the [[MyPhone]] brand in 2007. Stylized as "my|phone", Solid Broadband filed a trademark application of that brand. Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for "confusingly similar" to the iPhone and that it may likely "deceive" or "cause confusion" among consumers.

Apple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the "iPhone" and the "MyPhone". "This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark", Arevalo later added.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beltran |first=Sam |title=iPhone vs. MyPhone: Apple Loses in Trademark Case |url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/iphone-vs-myphone-apple-loses-in-trademark-case/ |access-date=June 4, 2015|date=June 3, 2015 |work=[[When In Manila]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gonzales |first=Yuji |title=Apple Loses Trademark Case vs PH's MyPhone|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/42511/apple-loses-trademark-case-vs-phs-myphone |access-date=June 4, 2015 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>
