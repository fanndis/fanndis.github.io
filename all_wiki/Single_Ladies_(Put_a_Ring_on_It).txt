"'''Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]], from her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). [[Columbia Records]] released "Single Ladies" as a [[Single (music)|single]] on October 13, 2008 as a [[A-side and B-side|Double A-side]] alongside "[[If I Were a Boy]]", showcasing the contrast between Beyoncé and her aggressive onstage [[alter ego]] Sasha Fierce. It explores men's unwillingness to [[Marriage proposal|propose]] or commit. In the song, the female protagonist is in a club to celebrate her single status.

"Single Ladies" won three [[Grammy Award]]s in [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010]], including [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], among other accolades. Several news media sources named it as one of the best songs of 2008, while some considered it one of the best songs of the decade. It topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for four non-consecutive weeks and has been [[RIAA certification|certified quadruple-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song charted among the top ten within the singles category in several other countries. Globally, it was 2009's seventh best-selling digital single with 6.1&nbsp;million copies sold<ref name="IFPI2009YEC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2010.pdf|title=Digital Music Sales Around The World|date=January 21, 2010|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|page=10|accessdate=December 15, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66RemjMkU?url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2010.pdf|archive-date=March 26, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> thus becoming [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|one of the best-selling singles of all time]].

<blockquote>I saw a video on YouTube. [The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.'

The video features Beyoncé and her two companions dancing inside an [[infinity cove]], which alternates between black and white and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move.<ref name="mtv1"/> At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s act in the 1969 film ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]''.<ref name="people"/> Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.<ref name="people"/><ref name="mtv1"/>

Although the video for "Single Ladies" was the cheapest and quickest of all her videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being "the most iconic&nbsp;... something special".<ref name=lioa/> It spawned a [[Novelty and fad dances|dance craze]] and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, many of which were posted on [[YouTube]].<ref name="people"/> In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video."<ref name="lady"/> Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach.<ref name=lad/> In an interview with Chandler Levack for ''Eye Weekly'', Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited "Single Ladies" with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to "consciously look for music videos because of its art".<ref name="cudmore">{{cite news|first=Chandler|last=Levack |title=Living on in video – Music clip installation series looks behind the camera|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/feature/article/65383|publisher=Torstar|work=Eye Weekly|date=July 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232835/http://archives.eyeweekly.com/feature/article/65383 |archivedate=April 25, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

"Single Ladies" was nominated for nine awards at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American [[country pop]] singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[You Belong with Me]]", sparked controversy during the ceremony. Swift's acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper [[Kanye West]], who grabbed her microphone to declare the "Single Ladies" video as "one of the best videos of all time".<ref name="rant"/> Footage of Beyoncé in the audience looking shocked was then shown. When Beyoncé won the Video of the Year award later that night, she reminisced about when she won her first MTV award with her former group, [[Destiny's Child]], and called the experience "one of the most exciting moments in [her] life". She then invited Swift on-stage to finish her speech and "have her moment".<ref name="rant">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621410/kanye-west-apologizes-taylor-swift-vma-rant.jhtml |title=Kanye West Apologizes To Taylor Swift For VMA Rant |first=Hillary |last=Crosley |publisher=MTV News.
