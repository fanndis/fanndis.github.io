'''Areva S.A.''' was a French [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] group specializing in [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] headquartered in Paris, France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/home-551/legal-notice.html|title=Legal Notice|publisher=Areva|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> Before its 2016 corporate restructuring, Areva was majority-owned by the French state<ref>Carol Matlack, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-16/france-s-areva-falters-in-reactor-business-leaks-cash Areva is costing France plenty], ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', 17 April 2015.</ref> through the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission]] (54.37%), [[Bpifrance (company)|Banque publique d'investissement]] (3.32%), and [[Agence des participations de l'État]] (28.83%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economie.gouv.fr/agence-participations-etat/Les-participations-publiques|title=Les participations publiques |date=30 April 2015|access-date=21 February 2016|publisher=Agence des participations de l'État|language=French}}</ref> [[Électricité de France]], of which the French government has a majority ownership stake, owned 2.24%; [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] owned 4.82% as the second largest shareholder after the French state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.areva.com/finance/liblocal/docs/doc-ref-2014/DDR_EN_310315.pdf|title=2014 Reference document|date=30 March 2015|access-date=21 February 2016|publisher=Areva}}</ref> The company was listed at the European stock exchange [[Euronext]].

As a part of the restructuring program following its insolvency, Areva sold out or discontinued its renewable energy businesses, sold its reactors business subsidiary [[Areva NP]] (now: [[Framatome]]) to [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and its [[nuclear propulsion]] and research reactors subsidiary Areva TA (now: Technicatome) to Agence des participations de l'État, and separated its nuclear cycle business into a separate company New Areva (later: [[Orano]]). As a result, Areva S.A. became wholly state-owned by the French government, remaining responsible only for the liabilities related to the [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant#Unit 3|Olkiluoto 3]] project in [[Finland]] and holding a 40% stake in Orano.

===Creation===
[[File:Siege Areva 33 rue Lafayette P1050953.JPG|upright|thumb|Former Areva headquarters, rue Lafayette in Paris]]
Areva was created on 3 April 2001 by the [[merger]] of Framatome (later: Areva NP, now: Framatome), [[Cogema]] (later: Areva NC, now: [[Orano Cycle]]) and Technicatome (later: Areva TA, now: Techicatome). It was based on the structure of its precursor, CEA-Industrie. [[Anne Lauvergeon]] became its first CEO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stock Ownership Profile |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/finance-402/shareholding-structure-of-the-world-leader-in-the-nuclear-industry-and-major-player-in-bioenergies.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}</ref>

[[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], the former [[Prime Minister of France]], announced the privatization of Areva in 2003, but it was postponed several times, the French government opting finally for the privatization of GDF and EDF. At the end of October 2005, French Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] announced that he had suspended the privatization process.

In 2003, Areva secured a contract for the [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant#Unit 3|Olkiluoto 3]] project, which foresaw construction of the [[Generation III reactor|third generation]] [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]]-type [[pressurised water reactor]].  In 2004 a contracted fixed price was established as €3.2&nbsp;billion.<ref name="New York Times"/> Construction started in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Finland, Nuclear Renaissance Runs into Trouble |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/business/energy-environment/29nuke.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 May 2009 |last1=Kanter |first1=James }}</ref>

In 2004, Areva acquired [[Alstom]]'s transmission and distribution activities, which became Areva T&D. It was sold back to Alstom and [[Schneider Electric]] in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/will-split-areva-td-into-two-separate-entities-alstom_535741.html |title=Will split Areva T&D into two separate entities: Alstom |publisher=MoneyControl.com |date=3 June 2014}}</ref>

On 15 September 2005, Areva and [[Constellation Energy]] of Baltimore announced a [[joint venture]] called UniStar Nuclear to market the commercial EPR in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=EPR: Constellation Energy and Areva Join Forces to Introduce New and Unique Business Model for the Future of American Nuclear Power |url=http://us.areva.com/EN/home-892/areva-inc-press-release.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}</ref> The joint venture later became [[Unistar|UniStar Nuclear Energy]] in 2007.

In 2007, Areva purchased UraMin, which later became Areva Resources Southern Africa (now part of Orano).

In 2007, Areva started construction of the [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant#Unit 3|Flamanville 3]] EPR reactor. In addition, in November 2007 Areva agreed to a €8 billion deal with the [[China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group]] to supply them with two EPRs for [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|title=European companies sign deals to supply China with airplanes and nuclear power |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/business/worldbusiness/26iht-trade.4.8485444.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 November 2007 |last1=Clark |first1=Nicola |last2=Lague |first2=David }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Areva, Airbus Lead $30 Billion Haul in China Visit |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=apreTFF295OE |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=25 June 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627075926/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive |archivedate=27 June 2014  }}</ref> Under the terms of the agreement, Areva also had to help operate the plant, including the reprocessing of spent fuel.<ref name=NYT>John Tagliabue, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 November 2007 [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/business/worldbusiness/27nuke.html "China Deal Gives Lift to Revival of Fission"].</ref> Also in 2007, Areva and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] created a joint venture named [[Atmea]] to develop a 1,100&nbsp;MWe Atmea-1 pressurised water reactor ([[Generation III reactor]]).<ref name=nei080118>

===Post-[[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] problems===

In December 2011, Areva suspended building work at several sites in France, Africa and the United States, one day after forecasting a €1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) loss.
 
Areva halted "capacity extensions" at its [[La Hague site|La Hague Reprocessing Plant]], in northern France, at its Melox factory in the southwest, and at two sites attached to its Tricastin power plant in the south.

==Notable incidents==
===2007 fine===
In January 2007, Areva was fined €53 million by the [[European Commission]] for [[Price fixing cases|rigging]] EU electricity markets through a [[cartel]] involving 11 companies, including [[ABB Group|ABB]], Alstom, [[Fujifilm|Fuji]], [[Hitachi Japan]], [[AE Power Systems]], [[Mitsubishi Electric Corp]], Schneider Electric, Siemens, [[Toshiba]] and VA Tech ELIN.<ref name=fine>[http://www.euractiv.com/en/energy/eu-cracks-electricity-gear-cartel/article-161169 EU cracks down on electricity-gear cartel], ''[[EurActiv]]'', 25 January 2007 .</ref> According to the Commission, "between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."<ref name=fine/>

Areva is not accused of any cartel involvement other than through the acquisition of an Alstom unit in January 2004.

=== Libya deal ===
On 13 August 2007, the French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' alleged that the [[Libya and nuclear technology|Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement]] signed by President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3&nbsp;billion.<ref name=Parisien>Marc Lomazzi, ''Le Parisien'', 13 August 2007 [http://www.leparisien.fr/economie/nucleaire-les-dessous-de-l-accord-entre-la-france-et-la-libye-13-08-2007-2008285886.php' "Nucléaire: les dessous de l'accord entre la France et la Libye"] {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>  ''Le Parisien'' cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to the deputy director of international affairs for the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA atomic agency]], which is the main share-holder in Areva.<ref name=Parisien /> Following allegations that the deal had been related to the [[HIV trial in Libya|release of the Bulgarian nurses]], the [[French Socialist Party]], through the spokesperson [[Jean-Louis Bianco]], declared that this deal was "geopolitically irresponsible".<ref name=Parisien /> The [[German government]] also denounced the agreement.<ref name=Parisien />

===Bakouma assault===
On 24 June 2012, an armed group assaulted a uranium plant operated by Areva at [[Bakouma]] in the southeast of the [[Central African Republic]]. A statement by the military described that "a violent clash on Sunday afternoon pitted" Central African troops against "an unidentified group of armed men attempting to launch an assault on the site of mining company Areva".

According to the report the army successfully repelled the attack, but "the enemy did some material damage and pulled back while taking a sizeable quantity mainly of food with them." The Areva group issued no immediate statement regarding the attack. Central African military sources believe that the attack was organized by members of the [[Chad]]ian rebel group [[Popular Front for Recovery]] (FPR) led by 'General' Baba Ladde, which has been active in the region since 2008. The army says it's conducting further operations to neutralize the remaining armed rebels in the region of Bakouma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2012/06/25/gunmen-attack-french-uranium-plant|title=Gunmen Attack French Uranium Plant|date=25 June 2012|work=timeslive.co.za}}</ref><ref name="News24 2012">{{cite web | title=CAR gunmen attack French uranium plant | website=News24 | date=25 June 2012 | url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/CAR-gunmen-attack-French-uranium-plant-20120625}}</ref>
