'''Miami Beach''' is a coastal [[resort city]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It was incorporated on March 26, 1915.{{sfn|Carson|1955|p={{pn|date=August 2020}}}} The [[municipality]] is located on natural and [[artificial island|man-made]] [[barrier island]]s between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Biscayne Bay]], the latter of which separates the Beach from the mainland city of [[Miami]]. The [[Neighborhoods of Miami Beach, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[South Beach]], comprising the southernmost {{convert|2.5|mi2|km2}} of Miami Beach, along with [[downtown Miami]] and the [[Port of Miami]], collectively form the commercial center of [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Gateways to the Global Economy|last=Andersson|first=Åke E.|last2=Andersson|first2=David E.|publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]]|year=2000|isbn=978-1-84064-389-3|page=124|language=en|oclc=473795927}}</ref>  Miami Beach's estimated population is 88,885 according to the most recent United States census estimates. Miami Beach is the 26th largest city in Florida based on official 2019 estimates from the US Census Bureau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/miami-beach-fl-population/|title=Miami Beach, Florida Population 2018|publisher=World Population Review|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>  It has been one of America's pre-eminent [[beach resort]]s since the early 20th century.

In 1979, Miami Beach's [[Miami Beach Architectural District|Art Deco Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Art Deco District is the largest collection of [[Art Deco]] architecture in the world<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/art_deco_historic_district.asp |title=Miami Art Deco District – Official Art Deco District Visitors Guide |publisher=Miamiandbeaches.com |date=December 31, 2012 |access-date=June 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901093942/http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/art_deco_historic_district.asp |archive-date=September 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and comprises hundreds of hotels, apartments and other structures erected between 1923 and 1943. Mediterranean, [[Streamline Moderne]] and Art Deco are all represented in the District. The Historic District is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the East, Lenox Court on the West, 6th Street on the South and Dade Boulevard along the Collins Canal to the North. The movement to preserve the Art Deco District's architectural heritage was led by former interior designer [[Barbara Baer Capitman]], who now has a street in the District named in her honor.

==Government==
Miami Beach is governed by a ceremonial mayor and six [[City commission government|commissioners]]. Although the mayor runs commission meetings, the mayor and all commissioners have equal voting power and are elected by popular election. The mayor serves for terms of two years with a term limit of three terms and commissioners serve for terms of four years and are limited to two terms. Commissioners are voted for citywide and every two years three commission seats are voted upon.

A city manager is responsible for administering governmental operations. An appointed city manager is responsible for administration of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Journey to Excellence|url=http://www.miamibeachfl.gov/government/|publisher=City of Miami Beach|access-date=May 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605162944/http://www.miamibeachfl.gov/government/|archive-date=June 5, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The City Clerk and the City Attorney are also appointed officials.

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2011}}
In 1870, father and son Henry and Charles Lum purchased land on Miami Beach for 75 cents an acre. The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] through an executive order issued by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biscayne House of Refuge |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=75990 |website=HMdb.org |access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref> at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1915, was destroyed in the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and never rebuilt.
 
The next step in the development of the future Miami Beach was the planting of a coconut plantation along the shore in the 1880s by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but this was a failed venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elnathan T. Field |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/ingraham/expedition/FieldE.htm |website=University of Florida Library |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> One of the investors in the project was agriculturist [[John S. Collins]], who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of [[Government Cut]] was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.

Collins' family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers (bankers from Miami), and [[Indianapolis]] entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]]. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market, and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company.<ref name="wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com">{{cite web|url=https://wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/return-in-time-to-the-lincoln-hotel-miami-beach-late-january-1921/|title=RETURN IN TIME TO THE LINCOLN HOTEL, MIAMI BEACH, LATE JANUARY, 1921|date=October 24, 2012|work=Wordpress.com|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown's Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.<ref>{{citation

|page=210}}</ref>

With loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2½-mile-long wooden bridge, the world's longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal.<ref name="wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com"/> That transaction kicked off the island's first real estate boom. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.

The Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach.<ref>http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1955/55_1_01.pdf</ref>

Carl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach's development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]], The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this man-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]]. The great [[1926 Miami hurricane]] put an end to this prosperous era of the [[Florida Boom]], but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present "[[Art Deco]]" historic district.

Carl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist.<ref>Ross, Edward Ellis; interview notebook; source: New York University Archives; p. 79.
</ref> Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could "Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right."<ref name=":0">Cooke, Bill (September 20, 2010); "Selling Miami Beach with Sex and Celebrities Is Nothing New;" <nowiki>http://www.miamibeach411.com/news/selling-miami</nowiki>; Miami Beach; 411.</ref> The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.<ref name=":0" /> One of Hannagan's favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: "'It's always June in Miami Beach' and 'Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.'"<ref>Fisher, Jane (1947); The Fabulous Hoosier; Robert M. McBride & Company; New York; p. 147.</ref>

[[Post–World War II economic expansion]] brought a wave of immigrants to South Florida from the Northern United States, which significantly increased the population in Miami Beach within a few decades. After [[Fidel Castro]]'s rise to power in 1959, a wave of Cuban refugees entered South Florida and dramatically changed the demographic make-up of the area. In 2017, one study named zip code 33109 ([[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]], a 216-acre island located just south of Miami Beach), as having the 4th most expensive home sales and the highest average annual income ($2.5 million) in 2015.<ref>{{cite web | last = LaBorde | first = Lauren | title = Miami Beach Is Among America's Priciest Zip Codes | publisher = Neighborhoods.com | date = March 21, 2017 | url = https://www.neighborhoods.com/blog/miami-beach-is-among-americas-priciest-zip-codes}}</ref>

[[South Beach]] (also known as SoBe, or simply the Beach), the area from Biscayne Street (also known as South Pointe Drive) one block south of 1st Street to about 23rd Street, is one of the more popular areas of Miami Beach. Although [[toplessness|topless]] sunbathing by women has not been officially legalized, female toplessness is tolerated on South Beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Natalie|title=Topless Protesters on South Beach|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-09-04/news/topless-protesters-on-south-beach/|access-date=January 26, 2012|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Muench-Pace|first=Dawn|title=Topless and Nude Beaches in Miami|url=http://gomiami.about.com/od/naturebeachesparks/a/ToplessBeaches.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref>  Before the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' helped make the area popular, SoBe was under [[urban blight]], with vacant buildings and a high [[crime rate]].

Miami Beach, particularly [[Ocean Drive (South Beach)|Ocean Drive]] of what is now the Art Deco District, was also featured prominently in the 1983 feature film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and the 1996 comedy ''[[The Birdcage]]''.

[[Lincoln Road]], running east–west parallel between 16th and 17th Streets, is a nationally known spot for outdoor dining and shopping and features galleries of well known designers, artists and photographers such as [[Romero Britto]], [[Peter Lik]], and [[Jonathan Adler]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

=== Historic preservation ===

[[File:Ocean drive day 2009j.JPG|thumb|Many [[Art Deco]] style hotels are located on [[Ocean Drive (South Beach)|Ocean Drive]]]]
By the 1970s, jet travel had enabled vacationers from the northern parts of the US to travel to the Caribbean and other warm-weather climates in the winter. Miami Beach's economy suffered. Elderly retirees, many with little money, dominated the population of South Beach.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title=A Martyr's Passion Helped Save Modern Deco Treasurers|last=Tasker|first=Fred|date=1999-07-11|work=The Miami Herald|page=91}}</ref>

To help revive the area, city planners and developers sought to bulldoze many of the aging [[Art Deco in the United States|art deco]] buildings that were built in the 1930s. By one count, the city had over 800 art deco buildings within its borders.<ref name=":1" />

In 1976, [[Barbara Baer Capitman]] and a group of fellow activists formed the Miami Design Preservation League (MDPL) to try to halt the destruction of the historic buildings in South Beach.<ref name=":1" /> After battling local developers and Washington DC bureaucrats, MDPL prevailed in its quest to have the Miami Beach Art Deco District named to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979. While the recognition did not offer protection for the buildings from demolition, it succeeded in drawing attention to the plight of the buildings.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Art Deco District Pays The Price of Success|last=Lorente|first=Rafael|date=1994-05-12|work=The Miami Herald|page=1–Neighbors Miami Beach}}</ref>

Due in part to the newfound awareness of the art deco buildings, vacationers, tourists and TV, and movie crews were drawn to South Beach. Investors began to rehabilitate hotels, restaurants and apartment buildings in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|title=South Beach's Art Deco district celebrates 30 years since its rebirth|last=Viglucci|first=Andres|date=2009-05-15|work=The Miami Herald|page=A1}}</ref>

Despite the enthusiasm for the historic buildings by many, there were no real protections for historic buildings. As wrecking crews threatened buildings, MDPL members protested by holding marches and candlelight vigils. In one case, protestors stood in front of a hotel blocking bulldozers as they approached a hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|title='First Lady of Art Deco" Barbara Capitman Dies|last=Dunlop|first=Beth|date=1990-03-30|work=The Miami Herald|page=1A}}</ref>

After many years of effort, the Miami Beach city commission created the first two historic preservation districts in 1986. The districts covered Espanola Way and most of [[Ocean Drive (South Beach)|Ocean Drive]] and [[Collins Avenue]] in South Beach. The designation of the districts helped protect buildings from demolition and created standards for renovation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Beach OKs Deco Historic Districts|last=Wellisz|first=Christopher|date=1986-07-10|work=The Miami Herald|page=2D}}</ref>

While some developers continued to focus on demolition, several investors like [[Tony Goldman]] and [[Ian Schrager]] bought art deco hotels and transformed them into world famous hot spots in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Among the celebrities that frequented Miami Beach were [[Madonna]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Cher]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Gianni Versace]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=In two decades, Miami Beach's southernmost square mile has become a big draw with art, cuisine, architecture and nightlife.|last=Martin|first=Lydia|date=2007-07-15|work=The Miami Herald|page=A1}}</ref>

Additional historic districts were created in 1992. The new districts covered Lincoln Road, Collins Avenue between 16th and 22nd Streets and the area around the [[Bass Museum]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Beach Set To OK Expansion of Art Deco District|last=Kidwell|first=David|date=1992-10-21|work=The Miami Herald|page=1B}}</ref> In 2005, the city began the process of protecting the mid-century buildings on Collins Avenue between 43rd to 53rd Streets including the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach|Fontainebleau]] and [[Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel|Eden Roc]] Hotels.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Board Votes For Historic District|last=Woods|first=Casey|date=2005-05-15|work=The Miami Herald|page=3MB}}</ref> Several North Beach neighborhoods were designated as historic in 2018.

===The Arts===

[[Jackie Gleason]] hosted his ''Jackie Gleason and His American Scene Magazine'' (September 29, 1962 – June 4, 1966) television show, after moving it from New York to [[Miami Beach]] in 1964, reportedly because he liked year-round access to the golf course at the nearby [[Inverrary Country Club]] in [[Lauderhill, Florida|Lauderhill]] (where he built his final home). His closing line became, almost invariably, "As always, the Miami Beach audience is the greatest audience in the world!" In the Fall 1966 television season, he abandoned the American Scene Magazine format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers. The show was renamed ''The Jackie Gleason Show'', lasting from September 17, 1966 – September 12, 1970. He started the 1966–1967 season with new, color episodes of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', with [[Sheila MacRae]] and [[Jane Kean]] as Alice Kramden and Trixie Norton, respectively. The regular cast included [[Art Carney]] as Ed Norton; [[Milton Berle]] was a frequent guest star. The show was shot in color on videotape at the [[Miami Beach Convention Center|Miami Beach Auditorium]] (later renamed the Jackie Gleason Theatre of the Performing Arts), now known as [[Miami Beach Convention Center#Fillmore Miami Beach|Fillmore Miami Beach]], and Gleason never tired of promoting the "sun and fun capital of the world" on camera. [[CBS]] canceled the series in 1970.

Each December, the City of Miami Beach hosts [[Art Basel Miami Beach]], one of the largest art shows in the United States. Art Basel Miami Beach, the sister event to the [[Art Basel]] event held each June in Basel, Switzerland, combines an international selection of top galleries with a program of special exhibitions, parties and crossover events featuring music, film, architecture, and design. Exhibition sites are located in the city's Art Deco District, and ancillary events are scattered throughout the greater Miami metropolitan area.

The first Art Basel Miami Beach was held in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/art_market/a-brief-history-of-art-basel-52350|title=A Brief History of Art Basel, the World's Premier Contemporary Fair|last=Bodick|first=Noelle|date=2014-06-17|website=Artspace|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}</ref> In 2016, about 77,000 people attended the fair.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/art-basel/article188441249.html|title=Is Art Basel bigger and better than ever?

===Jewish community===
Miami Beach is home to several [[Orthodox Jew]]ish communities with a network of well-established [[synagogue]]s and [[yeshiva]]s, the first of which being the Landow Yeshiva, a Chabad institution in operation for over 30 years. There is also a liberal [[Jewish]] community containing such famous synagogues as Temple Emanu-El, [[Temple Beth Sholom (Miami Beach, Florida)|Temple Beth Shalom]] and [[Cuban Hebrew Congregation]]. Miami Beach is also a magnet for [[Jew]]ish families, retirees, and particularly [[Snowbird (person)|snowbirds]] when the cold winter sets into the north. These visitors range from the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] to the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]&nbsp;– including many [[rebbe]]s who vacation there during the North American winter. Till his death in 1991, the Nobel laureate writer [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] lived in the northern end of Miami Beach and breakfasted often at Sheldon's drugstore on Harding Avenue.

There are many [[kosher]] restaurants and even [[kollel]]s for post-graduate [[Talmud]]ic scholars, such as the Miami Beach Community Kollel. Miami Beach had roughly 60,000 people in Jewish households, 62 percent of the total population in 1982, but only 16,500, or 19 percent of the population in 2004, said Ira Sheskin, a demographer at the University of Miami who conducts surveys once a [[decade]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The Miami Beach Jewish community had decreased in size by 1994 due to migration to wealthier areas and aging of the population.<ref>Patron, Eugene.

Miami Beach is home to the [[Holocaust Memorial of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation]].

=== LGBT community ===
{{main|LGBT culture in Miami}}
Miami Beach has been regarded as a [[gay mecca]] for decades as well as being one of the most LGBT friendly cities in the United States. Miami Beach is home to numerous gay bars and gay-specific events, and five service and resource organizations. After decades of economic and social decline, an influx of [[LGBT|gays and lesbians]] moving to South Beach in the late-1980s to mid-1990s contributed to Miami Beach's revitalization. The newcomers purchased and restored dilapidated Art Deco hotels and clubs, started numerous businesses and built political power in city and county government.<ref name="miamiherald.com">[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/03/04/2102454/miami-beach-by-the-numbers.html Miami Beach by the numbers - Miami Beach - MiamiHerald.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429104006/http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/03/04/2102454/miami-beach-by-the-numbers.html |date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>

==Climate==
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Miami Beach has a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. Proximity to the moderating influence of the Atlantic gives Miami Beach lower high temperatures and higher lows than inland areas of Florida. According to the [[National Weather Service]], other than [[Key West]], Miami Beach is the only U.S. city (mainland) to never report freezing temperatures, with the record low of 32.3 F in January 1989.<ref name=Transmiami>{{Cite web|url=http://transmiami.com/|title=Car Service Miami &#124; Sedan Service Miami &#124; Transmiami Limos|website=transmiami.com}}</ref> Miami Beach is in [[hardiness zone]] 11, like the Keys where temperatures rarely dip below 40, compared to mainland coastal Miami-Dade and the northern barrier islands at zone 10 where some frost is expected.

Miami Beach's location on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near its confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]], make it extraordinarily vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s. Miami has experienced several direct hits from major hurricanes in recorded weather history – the [[1906 Florida Keys hurricane]], [[1926 Miami hurricane]], [[1935 Yankee hurricane]], [[1941 Florida hurricane]], [[1948 Miami hurricane|1948 Miami Hurricane]], [[Hurricane King|1950 Hurricane King]] and [[Hurricane Cleo|1964 Hurricane Cleo]], the area has seen indirect contact from hurricanes: [[1945 Homestead hurricane|1945 Homestead Hurricane]], [[Hurricane Betsy|Betsy]] (1965), [[Hurricane Inez|Inez]] (1966), [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] (1992), [[Hurricane Irene (1999)|Irene]] (1999), [[Hurricane Michelle|Michelle]] (2001), [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] (2005), [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] (2005), and [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] (2017).

===Miami's response to flooding===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
During King Tide in Miami, citizens may wade in ankle to knee deep water on a sunny day. This unfortunate reality of climate change contributes to the City of Miami Beach's $400–500 Million of expenditures to address sea level rise over the next five years. After urgent meetings with city planners and engineers, Miami Beach officials decided on raising roads and installing pumps as the best course of action. Citizens have raised concerns that more pumps will simply exacerbate pollution in the bay, harming wildlife and decreasing biodiversity which in turn could harm tourism. Since they've turned on the pumps, seaside residents have complained of a lower quality of life due to the lack of stingrays, manatees, tarpin, and other wildlife. The tubes pump out a brown soot-like liquid, dangering those residents of lower property values. A hydrologist from Florida International University, Henry Briceño, is studying the validity of the city's claims that the output from the pipes is just harmless turbidity in the bay. “Remember,” Briceño argues, “we live here in Miami Beach out of tourism.” Anthropologist Kenny Broad sees that Miami residents understand that their livelihoods are at stake, and they feel the realities of climate change beyond partisan lines. This alarmed mindset is catalyzing support for a proposal to turn a public golf course back into wetlands, a more deep ecology approach than the pump installations.

The urgency and apparency of flooding coupled with the many other golf courses that the public and tourists can access in Miami have curbed public opposition to an extent, but in preparation for varied public opinion, Miami Beach has proposed three options. The first would not affect the golf course other than retrofitting it with greener, water-absorbing features. The second would repurpose nine holes into wetlands with a recreation center, while the third option goes all the way in a total reimagination of the course into a 145-acre eco-district reminiscent of Central Park in New York City. This move wouldn't be unprecedented: a private conservancy group purchased an aging golf course on Florida's Gulf Coast and repurposed it as a wetland and wildflower preserve.

Additionally, to accommodate water filtration that the pipes inadequately attempt to clean, the golf course is just one piece of a larger plan to add plant-based systems that will filter water before they enter the high water table of Miami and return to Biscayne Bay. This plan is similar to dealing with sewage through aquatic water treatment plants and steps that other cities such as Houston are beginning to take to increase permeability in their cities for water to drain into.

Public Transportation in Miami Beach is operated by [[Miami-Dade Transit]] (MDT). Along with neighborhoods such as [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] and [[Brickell]], public transit is heavily used in Miami Beach and is a vital part of city life. Although Miami Beach has no direct [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]] stations, numerous Metrobus lines connect to [[Downtown Miami]] and Metrorail (i.e., the 'S' bus line). The South Beach Local (SBL) is one of the most heavily used lines in Miami and connects all major points of South Beach to other major bus lines in the city. Metrobus ridership in Miami Beach is high, with some of the routes such as the L and S being the busiest Metrobus routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/rtr/2011-02_Ridership_Technical_Report.pdf |title=2011-02_Ridership_Technical_Report.pdf |access-date=June 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526085818/http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/rtr/2011-02_Ridership_Technical_Report.pdf |archive-date=May 26, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Airport-Beach Express (Route 150), operated by MDT, is a direct-service bus line that connects [[Miami International Airport]] to major points in South Beach. The ride costs $2.65, and runs every 30 minutes from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. seven days a week.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1328946.html miamiherald.com]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

===Bicycling===
Since the late 20th century, [[cycling]] has grown in popularity in Miami Beach. Due to its dense, urban nature, and pedestrian-friendly streets, many Miami Beach residents get around by bicycle.

In March 2011 a public [[bicycle sharing system]] named Decobike was launched, one of only a handful of such programs in the United States.  The program is operated by a private corporation, Decobike, LLC, but is partnered with the City of Miami Beach in a revenue-sharing model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decobike.com/decofaq.php#where-revenues-go |title=DecoBike Miami Beach - FAQ &#124; South Beach Bicycle Rental, Bike Sharing, Public Bike Program &#124; Bicycle Rentals, Bicycle Shop &#124; Art Deco Bike Tour, South Florida Bicycle Rides, Bicycle Sharing |publisher=Decobike.com |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> Once fully implemented, the program hopes to have around 1000 bikes accessible from 100 stations throughout Miami Beach, from around 85th Street on the north side of Miami Beach all the way south to [[South Pointe Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitmiami.com/bicycle-sharing/deco-bikes-south-florida-bikeshare-debut |title=Deco Bike: South Florida Bikeshare Debut |publisher=Transit Miami |date=March 15, 2011 |access-date=April 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311083056/http://www.transitmiami.com/bicycle-sharing/deco-bikes-south-florida-bikeshare-debut |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
