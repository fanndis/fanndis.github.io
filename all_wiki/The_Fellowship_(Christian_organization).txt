==History==
The Fellowship Foundation traces its roots to its founder, [[Abraham Vereide]], a [[Methodist]] clergyman and social innovator, who organized a month of prayer meetings in 1934 in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=Wheaton459/> Vereide was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrant who founded [[Goodwill Industries]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1916 to assist the city's unemployed [[Scandinavian Americans|Scandinavian]] immigrant population. Goodwill Industries soon occupied a city block, where they repaired and processed discarded clothing and furniture and converted "waste to wages". The Fellowship was founded in 1935 in opposition to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].<ref name=npr/> His work spread down the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and eventually to [[Boston]].<ref name=LeaderDev>{{cite web|title=Washington's Prayer Breakfast History|url=http://www.waleadership.com/GenericPage/DisplayPage.aspx?guid=956FE760-7036-46F2-869B-2723033C6131|publisher=Leadership Development|year=2009|access-date=August 29, 2009}}</ref>

The author [[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] described the beginning of the Family as a reaction to union activities of [[Harry Bridges]], "The Family really begins when the founder (Abraham Vereide) has this vision, which he thinks comes from God, that Harry Bridges, this Australian labour organiser who organised really the biggest strike in American history, a very successful strike, is a Satanic and Soviet agent."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/secrets-of-a-powerful-family-20080613-2q8z.html|title=Secrets of a powerful Family|last=York|first=Ian Munro, New|date=2008-06-13|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>

In April 1935, Vereide and Major J.F. Douglas invited 19 business and civic leaders for a prayer breakfast meeting.<ref name="LeaderDev" /> By 1937, 209 prayer breakfast groups had been organized throughout Seattle.<ref name="Wheaton459">{{cite web|date=November 7, 2007|title=Records of the Fellowship Foundation — Collection 459|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/459.htm|work=[[Billy Graham Center]] — Archives|publisher=[[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]|access-date=August 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103165138/http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/459.htm|archive-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref> In 1940, 300 men from all over the state of Washington attended a prayer breakfast for the new governor, [[Arthur Langlie]].<ref name="Wheaton459" /> Vereide traveled throughout the Pacific Northwest, and later around the country, to develop similar groups.<ref name="Wheaton459" /> The non-denominational groups were meant to informally bring together civic and business leaders to share vision, study the Bible and develop relationships of trust and support.<ref name="Wheaton459" />

The Fellowship Foundation was incorporated by Abraham Vereide in [[Chicago]] in 1942 as Fellowship Foundation, Inc. It also acquired the names International Christian Leadership (ICL), Fellowship House, and International Foundation for venues as its global outreach ministry expanded.<ref name=Wheaton459 /><ref>{{citation|publisher=ILSOS|url=http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController|title=Certificate of Good Standing|place=USA}}</ref> The Fellowship Foundation, Inc. does most of its business as the International Foundation,<ref name=ShowingFaith/> which is its [[Doing business as|DBA]] name.<ref name=Fellow990-2007/>

By 1942 there were 60 breakfast groups in major cities around the US and Canada, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington and Vancouver. That same year, Vereide began to hold small prayer breakfasts for members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate]].

In 1942, the Fellowship was incorporated in Chicago, Illinois as Vereide's center of national outreach to businessmen and civic and clergy leadership. Vereide had moved the group's offices from Seattle to the more centralized location of Chicago, headquarters of the businessmen's luncheon outreach "Christian Businessmen's Committee", which Vereide led with industrialist C.B. Hedstrom. That same year the Fellowship Foundation established a delegation ministry in Washington DC on Massachusetts Avenue at Sheridan Circle named "Fellowship House". Vereide later described it as the nerve center of the breakfast groups.

In 1944, Vereide held his first joint Senate–House prayer breakfast meeting. He held another breakfast on June 16, 1946, attended by Senators [[H. Alexander Smith]] and [[Lister Hill]], and ''[[US News and World Report]]'' publisher [[David Lawrence (publisher)|David Lawrence]].

In 1946, Vereide wrote and released a book with Reverend John G. Magee, chaplain to President [[Harry Truman]], entitled ''Together'' (Abingdon Cokesbury). In the book, Vereide explained his philosophy of visionary discipleship and gathering together in what he termed spiritual cells:

<blockquote>Man craves fellowship. Most of us want an opportunity to make our feelings known, to relate our personal experiences, to compare notes with others, and, in unity of spirit to receive renewal, inspiration, guidance, and strength from God. Such groups as we are thinking of have characterized every spiritual awakening. Jesus began with Peter and James and John. He had the twelve and the Seventy. At Bethany he established a cell... there you have the formula... faith embodied the same close informal fellowship... one common practice—gathering together in the name of Jesus.</blockquote>

In January 1947, a conference in Zurich led to the formation of the International Council for Christian Leadership (ICCL), an umbrella group for the national fellowship groups in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[Norway]], [[Hungary]], [[Egypt]] and [[China]]. ICCL was incorporated as a separate organization in 1953. ICL and ICCL were governed by different boards of directors, joined by a coordinating committee: four members of ICCL's board and four from the ICL's executive committee.

In 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended the Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. He was invited by fellow Kansan [[Frank Carlson]]. By that time, Vereide's congressional members also included Senators [[Frank Carlson]], [[Karl Mundt]], [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Strom Thurmond]].

By 1957, ICL had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups in Washington, D.C. alone. It had set up another 125 groups in other countries. During 1958, a mentor from [[The Navigators (organization)|The Navigators]], [[Douglas Coe]],<ref>Modern Viking, page 128</ref><ref>Window On Washington, page 28</ref> joined Vereide as assistant executive director of ICL in Washington, D.C. After over 35 years of leading the Fellowship Foundation, Vereide died in 1969 and was succeeded by [[Richard C. Halverson]] as executive director. Halverson and Coe worked side by side until Halverson's death in 1995.

==Influence==
Prominent evangelical Christians have described the Fellowship as one of the most, or the most, politically well-connected ministries in the world.

[[D. Michael Lindsay]], a former [[Rice University]] sociologist who studies the evangelical movement, said "there is no other organization like the Fellowship, especially among religious groups, in terms of its access or clout among the country's leadership."<ref name="LindsayP35"/> He also reported that lawmakers mentioned the Fellowship more than any other organization when asked to name a ministry with the most influence on their faith.<ref name=AllInFamily/> Lindsay interviewed 360 evangelical elites, among whom "One in three mentioned [Doug] Coe or the Fellowship as an important influence."<ref name="LindsayP35"/>   Lindsay reported that it "has relationships with pretty much every world leader—good and bad—and there are not many organizations in the world that can claim that."<ref name=AllInFamily/>

In 1977, four years after he had converted to Christianity, Fellowship member and Watergate conspirator [[Charles Colson]] described the group as a "veritable underground of Christ's men all through the U.S. government."<ref name="ColsonBornAgain"/>

Former Kansas Governor [[Sam Brownback]], also a former member of the Senate Prayer Group, has described Fellowship members' method of operation: "Typically, one person grows desirous of pursuing an action"—a piece of legislation, a diplomatic strategy—"and the others pull in behind."<ref name="SharletP264t5">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), pp. 264–5.</ref> Brownback has often joined with fellow Family members in pursuing legislation. For example, in 1999 he joined together with fellow Family members, Senators [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[Don Nickles]] to demand a criminal investigation of [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]], and in 2005 Brownback joined with Fellowship member Sen. [[Tom Coburn]] to promote the Houses of Worship Act.<ref name="SharletP265">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p. 265.</ref>

[[Rob Schenck]], founder of the Washington, D.C. ministry [[Faith and Action|Faith and Action in the Nation's Capital]], described the Family's influence as "off the charts" in comparison with other fundamentalist groups, specifically compared to [[Focus on the Family]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and [[Prison Fellowship]].<ref name="SharletP259"/> (These last two are associated with the Family: Traditional Values Coalition uses their C Street House<ref name="SharletP259"/> and Prison Fellowship was founded by [[Charles Colson]].) Schenck also says that "the mystique of the Fellowship" has helped it "gain entree into almost impossible places in the capital."<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

"The Fellowship's reach into governments around the world is almost impossible to overstate or even grasp," says [[David Kuo (author)|David Kuo]], a former special assistant in George W. Bush's [[Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref name="SharletP25"/>

==Beliefs and theology==
The Fellowship Foundation's [[501(c)(3)]] mission statement is:

{{quote|To develop and maintain an informal association of people banded together, to go out as "ambassadors of reconciliation," modeling the principles of Jesus, based on loving God and loving others. To work with the leaders of many nations, and as their hearts are touched, the poor, the oppressed, the widows, and the youth of their country will be impacted in a positive manner. Youth groups will be developed under the thoughts of Jesus, including loving others as you want to be loved.<ref name=Fellow990-2007 />}}

''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that the Fellowship has often been criticized by conservative and fundamentalist Christian groups for being too inclusive and not putting enough emphasis on doctrine or church attendance.<ref name =LisaMiller>{{cite web|first=Lisa|last=Miller|title=House of Worship|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/214986|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=September 8, 2009|access-date=August 14, 2009}}</ref> NPR has reported that the evangelical group's views on religion and politics are so singular that some other [[Christian right]] organizations consider them heretical.<ref name=npr />

[[David Kuo (author)|David Kuo]], staffer in President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives]], who has been affiliated with the Fellowship since college, said of the Fellowship:
{{quote|For all the hysteria about Christian organizations, the irony that the Fellowship is being targeted as a bad egg is jaw-dropping. This is so not [[Focus on the Family]], this is so not the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]]. There are other Christian groups that are truly insane. Who purport to follow Jesus Christ and who I would submit do not. The Fellowship is a loosely banded group of people who have an affinity for Jesus.<ref name=LisaMiller />}}

Current Fellowship prayer group member and former U.S. Representative [[Tony P. Hall]] (D-OH) said, "If people in this country knew how many Democrats and Republicans pray together and actually like each other behind closed doors, they would be amazed." The Fellowship is simply "men and women who are trying to get right with God. Trying to follow God, learn how to love him, and learn how to love each other." When he lost his teenage son to [[leukemia]], Hall says, "This family helped me. This family was there for me. That's what they do."<ref name =LisaMiller />

[[Hillary Clinton]] described meeting the leader of the Fellowship in 1993: "Doug Coe, the longtime National Prayer Breakfast organizer, is a unique presence in Washington: a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone, regardless of party or faith, who wants to deepen his or her relationship to God."<ref name=ClintonLivingHistory>{{citation|first=Hillary|last=Clinton|title=Living History|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2003}}.</ref>

Investigative reporter [[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] wrote a book, ''[[The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power]]'',<ref name="Sharlet Family">{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Sharlet|title=The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-055979-3|title-link=The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power}}</ref> as well as an article in ''[[Harper's]]''<ref name=JesusPlusNothing/> magazine, describing his experience while serving as an intern in the Fellowship. Sharlet did intensive research in the Fellowship's archives before they were closed to the public. He also spent a month in 2002 living in a Fellowship house near Washington, and wrote a magazine article describing his experiences.<ref name=JesusPlusNothing/> According to his 2008 book,<ref name="Sharlet Family" /> their theology is an "elite fundamentalism" that fetishizes political power and wealth, consistently opposes labor movements in the US and abroad, and teaches that [[laissez-faire]] economic policy is "God's will." He opines that their theological teaching of instant forgiveness has been useful to powerful men, providing them a convenient excuse for misdeeds or crimes and allowing them to avoid accepting responsibility or accountability for their actions.<ref name=sharlet>{{cite book|last=Sharlet|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Sharlet (writer) |title=The Family: Power, Politics and Fundamentalism's Shadow Elite|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Queensland Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVmcx-8zdGEC|isbn=978-0-7022-3694-5}}</ref> Sharlet's book was endorsed by several commentators, including [[Frank Schaeffer]], once a leading figure of the Christian right, who called Sharlet's book a "must read... disturbing tour de force," and [[Brian McLaren]], one of ''Time'''s "25 most influential evangelicals" in the U.S., who said: "Jeff Sharlet [is] a confessed non-evangelical whom top evangelical organizations might be wise to hire—and quick—as a consultant."<ref>{{citation|asin=0060560053|publisher=Amazon|title=Book review quotes}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.therevealer.org/archives/revealing_002953.php|title=The Revealer|contribution=Quoting book reviews for The Family}}.</ref> Lisa Miller, who writes a column on religion at ''Newsweek'', called his book "alarmist" and says it paints a "creepy, even cultish picture" of the young, lower-ranking members of the Fellowship.<ref name=LisaMiller/><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/32230|newspaper=Newsweek|title=Lisa Miller|type=biography}}.</ref>

==Leadership model==
Jeff Sharlet stated in an NBC Nightly News report that when he was an intern with the Fellowship "we were being taught the leadership lessons of Hitler, Lenin and Mao" and that Hitler's genocide "wasn't really an issue for them, it was the strength that he emulated."<ref name=poli-ties /> He opined that the Fellowship fetishizes power by comparing Jesus to "[[Lenin]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]" as examples of leaders who change the world through the strength of the covenants they had forged with their 'brothers'".<ref name="SharletP259"/><ref name=LisaMiller/> In his book ''The Family'', Sharlet said Fellowship leader [[Douglas Coe|Doug Coe]] preached a leadership model and a personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] comparable to the blind devotion that Hitler, Stalin, [[Mao Zedong]], and [[Pol Pot]] demanded from their followers.<ref name="SharletP254t5"/>

In one videotaped lecture series in 1989, Coe said,

{{quote|Hitler, Goebbels and Himmler were three men. Think of the immense power these three men had... But they bound themselves together in an agreement... Jesus said, 'You have to put me before other people. And you have to put me before yourself.' Hitler, that was the demand to be in the Nazi party. You have to put the Nazi party and its objectives ahead of your own life and ahead of other people.<ref name=poli-ties>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Andrea|last2=Popkin|first2=James 'Jim'|date=April 3, 2008|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540 |title=Political ties to a secretive religious group|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref name="SharletP254t5">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), pp. 254–5.</ref>}}

In the same series, Coe also compared Jesus's teachings to the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] during the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]]:

{{quote|I've seen pictures of young men in the Red Guard of China... They would bring in this young man's mother and father, lay her on the table with a basket on the end, he would take an axe and cut her head off... They have to put the purposes of the Red Guard ahead of the mother-father-brother-sister — their own life! That was a covenant. A pledge. That was what Jesus said.<ref name=poli-ties/><ref name="SharletP255">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p. 255.</ref>}}

David Kuo, a former White House aide to [[George W. Bush]], said that Coe is using Hitler as a metaphor for commitment. The NBC report said "a close friend of Coe told NBC News that he invokes Hitler to show the power of small groups—for good and bad. And, the friend said, most of the time he talks about Jesus."<ref name=poli-ties/>

==Secrecy==
In a report on the Fellowship, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found:

<blockquote>[Fellowship members] share a vow of silence about Fellowship activities. Oddly, it is categorized under US law as a church rather than a political lobbying organization, so financial sources and budget expenditures remain unknown. Coe and others cite biblical admonitions against public displays of good works, insisting they would not be able to tackle their diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention. Members, including congressmen, invoke this secrecy rule when refusing to discuss just about every aspect of the Fellowship and their involvement in it.<ref name=ShowingFaith/></blockquote>

The Fellowship has long been a secretive organization.<ref name=USAtoday-07-16-09>{{cite news|first=Cathy Lynn|last=Grossman|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/07/68494598/1|title=Does 'C Street' give 'accountability groups' bad name?|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 16, 2009|access-date=July 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Holly|last=Bailey|title=Another 'C Street' Pol Accused of Cheating|url=http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2009/07/17/another-c-street-pol-accused-of-cheating.aspx|magazine=Newsweek|date=July 17, 2009|access-date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> The Reverend Rob Schenck, who leads a Bible study on the Hill inspired by [[C Street Center|C Street]], wrote that "all ministries in Washington need to protect the confidence of those we minister to, and I'm sure that's a primary motive for C Street's low profile."<ref name="C Street House">Belz, Emily, Edward Lee Pitts (June 26, 2009). [http://www.worldmag.com/webextra/15584 "The C Street house."] ''World Magazine''. Retrieved on April 14, 2010.</ref> But he added, "I think The Fellowship has been just a tad bit too clandestine."<ref name="C Street House"/>

Prominent political figures have insisted that confidentiality and privacy are essential to the Fellowship's operation. In 1985, President [[Ronald Reagan]] said about the Fellowship, "I wish I could say more about it, but it's working precisely because it is private."<ref name="SharletP19">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p.19</ref> At the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast, President [[George H.W. Bush]] praised Douglas Coe for what he described as "quiet diplomacy, I wouldn't say secret diplomacy."<ref name="SharletP25"/> In 2009, Chris Halverson, son of Fellowship co-founder [[Richard C. Halverson]], said that a culture of pastoral confidentiality is essential to the ministry: "If you talked about it, you would destroy that fellowship."<ref name=AllInFamily/>

In the 1960s, the Fellowship began distributing to involved members of Congress notes that stated that "the group, as such, never takes any formal action, but individuals who participate in the group through their initiative have made possible the activities mentioned."<ref name="SharletP198">Jeff Sharlet, The Family (Harper, 2008), p. 198.</ref>

In 1974, after several Watergate conspirators had joined the Fellowship, a ''Los Angeles Times'' columnist discouraged further inquiries into Washington's "underground prayer movement", i.e. the Fellowship: "They genuinely avoid publicity... they shun it."<ref name=Thimmesch>Thimmesch, "Politicians and the Underground Prayer Movement," ''Los Angeles Times'', Jan. 13, 1974.</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Sharlet|title=Politicians and the Underground Prayer Movement|url=http://jeffsharlet.blogspot.com/2009/12/politicians-and-underground-prayer.html|publisher=jeffsharlet.blogspot.com|date=December 19, 2009|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

In 1975, a member of the Fellowship's inner circle wrote to the group's chief South African operative, that their political initiatives

<blockquote>... have always been misunderstood by 'outsiders.' As a result of very bitter experiences, therefore, we have learned never to commit to paper any discussions or negotiations that are taking place. There is no such thing as a 'confidential' memorandum, and leakage always seems to occur. Thus, I would urge you not to put on paper ''anything'' relating to any of the work that you are doing...

In 2002, Coe denied that the Fellowship Foundation owns the National Prayer Breakfast. Jennifer Thornett, a Fellowship employee, said that "there is no such thing as the Fellowship".<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

Former Republican senator [[William L. Armstrong|William Armstrong]] said the group has "made a fetish of being invisible".<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2008/03/hrc-says-wright-would-not-be-her-pastor-so-who-would-be "HRC Says Wright Would Not Be Her Pastor; So Who Would Be?."] ''Mother Jones'' (March 26, 2008).

On January 5, 2010, Fellowship member Bob Hunter gave an interview on national television in which he stated:

<blockquote>But I do agree with you, that The Fellowship is too secret. We don't have a Web site. We don't have – we have a lot of good ministers, 200 ministers doing good works that nobody knows about. I think that's wrong, and there's a debate going on among a lot of people about whether and how we should change that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34728459|title='The Rachel Maddow Show' for Tuesday, January 5th, 2010|publisher=NBC News|date=January 5, 2010|access-date=April 1, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

===National Prayer Breakfast===
{{main|National Prayer Breakfast}}
Fellowship Foundation is best known for the [[National Prayer Breakfast]], held each year on the first Thursday of February in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=npr>{{cite news|title='Family': Fundamentalism, Friends In High Places|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106115324|quote=Founded in 1935 in opposition to FDR's New Deal, the evangelical group's views on religion and politics are so singular that some other Christian-right organizations consider them heretical ...|work=[[National Public Radio]]|date=July 1, 2009|access-date=2009-07-02 }}</ref><ref name="sharlet"/> First held in 1953, the event is now attended by over 3,400 guests including dignitaries from many nations. The [[President of the United States]] typically makes an address at the breakfast, following the main speaker's keynote address. The event is hosted by a 24-member committee of members of Congress. Democrats and Republicans serve on the organizing committee, and chairmanship alternates each year between the House and the Senate.

At the National Prayer Breakfast, the president usually arrives an hour early and meets with eight to ten heads of state, usually of small nations, and guests chosen by the Fellowship.<ref>Jeff Sharlet, ''The Family'', (Harper, 2008), p.23.</ref><ref name=LindsayChristianMafia>{{cite journal|first=D. Michael|last=Lindsay|title=Is the National Prayer Breakfast Surrounded by a "Christian Mafia"?|url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/74/2/390|date=June 2006|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=74|issue=2|page=394|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj060|s2cid=145575486|issn=1477-4585|format=fee required|access-date=March 16, 2010}}</ref>

[[G. Philip Hughes]], the executive secretary for the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in the George H.W. Bush administration, said, "Doug Coe or someone who worked with him would call and say, 'So and so would like to have a word with the president. Do you think you could arrange something?'"<ref name=ShowingFaith/> However,  Coe has said that the Fellowship does not help foreign dignitaries gain access to U.S. officials. "We never make any commitment, ever, to arrange special meetings with the president, vice president or secretary of State," Coe said. "We would never do it."<ref name="ShowingFaith" />

At the 2001 Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings for State Department officials, Sen. [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] (D-FL), whose wife was on the board of the Fellowship, lamented that the State Department had blocked then-President Bush from meeting with four foreign heads of state (Rwanda, Macedonia, Congo and Slovakia) at the NPB that year.<ref name="ShowingFaith" /> Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) said of Nelson's complaint: "I'm not sure a head of state ought to be able to wander over here for the prayer breakfast and, in effect, compel the president of the United States to meet with him as a consequence... Getting these meetings with the president is a process that's usually very carefully vetted and worked up. Now sort of this back door has sort of evolved."<ref name="ShowingFaith" />

"It [the NPB] totally circumvents the State Department and the usual vetting within the administration that such a meeting would require," an anonymous government informant told sociologist [[D. Michael Lindsay]]. "If Doug Coe can get you some face time with the President of the United States, then you will take his call and seek his friendship. That's power."<ref>Lindsay, (2006), ''Is the National Prayer Breakfast Surrounded by a "Christian Mafia"?'', p. 395. Quoted in Sharlet, (2008), ''The Family'', p. 24</ref>

===Prayer Breakfast movement===
A primary activity of the Fellowship is to develop small support groups for politicians, including senators and members of Congress, Executive Branch officials, military officers, foreign leaders and dignitaries, businesspersons, and other influential individuals. Prayer groups have met in the [[White House]], [[the Pentagon]] and at the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].<ref name="alternet">Anthony Lappé, [http://www.alternet.org/story/16167/ "Meet 'The Family'"], ''Guerrilla News Network'', June 13, 2003</ref> By the early 1970s, prayer groups, breakfasts, and luncheons, including those sponsored by International Christian Leadership (ICL), had become commonplace in the Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lt.

In 2002, Reps. [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] (R-Va.), [[Tony P. Hall]] (D-Ohio) and Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) traveled to [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] on a fact-finding congressional trip, meeting with the leaders of both [[Muslim]] countries. According to Pitts, "The first thing we did when we met with [Afghan] [[Hamid Karzai|President Karzai]] and [then Pakistan] [[Pervez Musharraf|President Musharraf]] was to say, 'We're here officially representing the Congress; we'll report back to the speaker, our leaders, our committees, our government. But we're here also because we're best friends... We're members of the same prayer group'".<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

Coe has been dispatched to foreign governments with the blessing of Congressional representatives and has helped arrange meetings overseas for U.S. officials and members of Congress.<ref name=ShowingFaith/> In 1979, for instance, he messaged the [[Saudi Arabia]]n Minister of Commerce and asked him to meet with a [[U.S. Defense Department|Defense Department]] official who was visiting [[Riyadh]], the capital.<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

The Fellowship has brought controversial international figures to Washington to meet with U.S. officials. Among them are former Salvadoran Gen. [[Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova]], who in 2002 was found liable by a civil jury in Florida for the torture of thousands of civilians in the 1980s. He was invited to the 1984 prayer breakfast, along with Gen. [[Gustavo Alvarez Martinez]], then head of the Honduran armed forces who was linked to a death squad and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref name=ShowingFaith/><ref name=Lobe2004>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Lobe|date=July 1, 2004|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FG01Ak02.html|title=New US envoy: Past and present|publisher=[[Asia Times Online]]|access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref>

Coe was quoted in a rare interview regarding the Fellowship's associations with despots as explaining, "The people that are involved in this association of people around the world are the worst and the best, some are total despots. Some are totally religious. You can find what you want to find."<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

Coe also has claimed that the Fellowship does not help foreign dignitaries gain access to U.S. officials. "We never make any commitment, ever, to arrange special meetings with the president, vice president or secretary of State", Coe said. "We would never do it". The LA Times found that "the archives tell another story".<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

In January 1991, Fellowship associate and financial supporter Michael Timmis met President [[Pierre Buyoya]] of [[Burundi]] on behalf of the Fellowship, then flew to [[Kenya]] with Arthur (Gene) Dewey, the former second-in-command at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Sam Owen, then living in [[Nairobi]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Timmis|author2=Fickett, Harold |title=Between Two Worlds|url=http://womenathome.typepad.com/savvymom/2008/03/between-two-wor.html|date=March 15, 2008|work=Book excerpt|publisher=Savvy Mom|access-date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> Timmis wrote that he had obtained permission to fly over Tanzanian air space, even though the [[U.S. Department of State]] had ordered American citizens to stay clear of Tanzania.

The Fellowship has promoted reconciliation between the warring leaders of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Burundi]], and [[Rwanda]]. In 2001, the Fellowship helped arrange a secret meeting at The Cedars between Democratic Republic of Congo President [[Joseph Kabila]] and Rwandan President [[Paul Kagame]] – one of the first discreet meetings between the two African leaders that led to a peace accord in July 2002.<ref name=ShowingFaith/>

In 1994 at the National Prayer Breakfast, the Fellowship helped to persuade South African [[Zulu people|Zulu]] chief [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] not to engage in a civil war with [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref>Sharlet, Jeff (2008). "The Family." Harper Perennial. Page 24.</ref>

According to Jeff Sharlet, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R.-Kan.) is a Fellowship member who leads a secret "cell" of leading U.S. Senators and representatives to influence U.S. foreign policy.<ref name=GodsSenator>{{cite web|last=Sharlet|first=Jeff|date=January 25, 2006|title=God's Senator|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9178374/gods_senator|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> Sharlet reports that the group has stamped much of U.S. foreign policy through a group of senators and affiliated religious organizations forming the "Values Action Team" or "VAT".<ref name=GodsSenator/> One victory for the group was Brownback's North Korea Human Rights Act, which establishes a confrontational stance toward North Korea and shifts funds for humanitarian aid from the UN to Christian organizations.<ref name=GodsSenator/>

====The Fellowship and Uganda====
In a November 2009 [[NPR]] interview, Sharlet alleged that Ugandan Fellowship associates [[David Bahati]] and [[James Nsaba Buturo|Nsaba Buturo]] were behind the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014|recent proposed bill]] in [[Uganda]] that called for the [[death penalty]] for [[homosexual|gays]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret Political Reach Of 'The Family'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=120746516|publisher=NPR|date=November 24, 2009|access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> Bahati cited a conversation with Fellowship members in 2008 as having inspired the legislation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Resentment Toward the West Bolsters Uganda's New Anti-Gay Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/world/africa/ugandan-lawmakers-push-anti-homosexuality-bill-again.html|work=New York Times|date=February 28, 2012|access-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref>

Fellowship member Bob Hunter gave an interview to [[NPR]] in December 2009 in which he acknowledged Bahati's connection but argued that no American associates support the bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Different Perspective On 'The Family' And Uganda|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121755993&ps=cprs|publisher=NPR|date=December 22, 2009|access-date=December 24, 2009}}</ref>  President [[Barack Obama]], in his address to the Fellowship at their National Prayer Breakfast in early 2010, directly criticized the Uganda legislation targeting gay people for execution.

==Handling of politicians' extramarital affairs==
In 2009, the Fellowship received media attention in connection with three Republican politicians who reportedly engaged in extra-marital affairs.<ref name=wp-2009-06-25>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/25/AR2009062504480.html|title=The Political Enclave That Dare Not Speak Its Name|author=Roig-Franzia, Manuel|date=June 26, 2009|access-date=July 18, 2009|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="Thrush"/><ref name="on the Family"/><ref name=3rd-C-st/> Two of them, Senator [[John Ensign]], chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate and the fourth-ranking member in his party's Senate leadership, and South Carolina Governor [[Mark Sanford]], immediate past chair of the Republican Governors Association and U.S. Representative from 1995 to 2001, were considering running for president in 2012.<ref name=wp-2009-06-25/><ref name="Thrush"/><ref name="on the Family"/><ref>Murray, Mark (June 1, 2009) [https://archive.today/20120712130839/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/06/01/1948683.aspx "GOP WATCH: ENSIGN IN IOWA."] MSNBC.

===Ensign affair===
Ensign, a Fellowship member and longtime resident of the C Street Center, admitted in June 2009 to an extra-marital affair with Cindy Hampton. Hampton was Ensign's campaign treasurer and the wife of his co-chief of staff, longtime friend and fellow worshipper Doug Hampton.<ref name=McFadden1123>{{cite web|last=McFadden|first=Cynthia|author2=Arons, Melinda |author3=Sher, Lauren |date=November 23, 2009|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/doug-hampton-speaks-sen-john-ensigns-affair-ethic/story?id=9140788|title=Exclusive: Doug Hampton Speaks Out on Sen. Ensign's Affair With His Wife|publisher=[[ABC News]]|access-date=December 5, 2009}}</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the C Street House "pulsed with backstage intrigue, in the days and months before the Sanford and Ensign scandals" and that residents tried to talk each politician into ending his philandering. An emotional meeting was reportedly held to discuss "forgiveness" between Hampton, the husband of Ensign's mistress, and Senator [[Tom Coburn]].<ref name=wp-2009-06-25/> Coburn, with Timothy and David Coe, leaders of the Fellowship, attempted to intervene to end Ensign's affair in February 2008 by meeting with Hampton and convincing Ensign to write a letter to Hampton's wife breaking off the affair.<ref name=wp-2009-06-25/><ref name="Thrush">{{cite web|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|date=July 8, 2009|title=Ensign "letter" to mistress: I used you for "pleasure"|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0709/LV_Sun_publishes_Ensign_letter_to_mistress.html|work=Politico|access-date=July 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name="on the Family">{{cite web|last=Maddow|first=Rachel|title=The Rachael Maddow Show|date=July 10, 2009|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31890176|publisher=NBC News|access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Ensign was chaperoned by Coburn and other members from C Street, where Ensign lives with Coburn, to  post the letter.<ref name=wp-2009-06-25/><ref name="Thrush"/><ref name="on the Family"/> Ensign called Hampton's wife hours later to tell her to ignore the letter and flew out to spend the weekend with her in [[Nevada]].<ref name=wp-2009-06-25/><ref name="Thrush"/><ref name="on the Family"/>

Doug Hampton said he was not directly advised by the Fellowship to cover up Ensign's affair with his wife, but instead to "be cool". After losing his job with Ensign and losing a subsequent lobbying job, Hampton has said that he was in financial distress and reached out to Coburn—a C Street resident—in an effort to reach an agreement with Ensign.<ref name=McFadden1123/> Coburn has denied negotiating a deal, but has stated that he "had worked to 'bring two families to a closure of a very painful episode'".<ref name=McFadden1123/> Hampton has expressed the belief that his friends at C Street abandoned him by choosing to close ranks around Ensign, and that for them, the episode was "[more] about preserving John [Ensign], preserving the Republican party...preserving C Street" than about doing the right thing.<ref name=McFadden1123/>

Ensign's efforts to cover up his affair were investigated by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Senate Ethics Committee]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].<ref>Lipton, Eric (December 4, 2009).

===Role in affair of Mark Sanford===

==Property holdings==

===Arlington===
Fellowship Foundation purchased a large old house in 1978 in the Woodmont neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, called ‘The Doubleday Mansion’. Now called ‘The Cedars’, it was called 'Hillcrest Farm' under Frye-Vanderbilt ownership, 'Four Winds' while owned by [[Howard Hughes]], and the 'TWA House' by the press when a [[TWA]] executive used it to lobby for control of international airline routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sedonalegendhelenfrye.com/1943.html|title=Sedona Legend Helen Frye- the Jack and Helen Frye Story!|website=www.sedonalegendhelenfrye.com}}</ref> The 70-acre home less than 3 miles from the White House, which also has homes for volunteers, a detached two-story garage and a gardener's cottage, is zoned as a worship and teaching center. The home is used as a center for Bible studies, counseling, hymn sings, life mentoring, prayer groups, prayer breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, and hospitality receptions for international reconciliation and conflict resolution initiatives. The home was once surrounded by cedar trees and so was renamed Cedars. It is a historic landmark house and is situated adjacent to a commemorative recreational county park, once the homestead of writer C. F. Henry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CountyBoard/meetings/2004/nov/1116/34.pdf|title=County Board Agenda Item|date=2004-10-16|access-date=2009-07-18|publisher=Arlington County, VA}}</ref>

Coe has described Cedars as a place "committed to the care of the underprivileged, even though it looks very wealthy." He noted that people might say, "Why don't you sell a chandelier and help poor people?" Answering his own question, Coe said, "The people who come here have tremendous influence over kids." Private documents indicate that Cedars was purchased so that "people throughout the world who carry heavy responsibilities could meet in Washington to think together, plan together and pray together about personal and public problems and opportunities."<ref name=ShowingFaith/> Cedars is host to dozens of prayer breakfasts, luncheons and dinners for ambassadors, congressional representatives, foreign religious leaders and many others.

In March 1990, [[Youth With A Mission]] (YWAM; organization which also previously owned the C Street Center) purchased a nearby property located at 2200 24th Street North for $580,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=2200 24th ST N|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/realestate/reassessments/scripts/Inquiry.asp?action=view&lrsn=7673|work=Dept. of Real Estate Assessments|publisher=[[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]|date=June 30, 2009|access-date=August 30, 2009}}</ref> The property was used as another gathering place for bible study.
