The '''Government Communications Security Bureau''' ('''GCSB''') ({{lang-mi|Te Tira Tiaki}}) is the [[public service|public-service]] department of [[New Zealand]] charged with promoting New Zealand's [[national security]] by collecting and analysing information of an intelligence nature.

According to the Bureau's official website, it has a mission of contributing to the national security of New Zealand by providing information assurance and [[cybersecurity]], foreign intelligence, and assistance to other New Zealand government agencies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.gcsb.govt.nz/our-work/| title=Our work| accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

==History==
The Government Communications Security Bureau was created in 1977 on the instructions of [[Robert Muldoon]], the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]]. [[File:Waihopai Valley base (2005).jpg|frame|right|[[Waihopai Station|Waihopai Valley base]]]]
Prior to this, the functions now handled by the GCSB were split between three organisations:
*Communications security was the responsibility of the [[New Zealand Communications Security Committee|Communications Security Committee]], based around the Prime Minister's office and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].
*[[Signals intelligence]] was the responsibility of the [[New Zealand Combined Signals Organisation|Combined Signals Organisation]], run by the military.
*Anti-bugging measures were the responsibility of the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]].

Upon its establishment, the GCSB assumed responsibility for these three roles. Officially, the new organisation was part of the Ministry of Defence, and its functions and activities were highly secret{{spaced ndash}}even [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] was not informed. In the 1980s, however, information was gradually released, first about the GCSB's security role, and then about its signals intelligence operations.

Also in the 1980s, the GCSB was split away from the [[Ministry of Defence (New Zealand)|Ministry of Defence]], becoming a separate organisation. It was not until 2000, however, that it was decided to make the GCSB a government department in its own right. This decision was implemented through the [[Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0009/latest/whole.html#dlm187178 |title=Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 No 9 (as at 29 November 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=There continues to be an instrument of the Executive Government of New Zealand known as the Government Communications Security Bureau. |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, the Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection was formed within the GCSB with a mandate to assist in the protection of national [[critical infrastructure]] from information-borne threats. The National Cyber Security Centre was established within the GCSB in September 2011, and it absorbed the functions of the Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection.<ref>[http://www.nzic.govt.nz/about-us/gcsb/ Government Communications Security Bureau]. New Zealand Intelligence Community.</ref>

==Staff and budget==
The GCSB is considered to be a government department in its own right with its head office in Pipitea St, Wellington. Through its director, the GCSB reports to the [[minister (government)|minister]] holding the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|Intelligence]] portfolio, who, by convention, is always the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]]. Its main functions are: the collection and processing of intelligence, the distribution of intelligence, IT security, technology and administration. It has slightly over 400 employees<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/BIM-Redacted.pdf|title=Briefing to the Incoming Minister 2017|work=gcsb.govt.nz|accessdate=13 December 2017}}.</ref> with a range of disciplines including foreign language experts, communications and cryptography specialists, engineers, technicians and support staff.<ref>''The what, where why of NZ's spy agencies'', Dominion Post, 13 April 2013, page C2.</ref>

In 2015/16 the budget for the GCSB was $89.6 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2015/by/dept/gcsb.htm|title=Government Communications Security Bureau|work=budget.govt.nz|accessdate=10 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001030103/http://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2015/by/dept/gcsb.htm|archive-date=1 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Former Green MP [[Keith Locke]] says that despite the attention the GCSB received as a result of its illegal surveillance of [[Kim Dotcom]], there has been little public discussion about its value. Locke questions GCSB's suitability for the task of protecting government computers given its security failures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/kim-dotcom-case/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503274&objectid=10854676|title=Keith Locke: Dotcom case shows the cost of spying is spooky|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> Cabinet Secretary [[Rebecca Kitteridge]]'s report noted the Bureau's problems included "under-resourcing and a lack of legal staff".

== Oversight ==
An [[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (New Zealand)|Inspector-General]] has oversight of the GCSB (and other intelligence organisations). The current Inspector-General is Cheryl Gwyn, who began her three year term on 5 May 2014. The office of the Inspector-General also consists of Deputy Inspector-General Ben Keith, and a number of investigating staff. A statutory advisory panel of two members also provides advice to the Inspector-General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igis.govt.nz/about/|title=The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref>

The Prime Minister appoints both the director of the GCSB and the Inspector General. Associate Professor of law at Auckland University, Bill Hodge, says the watchdog should be appointed by Parliament rather than by the Prime Minister. Former prime minister, Sir [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] agrees: "There needs to be some separation between the inspector and the agency he oversees."<ref name="Who is watching the watchers">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/8546280/Who-is-watching-the-watchers|title=Who is watching the watchers?|work=Stuff|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

==Operations==
The functions of the GCSB include [[signals intelligence]], [[communications security]], [[technical surveillance counter-measures|anti-bugging measures]], and [[computer security]]. The GCSB does not publicly disclose the nature of the communications which it intercepts. It is frequently described by some authors, such as [[Nicky Hager]], as part of [[ECHELON]]. In 2006, after the death of former Prime Minister [[David Lange]], a 1985–86 report given to Lange was found among his papers, having been mistakenly released. The report listed a number of countries as targets of GCSB efforts, including [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Argentina]], [[France]], [[Vietnam]], and many small Pacific island states. It also mentioned [[United Nations]] diplomatic traffic. In his book on the GCSB, Nicky Hager says that during the [[Cold War]], the locations and activities of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ships (including civilian craft such as fishing trawlers) were a major focus of the organisation's activities.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10363782">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10363782 |title=Lange papers reveal US spy threats |date=15 January 2006 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

For the purposes of its signals intelligence activities, the GCSB maintains two "listening stations": a satellite communications interception station at [[Waihopai Station|GCSB Waihopai]] near [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and a radio communications interception station at [[GCSB Tangimoana]] near [[Palmerston North]].<ref>Nicky Hager, ''Secret Power'', pp. 258–266.</ref> On 16 March 2015, the former [[National Security Agency]] contractor and [[whistleblower]] Edward Snowden disclosed that New Zealand's GCSB agency had a secret listening post, codenamed "Caprica", at the New Zealand High Commission in [[Honiara]], the capital of the [[Solomon Islands]]. The "Caprica" outpost was reportedly modeled after the American [[National Security Agency]]'s [[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]] outposts at selected United States Embassies across the world.<ref name="NZHerald March 16, 2015">{{cite news|last1=Hager|first1=Nicky|last2=Gallagher|first2=Ryan|title=GCSB had Solomons post, papers show|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11417762|accessdate=16 March 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=16 March 2015}}</ref>

The GCSB is characterised by its focus on foreign intelligence gathering and is unable to collect intelligence on New Zealand citizens. Because of this, the agency is reliant on the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service for domestic intelligence gathering. If the GCSB were to collect data on New Zealanders, this would be in violation of the GCSB Amendment Bill.<ref>Andrew Brunatti ''The architecture of community'', p. 127.</ref>

=== GCSB strategic plan; 2016 - 2020 ===
The 2016 - 2020 strategic plan entails what the GCSB is aiming to achieve in the years until 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/assets/GCSB-Annual-Reports/GCSB-Annual-Report-2017.pdf|title=GCSB and NZSIS|website=Beehive|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> Its two main focuses are; '''impenetrable infrastructure'<nowiki/>'' and '''indispensable intelligence.''' "New Zealand’s most important information infrastructures are impenetrable to technology-borne compromise. We call this aim impenetrable infrastructure; and New Zealand’s intelligence generates unique policy and operational impacts for New Zealand. We call this aim indispensable intelligence." They plan to do this through the set up of eight priority objectives, including; recruiting and retaining the best employees, replacing high grade infrastructure and continuing to modernise the GCSB's access and [[tradecraft]].<ref name=":0" />

==Waihopai station==
[[File:Waihopai 1.jpg|thumb|The Waihopai facility]]

The [[Waihopai Station]] has been operating since 1989. It is described as a satellite [[espionage|communications monitoring]] facility in the [[Waihopai (region)|Waihopai Valley]], near [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]].<ref>[http://www.gcsb.govt.nz/aboutus/dscu.html About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162706/http://www.gcsb.govt.nz/aboutus/dscu.html |date=27 September 2007 }}. Government Communications Security Bureau.</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/new_zealand/gcsb.htm Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB)].

Few details of the facility are known, but it is believed that it intercepts and processes all phone calls, faxes, e-mail and computer data communications. The site is a regular target for protesters and activists who are attempting to have the base closed down. The [[Anti-Bases Campaign]] have had regular yearly protests at the base.

==Tangimoana station==
The [[Tangimoana Station]] was opened in 1982, replacing an earlier facility at [[Irirangi]], near [[Waiouru]].  According to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the facility is part of [[ECHELON]]; its role in this capacity was first identified publicly by peace researcher [[Owen Wilkes]] in 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronet.nl/~rembert/echelon/sp.html|title=Secret Power – Press and Praise|work=euronet.nl|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> and investigated in detail by peace activist and independent journalist [[Nicky Hager]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/sp/sp_c2.htm|title=Chapter Two: Hooked up to the spy network: The UKUSA system|work=fas.org|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

== Notable activities and controversies ==

=== Appointment of Ian Fletcher ===
Ian Fletcher was appointed as director of the GCSB in February 2012.<ref name="Spy boss got job after call from PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8500427/Spy-boss-got-job-after-call-from-PM|title=Spy boss got job after call from PM|work=Stuff|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> Mr Fletcher is a former diplomat. Fletcher was interviewed by the appointment panel after an earlier short-list of four candidates had been rejected by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the State Services Commissioner. In March 2013, Mr Key admitted he had known Mr Fletcher since they were in school, but denied they were friends.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-grilled-over-link-with-GCSB-head/tabid/1607/articleID/292036/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Key grilled over link with GCSB head| date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

Answering questions in parliament about Mr Fletcher's appointment, Key said he hadn't "seen the guy in a long time"<ref name="Key met spy candidate for breakfast">[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/8588379/Key-met-spy-candidate-for-breakfast Key met spy candidate for breakfast], Dominion Post</ref>  and hadn't mentioned he had made a phone call to Mr Fletcher when the question first came up in parliament because he had "forgotten" about it.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Keys-faulty-memory-on-GCSB-an-excuse---Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/292940/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Key's faulty memory on GCSB an 'excuse'| date= 4 April 2013| access-date= 3 April 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140112035626/http://www.3news.co.nz/Keys-faulty-memory-on-GCSB-an-excuse---Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/292940/Default.aspx| archive-date= 12 January 2014| url-status= dead}}</ref> Former GCSB director [[Bruce Ferguson (RNZAF officer)|Sir Bruce Ferguson]] said the way Key had intervened in the selection process was "disturbing".<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Former-GCSB-head-Sir-Bruce-Ferguson-speaks-out/tabid/817/articleID/292879/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Former GCSB head Sir Bruce Ferguson speaks out| date= 4 April 2013| access-date= 3 April 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140112053924/http://www.3news.co.nz/Former-GCSB-head-Sir-Bruce-Ferguson-speaks-out/tabid/817/articleID/292879/Default.aspx| archive-date= 12 January 2014| url-status= dead}}</ref> The Labour Party called for an inquiry into the matter.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-brushes-off-Labours-spy-review-call/tabid/1607/articleID/293380/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Key brushes off Labour's spy review call| date=8 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Illegal spying ===
Shortly before Fletcher was appointed, the GCSB was found to have illegally spied on [[Kim Dotcom]], a German national but New Zealand resident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10837715|title=Dotcom case: GCSB review ordered |last=Shuttleworth |first=Kate |date=1 October 2012 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> By law the agency cannot spy on New Zealand residents. The GCSB admitted that Hugh Wolfensohn, acting director at the time, knew the organisation was spying on Dotcom. It is believed Mr Wolfensohn was placed on "[[gardening leave]]" after it became clear the GCSB had made a mistake in spying on Dotcom.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Senior-spy-faces-sack-over-Dotcom-debacle/tabid/1607/articleID/273114/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Spy faces sack over Dotcom debacle| date=17 October 2012}}</ref> In December, the [[High Court of New Zealand]] ruled [[Kim Dotcom]] could sue the GCSB for damages.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-taking-GCSB-to-court/tabid/1607/articleID/279439/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Dotcom taking GCSB to court| date=6 December 2012}}</ref> The attorney-general appealed the ruling, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-wins-right-to-sue-Govt-spies/tabid/423/articleID/289342/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Dotcom wins right to sue Govt spies| date=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10869764 |work=NZ Herald |title=Dotcom wins right to sue| date=7 March 2013}}</ref> In March 2013, the [[The New Zealand Herald|NZ Herald]] reported that Wolfensohn "no longer works for the GCSB intelligence agency as it braces for fresh exposure of its failings".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10871905|title=Spy boss left out in cold|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Kitteridge report ===
As a result of the Dotcom saga, a review into the bureau's compliance with legislation and its internal systems and processes was conducted by Cabinet Secretary [[Rebecca Kitteridge]]. In April 2013, Kitteridge's report<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/assets/GCSB-Compliance-Review/Review-of-Compliance.pdf| title=Review of Compliance at the Government Communications Security Bureau| date=22 March 2013| first=Rebecca| last=Kitteridge}}</ref> was leaked to the media. It contradicted GCSB head Ian Fletcher's comments that the bureau had not unlawfully spied on anyone other than Dotcom showing that the GCSB may have unlawfully spied on up to 85 people between April 2003 and September 2012.<ref name="nzherald.co.nz">{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10876344|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015907/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10876344|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Report: Up to 85 cases of illegal spying uncovered|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

[[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] reported "The review noted a series of failings had led to the illegal spying, including under-resourcing and a lack of legal staff." It found "the GCSB structure was overly complex and top heavy, while staff who performed poorly were tolerated, rather than dismissed or disciplined, so they would not pose a security risk upon leaving the bureau."<ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/> The [[Green Party of New Zealand|Green Party]] asked police to investigate the illegal spying.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Greens-ask-police-to-extend-spy-inquiry/tabid/1607/articleID/293995/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Greens ask police to extend spy inquiry| date=12 April 2013}}</ref>

Kitteridge also said she had trouble accessing a number of "basic files". Prime Minister John Key said there was no "cover-up", and the files were probably either misfiled or never existed in the first place.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/key-rejects-gscb-coverup-2013041608|work=3 News NZ |title= Key rejects GSCB (sic) cover-up| date=16 April 2013}}</ref>

=== GCSB Amendment Bill ===
On 8 May 2013, the National Prime Minister [[John Key]] introduced the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill, which would extend the powers of the GCSB to enable it to collect information from all New Zealanders for the use of other government departments including the [[New Zealand Police]], [[New Zealand Defence Force|Defence Force]] and the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12122_1/government-communications-security-bureau-and-related-legislation |title=Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=8 May 2013 |website=New Zealand Parliament website |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> Under the bill, the GCSB will have three main functions. Firstly, it will continue to collect foreign intelligence but it will not be allowed to spy on New Zealanders. Secondly, it will give the GCSB a legal mandate to assist the police, Defence Force and the Security Intelligence Service. Thirdly, it will extend the GCSB's cyber-security functions to encompass protecting private-sector cyber systems.<ref name="NZ Herald August 21">{{cite news|last=Young |first=Andrew |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11112152 |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |title=GCSB bill passes after final reading | date=21 August 2013}}</ref>

While this Bill was supported by the ruling [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and its coalition partners [[ACT New Zealand]] and the [[United Future]] MP [[Peter Dunne]], it was opposed by the opposition [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green parties]], several left-wing groups, and the internet millionaire [[Kim Dotcom]], the [[New Zealand Law Society|NZ Law Society]], and the Human Rights Tribunal. On 27 July, opponents of the GCSB Amendment Bill staged nationwide protests in eleven major towns and cities, thousands attended.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/thousands-gcsb-bill-protesters-hit-streets-5520305|work=TVNZ One News |title= Thousands of GCSB Bill protestors hit the streets| date=27 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10904220|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |title= Protest marches against GCSB bill across NZ| date=27 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="TVNZ July 27">{{cite news| url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/pm-dismisses-protests-against-gcsb-bill-misinformed-5520686|work=TVNZ One News |title= PM dismisses protests against GCSB Bill as 'misinformed' | date=28 July 2013}}</ref> Critics of the GCSB Amendment Bill claimed that the Bill would turn New Zealand into a [[police state]] like the former [[German Democratic Republic]] and made references to [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]'' and the ongoing [[Edward Snowden]] [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|NSA Leaks scandal]].

On 14 August 2013 the Prime Minister of New Zealand [[John Key]] addressed what he identified as "misinformation" surrounding the GCSB Amendment Bill, claiming that the actions of the Government Communications Security Bureau were analogous to [[Norton AntiVirus]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/John-Key-defends-the-GCSB-bill/tabid/817/articleID/309018/Default.aspx| title=John Key defends the GCSB bill| date=14 August 2013| publisher=3news| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825102746/http://www.3news.co.nz/John-Key-defends-the-GCSB-Bill/tabid/817/articleID/309018/Default.aspx| archivedate=25 August 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 21 August, the House of Representatives voted to pass the GCSB Amendment Bill by 61 to 59. The bill passed its third reading despite protests from the opposition parties, human rights groups, legal advocates, and technology groups. John Key defended the GCSB Amendment Bill by arguing that it did not authorize "wholesale spying" on New Zealanders and that its opponents were misinformed.<ref name="NZ Herald August 21" /><ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23769206 |agency=BBC News |title= New Zealand passes law for domestic spying| date=21 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Southern Cross Cable mass surveillance ===
{{Global surveillance}}
{{see also|Southern Cross Cable#Spying and interception}}
In 2013 the ''New Zealand Herald'' reported that the owners of the [[Southern Cross Cable]], New Zealand's majority (≈95%) international internet access point, had asked the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to pay them for mass surveillance of New Zealand internet activity through the cable.<ref name="nzh-jm">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11222413 |title=GCSB holding doors open while US buddies invade our privacy |date=14 May 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=[[John Minto]]}}</ref> In May 2014, [[John Minto]], vice-president of the New Zealand [[Mana Party]], alleged that the NSA was carrying out mass surveillance on all meta-data and content that went out of New Zealand through the cable.<ref name="nzh-jm" />

In August 2014, New Zealand [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] stated that an interception point was being established on the Southern Cross Cable.<ref name="rnz-rn">{{cite web |url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/251191/govt-called-to-account-for-spy-claims |title=Govt called to account for spy claims |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=1 August 2014}}</ref> Norman said that as the cable is the only point of telecommunications access from New Zealand, this would allow the Government to spy on all phone calls and internet traffic from New Zealand.<ref name="rnz-rn" /> Norman's claims followed the revelation that an engineer from the NSA had visited New Zealand earlier in the year to discuss how to intercept traffic on the Southern Cross cable.<ref name="rnz-rn" /> The office of [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] denied the claims, but admitted that they were negotiating a "cable access programme" with the NSA, while refusing to clarify what that was or why the NSA was involved.<ref name="rnz-rn" />

===2015 Edward Snowden surveillance disclosures===
On 5 March 2015, [[The Intercept]] website and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' newspaper disclosed that the Government Communications Security Bureau had been spying on New Zealand's South Pacific neighbors including [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]], [[Kiribati]], [[Samoa]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Tonga]], and the French [[overseas department]]s of [[New Caledonia]] and [[French Polynesia]]. The Intercept provided documents supplied by the US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]], who had earlier released leaked documents relating to the surveillance activities of other [[Five Eyes]] partners including the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The Snowden documents show that information collected by the GCSB is sent to the American [[National Security Agency]] to plug holes in the global intelligence network. Most of the surveillance was carried out from the GCSB's [[Waihopai Station]] in the South Island. Under the premiership of Prime Minister John Key, the GCSB had expanded its intelligence-gathering activities in support of the Five Eyes.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11411759 |last1=Hager |first1=Nicky |last2=Gallagher |first2=Ryan |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |title= Snowden revelations / The price of the Five Eyes club: Mass spying on friendly nations| date=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=New Zealand Spies on Neighbors in Secret 'Five Eyes' global surveillance|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/04/new-zealand-gcsb-surveillance-waihopai-xkeyscore/|website=The Intercept|publisher=First Look Media|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

According to investigative journalist and peace activist [[Nicky Hager]], the GCSB had gone from a selective targeting of South Pacific targets to collected a wide breadth of emails messages and telephone calls. He added that the spy agency had upgraded its Waihopai spy base in 2009 to collect both the content and meta-data of all communications, rather than specific individuals and agencies. According to leaked documents supplied by Snowden, the GCSB collected a wide trove of electronic information including emails, mobile and fixed line phone calls, and social media messages from various South Pacific countries. In addition, Snowden alleged that a GCSB officer had also worked with the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] to spy on the Indonesian cellphone company [[Telkomsel]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Zealand spying on South Pacific neighbors, Snowden documents show|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/5/new-zealand-spying-on-south-pacific-neighbors.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera America]]|date=5 March 2015}}</ref>

The GCSB's mass surveillance program was criticized by opposition parties including the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]], who told the press that New Zealand risked damaging its relationship with the South Pacific and that the GCSB's actions amounted to an invasion of people's privacy. In 2014, New Zealand had secured a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]] with the support of the entire Pacific region on the platform that "New Zealand stands up for small states."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=Snowden GCSB revelations/Russel Norman says GCSB breaking the law|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11411730|accessdate=6 March 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=5 March 2015}}</ref> The Green Party also laid a complaint with the [[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (New Zealand)|Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security]], alleging that the GCSB had broken the law by spying on New Zealanders who were holidaying in the South Pacific. In response, Brian Fergurson, a former director of the GCSB, acknowledged that the spy agency did collect emails and other electronic communications but that it did not use material about New Zealanders captured inadvertently.<ref>{{cite news|title=GCSB in mass collection of Pacific data: Ferguson|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/267923/gcsb-in-mass-collection-of-pacific-data-ferguson|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Radio New Zealand News|date=6 March 2015}}</ref>

The [[Prime Minister of Tonga|Tongan Prime Minister]] [[ʻAkilisi Pohiva]] has denounced New Zealand's espionage activities as a "breach of trust." He also expressed concerns about similar surveillance activities carried out by [[China]]. The [[Prime Minister of Samoa|Samoan Prime Minister]] [[Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi|Tuilaepa Sa'ilele]] has by contrast dismissed allegations of New Zealand espionage against Samoa, commenting that "it would be far fetched to think that a spy agency in any country would waste their resources doing that kind of thing to Samoa." In response to these disclosures, Prime Minister John Key issued a statement on 5 March 2015 saying that he would "neither confirm nor deny" whether New Zealand's spy agencies were spying on the South Pacific. Key had earlier acknowledged that New Zealand was a member of the Five Eyes club, which included the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, during a speech calling for New Zealand to deploy troops to Iraq to combat the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/66972448/gcsb-committing-crimes-against-whole-countries--greens  |last1=Gulliver |first1=Aimee |last2=Field |first2=Michael |website=Stuff.co.nz |title=GCSB committing crimes against whole countries – Greens| date=5 March 2015}}</ref>

On 11 March 2015, Edward Snowden disclosed that the Government Communications Security Bureau was also using the Waihopai Station to intercept transmissions from several [[Pacific Rim]] and Asian countries including [[Vietnam]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and several unspecified [[South American]] nations. He added that the GCSB was helping the National Security Agency to fill gaps in its world surveillance data collection.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hager|first1=Nicky|last2=Gallagher|first2=Ryan|title=Snowden revelations: NZ's spy reach stretches across the globe|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11415172|accessdate=11 March 2015|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 March 2015}}</ref> In response to Snowden's disclosures, [[Una Jagose]], the Acting-Director of the GCSB issued a statement that the spy agency was collecting less information that it was seven years ago during a session of the [[New Zealand Parliament]]'s [[Intelligence and Security Committee (New Zealand)|Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vance|first1=Andrea|title=GCSB spies 'collecting less intelligence'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/67228330/gcsb-spies-collecting-less-intelligence|accessdate=13 March 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=11 March 2015}}</ref> According to the GCSB's latest annual report, the volume of phone and electronic surveillance carried out on New Zealanders surged throughout 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=GCSB's spying on Kiwis surges over year|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11416285|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=13 March 2015}}</ref> On 13 March 2015, the Fijian military commander [[Brigadier-General]] [[Mosese Tikoitoga]] confirmed that the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Fijian Military Forces]] were aware of the GCSB's intelligence-gathering activities in Fiji.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Su|first1=Reissa|title=Fiji Military Aware of New Zealand Spying; GCSB accused of mass surveillance on Asian countries|url=http://ibtimes.com/fiji-military-aware-new-zealand-spying-gcsb-accused-mass-surveillance-asian-countries-1429099|accessdate=15 March 2015|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=13 March 2015}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On 15 March 2015, the journalists Nicky Hager and [[Ryan Gallagher]] reported in the ''New Zealand Herald'' that the GCSB was using the NSA's internet mass surveillance system [[XKeyscore]] to intercept email communications from several leading Solomon Islands government ministers, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)|Solomons Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], and the Solomons anti-corruption campaigner [[Benjamin Afuga]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hager|first1=Nicky|last2=Gallagher|first2=Ryan|title=Revealed: The names NZ targeted using NSA's XKeyscore system|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11417386|accessdate=15 March 2015|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=15 March 2015}}</ref> In response the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Murray McCully]] downplayed reports of the spying disclosures by asserting that Pacific Islands ministers "were smart enough not to believe what they read in New Zealand newspapers." He also offered to discuss their concerns about the mass surveillance program in private. The Solomons Chief of Staff, [[Robert Iroga]], has condemned the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]]'s actions for damaging New Zealand's image as a "friendly government" in the South Pacific. He added that communications within the inner circle of the Solomons Government was "highly secret information" that rightfully belong to the Solomon Islanders.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=GCSB spied on inner circle of former Solomon Islands PM and anti-corruption campaigner|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11417445|accessdate=15 March 2015|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=15 March 2015}}</ref>

On 16 March 2015, Snowden released more documents which revealed that the GCSB had a secret listening post, codenamed "Caprica", at the New Zealand High Commission in the Solomon Islands capital of [[Honiara]]. The "Caprica" outpost was reportedly modeled after the NSA's [[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]] outposts at selected United States Embassies across the world.<ref name="NZHerald March 16, 2015" /> On 22 March 2015, The Intercept released a new document which showed that the GCSB had monitored the email and internet communications of several foreign diplomats vying for the position of [[Director-General of the World Trade Organization]]. This surveillance was carried out on behalf of the New Zealand Trade Minister [[Tim Groser]], who was also competing for that position. Known targets included candidates from [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ghana]], [[Jordan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Korea]]. Ultimately, Groser's candidature was unsuccessful and the Brazilian diplomat [[Roberto Azevêdo]] was elected as the Director General of the WTO on May 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=GCSB spies monitored diplomats in line for World Trade Organisation job|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11421371|accessdate=23 March 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=23 March 2015}}</ref> In response to these disclosures, [[Sergio Danese]], the Secretary-General of the [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of External Relations]] summoned the [[List of ambassadors of New Zealand to Brazil|New Zealand Ambassador]] [[Caroline Bilkey]] to explain the actions of her government.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Audrey|title=GCSB spying reports: Brazil demands an explanation from New Zealand|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11424168|accessdate=28 March 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=27 March 2015}}</ref>

On 26 March 2015, the [[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (New Zealand)|Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security]] [[Cheryl Gywn]] announced that she would lead an inquiry into the allegations that the GCSB had spied on New Zealanders working in the Pacific. Prime Minister John Key has welcomed this inquiry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=GCSB will be investigated over claims New Zealanders spied on in Pacific|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/67518446/gcsb-will-be-investigated-over-claims-new-zealanders-spied-on-in-pacific|accessdate=28 March 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=26 March 2015}}</ref> On 16 April 2015, The Intercept and ''New Zealand Herald'' disclosed that the GCSB had been both spying on and sharing intelligence with the [[Bangladesh]] government, using a leaked [[National Security Agency]] document entitled "NSA Intelligence Relationship with New Zealand." The Bangladeshi security forces have been implicated in various human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and torture.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hager|first1=Nicky|last2=Gallagher|first2=Ryan|title=Secret documents shine light on GCSB spying on Bangladesh|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11433216|accessdate=18 April 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=16 April 2015}}</ref> The New Zealand Government has refused to respond to these disclosures but opposition parties have criticized the GCSB for cooperating with Bangladeshi security forces.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=Benedict|title=PM refuses to discuss GCSB allegations|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/271363/pm-refuses-to-discuss-gcsb-allegations|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Radio New Zealand|date=16 April 2015}}</ref>

On 19 April 2015, The Intercept and the ''New Zealand Herald'' revealed that the GCSB and the National Security Agency had worked together to tap into a data link between the [[Chinese Consulate-General, Auckland|Chinese Consulate-General]] and the Chinese Visa Office in [[Auckland]], New Zealand's largest city. According to a leaked secret report entitled "NSA activities in progress 2013", the GCSB was providing additional technical data on the data link to the NSA's "Tailored Accessed Operations", a powerful system that hacks into computer systems and networks to intercept communications.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|last2=Hager|first2=Nicky|title=New Zealand Plotted Hack on China with NSA|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/18/new-zealand-china-gcsb-nsa-auckland-hack/|website=The Intercept|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref> Other leaked documents also indicated that the GCSB codenamed their Auckland tapping operation "Frostbite" while their American counterparts called it "Basilhayden", after a Kentucky bourbon that was once regarded as the fictional spy [[James Bond]]'s favourite alcoholic beverage. In response, a Chinese Embassy spokesman told the ''New Zealand Herald'' that China was concerned about the report and attached great importance to the cybersecurity issue.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=Leaked papers reveal NZ plan to spy on China for US|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11434886|accessdate=21 April 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=19 April 2015}}</ref>

On 5 May 2015, the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] acknowledged that Snowden's leaked documents on the GCSB and NSA were authentic but accused Snowden's associates, particularly the journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]], of "misrepresenting, misinterpreting, and misunderstanding" the leaked information.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=David|title=No factual basis for suggesting Snowden GCSB docs 'fabricated' – PM office|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11443630|accessdate=5 May 2015|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

===2018&ndash;2019 Huawei ban===
In late November 2018, the Government Communications Security Bureau prevented national telecommunications provider [[Spark New Zealand]] from using Chinese telecommunication giant [[Huawei]]'s equipment in its 5G mobile tower expansion, with the agency's Director-General Andrew Hampton citing a "a significant network security risk." New Zealand's decision to ban Huawei from its 5G expansion program accompanied moves by several Western governments including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia to exclude Huawei from participating in their 5G mobile network expansion programs as well as the ongoing [[China-United States trade war]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jolly |first1=Jasper |title=New Zealand blocks Huawei imports over 'significant security risk' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/new-zealand-blocks-huawei-5g-equipment-on-security-concerns |accessdate=13 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Choy |first1=Gigi |title=Huawei's banned, but where's the backlash in New Zealand? |url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2175808/huaweis-banned-wheres-backlash-new-zealand |accessdate=13 February 2019 |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=1 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=China intelligence law a 'known concern' in Huawei 5G ban - GCSB Minister Andrew Little |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/380057/china-intelligence-law-a-known-concern-in-huawei-5g-ban-gcsb-minister-andrew-little |accessdate=13 February 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=14 January 2019}}</ref>
