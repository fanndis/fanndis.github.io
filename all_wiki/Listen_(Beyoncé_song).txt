"'''Listen'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. The song was written by Beyoncé, [[Henry Krieger]], [[Scott Cutler]], and [[Anne Preven]], and produced by [[The Underdogs (duo)|The Underdogs]], Matt Sullivan and Randy Spendlove for the 2006 [[musical film]] ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', in which Beyoncé's character Deena Jones sings the song in an expression of independence from her controlling husband. [[Columbia Records]] released "Listen" as the [[lead single]] from the ''[[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture]]''  [[soundtrack album]]  on December 5, 2006. It additionally appeared as a [[hidden track]] on international editions, and on the deluxe edition of Beyoncé's second solo studio album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]''. The Spanish version of the song, "Oye", was released on the EP, ''[[Irreemplazable]]'', and the Spanish deluxe edition of ''B'Day''.

One of four new songs written for the feature version of ''Dreamgirls'' (originally a [[Dreamgirls|1981 Broadway musical]]), "Listen" is a [[Soul music|soul]]-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song; its lyrics make reference to tenacity, love, the refusal to defer dreams and finally rise towards fame. Its [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] includes [[bass (instrument)|bass]], [[drum]]s, [[guitar]]s, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]], and [[violin]]s, among others. Contemporary music critics complimented the strong and emotional vocals of Beyoncé, and added that the lyrics perfectly elaborate on Deena Jones's life. "Listen" won Best Original Song at the 2007 [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award|Critics' Choice Awards]]. It was nominated in the same category at the 2006 [[International Press Academy]] [[Satellite Award]], at the 2007 [[Golden Globe Award]]s for all songwriters, and at the [[79th Academy Awards|2007 Academy Awards]], for songwriters Krieger, Cutler and Preven.

"Listen" peaked at number 61 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and generally peaked inside the top 20 positions in European countries. It fared better in the United Kingdom where it reached number eight thanks to a live duet performance of Beyoncé and [[Alexandra Burke]] at ''[[The X Factor (UK series 5)|The X Factor]]'', where Burke emerged as the winner after singing "Listen" during the finale. The song was also covered by [[Jake Zyrus]] during the [[Audition (Glee)|second-season premiere]] of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and [[Melanie Amaro]] during the finale of the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 1)|first season]] of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'' in the U.S., where she emerged as the winner. Two accompanying music videos were filmed for "Listen"; the performance version was directed by [[Diane Martel]], and the second one, being ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' Shoot Version, was directed by [[Matthew Rolston]]. "Listen" was also a part of her [[set list]] on [[The Beyoncé Experience]] (2007) and the [[I Am... Tour]] (2009–10).

==Context==
In the film version of ''Dreamgirls'', Beyoncé portrays the character of Deena Jones, a [[pop music|pop]] singer loosely based on [[Motown]] star [[Diana Ross]]. The story explores the life of The Dreams (based on [[The Supremes]]), a fictional 1960s group of three female singers: Effie White ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson ([[Anika Noni Rose]]), whose manager Curtis Taylor (based on [[Berry Gordy]] and played by [[Jamie Foxx]]) manipulates their personal and professional relationships.<ref name="CondonBill">{{cite video |people=[[Bill Condon|Condon, Bill]] – Director|date=December 15, 2006|title=Dreamgirls|medium=Motion picture|publisher=[[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks SKG]]|location=United States}}</ref>

During the second half of the film, Curtis and Deena argue at dinner over Deena's desire to make her film debut in an urban film instead of the ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' prequel that Curtis is producing. An angry Curtis asserts his creative and psychological control over his wife, informing Deena that he would not let anyone else "handle" her, because, in his words, "no one knows you the way I do". Curtis tells Deena that he put Deena as lead singer of the Dreams because her voice "had no personality. No depth. Except for what [he] put in there".<ref name="CondonBill"/>

In the context of the film, "Listen" is a 1975 song that Deena records on Rainbow Records, a recording empire established by Curtis.  She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property.<ref name="Reid">{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Beyonce Wants End To Drama Over New Drama 'Dreamgirls'; Sets Tour |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1547863/20061212/story.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

While working on the script adaptation for ''Dreamgirls'', screenwriter/director [[Bill Condon]] felt the second half of the film needed a song.<ref name="Reid"/> The "emotional punch" of "[[And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going]]" led him to ask the musical team for ''Dreamgirls'' "to create a new and equally moving song to energize the second act".<ref name="Ulmer"/> Led by [[Henry Krieger]], the composer of the [[Dreamgirls|original 1981 Broadway musical version of ''Dreamgirls'']], "Listen" was written with help from [[Scott Cutler]], Preven, and Beyoncé; it was one of four songs written for the film version of ''Dreamgirls''.<ref name="MossSingle">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1537576/20060801/story.jhtml|title=New Beyonce Single — And Eddie Murphy Singing — Featured In 'Dreamgirls'|last=Corey|first=Moss|date=August 1, 2006|publisher=MTV News.

;Performance Version
This video, which was directed by [[Diane Martel]], features Beyoncé walking through a performance hall in modern-day street clothes, performing the song. Once she arrives onstage and at the song's bridge, she appears in costume as Deena, dressed in a 1970s-era gown.

The music video, directed by [[Matthew Rolston]], features Beyoncé wearing a modern-day tank top, performing the song against a blank background which changes back and forth between white and black. Interspersed are some scenes from a photo shoot within her film ''Dreamgirls''.<ref name="Listen">{{cite video |people=[[Matthew Rolston|Rolston, Matthew]] – Director|date=2006|title=Listen|medium=Music video|publisher=[[VH1]]|location=United States}}</ref> This version appears on the ''Dreamgirls'' DVD release. In the director's cut of this version, Beyoncé is seen posing for a photo shoot not featured in the film in which she wears very outlandish clothing. As the shoot progresses it becomes more and more evident that Beyoncé is not happy with the direction of the shoot and when she is handed a bird to pose with she becomes fed up, walks away and strips down to the black tank top and tights underneath. She then climbs the staircase of the building to the rooftop and finishes singing the song.
