They form the [[West Indies]] with the nearby [[Lucayan Archipelago]] ([[The Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]), which are sometimes considered to be a part of the Caribbean despite not bordering the Caribbean Sea. On the mainland, [[Belize]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Caribbean region of Colombia]], [[Cozumel]], the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], [[Margarita Island]], and [[The Guianas]] ([[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guayana Region, Venezuela|Guayana Region]] in [[Venezuela]], and [[Amapá]] in [[Brazil]]) are often included due to their [[political geography|political]] and [[cultural geography|cultural]] ties with the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Higman|first1=B.

A mostly tropical geography, the climates are greatly shaped by sea temperatures and precipitation, with the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] regularly leading to natural disasters. Because of its tropical climate and low-lying island geography, the Caribbean is vulnerable to a [[Climate change in the Caribbean|number of climate change effects]], including increased [[Extreme weather|storm intensity]], saltwater intrusion, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, and precipitation variability.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Latin America and the Caribbean {{!}} UNDP Climate Change Adaptation|url=https://www.adaptation-undp.org/explore/caribbean|access-date=2020-07-27|website=www.adaptation-undp.org|language=en}}</ref> These weather changes will greatly change the economies of the islands, and especially the major industries of agricultural and tourism.<ref name=":0" />

The Caribbean was [[Indigenous peoples of the Caribbean|occupied by indigenous people]] since at least 3600 BC. When European colonization followed the arrival of Columbus, the population was quickly decimated by brutal labor practices, enslavement and disease and on many islands, Europeans supplanted the native populations [[Atlantic slave trade|with enslaved Africans]]. Following the [[Haitian Revolution|independence of Haiti]] from France in the early 19th century and the decline of slavery in the 19th century, island nations in the Caribbean gradually gained independence, with a wave of new states during the 1950s and 60s. Because of the proximity to the United States, there is also a long history of United States intervention in the region. 

The islands of the Caribbean (the [[West Indies]]) are often<!--the EB also says that N.Am. is bordered to the south by the Caribbean, so they're ambiguous--> regarded as a [[subregion]] of [[North America]], though sometimes they are included in [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] or then left as a subregion of their own<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America "North America"].

From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a country known as the [[Netherlands Antilles]] composed of five states, all of which were [[Netherlands|Dutch]] dependencies.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/16015552 The Netherlands Antilles: The joy of six], The Economist Magazine, April 29, 2010</ref>  From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived political union called the [[West Indies Federation]] composed of ten [[English language|English]]-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then [[United Kingdom|British]] dependencies.

==Definition==
[[File:CIA map of the Caribbean.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map of the Caribbean]]

The word "Caribbean" has multiple uses. Its principal ones are geographical and political. The Caribbean can also be expanded to include territories with strong cultural and historical connections to Africa, [[slavery]], [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonisation]] and the [[plantation system]].

* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] presents the Caribbean as a distinct region within the [[Americas]].
* Physiographically, the Caribbean region is mainly a chain of islands surrounding the Caribbean Sea. To the north, the region is bordered by the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[Straits of Florida]] and the Northern [[Atlantic Ocean]], which lies to the east and northeast. To the south lies the coastline of the continent of [[South America]].
* Politically, the "Caribbean" may be centred by considering narrower and wider [[socio-economic]] groupings: 
** At its core is the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), whose full members include the [[Bahamas|Commonwealth of the Bahamas]] in the Atlantic, the [[Guyana|Co-operative Republic of Guyana]] and the [[Suriname|Republic of Suriname]] in South America, and [[Belize]] in Central America; its associate members include [[Bermuda]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] in the Atlantic Ocean. 
** Most expansive is the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), which includes almost every nation in the region surrounding the Caribbean and also [[El Salvador]] on the Pacific Ocean. According to the ACS, the total population of its member states is 227&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acs-aec.org/Trade/6thBusinessForum/background.htm |title=Background of the business forum of the Greater Caribbean of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) |accessdate=2009-05-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327084353/http://www.acs-aec.org/Trade/6thBusinessForum/background.htm |archive-date=2010-03-27 }}. acs-aec.org</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the Caribbean}}

The oldest evidence of humans in the Caribbean is in southern [[Trinidad]] at [[Banwari Trace]], where remains have been found from seven thousand years ago. These pre-ceramic sites, which belong to the Archaic (pre-ceramic) age, have been termed [[Ortoiroid]]. The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlement in [[Hispaniola]] dates to about 3600 BC, but the reliability of these finds is questioned. Consistent dates of 3100 BC appear in [[Cuba]]. The earliest dates in the [[Lesser Antilles]] are from 2000 BC in [[Antigua]]. A lack of pre-ceramic sites in the [[Windward Islands]] and differences in technology suggest that these Archaic settlers may have Central American origins. Whether an Ortoiroid colonization of the islands took place is uncertain, but there is little evidence of one.

Between 400 BC and 200 BC the first ceramic-using agriculturalists, the [[Saladoid culture]], entered Trinidad from South America. They expanded up the Orinoco River to Trinidad and then spread rapidly up the islands of the Caribbean. Some time after 250 AD another group, the [[Barancoid]], entered Trinidad. The Barancoid society collapsed along the Orinoco around 650 AD and another group, the [[Arauquinoid]], expanded into these areas and up the Caribbean chain. Around 1300 AD a new group, the [[Mayoid]], entered Trinidad and remained the dominant culture until Spanish settlement.

At the time of the European discovery of most of the islands of the Caribbean, three major Amerindian indigenous peoples lived on the islands: the [[Taíno]] in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[the Bahamas]] and the [[Leeward Islands]], the [[Island Caribs]] and [[Galibi]] in the Windward Islands, and the [[Ciboney]] in western Cuba. The Taínos are subdivided into Classic Taínos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]], Western Taínos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the Bahamian archipelago, and the Eastern Taínos, who occupied the Leeward Islands. Trinidad was inhabited by both Carib speaking and Arawak-speaking groups.

Soon after [[Christopher Columbus]] came to the Caribbean, both Portuguese and Spanish explorers began claiming territories in Central and South America. These early colonies brought gold to Europe; most specifically England, the Netherlands, and France. These nations hoped to establish profitable colonies in the Caribbean. Colonial rivalries made the Caribbean a cockpit for European wars for centuries. 

The Caribbean was known for [[piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]], especially between 1640 and 1680. The term "[[buccaneer]]" is often used to describe a pirate operating in this region. The Caribbean region was war-torn throughout much of its colonial history, but the wars were often based in Europe, with only minor battles fought in the Caribbean. Some wars, however, were born of political turmoil in the Caribbean itself.

[[Haiti]] was the first Caribbean nation to gain independence from European powers (see [[Haitian Revolution]]). Some Caribbean nations gained independence from European powers in the 19th century. Some smaller states are still dependencies of European powers today. Cuba remained a Spanish colony until the [[Spanish–American War]]. Between 1958 and 1962, most of the [[British West Indies|British-controlled Caribbean]] became the [[West Indies Federation]] before they separated into many separate nations.

===Foreign interventions by the United States===
{{See also|Foreign interventions by the United States|American imperialism}}

The [[United States]] has conducted military operations in the Caribbean and Latin America regions for at least 100 years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dosal|first=Paul|title=THE CARIBBEAN WAR. The United States in the Caribbean, 1898–1998|url=http://www.cercles.com/n5/dosal.pdf|publisher=University of South Florida}}</ref> Successive administrations of the Caribbean region have regularly maintained that the Caribbean must remain a zone of peace and have sought declarations at the United Nations to declare the region as such.

Since the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the United States gained a major influence on most Caribbean nations. In the early part of the 20th century, this influence was extended by participation in the [[Banana Wars]]. Victory in the Spanish–American War and the signing of the [[Platt Amendment]] in 1901 ensured that the United States would have the right to interfere in Cuban political and economic affairs, militarily if necessary. After the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, relations deteriorated rapidly leading to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and successive US attempts to destabilize the island, based upon [[Cold War]] fears of the [[Soviet]] threat. The US invaded and occupied Hispaniola for 19 years (1915–34), subsequently dominating the Haitian economy through aid and loan repayments. The US invaded Haiti again [[Operation Uphold Democracy|in 1994]] and in 2004 were accused by [[CARICOM]] of arranging a [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|coup d'état]] to remove elected Haitian leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In 1965, 23,000 US troops were sent to the Dominican Republic to quash a local uprising against military rule (see [[Dominican Civil War]]). President Lyndon Johnson had ordered the invasion to stem what he deemed to be a "Communist threat." However, the mission appeared ambiguous and was roundly condemned throughout the hemisphere as a return to [[gunboat diplomacy]]. In 1983, the US [[United States invasion of Grenada|invaded Grenada]] to remove populist left-wing leader Maurice Bishop. The US maintains a naval military base in Cuba at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The base is one of five unified commands whose "area of responsibility" is [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. The command is headquartered in Miami, Florida.

===Foreign interventions by Cuba===
{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}

[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|A Cuban [[PT-76]] tank crew performing routine security duties in Angola during the [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban intervention into the country]]]]

From 1966 until the late 1980s, the Soviet government upgraded Cuba's military capabilities, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro saw to it that Cuba assisted with the independence struggles of several countries across the world, most notably Angola and Mozambique in southern Africa, and the anti-imperialist struggles of countries such as Syria, Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parameters: Journal of the US Army War College |date=1977 |publisher=U.S. Army War College |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMdLAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA13}}</ref><ref name=CIA>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000400100003-7.pdf|title=Foreign Intervention by Cuba}}</ref> Its Angolan involvement was particularly intense and noteworthy with heavy assistance given to the Marxist–Leninist [[MPLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]]. Cuba sent 380,000 troops to Angola and 70,000 additional civilian technicians and volunteers. (The Cuban forces possessed 1,000 tanks, 600 armored vehicles and 1,600 artillery pieces.)

Cuba's involvement in the Angolan Civil War began in the 1960s when relations were established with the leftist Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The MPLA was one of three organizations struggling to gain Angola's independence from Portugal, the other two being [[UNITA]] and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA). In August and October 1975, the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) intervened in Angola in support of the UNITA and FNLA. On 14 October 1975, the SADF commenced [[Operation Savannah (Angola)|Operation Savannah]] in an effort to capture Luanda from the south. On 5 November 1975, without consulting Moscow, the Cuban government opted for direct intervention with combat troops ([[Operation Carlota]]) in support of the MPLA and the combined MPLA-Cuban armies managed to stop the South African advance by 26 November. 

During the [[Ogaden War]] (1977–78) in which Somalia attempted to invade an Ethiopia affected by civil war, Cuba deployed 18,000 troops along with armored vehicles, artillery, [[T-62]] tanks, and MiGs to assist the [[Derg]]. Ethiopia and Cuba defeated Somalia on 9 March 1978.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dixon |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Sarkees |first2=Meredith Reid |title=A Guide to Intra-state Wars: An Examination of Civil, Regional, and Intercommunal Wars, 1816-2014 |date=2015 |publisher=CQ Press |page=624}}</ref>

In 1987–88, South Africa again sent military forces to Angola to stop an advance of MPLA forces (FAPLA) against UNITA, leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], where the SADF was unable to defeat the FAPLA and Cuban forces. Cuba also directly participated in the negotiations between Angola and South Africa, again without consulting Moscow. Within two years, the Cold War was over and Cuba's foreign policy shifted away from military intervention.

==Geography and geology==
[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|right|{{legend|#FAD4AF|The [[Caribbean Plate]]}}]]

The geography and climate in the Caribbean region varies: Some islands in the region have relatively flat terrain of non-volcanic origin. These islands include [[Aruba]] (possessing only minor volcanic features), [[Curaçao]], [[Barbados]], [[Bonaire]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Saint Croix]], [[the Bahamas]], and [[Antigua]]. Others possess rugged towering mountain-ranges like the islands of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Dominica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]], [[Tortola]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

Definitions of the terms Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles often vary. The Virgin Islands as part of the Puerto Rican bank are sometimes included with the Greater Antilles. The term Lesser Antilles is often used to define an island arc that includes Grenada but excludes Trinidad and Tobago and the Leeward Antilles.

The waters of the Caribbean Sea host large, migratory schools of fish, turtles, and [[coral reef]] formations. The [[Puerto Rico Trench]], located on the fringe of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea just to the north of the island of Puerto Rico, is the deepest point in all of the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03trench/welcome.html| title=Puerto Rico Trench 2003: Cruise Summary Results|  author=ten Brink, Uri | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>

The region sits in the line of several major shipping routes with the [[Panama Canal]] connecting the western Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean.

The British West Indies were united by the United Kingdom into a [[West Indies Federation]] between 1958 and 1962. The independent countries formerly part of the B.W.I. still have a joint [[cricket]] team that competes in [[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]]s and [[Twenty20 International]]s. The [[West Indian cricket team]] includes the South American nation of [[Guyana]], the only former British colony on the mainland of that continent.

In addition, these countries share the [[University of the West Indies]] as a regional entity. The university consists of three main campuses in Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, a smaller campus in the Bahamas and Resident Tutors in other contributing territories such as Trinidad.

==Climate==
[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|left|Tropical monsoon climate in [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés island]], Caribbean, [[Colombia]].]]
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map Caribbean present.svg|thumb|left|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate]] map of the islands of the Caribbean.]]

The climate of the area is [[tropical]], varying from [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] in some areas to [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] and [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]] in others. There are also some locations that are [[arid]] climates with considerable drought in some years, and the peaks of mountains tend to have cooler [[temperate climate]]s.

Rainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents, such as the cool upwellings that keep the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] arid. Warm, moist [[trade winds]] blow consistently from the east, creating both rain forest and semi-arid climates across the region. The tropical rainforest climates include lowland areas near the Caribbean Sea from [[Costa Rica]] north to [[Belize]], as well as the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], while the more seasonal dry tropical savanna climates are found in [[Cuba]], northern [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], and southern [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán, Mexico]]. Arid climates are found along the extreme northern coast of Venezuela out to the islands including [[Aruba]] and [[Curacao]], as well as the northwestern tip of Yucatán.

While the region generally is sunny much of the year, the wet season from May through November sees more frequent cloud cover (both broken and overcast), while the dry season from December through April is more often clear to mostly sunny. Seasonal rainfall is divided into 'dry' and 'wet' seasons, with the latter six months of the year being wetter than the first half. The air temperature is hot much of the year, varying from 25 to 33 C (77 F to 90 F) between the wet and dry seasons. Seasonally, monthly mean temperatures vary from only about 5 C (7 F) in the northernmost regions, to less than 3 C in the southernmost areas of the Caribbean.

Hurricane season is from June to November, but they occur more frequently in August and September and more common in the northern islands of the Caribbean. [[Tropical cyclone#Hurricane or typhoon|Hurricanes]] that sometimes batter the region usually strike northwards of [[Grenada]] and to the west of Barbados. The principal hurricane belt arcs to the northwest of the island of Barbados in the Eastern Caribbean. A great example being recent events of Hurricane Irma devastating the island of Saint Martin during the 2017 hurricane season.

Sea surface temperatures change little annually, normally running from 30&nbsp;°C (87&nbsp;°F) in the warmest months to 26&nbsp;°C (76&nbsp;°F) in the coolest months. The air temperature is warm year-round, in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and only varies from winter to summer about 2–5 degrees on the southern islands and about a 10–20 degrees difference on the northern islands of the Caribbean. The northern islands, like the Bahamas, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, may be influenced by continental masses during winter months, such as cold fronts.

==Biodiversity==
The Caribbean islands have some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. The animals, fungi, and plants have been classified as one of [[Conservation International]]'s [[biodiversity hotspot]]s because of their exceptionally diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems, ranging from montane [[cloud forests]], to [[tropical rainforest]],  to [[cactus]] [[scrubland]]s. The region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark Spalding|author2=Corinna Ravilious|author3=Edmund Peter Green|title=World Atlas of Coral Reefs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUI2fLpxIRwC|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=10 September 2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23255-6}}</ref> along with extensive seagrass meadows,<ref>Littler, D. and Littler, M. (2000) ''Caribbean Reef Plants''. OffShore Graphics, Inc., {{ISBN|0967890101}}.</ref> both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering the island and continental coasts of the region.

For the fungi, there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections, published accounts, and field observations.<ref>Minter, D.W., Rodríguez Hernández, M. and Mena Portales, J. (2001) ''Fungi of the Caribbean. An annotated checklist''. PDMS Publishing, {{ISBN|0-9540169-0-4}}.</ref> That checklist includes more than 11,250 species of fungi recorded from the region. As its authors note, the work is far from exhaustive, and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher. The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean, including species not yet recorded, is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kirk, P.

Many of the [[ecosystem]]s of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by [[deforestation]], pollution, and human encroachment. The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of [[Tyto pollens|giant]] [[Ornimegalonyx|owls]] and [[Megalocnus|dwarf ground sloths]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatstory.org/charts/NA-extinctions.html |title=North American Extinctions v. World |publisher=Thegreatstory.org |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds, to mammals and reptiles), fungi and plants. Examples of threatened animals include the [[Puerto Rican amazon]], two species of [[solenodon]] (giant shrews) in Cuba and Hispaniola, and the [[Cuban crocodile]].

Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture. [[Tobacco]] was an important early crop during the colonial era, but was eventually overtaken by [[sugarcane]] production as the region's staple crop. Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe. [[Cuba]] and [[Barbados]] were historically the largest producers of [[sugar]]. The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement.  Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for [[agriculture]], for example [[Dominica]], which remains heavily forested. The islands in the southern [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], are extremely arid, making them unsuitable for agriculture. However, they have [[salt]] pans that were exploited by the Dutch. Seawater was pumped into shallow ponds, producing coarse salt when the water evaporated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogoziński|first=Jan|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0-452-28193-6|page=65}}</ref>

The natural environmental diversity of the Caribbean islands has led to recent growth in [[eco-tourism]]. This type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogoziński|first=Jan|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0-452-28193-6|page=356}}</ref>

At the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]], the dominant ethnic groups in the Caribbean included the [[Taíno]] of the [[Greater Antilles]] and northern [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Island Caribs]] of the southern Lesser Antilles, and smaller distinct groups such as the [[Guanahatabey]] of western Cuba and the [[Neo-Taíno nations#Ciguayo|Ciguayo]] and [[Neo-Taíno nations#Macorix|Macorix]] of eastern Hispaniola. The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before European contact, although lower and higher figures are given.

In [[Haiti]] and most of the [[French Caribbean|French]], [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone]] and [[Dutch West Indies|Dutch Caribbean]], the population is predominantly of [[Afro-Caribbean|African]] origin; on many islands there are also significant populations of mixed racial origin (including [[Mulatto]]-[[Creole peoples|Creole]], [[Dougla]], [[Mestizo]], [[Quadroon]], [[Cholo]], [[Castizo]], [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Zambo]], [[Pardo]], [[Asian Latin Americans]], [[Chindian]], [[Cocoa panyols]], and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]), as well as populations of European ancestry: [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry. [[Asians]], especially those of [[Chinese Caribbean|Chinese]], [[Indo-Caribbean|Indian]] descent, and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Indonesian people|Indonesians]], form a significant minority in parts of the region. [[Indo-Caribbean|Indians]] form a plurality of the population in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], and [[Suriname]]. Most of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers.

The [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]] populations are primarily of European, African, or racially mixed origins. Puerto Rico has a European majority with a tri-racial (mixture of European-African-Native American) population, as well as a large mulatto (European-West African) and West African minority. Cuba has a mixed-race majority, along with a high European minority, and a significant population of African ancestry. The Dominican Republic has the largest mixed-race population, primarily descended from Europeans, [[West African]]s, and Amerindians.
[[File:Revellers Wine at Trinidad Carnival.jpg|thumb|Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago]]

[[Jamaica]] has a large African majority, in addition to a significant population of mixed racial background, and has minorities of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Latin Americans|Latinos]], [[Jews]], and [[Arabs]]. This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured laborers, and migration. Most multi-racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown. Similar populations can be found in the [[Caricom]] states of [[Belize]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrivals of [[Afro-Trinidadian|Africans]], [[Indo-Trinidadian|Indians]], [[Chinese Trinidadian|Chinese]], [[Arabs]], [[Jews]], [[Latin Americans|Latino]]s, and [[White Trinidadian|Europeans]] along with the [[Amerindians|native indigenous Amerindians]] population. This multi-racial mix of the Caribbean has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include [[Mulatto]]-[[Creole peoples|Creole]], [[Mestizo]], [[Pardo]], [[Zambo]], [[Dougla]], [[Chindian]], [[Afro-Asians]], [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]], [[Cocoa panyols]], and [[Asian Latin Americans|Asian Latinos]].

===Language===

==Politics==
===Regionalism===
[[File:Flag of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).svg|thumb|Flag of the Caribbean Common Market and Community (CARICOM)]]

Caribbean societies are very different from other Western societies in terms of size, culture, and degree of mobility of their citizens.<ref>Gowricharn, Ruben. ''Caribbean Transnationalism: Migration, Pluralization, and Social Cohesion'', Lanham: Lexington Books, 2006. p. 5 {{ISBN|0-7391-1167-1}}</ref> The current economic and political problems the states face individually are common to all Caribbean states. Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems. From a political and economic perspective, [[Regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]] serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions. In 1973, the first political regionalism in the [[Caribbean Basin]] was created by advances of the English-speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community ([[CARICOM]])<ref>Hillman, p. 150</ref> which is located in Guyana.

Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean. On the one hand, the Caribbean states are politically diverse, ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states. Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a "blending of traditional and modern patterns, yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways."<ref>Hillman, p. 165</ref> The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices.

The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized. Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique. On the other hand, scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists.  "Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action."<ref name=serbin>{{cite journal|author=Serbin, Andres|title=Towards an Association of Caribbean States: Raising Some Awkward Questions|journal=Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs|year=1994|pages=61–90|volume=36|issue=4|jstor=166319|doi=10.2307/166319}}</ref> These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations' desires to compete in the international economic system.<ref name=serbin />

Furthermore, a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region.  In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U.S. interest. "With the end of the Cold War, U.S. security and economic interests have been focused on other areas. As a result, there has been a significant reduction in U.S. aid and investment to the Caribbean."<ref>Hillman, p. 123</ref>  The lack of international support for these small, relatively poor states, helped regionalism prosper.

Another issue of due to the cold war in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and [[European Union]]'s allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other.

In counteraction, the European Union claimed that the U.S. in the midst of the cold war, and seeking to promote capitalist economic growth in the region through [[offshoring]] of business development and later on offshore financial sector characterized this segment of regional government activity in the Caribbean as an unfair/ Harmful low-tax competition which undercuts the higher taxation rates found in Europe. Much of the U.S. tax code which benefited the Caribbean[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1446603.stm US eases stance on 'tax havens'], was to cull socialist movements in the region, limit Russian financial influence in the area, and firmly integrate the Caribbean into the United States financial system much to the insistence by the E.U. that the low tax rates of the Caribbean for global companies needed to be banned.[https://ips-dc.org/us-caribbean_relations/ U.S.-Caribbean Relations][https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1227&context=mjil ]

====United States-EU trade dispute====
The United States President [[Bill Clinton]], backed by American owned banana producers in Central America launched a challenge in the [[World Trade Organization]] against the EU over Europe's preferential program, known as the [[Lomé Convention]], which allowed [[banana]] exports from the former colonies of the [[ACP countries|Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states]] (ACP) to enter Europe cheaply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2001/April/The_US-EU_Banana_Agreement.html |title=The U.S.-EU Banana Agreement |accessdate=2008-11-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012800/http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2001/April/The_US-EU_Banana_Agreement.html |archive-date=2009-05-06 }} See also: {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2008/05/080516_sanders190508.shtml |title=Dominica: Poverty and Potential |publisher=BBC |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2008-12-06 }}</ref> The World Trade Organization sided in the United States' favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African, Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the [[Cotonou Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1196354821.32/ |title=WTO rules against EU banana import practices |accessdate=2008-11-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416002704/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1196354821.32/ |archive-date=2009-04-16 }}. eubusiness.com (2007-11-29)</ref>

During the US/EU dispute, the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods (up to 100%) to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/293114.stm |title=No truce in banana war |work=BBC News |date=1999-03-08 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the Lomé Convention weakens.  Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of marijuana, which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these narcotics in North America and Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/296008.stm |title=World: Americas St Vincent hit by banana war |work=BBC News |date=1999-03-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2005/01/050117_ukparliament-concern.shtml |title=Concern for Caribbean farmers |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2005-01-07|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto3 The banana wars explained]

====Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and Association of Caribbean States====
Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the [[Caribbean Financial Action Task Force]] and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry. One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the [[Caribbean Basin]] has been the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region.  It was founded in July 1994.  The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean.  The successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.

==== Chinese relations ====
In recent history increasing numbers of countries in the regions have signed on to the Chinese [[Belt and Road Initiative]] in order to take advantage of the advancing Chinese market and access development loans at rates lower than traditional global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or World Bank.

====Bolivarian Alliance====
The President of [[Venezuela]], [[Hugo Chavez]] launched an economic group called the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] (ALBA), which several eastern Caribbean islands joined.  In 2012, the nation of Haiti, with 9&nbsp;million people, became the largest CARICOM nation that sought to join the union.<ref>{{cite news |title=ALBA Expands its Allies in the Caribbean |first=Kevin |last=Edmonds |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/6855 |publisher=Venezuela Analysis |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}</ref>
