Since many economists and politicians called for a new [[Bretton Woods system]] (a monetary management which was instituted after World War II) to overhaul the world's financial structure, the meeting has sometimes been described by the media as ''Bretton Woods II''.<ref name=Eurodad />

==Preliminary history==
===Approaches in the early 2000s===
''Bretton Woods II'' was an informal designation for the system of currency relations which developed during the 00's . As described by political economist [[Daniel Drezner]], "Under this system, the U.S. is running massive current account deficits to be the source of export-led growth for other countries. To fund this deficit, central banks, particularly those on the Pacific Rim, are buying up dollars and dollar-denominated assets."<ref>{{cite web

The notion of a "revived Bretton Woods system" was introduced in a 2004 paper by Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber, in which it is described as arising after the end of the Cold War, out of the choice of countries, {{quote|mainly in Asia, [which] chose the same periphery strategy as immediate post-war Europe and Japan, undervaluing the exchange rate, managing sizable foreign exchange interventions, imposing controls, accumulating reserves, and encouraging export-led growth by sending goods to the competitive center countries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Dooley |first2=David |last2=Folkerts‐Landau |first3=Peter |last3=Garber |title=The Revived Bretton Woods System |journal=International Journal of Finance and Economics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=307–313 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/ijfe.250 }}</ref>}}

In 2005, [[Nouriel Roubini|Roubini]] and [[Brad Setser|Setser]] argued that the system is unsustainable:
{{quote|If the US does not take policy steps to reduce its need for external financing before it exhausts the world's central banks willingness to keep adding to their dollar reserves – and if the rest of the world does not take steps to reduce its dependence on an unsustainable expansion in US domestic demand to support its own growth – the risk of a hard landing for the US and global economy will grow. The basic outlines of a hard landing are easy to envision: a sharp fall in the value of the US dollar, a rapid increase in US long-term interest rates and a sharp fall in the price of a range of risk assets including equities and housing. The asset price adjustment would lead to a severe slowdown in the US, and the fall in US imports associated with the US slowdown and the dollar's fall would lead to a global severe economic slowdown, if not an outright recession.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Cumbre G-20-Washington.jpg|300px|thumb|G20 leaders and delegates attend the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy Saturday at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. on November 15, 2008.]]

The formula is "G7 plus". In announcing the summit, US President George Bush said that the summit would bring together members of the [[G20]]. The G20 was set up to respond to the financial turmoil of 1997-99 through the development of policies that "promote international financial stability". The G20 comprises countries considered to be systemically important, but omits over 170 governments (192 governments are members of the United Nations).

The first meeting of the G20 leaders on financial markets and the world economy was held in Washington, D.C. on November 14–15, 2008, at the [[National Building Museum]]. The participants were: [[Argentina]], Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, the [[People's Republic of China]], France, Germany, India, [[Indonesia]], Italy, Japan, Mexico, [[Republic of Korea]], Russia, [[Saudi Arabia]], South Africa, [[Turkey]], the United Kingdom, the [[United States of America]], the [[European Union]] (represented by France's President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as [[President of the European Council]], as well as by [[José Manuel Barroso]], president of the [[European Commission]]), the Netherlands (allowed extraordinary presence), Spain (allowed extraordinary presence), the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Financial Stability Forum]]. Although Dutch Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] arrived at Andrews Air Force Base on the evening of November 14, he immediately returned to the Netherlands when notified of the death of his father; the Netherlands was instead represented by [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|State Secretary]] [[Jan Kees de Jager]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081114-5.html|title=Delegations to the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy|publisher=[[White House]]|date=2008-11-14|accessdate=2008-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161800/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081114-5.html|archive-date=2011-10-23|url-status=live}}</ref>

[http://www.amchamspain.com/spanish/images/press/financialTimes1_11_08.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  Zapatero eventually extracted an invitation through "intense lobbying" of French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who happened to hold two invitations (the second French invitation was due to the fact that France held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] during this period).<ref>Diana Fong, ''Spain's Zapatero Takes Extra Seat at G20 Summit'', Deutsche Welle, Nov. 15, 2008.

===Suggestions===
German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said "Bretton Woods II" should bring about "genuine, all-encompassing reform of the international financial system".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=132&item=3008 |title=Breton Woods II conference FAQs |publisher=[[Eurodad]] |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114074955/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=132&item=3008 |archivedate=2009-01-14 }}</ref> The Council of the European Union sees the meeting as "tak[ing] early decisions on transparency, global standards of regulation, cross-border supervision and crisis management, to avoid conflicts of interest and to create an early warning system, so as to engender confidence among savers and investors in every country." In announcing the meeting, the spokesperson for US President George Bush said that "leaders will review progress being made to address the current financial crisis, advance a common understanding of its causes, and, in order to avoid a repetition, agree on a common set of principles for reform of the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world's financial sector". UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in a mid-October speech, set out several principles. These include transparency (internationally agreed accounting standards, credit insurance market standards), integrity (credit agencies, executive pay), responsibility (board member competency and expertise), sound banking practice (protecting against speculative bubbles). While addressing the G20 leaders, [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]] listed four priorities in reforming the international financial system: stepping up international cooperation in [[financial regulation]]; advancing reform of international financial institutions; encouraging regional financial cooperation; and improving the international currency system.<ref name="China Daily">{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/16/content_7208365.htm |title=Washington summit targets at crisis |work=[[China Daily]] |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ih3i4Vgl?url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/16/content_7208365.htm |archivedate=2009-08-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the agreement was "comprehensive, positive and balanced".<ref name="Xinhua News Agency">{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/16/content_10365670.htm |title=Chinese FM: G20 summit "significant" for world to tackle financial crisis |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ih3lgdZZ?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/16/content_10365670.htm |archivedate=2009-08-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> Prior to this summit, [[Japan]]'s Prime Minister, [[Taro Aso]], had contributed feasible action plan based on the analysis of the surplus of Japan's international balance of payments in spite of her prolonged economic slump to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122660683367025399 |title=Restoring Financial Stability; Use Japan's experience as a guide to near-term problems ? then think bigger. |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-11-14 |first=Taro |last=Aso |accessdate=8 September 2010  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010024302/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122660683367025399.html |archivedate=10 October 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> and also provided his idea includes funding in the meeting.

===Key achievements===
The [[White House]] reported that the summit had reached what would be the '''Washington declaration'''. The five key objectives the leaders agreed upon were:
* reached a common understanding of the root causes of the global crisis;
* reviewed actions countries had taken and would take in the future to address the immediate crisis and strengthen growth;
