{{Campaignbox PKK–Turkey conflict}}

In late July 2015, the third phase of the '''[[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]''' between various [[Kurdish Insurgency#Kurdish political movement|Kurdish insurgent groups]] and the Turkish government erupted, following a failed two and a half year-long [[Solution process|peace process]] aimed at resolving the long-running conflict.

The conflict between [[Turkey]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) broke out again in summer 2015 following two-year-long peace negotiations. These began in late 2012, but failed to progress in light of the growing tensions on the [[Turkish-Syrian border]] in late 2014, when the Turkish state prevented its Kurdish citizens from sending support to the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) who were fighting against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) during the [[Siege of Kobani]]. Turkey was accused of assisting the Islamic State during the siege,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/khairuldeen-al-makhzoomi/the-cost-of-turkeys-self-interest_b_8615668.html|title=The Cost of Turkey's Self-Interest|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/11/11/turkey-is-supporting-isis/|title=Turkey Is Supporting ISIS|author=Ben Norton|date=11 November 2014|work=counterpunch.org|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> resulting in the widespread [[2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey]] involving dozens of fatalities.

In November 2015, Turkish authorities said that a number of towns and areas in the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] had come under the control of PKK militants and affiliated armed organizations. According to Turkish government sources, between July 2015 and May 2016, 2,583 Kurdish insurgents were killed in Turkey and 2,366 in Iraq, as well as 483 members of the Turkish security forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/7-bin-78-pkkli-etkisiz-hale-getirildi-138066h.htm|title=7 bin 78 PKK'lı etkisiz hale getirildiKaynak: 7 bin 78 PKK'lı etkisiz hale getirildi |publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref> The PKK said 1,557 Turkish security forces members were killed in 2015 during the clashes in Turkish and Iraqi Kurdistan, while it lost 220 fighters.<ref name="PKKclaim2015">{{cite news|title=HPG releases balance sheet of war for 2015|url=http://www.anfenglish.com/kurdistan/hpg-releases-balance-sheet-of-war-for-2015|work=ANF news|date=3 January 2015|access-date=2016-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816013354/https://anfenglish.com/kurdistan/hpg-releases-balance-sheet-of-war-for-2015|archive-date=2017-08-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the [[International Crisis Group]], 4,226 people, including 465 civilians, were killed in Turkey between July 2015 and December 2018,<ref name="ICG">{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.be/interactives/turkey/|title=Turkey's PKK Conflict: The Rising Toll|date=10 December 2018|accessdate=10 December 2018}}</ref> including Kurdish lawyer [[Tahir Elçi]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A Sisyphean Task?

==Background==
{{main|Solution process|2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey|Rojava–Islamist conflict}}
The [[Kurdish-Turkish peace process]] saw negotiations begin between jailed [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) leader [[Abdullah Ocalan]] and the [[Turkish government]] in late 2012. A ceasefire was called, and the PKK agreed to withdraw from [[Turkish Kurdistan]] into [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].<ref>https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0508/PKK-militants-start-withdrawal-from-Turkey-fueling-optimism-for-peace-process</ref> In 2014, anger increased among [[Turkish Kurds]] with what they saw as the [[Collaboration with ISIL#Turkey|Turkish state's facilitation]] of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]'s assault on [[Syrian Kurds]] during the [[Rojava–Islamist conflict]],<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/turkey-cut-islamic-state-supply-lines-erdogan-isis</ref> culminating in the [[2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey]] during the [[Siege of Kobanî]]. The [[June 2015 Turkish general election]] saw Turkey's ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) lose its majority, and gains for the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP). Tensions increased further after the [[Suruç bombing]] and [[Ceylanpınar incident]] in July, after which the Turkish government launched the [[2015 police raids in Turkey]] and attacked PKK positions in [[Iraq]], prompting the PKK to call off its ceasefire.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news-19-6/turkish-airstrikes-against-pkk-in-iraq-throw-two-year-ceasefire-with-kurds-into-jeopardy-10416213.html</ref><ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/turkey-pkk-ceasefire-puts-hdp-tough-spot-150806110231827.html</ref>

On 20 July 2015, [[2015 Suruç bombing|a bombing]] in the predominantly Kurdish district of [[Suruç]], reportedly perpetrated by the [[Dokumacılar]] group  linked to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), killed 32 young activists and injured over 100. Most victims were members of the [[Socialist Party of the Oppressed]] (ESP) Youth Wing and the Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF), university-aged students who were giving a press statement on their planned trip to reconstruct the Syrian border town of [[Kobanî]] in the de facto autonomous [[Rojava|Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava]].<ref>[http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/20/turkey-death-toll-climbs-in-suruc-attack/ 'Turkey: Death toll climbs in Suruc attack'], Euronews.com, 20 July 2015; retrieved 21 August 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/sosyalist-genclik-dernegi-gundem-2090164|title=Sosyalist Gençlik Derneği Federasyonu - SGDF amacı nedir, kimdir?|date=20 July 2015|work=milliyet.com.tr|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>

{{main|Operation Martyr Yalçın}}
The July 21 and 22 attacks were proclaimed a ''[[casus belli]]'' by the Turkish government, which resulted in Turkish Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] taking the decision to begin active air operations against PKK positions in Iraq.
