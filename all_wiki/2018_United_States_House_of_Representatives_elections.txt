The '''2018 United States House of Representatives elections''' were held on November 6, 2018, with early voting taking place in some states in the weeks preceding that date. Voters chose representatives from all 435 [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] across each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s. [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Non-voting delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and four of the five inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]]{{efn|Not including the [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]], who serves a four-year term.}} were also elected. These [[2018 United States elections|midterm elections]] took place nearly halfway through the first term of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Donald Trump]]. On Election Day, Republicans had held a House majority since [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|January 2011]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/what-happens-now-democrats-will-retake-house-n930556 | title=What happens now that Democrats will retake the House | website=NBC News | language=en | access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref>

In the 2018 elections, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], led by [[Nancy Pelosi]], won control of the House. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the [[2016 United States House of Representatives elections|2016 elections]]. The 41-seat gain was the Democrats' largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|1974 elections]], when they picked up 49 seats. The Democrats also won the popular vote by a margin of 8.6%, the largest margin on record for a party that previously held a minority in the House. Turnout was the highest for a midterm election in more than a century, with over half the electorate casting ballots.

Upon the opening of the [[116th United States Congress]], Pelosi was [[2019 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election|elected]] as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-speaker-house-vote-congress_us_5c2e4d43e4b0407e90897fe6 | title=Nancy Pelosi Elected Speaker Of The House | last=Fuller | first=Matt | date=January 3, 2019 | website=Huffington Post | access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> Incumbent Republican House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] chose not to run for another term.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/11/politics/paul-ryan-retirement-house-speaker/index.html | title=House Speaker Paul Ryan won't seek re-election: 'I like to think I've done my part' | author1=Lauren Fox |author2=Deirdre Walsh |author3=Maegan Vazquez | website=CNN | access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> In November 2018, House Republicans elected [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] as House Minority Leader.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/kevin-mccarthy-elected-minority-leader-next-congress/1987796002 | title=Kevin McCarthy elected minority leader for next Congress | website=USA TODAY | language=en | access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref>
