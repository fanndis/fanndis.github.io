"'''Sweet Dreams'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] from her third studio album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). Originally titled "Beautiful Nightmare", it leaked online in March 2008. The song was written and produced by Beyoncé, [[Jim Jonsin|James Scheffer]], [[Wayne Wilkins]], and [[Rico Love]]. [[Columbia Records]] released "Sweet Dreams", the album's sixth single, to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream radio]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic contemporary radio]] playlists in the United States on June 2, 2009, and elsewhere on July 13. It is an [[electropop]] song whose instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and [[snare drum]]s. Knowles employs slinky vocals to sing the haunting lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream.

"Sweet Dreams" was acclaimed by contemporary music critics, who praised its [[Beat (music)|beats]], [[synthpop]] sound Knowles' vocals. Some critics noted that the sliding [[bassline]] gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of [[Michael Jackson]]'s songs on ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982). "Sweet Dreams" gained popularity for its [[Electro (music)|electro music]] style, which contrasts Knowles' earlier [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[urban contemporary|urban]], and [[funk]]-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the [[BET Award for Viewer's Choice|Viewers Choice Award]] at the 2010 [[BET Awards]]. "Sweet Dreams" peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Outside of the United States, "Sweet Dreams" topped the charts in New Zealand, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in many countries, including Australia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. "Sweet Dreams" was certified platinum in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Adria Petty]], and was filmed in [[Brooklyn]], New York. It mainly uses a [[green screen]] and [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]], making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video sees Knowles wearing a golden robot suit designed by French fashion designer [[Thierry Mugler]]. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who described it as high-fashion and noted that Knowles reprised part of the choreography from her 2008 video for "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)|Single Ladies]]". Knowles promoted the song by performing it live at the [[2009 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and occasionally during the [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10). "Sweet Dreams" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. It was used in a [[Crystal Geyser|Cryster Geyser Water]] Japanese advertisement that featured Knowles.

<blockquote>
I was more concerned that [Beyoncé] would feel that we did it. A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if you put the song out there it would go [on to become a hit]. Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé.

==Critical reception==
=== Reviews ===
"Sweet Dreams" was acclaimed by critics, some of whom praised its dark tone and electropop sound that is different from Knowles' previous work. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, "icy and cool, slippery like mercury [and] nothing to scoff at either", help make the song an "undeniable smash" that is unique compared to the work of other artists.<ref name="MTV"/> Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' "fierce" alter ego, who "dares the listener to dream of her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'."<ref name="wety">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597718/beyonces-i-sasha-fierce-album-preview.jhtml |title=Beyoncé Album Preview: I Am ...

<blockquote>
The fashion was extremely important in this video because everything was so minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat.

===Synopsis and analysis===
The video opens with Knowles tossing and turning in her bed; her idea was to make the opening shot look like "a dark fairy tale
".<ref name="pop"/> As she tries to sleep, [[Brahms's Lullaby]] plays softly in the background.<ref name="vicki" />. Listening to heartbeat before Beyoncé breathing at visual effects. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move the top half of her body.<ref name="pop"/> Knowles said that the levitation shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight. She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream,<ref name="pop"/> which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar.<ref name="vicki" /> Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black [[Roberto Cavalli]] dress and boots;<ref name="pop"/> as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear.<ref name="pop"/> The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''.<ref name="slantmag"/><ref name="pre"/> The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background.<ref name="slantmag"/> Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves.<ref name="slantmag"/><ref name="dose"/>

The second chorus shows Knowles wearing a silver lined body suit while smashing mirrors. During the bridge, the video fades to black and white and Knowles appears wearing the gold robot suit, and gold and diamond nail rings valued at $36,000 and designed by Bijules designer Jules Kim.<ref name="life">{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/2009/07/beyonces-35k-nails.html |title=Beyoncé's $36,000 nails! |work=[[Life & Style (magazine)|Life & Style]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |date=July 14, 2009 |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref> She executes some robotic movements. As the chorus begins to play for the third and final time, digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images Knowles arching her back.<ref name="slantmag"/> The gold outfit is then reused, this time in color. Knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers, then says, "Turn the lights out", and the video ends.

===Reception===
James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that the video is "an eye-popping, herky-jerky, high-fashion" one. He praised the way Knowles "[pops] her pelvis in ways never imagined", and the wardrobe changes in the clip, before concluding: "She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish, flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways.
