A '''civil marriage''' is a [[marriage]] performed, recorded and recognised by a government official.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/marriagelaws/g/civilmarriage.htm |title=Civil Marriage Definition  |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref> Such a marriage may be performed by a [[religion|religious]] body and recognised by the state, or it may be entirely [[secular]].

==History==
Every country maintaining a [[Civil registry|population registry]] of its residents keeps track of [[marital status]],<ref>http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/mar/default.htm</ref> and all UN Member countries except [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] have signed or ratified either the United Nations [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages]] (1962)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/MinimumAgeForMarriage.aspx | title=OHCHR &#124; Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage}}</ref> or the United Nations [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979) which carry a responsibility to register marriages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wunrn.com/news/2008/08_08/08_04_08/080408_child.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-31 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201715/http://www.wunrn.com/news/2008/08_08/08_04_08/080408_child.htm |archive-date=2013-10-29 }}</ref> Most countries define the conditions of civil marriage separately from religious requirements. Certain countries, such as Israel, allow couples to register only on the condition that they have first been married in a religious ceremony recognised by the state, or were married in a different country.

===In England===
In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], marriage was governed by [[canon law]], which recognised as valid only those marriages where the parties stated they took one another as husband and wife, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses. It was not necessary, however, to be married by any official or cleric. This institution was cancelled in England with the enactment of "[[Marriage Act 1753|Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act]]" of 1753, which required that, in order to be valid and registered, all marriages were to be performed in an official ceremony in a religious setting recognised by the state, i.e. [[Church of England]], [[Religious Society of Friends|the Quakers]], or in a [[Jewish|Jewish ceremony]]. Any other form of marriage was abolished. Children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically [[Inheritance|inherit]] the property or titles of their parents. For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland. Consequently, until 1940, it continued to be enough in Scotland for a man and a woman to pledge their commitment to each other in front of witnesses to legalise their marriage. This led to an industry of "fast marriages" in Scottish towns on the border with England; the town of [[Gretna Green]] was particularly well known for this. In [[Marriage Act 1836|1836]], the requirement that the ceremony take place in a religious forum was removed, and [[Register office|registrar]]s were given the authority to register marriages not conducted by a religious official.

===In other European countries===
[[File:A cauple wait for wedding.jpg|thumb|A couple waiting to get married in the town of [[Alghero]] on the island of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]]]
Many European countries had institutions similar to [[common-law marriage]].  In 1566, the edict of the [[Council of Trent]] was proclaimed denying [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] any form of marriage not executed in a religious ceremony before a priest and two witnesses.

The [[Protestant]] pastor and theologian of [[Geneva]], [[John Calvin]], decreed that in order for a couple to be considered married they must be registered by the state in addition to a church ceremony.

In 1792, with the [[French Revolution]], religious marriage ceremonies in France were made secondary to civil marriage.  Religious ceremonies could still be performed, but only for couples who had already been married in a civil ceremony. [[Napoleon]] later spread this custom throughout most of Europe. In present-day France, only civil marriage has legal validity. A religious ceremony may be performed after or before the civil union, but it has no legal effect.

In Germany, the [[Napoleonic code]] was valid only in territories conquered by Napoleon. With the fall of his empire, civil marriage in Germany began to die out. However, certain sovereign German states introduced civil marriages, which were either obligatory (like the French model) or optional, with either a religious or civil ceremony being accepted. Already before 1848 the Grand-Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] enacted optional civil marriages, followed by the German republics of the [[Free City of Frankfurt|Free City of Frankfurt upon Main]] (1850, obligatory), [[Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg]] (1851, optional) and [[Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck]] (1852, optional). German Grand-Duchies such as [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] (1852/55, optional), [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] (1860) and [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]] (1860) as well as the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] (1863) followed suit.<ref>Julius Schoeps, "Emanzipation der Herzen – oder: Der Fall Ferdinand Falkson", in: ''PreußenJahrBuch: Ein Alamanch'' [published on the occasion of the Projekt Preussen 2001], Museumspädagogischer Dienst Berlin (MD Berlin) in collaboration with the Landesverband der Museen zu Berlin and Museumsverband des Landes Brandenburg (ed.), Berlin: MD Berlin, 2000, pp. 52–56, here p. 56. {{ISBN|3-930929-12-0}}.</ref> Civil marriages enabled [[interfaith marriage]]s as well as marriages between spouses of different Christian denominations.  After the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871, the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] adopted a bill initiated by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the "Civil Marriage Law" in 1875 (see: [[Kulturkampf]]); since then, only civil marriages have been recognised in Germany.  Religious ceremonies may still be performed at the couple's discretion.  Until Dec. 31, 2008, religious marriages could not be performed until the couple had first married in a civil ceremony.

===England and Wales===

Today marriages in England or Wales must be held in authorised premises, which may include register offices, premises such as stately homes, castles and hotels that have been approved by the local authority, churches or chapels of the Church of England or Church in Wales, and other churches and religious premises that have been registered by the registrar general for marriage.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.weddingguideuk.com/articles/legal/englandwales.asp | publisher = Wedding Guide UK | type = article | title = Legal | contribution = England and Wales |url-status = dead| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130209043344/http://www.weddingguideuk.com/articles/legal/englandwales.asp | archive-date = 2013-02-09 }}</ref>

Civil marriages require a certificate, and at times a licence, that testify that the couple is fit for marriage.  A short time after they are approved in the superintendent registrar's office, a short non-religious ceremony takes place which the registrar, the couple and two witnesses must attend; guests may also be present. Reference must not be made to God or any deity, or to a particular religion or denomination: this is strictly enforced, and readings and music in the ceremony must be agreed in advance.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://celebratewithmusic.co.uk/songs-you-cant-have-at-a-civil-ceremony/ | publisher = Wedding Music Designer (Simon Jordan) | type = article | title = Music Not Allowed at Civil Ceremonies | contribution = England and Wales}}</ref>

===United States===
[[Marriage in the United States]] is still largely regulated by state laws (though not without occasional federal override—see '''[[Loving v. Virginia|Loving]]''' and   '''[[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell]]''').

All states (and the District of Columbia) require a marriage license issued by local civil authorities. As a rule, ministers of religion (e.g. rabbis or Christian pastors) are authorized in law to perform marriages; various state or local officials, such as a mayor, judge, [[deputy marriage commissioner]], or justice of the peace, are also empowered to conduct civil wedding ceremonies, which may take place in public offices. Many counties in Pennsylvania allow [[self-uniting marriage]]s for which no official minister is required, as a concession to the state's [[Quaker]] heritage (though other religious traditions also avail themselves of the option). The type of ceremony (religious or civil) has no bearing on the legal validity of the marriage, and there is no requirement to precede a religious rite with a civil ceremony. Marriages performed outside of the United States are legally binding if officially recognized by the government of the country in which they are performed.

===Countries with mandatory civil marriage===
In most [[Europe]]an countries there is a civil ceremony requirement.  Following the civil marriage ceremony, couples are free to marry in a religious ceremony.  Such ceremonies, however, only serve to provide a religious recognition of the marriage, since the state's recognition has already been given. In some of these countries (e.g. [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]]) most couples marry
without any religious ceremony at all. Full, formal weddings, complete with wedding gowns and the presence of family and friends, are usually conducted in special ceremonial rooms in the town hall.

===Countries with no civil marriage===
There is no civil marriage in many [[Middle Eastern]] countries like [[Egypt]], [[Syria]],<ref>{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman}}</ref> [[Jordan]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html | title = Marriage in Jordan | publisher = Jordan embassy | place = USA |url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html | archive-date = 2011-10-06 }}</ref> [[United Arab Emirates]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs}}</ref> [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Israel]], as well as [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Indonesia]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law | access-date = 2011-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103042404/http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | archive-date = 2011-11-03 | url-status = dead }}</ref> among others; all marriages are conducted by religious authorities, and are registered by civil authorities only after having been registered by authorities of officially approved religions, or, having been registered abroad. Some of those countries as Israel, [[Religion in Syria|Syria]] and [[Demographics of Lebanon#18 recognized religious groups|Lebanon officially recognize]] Islam, Christianity, Druze, Judaism, and marriage is possible but usually only within the same community. Contrary to the situation in Lebanon, Syrian law prohibits the recognition of any marriage that falls outside the existing proscriptions of its personal status laws, even if the couple marries abroad.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hassan |first1=Ali Wadea' |title=Between Church and State: Civil Marriage in the Arab World |url=https://raseef22.com/en/life/2017/05/07/church-state-civil-marriage-arab-world/}}</ref>{{efn|During the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], French [[High Commissioner of the Levant]] [[Damien de Martel]] enacted Law no. 60/LR (''Lois et Réglements'') on 13 March 1936, which would give different religious communities the right to form their family laws in their own religious courts. However, Muslims rejected the notion which would make them equal with non-Muslims and lose the privileged status made by the Ottoman ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]'' system. The Muslims also rejected Law no. 146/LR on 18 November 1938 enacted by High Commissioner [[Gabriel Puaux]], which would recognize civil marriages contracted abroad, and require citizens to follow civil laws which are not explicitly regulated within one's religious community.{{sfn|van Eijk|2016|pp=29–30}}}} Egypt recognizes civil marriages but is very complicated.

In 22 countries worldwide and in several jurisdictions within [[Mexico]], a same-sex couple can be legally partnered in a [[civil union]], [[domestic partnership]] or [[registered partnership]]. Couples in these unions or partnerships are afforded rights and obligations similar to, but not identical to, those of a married couple.
