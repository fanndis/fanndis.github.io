==Personal life==
Pickler's mother was repeatedly charged with writing [[Non-sufficient funds|bad checks]] and was convicted in 1988 for passing a forged prescription for [[Diazepam|Valium]] at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, {{convert|45|mi}} northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', Pickler said: "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said that her mother had moved to [[Union County, North Carolina|Union County]] with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since.

In June 2008, she joined Carrie Underwood, a prolonged vegetarian, in giving up eating meat.

"One night I couldn't sleep and I was up and just Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' I saw all the videos and I just thought it was horrible. It's animal cruelty.
