'''Contemporary R&B''' (commonly referred to as simply '''R&B''') is a [[music genre]] that combines [[rhythm and blues]] with elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic music]].

The genre features a distinctive [[Record producer|record production]] style, [[drum machine]]-backed rhythms, [[Pitch correction|pitch corrected]] vocals, and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. [[Electronic music|Electronic]] influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or [[electronic dance music|dance]]-inspired [[beat (music)|beats]] are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists are often known for their use of [[melisma]], popularized by vocalists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Stevie Wonder]],<ref name="Kustombeats">{{cite web|title= R&B |website= Kustom Beats |url= http://www.kustombeats.com/r_b.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315235741/http://www.kustombeats.com/r_b.html |archivedate= March 15, 2012}}</ref> [[Whitney Houston]],<ref name="Kustombeats"/><ref name="NewYorker">{{cite magazine|first= Sasha |last= Frere-Jones |title= On Top: Mariah Carey's record-breaking career |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |date= April 3, 2006 |url= http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/?060403crmu_music |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060420191553/http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/?060403crmu_music |archivedate= April 20, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Michael |last= Jarret |date= October 6, 1998 |chapter= Whitney Houston Syndrome |title= Sound Tracks: A Musical ABC |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |isbn= 978-1-56639-641-7}}</ref> [[Mariah Carey]]<ref name="NewYorker"/><ref>{{cite news|url= http://mcarchives.com/index.asp?id=1457 |title= "Vision of Love" sets off melisma trend |newspaper= [[The Village Voice]] |publisher= Mcarchives.com |date= February 4, 2003 |accessdate= November 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title= The 100 Greatest Singer of All Time : 79 – Mariah Carey |date= November 12, 2008 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/greatestsingers/page/79 |archivedate= March 24, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324045333/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/greatestsingers/page/79}}</ref> and [[Beyoncé]].<ref>{{cite news|first= David |last= Browne |title= Trilling Songbirds Clip Their Wings |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= December 24, 2010 |accessdate= 27 August 2020 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/arts/music/26browne.html |archivedate= August 25, 2012 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ABcqdJYG?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/arts/music/26browne.html?_r=2 |url-status= live}}</ref> As of late, contemporary R&B rhythms are being combined with elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[pop music]].

==History==
Contemporary R&B originated at the end of the disco era in the late-1970s, when [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Quincy Jones]] added more electronic elements to the sound of the time to create a smoother dancefloor-friendly sound.<ref>{{cite web|first= David |last= Ward |title= R&B and Influence: The Producer as Ephebe |work= Circulation Mag |date= November 2011 |accessdate= August 27, 2015 |url= http://www.circulation-mag.com/2011/11/rb-and-influence-the-producer-as-ephebe/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200728192100/http://www.circulation-mag.com/2011/11/rb-and-influence-the-producer-as-ephebe/ |archivedate= February 28, 2020}}</ref> The first result was "[[Off the Wall]]" (1979), which—according to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]]—"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus" and "was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk".<ref>{{cite web |first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |title= Michael Jackson – Off the Wall |publisher= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= August 27, 2015 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332 |archivedate= December 20, 2015 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151220235825/http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332 |url-status= live}}</ref>

Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's "[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]" (1986) was "important to the development of R&B for a number of reasons", as she and her producers, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility."<ref name="The New Blue Music">{{cite book|first= Richard J. |last= Ripani |year= 2006 |title= The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 |pages= 130–155, 186–188 |publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]] |isbn= 978-1-57806-862-3}}</ref> Ripani wrote that "the success of "Control" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development."<ref name="The New Blue Music"/> That same year, [[Teddy Riley]] began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed "[[new jack swing]]" and was applied to artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bobby Brown]] and [[Bell Biv DeVoe]].

==1990s==
[[File:Ballasyrkellypic.jpg|thumb|left|[[R. Kelly]] was listed in 2010 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' the most successful R&B artist of the past 25 years.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/950658/the-juice-presents-top-50-rbhip-hop-artists-of-the-past-25-years |first= Mariel |last= Concepcion |title= The Juice Presents Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= November 18, 2010 |accessdate= December 15, 2014 |archivedate= August 3, 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170803144552/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/950658/the-juice-presents-top-50-rbhip-hop-artists-of-the-past-25-years |url-status= live }}</ref> He is also referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#K|King of R&B]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Cover Story – R.

In contrast to the works of [[Boyz II Men]], [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and similar artists, other R&B artists and groups from this same period began adding even more of a hip-hop sound to their work, like the innovative group [[Jodeci]]. The synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks of new jack swing were replaced by grittier [[East Coast hip hop]]-inspired backing tracks, resulting in a genre labeled "[[hip hop soul]]" by [[Mary J. Blige]] and producer [[Sean Combs]] who also had mentored group [[Jodeci]] in the beginning and helped them with their unique look. The style became less popular by the end of the 1990s, but later experienced a resurgence.

In 1990, [[Mariah Carey]] released "[[Vision of Love]]" as her debut single. It was immensely popular peaking at number 1 in many worldwide charts including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and it propelled Mariah's career. The song is usually said to have popularized the use of [[melisma]] and brought it into mainstream R&B.

During the mid-1990s, Whitney Houston's "[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album]]" sold over 40 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/01/26/adele-s-21-sets-new-records.html |first= Brooklyne |last= Gipson |title= Adele's "21" Closing in on Billboard Charts Record |publisher= [[BET]] |date= January 26, 2012 |accessdate= November 2, 2014}}</ref> [[Janet Jackson]]'s self-titled fifth studio album "[[Janet (album)|janet.]]" (1993), which came after her historic multimillion-dollar contract with [[Virgin Records]], sold over twenty million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Michael |last= Goldberg |date= May 2, 1991 |title= The Jacksons score big |newspaper= Rolling Stone |page= 32 |issn= 0035-791X}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1= Susan |last1= Bickelhaupt |first2= Maureen |last2= Dezell |date= January 13, 1996 |title= Room with a private view |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |page= 26}}</ref> Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No. 1 hits, including "[[One Sweet Day]]", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", with [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—"[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]", "[[II (Boyz II Men album)|II]]" and "[[CrazySexyCool]]".

In the late 1990s, [[neo soul]], which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]. Hill and [[Missy Elliott]] further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the [[Grammy Award]]s enacted the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album]], with "[[II (Boyz II Men album)|II]]" by [[Boyz II Men]] becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by [[TLC (group)|TLC]] for "[[CrazySexyCool]]" in 1996, [[Tony Rich]] for "Words" in 1997, [[Erykah Badu]] for "[[Baduizm]]" in 1998 and [[Lauryn Hill]] for "[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]" in 1999. At the end of 1999, ''Billboard'' magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Geoff |last= Mayfield |date= December 25, 1999 |title= Totally '90s: Diary of a decade |magazine= Billboard |volume= 111 |issue= 112 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>

Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, [[The Neptunes]] and [[Timbaland]] set influential precedence on contemporary R&B and hip hop music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Sasha |last= Frere-Jones |title= The Timbaland Era |date= October 6, 2008 |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |url= http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2008/10/06/081006crmu_music_frerejones |archivedate= October 1, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081001233024/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2008/10/06/081006crmu_music_frerejones}}</ref>
