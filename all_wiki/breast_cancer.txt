<!-- Causes and Diagnosis' -->
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, [[obesity]], a lack of physical exercise, [[alcoholism]], [[hormone replacement therapy]] during [[menopause]], [[ionizing radiation]], an early age at [[menarche|first menstruation]], having children late in life or not at all, older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer.<ref name=NCI2014Pt /><ref name="WCR2014">{{cite book |title = World Cancer Report 2014 |date = 2014 |publisher = World Health Organization |isbn = 978-92-832-0429-9 |pages = Chapter 5.2 }}</ref> About 5–10% of cases are the result of a genetic predisposition inherited from a person's parents,<ref name=NCI2014Pt /> including [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] among others.<ref name=NCI2014Pt /> Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] and the [[lobules]] that supply these ducts with milk.<ref name=NCI2014Pt /> Cancers developing from the ducts are known as [[Mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinomas]], while those developing from lobules are known as [[lobular carcinoma]]s.<ref name=NCI2014Pt /> There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer.<ref name=WCR2014 /> Some, such as [[ductal carcinoma in situ]], develop from [[pre-invasive lesions]].<ref name=WCR2014 /> The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a [[breast biopsy|biopsy]] of the concerning tissue.<ref name=NCI2014Pt /> Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective.<ref name=NCI2014Pt />

<!-- Screening and treatments -->
The balance of benefits versus harms of [[breast cancer screening]] is controversial.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File: Breast Cancer.png|thumb|Breast cancer]]
[[File:Breast cancer.jpg|thumb|Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump, and skin dimpling.]]
Breast cancer most commonly presents as a [[breast lump|lump]] that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.<ref name="merck">{{cite web |author = Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy |date = February 2003 |title = Breast Disorders: Breast Cancer |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |access-date = 5 February 2008 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002141649/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archive-date = 2 October 2011 |df = dmy-all |author-link = Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy }}</ref> The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a [[mammogram]].<ref name="acs cancer facts 2007" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd NF, Guo H, Martin LJ, Sun L, Stone J, Fishell E, Jong RA, Hislop G, Chiarelli A, Minkin S, Yaffe MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Mammographic density and the risk and detection of breast cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–36 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17229950 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa062790 }}</ref> Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits<ref name="merck" /> may also indicate breast cancer.

Indications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Watson M |title = Assessment of suspected cancer |journal = InnoAiT |volume = 1 |issue = 2 |pages = 94–107 |year = 2008 |doi = 10.1093/innovait/inn001 |s2cid = 71908359 }}</ref> Pain ("[[mastodynia]]") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other [[breast health]] issues.<ref name="merck" /><ref name="acs cancer facts 2007">{{cite web |author = American Cancer Society |year = 2007 |title = Cancer Facts & Figures 2007 |url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf |access-date = 26 April 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410025934/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf |archive-date = 10 April 2007 }}</ref><ref name="eMed">{{Cite web|website=eMedicine|date=23 August 2006|title=Breast Cancer Evaluation|url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3287.HTM|access-date=5 February 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212070431/http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3287.HTM|archive-date=12 February 2008}}</ref>

Another symptom complex of breast cancer is [[Paget's disease of the breast]]. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashikari R, Park K, Huvos AG, Urban JA | title = Paget's disease of the breast | journal = Cancer | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 680–5 | date = September 1970 | pmid = 4318756 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(197009)26:3<680::aid-cncr2820260329>3.0.co;2-p | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kollmorgen DR, Varanasi JS, Edge SB, Carson WE | title = Paget's disease of the breast: a 33-year experience | journal = Journal of the American College of Surgeons | volume = 187 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–7 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9704964 | doi = 10.1016/S1072-7515(98)00143-4 }}</ref>

Inflammatory Breast Cancer presents with similar effects. [[Inflammatory Breast Cancer]] is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the Breast. The visual effects of Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleer CG, van Golen KL, Merajver SD | title = Molecular biology of breast cancer metastasis.

In rare cases, what initially appears as a [[fibroadenoma]] (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a [[phyllodes tumor]]. Phyllodes tumors are formed within the [[Stroma (tissue)|stroma]] (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumors are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline or malignant.<ref name="phyllodes-tumor">{{cite web |author = answers.com |title = Oncology Encyclopedia: Cystosarcoma Phyllodes |url = http://www.answers.com/topic/phyllodes-tumor |access-date = 10 August 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100908032727/http://www.answers.com/topic/phyllodes-tumor |archive-date = 8 September 2010 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Malignant tumors can result in metastatic tumors— secondary tumors (originating from the primary tumor) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.<ref name="pmid17158753">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacroix M | title = Significance, detection and markers of disseminated breast cancer cells | journal = Endocrine-Related Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 1033–67 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17158753 | doi = 10.1677/ERC-06-0001 | doi-access = free }}</ref> When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are oftentimes fatal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stage 4 :: The National Breast Cancer Foundation |url=https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-4 |website=www.nationalbreastcancer.org }}</ref> Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain,  jaundice and neurological symptoms.

{{Main|Risk factors of breast cancer}}

Risk factors can be divided into two categories:
* ''modifiable'' risk factors (things that people can change themselves, such as consumption of alcoholic beverages), and
* ''fixed'' risk factors (things that cannot be changed, such as age and biological sex).<ref name="Hay2013" />

=== Lifestyle ===
{{See also|List of breast carcinogenic substances}}

Obesity and drinking alcoholic beverages are among the most common modifiable risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald JA, Goyal A, Terry MB | title = Alcohol Intake and Breast Cancer Risk: Weighing the Overall Evidence | journal = Current Breast Cancer Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–221 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24265860 | pmc = 3832299 | doi = 10.1007/s12609-013-0114-z }}</ref> However, the correlation between these factors and breast cancer is anything but linear. Studies show that those who rapidly gain weight in adulthood are at higher risk than those who have been overweight since childhood. Likewise excess fat in the midsection seems to induce a higher risk than excess weight carried in the lower body.

[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]. Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.]]

Breast cancer, like other [[cancers]], occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.

Normal cells will commit cell suicide ([[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]) when they are no longer needed. Until then, they are protected from cell suicide by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] pathway; another is the [[Ras (protein)|RAS]]/[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]]/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently "on", rendering the cell incapable of committing suicide when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the "on" position, and the cancer cell does not commit suicide.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Lee A, Arteaga C |title = 32nd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium |book-title = Sunday Morning Year-End Review |date = 14 December 2009 |url = http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813021816/http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2013 }}</ref>

In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of people with breast cancer and people with [[ovarian cancer]] have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases.  The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called [[hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome]].  The best known of these, the [[BRCA mutation|''BRCA'' mutations]], confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent.  Some mutations associated with cancer, such as ''[[p53]]'', ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', occur in mechanisms to correct errors in [[DNA]]. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.<ref name="acs bc facts 2005-6">{{cite web |author = American Cancer Society |year = 2005 |title = Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2005–2006 |url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |access-date = 26 April 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613192148/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |archive-date = 13 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunning AM, Healey CS, Pharoah PD, Teare MD, Ponder BA, Easton DF | title = A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 843–54 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10548311 | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10548311 }}</ref> However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary ''BRCA'' gene mutations between carrier families.

== Diagnosis ==

Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample - or [[breast biopsy|biopsy]] - of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.

The two most commonly used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple [[cyst]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saslow D, Hannan J, Osuch J, Alciati MH, Baines C, Barton M, Bobo JK, Coleman C, Dolan M, Gaumer G, Kopans D, Kutner S, Lane DS, Lawson H, Meissner H, Moorman C, Pennypacker H, Pierce P, Sciandra E, Smith R, Coates R | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical breast examination: practical recommendations for optimizing performance and reporting | journal = Ca | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 327–44 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15537576 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.54.6.327 | doi-access = free }}</ref> When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove a sample of the fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as [[fine needle aspiration]], or fine needle aspiration and cytology, FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. A needle aspiration can be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic. A local anesthetic may be used to numb the breast tissue to prevent pain during the procedure, but may not be necessary if the lump isn't beneath the skin. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.

Other options for biopsy include a [[core biopsy]] or [[vacuum-assisted breast biopsy]],<ref name="pmid20130983">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu YH, Liang C, Yuan XZ | title = Diagnostic value of vacuum-assisted breast biopsy for breast carcinoma: a meta-analysis and systematic review | journal = Breast Cancer Research and Treatment | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 469–79 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20130983 | doi = 10.1007/s10549-010-0750-1 | s2cid = 22685290 }}</ref> which are procedures in which a section of the breast lump is removed; or an [[excisional biopsy]], in which the entire lump is removed. Very often the results of physical examination by a healthcare provider, mammography, and additional tests that may be performed in special circumstances (such as imaging by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) are sufficient to warrant excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and primary treatment method.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson MJ | title = Multifocal invasive mucinous carcinoma of the breast | journal = Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–158 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 31975569 | pmc = 7276192 | doi = 10.1002/jmrs.379 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=July 2020}}

=== Classification ===
{{Main|Breast cancer classification}}

Breast cancers are classified by several grading systems. Each of these influences the [[prognosis]] and can affect treatment response. Description of a breast cancer optimally includes all of these factors.
[[File:Pie chart of incidence and prognosis of histopathologic breast cancer types.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Histopathologic types of breast cancer, with relative incidences and prognoses.]]
* '''Histopathology'''. Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histological]] appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal]] or lobular carcinoma. ''Carcinoma in situ'' is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mary Ann |last=Kosir | name-list-style = vanc |date=July 2019|title=Merck Manual, Professional Edition|chapter-url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live|chapter=Ch. 253, Breast Cancer}}</ref>
* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.
* '''Stage'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|Breast cancer staging]] using the [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|TNM system]] is based on the size of the <u>t</u>umor ('''T'''), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph node|lymph]] <u>n</u>odes ('''N''') in the armpits, and whether the tumor has <u>m</u>etastasized ('''M''') (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. <br />The main stages are:
** Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS).
** Stages 1–3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.
** Stage 4 is [[Metastatic breast cancer|'metastatic' cancer]] that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.

:Where available, [[imaging studies]] may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer. However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the person to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |access-date = 14 August 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |archive-date = 31 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="CarlsonBreast">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlson RW, Allred DC, Anderson BO, Burstein HJ, Carter WB, Edge SB, Erban JK, Farrar WB, Goldstein LJ, Gradishar WJ, Hayes DF, Hudis CA, Jahanzeb M, Kiel K, Ljung BM, Marcom PK, Mayer IA, McCormick B, Nabell LM, Pierce LJ, Reed EC, Smith ML, Somlo G, Theriault RL, Topham NS, Ward JH, Winer EP, Wolff AC | display-authors = 6 | title = Breast cancer.

* '''Receptor status'''. Breast cancer cells have [[Breast cancer classification#Receptor status|receptors]] on their surface and in their [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Chemical messengers such as [[hormone]]s bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have three important receptors: [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and [[HER2/neu|HER2]]. <br />ER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. [[tamoxifen]]), and generally have a better prognosis.

{{Main|Breast cancer screening}}

[[File:BreastScreen Aotearoa.JPG|thumb|A mobile breast cancer screening unit in New Zealand]]

Breast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed including clinical and self [[breast exams]], [[mammography]], genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

A clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities. Clinical breast exams are performed by health care providers, while self-breast exams are performed by the person themselves.<ref>{{cite web |title = Screening |url = https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm |work = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date = 17 November 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151118012201/http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm |archive-date = 18 November 2015 |df = dmy-all |date = 2018-09-11 }}</ref> Evidence does not support the effectiveness of either type of breast exam, as by the time a lump is large enough to be found it is likely to have been growing for several years and thus soon be large enough to be found without an exam.<ref name=USPSTFScreen2009>{{cite web |title = Screening for Breast Cancer |url = http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm |work = US Preventive Services Task Force |date = December 2009 |access-date = 24 December 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130102015424/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm |archive-date = 2 January 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kösters JP, Gøtzsche PC | title = Regular self-examination or clinical examination for early detection of breast cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD003373 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12804462 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003373 | pmc = 7387360 }}</ref> Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses [[X-ray]]s to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps.

== Management ==
{{Main|Breast cancer management}}

The management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the cancer is more advanced or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.

Breast cancer is usually treated with [[surgery]], which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saini KS, Taylor C, Ramirez AJ, Palmieri C, Gunnarsson U, Schmoll HJ, Dolci SM, Ghenne C, Metzger-Filho O, Skrzypski M, Paesmans M, Ameye L, Piccart-Gebhart MJ, de Azambuja E | display-authors = 6 | title = Role of the multidisciplinary team in breast cancer management: results from a large international survey involving 39 countries | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 853–9 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21821551 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdr352 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years.

=== Surgery ===

[[File:Mastectomie 02.jpg|thumb|Chest after right breast [[mastectomy]]]]

Surgery involves the physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy.

Standard surgeries include:
* [[Mastectomy]]: Removal of the whole breast.
* [[Quadrantectomy]]: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.
* [[Lumpectomy]]: Removal of a small part of the breast.
Once the tumor has been removed, if the person desires, [[breast reconstruction surgery]], a type of [[plastic surgery]], may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.
Alternatively, women use [[breast prostheses]] to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. [[Nipple prosthesis]] can be used at any time following the mastectomy.

=== Medication ===

Medications used after and in addition to surgery are called [[Adjuvant cancer therapy|adjuvant therapy]]. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called [[neoadjuvant therapy]]. [[Aspirin]] may reduce mortality from breast cancer when used with other treatments.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leite AM, Macedo AV, Jorge AJ, Martins WA | title = Antiplatelet Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients Using Hormonal Therapy: Myths, Evidence and Potentialities - Systematic Review | journal = Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–212 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30183988 | pmc = 6122903 | doi = 10.5935/abc.20180138 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes MD, Chen WY, Li L, Hertzmark E, Spiegelman D, Hankinson SE | title = Aspirin intake and survival after breast cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1467–72 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20159825 | pmc = 2849768 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.7918 }}</ref>

There are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment: hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.

====Hormonal therapy====
Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. [[tamoxifen]], or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an [[aromatase inhibitor]], e.g. [[anastrozole]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bao T, Rudek MA |s2cid = 1802863 |title = The Clinical Pharmacology of Anastrozole |journal = European Oncology & Haematology |volume = 7 |issue = 2 |pages = 106–8 |year = 2011 |doi = 10.17925/EOH.2011.07.02.106 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> or [[letrozole]].

====Chemotherapy====
[[Chemotherapy]] is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as "AC",  combines [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[doxorubicin]]. Sometimes a [[taxane]] drug, such as [[docetaxel]], is added, and the regime is then known as "CAT". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, [[methotrexate]], and [[fluorouracil]] (or "CMF"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

[[File:Diagram showing how you have internal radiotherapy for breast cancer CRUK 159.svg|thumb|right|Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer]]

[[Radiotherapy]] is given after surgery to the region of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery. When given intraoperatively as [[Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy]], it may also have a beneficial effect on tumor microenvironment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Massarut S, Baldassare G, Belleti B, Reccanello S, D'Andrea S, Ezio C, Perin T, Roncadin M, Vaidya JS |title = Intraoperative radiotherapy impairs breast cancer cell motility induced by surgical wound fluid |journal = J Clin Oncol |volume = 24 |issue = 18S |page = 10611 |year = 2006 |url = http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=40&abstractID=34291 |df = dmy-all |doi = 10.1200/jco.2006.24.18_suppl.10611 |access-date = 9 June 2010  |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122626/http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=40&abstractID=34291 |archive-date = 12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belletti B, Vaidya JS, D'Andrea S, Entschladen F, Roncadin M, Lovat F, Berton S, Perin T, Candiani E, Reccanello S, Veronesi A, Canzonieri V, Trovò MG, Zaenker KS, Colombatti A, Baldassarre G, Massarut S | display-authors = 6 | title = Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy impairs the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 1325–32 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316551 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4453 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Radiation therapy can be delivered as [[external beam radiotherapy]] or as [[brachytherapy]] (internal radiotherapy).

=== Follow-up care ===

Care after primary breast cancer treatment, otherwise called 'follow-up care', can be intensive involving regular laboratory tests in asymptomatic people to try to achieve earlier detection of possible metastases. A review has found that follow-up programs involving regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive programs consisting of laboratory tests in terms of early detection of recurrence, overall survival and quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moschetti I, Cinquini M, Lambertini M, Levaggi A, Liberati A | title = Follow-up strategies for women treated for early breast cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD001768 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27230946 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd001768.pub3 | pmc = 7073405 }}</ref>

[[File:RecurrentbreastCA1.gif|thumb|An extreme example of an advanced recurrent breast cancer with an ulcerating axillary mass]]

=== Prognostic factors ===

The [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the breast cancer is the most important component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title = Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher = Merck.com |access-date = 8 May 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archive-date = 10 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

* Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an excellent prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |title = Surgery Choices for Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer |publisher = National Cancer Institute and the National Research Center for Women & Families |date = August 2004 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813054115/http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2013 }}</ref> 
* Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a progressively poorer prognosis and greater risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without [[Lymphadenectomy|lymph node removal]]), chemotherapy (plus [[trastuzumab]] for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).{{mcn|date=May 2018}}
* Stage 4, metastatic cancer, (i.e. spread to distant sites) has a poor prognosis and is managed by various combination of all treatments from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Ten-year survival rate is 5% without treatment and 10% with optimal treatment.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title = Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher = Merck.com |access-date = 14 November 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archive-date = 10 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Breast cancer classification#Grade|The breast cancer grade]] is assessed by comparison of the breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elston CW, Ellis IO | title = Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I.

Younger women with an age of less than 40 years or women over 80 years tend to have a poorer prognosis than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Peppercorn J |title = Breast Cancer in Women Under 40 |journal = Oncology |volume = 23 |issue = 6 |pages = 465–74 |year = 2009 |url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1413886 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090616191104/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1413886 |archive-date = 16 June 2009 |df = dmy-all |pmid = 19544685 }}</ref>

=== Psychological aspects ===
Not all people with breast cancer experience their illness in the same manner. Factors such as age can have a significant impact on the way a person copes with a breast cancer diagnosis. Premenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer must confront the issues of early [[menopause]] induced by many of the chemotherapy regimens used to treat their breast cancer, especially those that use hormones to counteract ovarian function.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Pritchard KI |title = Ovarian Suppression/Ablation in Premenopausal ER-Positive Breast Cancer Patients |journal = Oncology |volume = 23 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/1366719?pageNumber=1 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090705230857/http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/1366719?pageNumber=1 |archive-date = 5 July 2009 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Although breast cancer was known in ancient times, it was uncommon until the 19th century, when improvements in sanitation and control of deadly [[infectious disease]]s resulted in dramatic increases in lifespan.

Because ancient medicine believed that the cause was systemic, rather than local, and because surgery carried a high mortality rate, the preferred treatments tended to be pharmacological rather than surgical.  Herbal and mineral preparations, especially involving the poison [[arsenic]], were relatively common.

Mastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as AD 548, when it was proposed by the court physician [[Aetios of Amida]] to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]].<ref name=Olson9 />  It was not until doctors achieved greater understanding of the circulatory system in the 17th century that they could link breast cancer's spread to the [[lymph nodes]] in the armpit.

Their successful work was carried on by [[William Stewart Halsted]] who started performing [[radical mastectomies]] in 1882, helped greatly by advances in general surgical technology, such as [[aseptic technique]] and [[anesthesia]]. The Halsted radical mastectomy often involved removing both breasts, associated lymph nodes, and the underlying chest muscles. This often led to long-term pain and disability, but was seen as necessary in order to prevent the cancer from recurring.<ref name=Olson102 /> Before the advent of the Halsted radical mastectomy, 20-year survival rates were only 10%; Halsted's surgery raised that rate to 50%.<ref name=Olson1>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|p=1}}</ref>  Extending Halsted's work, [[Jerome Urban]] promoted superradical mastectomies, taking even more tissue, until 1963, when the ten-year survival rates proved equal to the less-damaging radical mastectomy.<ref name=Olson102>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=102–6}}</ref>

Radical mastectomies remained the standard of care in America until the 1970s, but in Europe, breast-sparing procedures, often followed by radiation therapy, were generally adopted in the 1950s.<ref name=Olson102 />  One reason for this striking difference in approach may be the structure of the medical professions:  European surgeons, descended from the [[barber surgeon]], were held in less esteem than [[physicians]]; in America, the surgeon was the king of the medical profession.<ref name=Olson102 />  Additionally, there were far more European women surgeons:  Less than one percent of American surgical oncologists were female, but some European breast cancer wards boasted a medical staff that was half female.<ref name=Olson102 />  American health insurance companies also paid surgeons more to perform radical mastectomies than they did to perform more intricate breast-sparing surgeries.<ref name=Olson102 />

Breast cancer staging systems were developed in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=Olson102 />

During the 1970s, a new understanding of [[metastasis]] led to perceiving cancer as a systemic illness as well as a localized one, and more sparing procedures were developed that proved equally effective.

In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of women who had successfully completed standard treatment then demanded and received high-dose [[bone marrow transplant]]s, thinking this would lead to better long-term survival.

== Society and culture ==
{{See also|Breast cancer awareness|List of people with breast cancer}}

Before the 20th century, breast cancer was feared and discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful.  As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care.  When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began [[raising awareness]] of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment.  The "Women's Field Army", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the [[American Cancer Society]]) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer [[support group]], called "Reach to Recovery", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=37–38}}</ref>

The [[breast cancer movement]] of the 1980s and 1990s developed out of the larger [[feminist movement]]s and [[Women's health movement in the United States|women's health movement]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=4}}</ref>  This series of political and educational campaigns, partly inspired by the politically and socially effective [[AIDS]] awareness campaigns, resulted in the widespread acceptance of second opinions before surgery, less invasive surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in care.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.crcfl.net/content/view/history-of-breast-cancer-advocacy.html |title = History of Breast Cancer Advocacy |author = Bob Riter |publisher = Cancer Resource Center of the Finger Lakes |access-date = 29 June 2013 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130623074930/http://www.crcfl.net/content/view/history-of-breast-cancer-advocacy.html |archive-date = 23 June 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Pink ribbon ===
{{Main|Pink ribbon}}

[[File:Pink ribbon.svg|upright|thumb|The [[pink ribbon]] is a symbol to show support for breast cancer awareness]]

A [[pink ribbon]] is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, which can be made inexpensively, are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like [[Poppy day#Poppies|poppies on Remembrance Day]].  They may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that the manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=27–72}}</ref>

The pink ribbon is associated with individual generosity, faith in scientific progress, and a "can-do" attitude.  It encourages consumers to focus on the emotionally appealing ultimate vision of a cure for breast cancer, rather than on the fraught path between current knowledge and any future cures.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=359–361}}</ref>

Wearing or displaying a pink ribbon has been criticized by the opponents of this practice as a kind of [[slacktivism]], because it has no practical positive effect.  It has also been criticized as [[hypocrisy]], because some people wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like [[patient rights]] and anti-pollution legislation.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=366–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author = Landeman, Anne |date = 11 June 2008 |url = http://www.prwatch.org/node/7436 |title = Pinkwashing: Can Shopping Cure Breast Cancer? |publisher = [[Center for Media and Democracy]] |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605122507/http://www.prwatch.org/node/7436 |archive-date = 5 June 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>  Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=365–6}}</ref>  It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and [[objectifying]] women and their breasts.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=372–4}}</ref>  [[Breast Cancer Action]] launched the "Think Before You Pink" campaign, and said that businesses have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.<ref>[http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101008/pinkwashing-pink-ribbon-101009/20101009/?hub=OttawaHome Breast cancer month overshadowed by 'pinkwashing'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012151918/http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101008/pinkwashing-pink-ribbon-101009/20101009/?hub=OttawaHome |date=12 October 2010 }} 9 October 2010, Angela Mulholland, CTV.ca News</ref>

=== Breast cancer culture ===
Breast cancer culture, also known as pink ribbon culture, is the set of activities, attitudes, and values that surround and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism.

In breast cancer culture, breast cancer therapy is viewed as a [[rite of passage]] rather than a disease.<ref name=Ehrenreich>{{Cite news |first = Barbara |last = Ehrenreich | name-list-style = vanc |title = Welcome to Cancerland |newspaper = [[Harper's Magazine]] |date = November 2001 |url = http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101120135605/http://barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |archive-date = 20 November 2010 }}</ref>  To fit into this mold, the woman with breast cancer needs to normalize and feminize her appearance, and minimize the disruption that her health issues cause anyone else.  Anger, sadness, and negativity must be silenced.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

As with most cultural models, people who conform to the model are given social status, in this case as [[cancer survivor]]s.  Women who reject the model are shunned, punished and shamed.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

The culture is criticized for treating adult women like little girls, as evidenced by "baby" toys such as pink [[teddy bear]]s given to adult women.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

The primary purposes or goals of breast cancer culture are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the pre-eminent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is doing something effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=57}}</ref>

=== Emphasis ===

Compared to other diseases or other cancers, breast cancer receives a proportionately greater share of resources and attention. In 2001 MP [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Ian Gibson]], chairman of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] all party group on cancer stated "The treatment has been skewed by the [[lobbying]], there is no doubt about that.

Some subjects, such as [[cancer-related fatigue]], have been studied little except in women with breast cancer.

One result of breast cancer's high visibility is that statistical results can sometimes be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives—a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.<ref name=Olson199>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=199–200}}</ref>  This obscures the reality, which is that about ten times as many women will die from [[heart disease]] or [[stroke]] than from breast cancer.<ref>{{cite news |author = Ave, Melanie |title = Tampabay: All May Not Be in the Pink |journal = [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date = 10 October 2006 |url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/06/Tampabay/All_may_not_be_in_the.shtml |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090824100103/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/06/Tampabay/All_may_not_be_in_the.shtml |archive-date = 24 August 2009 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The emphasis on breast cancer screening may be harming women by subjecting them to unnecessary radiation, biopsies, and surgery.

=== Racial Differences in Breast Cancer Incidence / Mortality ===

There are racial disparities in the mortality rates for breast cancer as well as in breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women of every ethnic group in the United States. Breast cancer incidence among black women aged 45 and older is higher than that of white women in the same age group. White women aged 60-84 have higher incidence rates of breast cancer than Black women. Despite this, Black women at every age are more likely to succumb to breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yedjou CG, Sims JN, Miele L, Noubissi F, Lowe L, Fonseca DD, Alo RA, Payton M, Tchounwou PB | display-authors = 6 | title = Health and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 1152 | pages = 31–49 | date = January 3, 2020 | pmid = 31456178 | pmc = 6941147 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-030-20301-6_3 | isbn = 978-3-030-20300-9 }}</ref>
 
Breast cancer treatment has improved greatly in recent years, but black women are still less likely to obtain treatment compared to white women. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yedjou CG, Sims JN, Miele L, Noubissi F, Lowe L, Fonseca DD, Alo RA, Payton M, Tchounwou PB | display-authors = 6 | title = Health and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 1152 | pages = 31–49 | date = January 3, 2020 | pmid = 31456178 | pmc = 6941147 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-030-20301-6_3 | isbn = 978-3-030-20300-9 }}</ref>  Risk factors such as socioeconomic status, late-stage, or breast cancer at diagnosis, genetic differences in tumor subtypes, differences in health care access all contribute to these disparities. Socioeconomic determinants affecting the disparity in breast cancer illness include poverty, culture, as well as social injustice. In Hispanic women, the incidence of breast cancer is lower than in non-Hispanic women but is often diagnosed at a later stage than white women with larger tumors. 

Black women are usually diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age than white women. The median age of diagnosis for Black women is 59, in comparison to 62 in White women. The incidence of breast cancer in Black women has increased by 0.4% per year since 1975 and 1.5% per year among Asian/Pacific Islander women since 1992. Incidence rates were stable for non-Hispanic White, Hispanics, and Native women. The five-year survival rate is noted to be 81% in Black women and 92% in White women. Chinese and Japanese women have the highest survival rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yedjou CG, Sims JN, Miele L, Noubissi F, Lowe L, Fonseca DD, Alo RA, Payton M, Tchounwou PB | display-authors = 6 | title = Health and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 1152 | pages = 31–49 | date = January 3, 2020 | pmid = 31456178 | pmc = 6941147 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-030-20301-6_3 | isbn = 978-3-030-20300-9 }}</ref>

Poverty is a major driver for disparities related to breast cancer. Low-income women are less likely to undergo breast cancer screening and thus are more likely to have a late-stage diagnosis. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yedjou CG, Sims JN, Miele L, Noubissi F, Lowe L, Fonseca DD, Alo RA, Payton M, Tchounwou PB | display-authors = 6 | title = Health and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 1152 | pages = 31–49 | date = January 3, 2020 | pmid = 31456178 | pmc = 6941147 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-030-20301-6_3 | isbn = 978-3-030-20300-9 }}</ref> Ensuring women of all racial and ethnic groups receive equitable health care can positively affect these disparities.

Diagnosing new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.<ref name=yarbro /> As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as [[MRI]]s (magnetic resonance imaging), [[CT scan]]s, ultrasounds, and [[mammogram]]s with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as [[PET scan]]s are not.<ref name=yarbro />

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.<ref name=yarbro /> However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the [[first trimester]], increase the risk of [[birth defect]]s and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).<ref name=yarbro />  Elective [[abortion]]s are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.<ref name=yarbro />

Radiation treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of [[mastitis]]. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.<ref name="yarbro">{{cite book |title = Cancer nursing: principles and practice | veditors = Yarbro CH, Wujcik D, Gobel BH |edition = 7th |publisher = Jones & Bartlett Publishers |year = 2011 |isbn = 978-1-4496-1829-2 |pages = 901–905 }}</ref>

=== Menopausal hormone replacement ===

In breast cancer survivors, it is recommended to first consider non-hormonal options for [[menopausal]] effects, such as [[bisphosphonate]]s or [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s (SERMs) for osteoporosis, and [[vaginal estrogen]] for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If hormone replacement is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with an [[intrauterine device with progestogen]] may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.<ref>[https://archive.is/20160407214503/https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html Management of the menopause after breast cancer], from the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]].

=== Breast cancer cell lines ===
{{See also|List of breast cancer cell lines}}

Part of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]] studies performed with [[cell lines]] derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating [[stroma (animal tissue)|stromal]] cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard [[growth medium|media]]. The first breast cancer cell line described, [[BT-20 (cell line)|BT-20]], was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from [[pleural effusion]]s. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by [[fibroblasts]] and other tumor stroma cells.
Many of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely [[MCF-7]], [[T-47D]], and [[MDA-MB-231]], account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a [[Medline]]-based survey.

=== Molecular markers ===

==== Metabolic markers ====

Clinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2<ref name="pmid11522269">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duffy MJ | title = Biochemical markers in breast cancer: which ones are clinically useful? | journal = Clinical Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 347–52 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11522269 | doi = 10.1016/s0009-9120(00)00201-0}}</ref> to identify people at high risk of developing breast cancer, [[HER-2]],{{mcn|date=May 2018}} and [[Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1|SCD1]], for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and [[urokinase plasminogen activator]], PA1-1 and [[Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1|SCD1]] for assessing prognosis.{{mcn|date=May 2018}}
