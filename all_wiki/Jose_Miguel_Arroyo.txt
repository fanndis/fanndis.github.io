'''José Miguel Arroyo y Tuason''' (born June 27, 1945), also known as '''Mike Arroyo''', is a former [[First Gentleman]] of the [[Philippines]]. A lawyer by profession, he is the husband of former president and house speaker [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]. He is the first and only male spouse of a [[President of the Philippines]] and [[Vice President of the Philippines]].

==Family==
[[File:Agoncillojf3062 12.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Arroyo's ancestors, Jesusa Araneta-Lacson and María Teresa Arroyo, in the graveyard adjoining Santuario de Santo Cristo, [[San Juan, Metro Manila]]]]
Arroyo's great-great-grandparents were Ignacio Arroyo and Doña María Pidal, who had three children: [[Maria Beatriz del Rosario Arroyo]] (a candidate for [[saint]]hood in the Catholic Church); [[José María Arroyo]]; and Mariano Arroyo. José María became a [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] in 1919, whilst Mariano was elected governor of the western province of [[Iloilo]] in 1928. Senator José María Arroyo and his wife, Jesusa [[Araneta family|Araneta]]-Lacson of [[Negros Occidental]], produced seven children, one of whom was Ignacio Lacson Arroyo.

Ignacio subsequently married Lourdes Zaragoza Tuason and had two sons, José Miguel and his brother, [[Iggy Arroyo|Ignacio Arroyo, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101702/Mike-Arroyos-kin-may-become-a-saint---report |title=GMA NEWS.TV, Mike Arroyo's kin may become a saint – report |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}</ref>

José Miguel wed María Gloria Macaraeg Macapagal in 1968, and the couple has three children: [[Mikey Arroyo|Juan Miguel]] ("Mikey"); Evangelina Lourdes ("Luli"); and [[Diosdado Macapagal Arroyo|Diosdado]] ("Dato"). Luli married former investment banker and director of the [[Ayala Foundation]], J. Aloysius "Luigi" Bernas on November 5, 2008 in [[Tagaytay#Tagaytay Highlands|Tagaytay Highlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/05/08/luli-arroyo-marries-luigi-bernas-tagaytay-abs-cbn-news |title=www.abs-cbnnews.com, Luli Arroyo marries Luigi Bernas in Tagaytay |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}</ref>

==Public life==
Arroyo's major project whilst occupying the role of the First Gentleman was the sourcing of funds for the training of Filipino athletes in preparation for the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], for which the Philippines was the host nation. Beyond that, not much else is known.

===Health===
The former First Gentleman's fragile health has been a public affair since April 9, 2007, when he underwent open heart surgery after being diagnosed with an [[aortic aneurysm]]. The procedure lasted for ten hours but was considered successful, and 22 days after the operation, Arroyo had almost completely recovered and was discharged from hospital. However, Arroyo's health since 2007 has been described as "questionable", with serious abdominal pains resulting in an emergency landing in 2008, and another heart-related hospital visit in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Arroyo rushed to hospital|url=http://globalbalita.com/mike-arroyo-rushed-to-hospital/|work=globalbalita.com|publisher=Global Balita|accessdate=28 March 2012|author=Angelo S.
