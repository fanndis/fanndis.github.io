=== 2002–2007: Mixed critical work and hiatus ===
In 2004, it was observed that since the Oscar for ''Shakespeare in Love'', Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3621488/Curse-of-the-Best-Actress-Oscar.html|title=Curse of the Best Actress Oscar|last=Gritten|first=David|date=July 30, 2004|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad movie choices,<ref>{{cite news |last=Zeidler |first=Sue |title=Is winning an Oscar a curse or a blessing? |url=http://www.film.com/news/story/entertainmentoscarscursedc/13303376 |publisher=Film.com |date=January 30, 2007}}</ref> agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse.<ref>{{cite news |last=Soden |first=Blair |title=Is Winning An Oscar a Blessing or a Curse? |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Oscars2007/Story?id=2902805&page=1 |publisher=ABC News |date=February 25, 2007}}</ref> During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children.<ref name="EW" /> In ''[[The Guardian]]'', she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: ''The Royal Tenenbaums'', ''[[Proof (2005 film)|Proof]]'', and ''[[Sylvia (2003 film)|Sylvia]]'' fell into the former category, while she signed on to ''[[View from the Top]]'' and ''Shallow Hal'' for the latter.<ref name="heart" />

In 2002, Paltrow made small appearances in the documentary ''[[Searching for Debra Winger]]'' and the action satire comedy ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', while she starred in the thriller-drama ''[[Possession (2002 film)|Possession]]'' with [[Aaron Eckhart]] as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection.

In 2004, she starred with her ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' co-star Jude Law and [[Angelina Jolie]] in the science-fiction film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]''. Her role in the film was Polly Perkins, a reporter for the fictional ''New York Chronicle''. Law became one of the producers of the film and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember "any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board."<ref name=SkyCaptain /> She said in an interview, "I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie."<ref name=SkyCaptain>{{cite news |last=Douglas |first=Edward |title=The Making of ''Sky Captain'' – Part 3! |work=ComingSoon.net |date=September 14, 2004 |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6284 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605022651/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6384 |archive-date=June 5, 2008}}</ref> While critical response was positive, with a budget of US$70 million, ''Sky Captain'' only grossed US$58 million at the international box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=skycaptain.htm|title=Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) – Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> Also in 2004, she was recognized as an outstanding woman in entertainment by [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards|Women in Film Los Angeles]] with the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#Crystal Award|Crystal Award]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|author-link=Stephen M.

In the drama ''[[Proof (2005 film)|Proof]]'' (2005), she starred as the depressed daughter of a brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by [[Anthony Hopkins]]). The film was based on the [[Proof (play)|play of the same name]], in which Paltrow also played the same character at London's [[Donmar Warehouse]] between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, ''Eye for Film'' remarked: "As she has already shown in ''Sylvia'', ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and even ''Sliding Doors'', Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women who are coming apart at the seams and her [character] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/proof-film-review-by-anton-bitel|title=Proof (2005) Movie Review from Eye for Film|website=www.eyeforfilm.co.uk}}</ref> For her performance, Paltrow earned her second Golden Globe Award nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama]].

=== 2008–2013: ''Iron Man'' and return to prominence ===
Paltrow saw a resurgence in her career in 2008, when she was cast in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' as [[Pepper Potts]], [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s personal assistant, closest friend, and budding love interest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Willow|title=Gwyneth Paltrow Joins Iron Man|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/gwyneth-paltrow-joins-iron-man/|website=Empire|accessdate=2 October 2019|date=17 January 2007}}</ref> First hesitant to appear in a big-budget project, Paltrow asked [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, who she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked "the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant." Director [[Jon Favreau]] wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s [[screwball comedy]], something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an "innocent yet sexy" way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/96461-gwyneth-paltrow-plays-pepper-potts|title=Gwyneth Paltrow Plays Pepper Potts – SuperHeroHype|date=April 30, 2008}}</ref> ''Iron Man'' was favorably received by critics, and with a worldwide gross of US$585 million, it became Paltrow's highest-grossing film until ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ironman.htm |title=Iron Man (2008) |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> She reprised her role in the sequels ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013).
