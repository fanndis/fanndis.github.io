===National Board of Ophthalmology===
In 1995, Paul passed the [[American Board of Ophthalmology]] (ABO) boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abop.org/verify-a-physician/?fn=rand&ln=paul#physician-list-search-results|title=Verify a Physician|website=abop.org}}</ref> Prior to this, in 1992, the ABO had changed its certification program, which had previously awarded lifetime certifications, instead of requiring doctors to recertify every 10 years. Those who had already been given lifetime certification were allowed to keep it (according to the ABO, they would not legally have been able to rescind these certifications). Shortly after this change, Paul began a campaign to protest it. This effort culminated in 1997 with him creating, "along with 200 other young ophthalmologists", the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO) to offer an alternative certification system, at a cost substantially lower than that of the ABO.<ref name="WaPoNBO">{{cite news |first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |title=How Rand Paul tried to lead an eye doctors' rebellion |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-rand-paul-tried-to-lead-an-eye-doctors-rebellion/2015/02/01/010994da-9cd6-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 1, 2015 |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Weigel |first=David |title=Rand Paul: I passed my ophthalmology certification, but took a stand against the way the board operates |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 14, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/rand_paul_i_passed_my_opthamal.html |access-date=March 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Montopoli |first=Brian |title=Rand Paul's Addresses Ophthalmology Certification Questions |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20007639-503544.html |work=CBS News |access-date=October 18, 2013 |date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> Its certification exam, an open book take-home test, was described by one taker as "probably harder" and "more clinically relevant" than the ABO's exam.<ref name="WaPoNBO"/>

In a segment on [[Fox News]], which went viral, comedian [[Jon Stewart]] and 9/11 first responder [[John Feal]] rebuked Paul, accusing him of hypocritical "fiscal responsibility [[virtue signalling]]", for delaying passage of the bill, while at the same time he voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which increased the deficit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/07/18/jon-stewart-rand-paul-mike-lee-victims-fund-delay/ |title=Jon Stewart accuses Rand Paul of 'fiscal responsibility virtue signaling' in stalling 9/11 victims funding |first=Allyson |last=Chiu |date=July 18, 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> In response, Paul said he has always insisted on "[[PAYGO|pay-go provisions]]" for any increase in spending, including for disaster relief funding, and called Stewart uninformed and a part of a "left-wing mob".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wise |first1=Justin |title=Rand Paul accuses Jon Stewart of being 'part of left-wing mob' after criticism over 9/11 victim fund |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/453823-rand-paul-accuses-jon-stewart-of-being-part-of-left-wing-mob-after-criticism |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=July 21, 2019 |date=July 18, 2019}}</ref>

In February 2020, Paul criticized [[YouTube]] for removing a video of his floor speech about the [[impeachment trial of Donald Trump]].

In September 2020, Paul was the lone Republican to vote against the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19]] aid package introduced by Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], joining the Democrats who unanimously voted against it.

[[File:Rand Paul (22525600570).jpg|thumb|Paul speaking at a campaign rally, October 2015]]

Paul was considered a potential candidate for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican nomination]] for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] since at least January 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/rand-paul-gop-must-evolve-and-adapt-86473.html |title=Rand Paul: GOP must 'evolve and adapt{{'-}} |first=Mackenzie |last=Weinger |work=Politico |date=January 28, 2013 |access-date=August 20, 2013}}</ref> He delivered the Tea Party response to [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama's]] [[2013 State of the Union Address|State of the Union address]] on February 13, 2013,<ref name="rebuttal">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/tea-party-rebuttal-text-of-rand-paul-response-87557.html |title=Tea party State of the Union 2013 rebuttal: Rand Paul response (full text) |work=Politico |date=February 13, 2013 |access-date=August 20, 2013}}</ref> while [[Marco Rubio]] gave the official Republican response.

Paul went on to win the straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/28/rand-paul-wins-2015-cpac-straw-poll |title=Rand Paul wins 2015 CPAC straw poll |website=[[Fox News]] |access-date=March 1, 2015 |date=February 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rand Paul wins CPAC straw poll, with Scott Walker a close second |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 28, 2015 |last=Cha |first=Ariana |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/28/rand-paul-wins-cpac-straw-poll-narrowly-topping-walker |access-date=March 2, 2015 |quote=A candidate's popularity with the Conservative Political Action Conference hasn't necessarily been a great predictor of his or her success with the larger GOP electorate, as attendees tend to have a stronger libertarian bent than the Republican majority.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Senator Rand Paul wins straw poll in boost to 2016 presidential prospects |website=Reuters |date=February 28, 2015 |last=Holland |first=Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/01/us-randpaul-idUSKBN0LW0YY20150301 |access-date=March 2, 2015 |quote=Whether the victory for Paul will have long-lasting benefit is unclear since his libertarian views may not have broad appeal in the Republican Party.}}</ref>

In a speech at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" and that the conservative movement has never been about rich people or privilege, "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Obamacare' under attack as conservatives eye 2016 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/obamacare-under-attack-conservatives-eye-2016-200658669--election.html |agency=Associated Press |website=Yahoo!

During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled "Hillary's Losers" which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from [[Hillary Clinton]]. Clinton was [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|also a candidate for President]] and eventually won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party's nomination]], going on to lose to [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|general election]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/7/rand-paul-clinton-democrats-became-hillarys-losers |title=Rand Paul: 'Clinton Democrats' became 'Hillary's losers' during election landslide |newspaper=Washington Times |access-date=February 4, 2015 |date=November 7, 2014 |last=Sherfinski |first=David}}</ref>

===Government surveillance===

Paul has not definitively accepted [[scientific opinion on climate change|the scientific consensus on climate change]], which states that global warming is real, progressing, and primarily caused by humans. Paul has said pollution emissions are subject to "onerous regulation."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/05/12/where-the-2016-gop-contenders-stand-on-climate-change/ |title=Where the 2016 GOP contenders stand on climate change |last=Waldman |first=Paul |date=May 12, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |author-link=Paul Waldman |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820082811/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/05/12/where-the-2016-gop-contenders-stand-on-climate-change/ |archive-date=August 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/204235-paul-science-behind-climate-change-not-conclusive |title=Rand Paul: Science behind climate change 'not conclusive' |last=Barron-Lopez |first=Laura |date=April 23, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200821101302/http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/204235-paul-science-behind-climate-change-not-conclusive |archive-date=August 21, 2020}}</ref> In 2018, Paul called for an investigation of a [[National Science Foundation]] grant that went towards educating meteorologists about the science of climate change.

===Disease control===
On February 2, 2015, Paul told Fox TV host [[Laura Ingraham]] regarding vaccinations, that "most should be voluntary." His remarks generated controversy by suggesting that states should not require parents to [[Vaccination policy in the United States|vaccinate their children]], because parents should have the freedom to make that decision for their children. Later that day, in an interview with [[CNBC]], Paul clarified this statement, commenting "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Michelle |title=Vaccines should be voluntary: Rand Paul |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/02/vaccines-should-be-voluntary-rand-paul.html |access-date=July 22, 2015 |website=[[CNBC]] |date=February 2, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808224432/https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/02/vaccines-should-be-voluntary-rand-paul.html |archive-date=August 8, 2020}}</ref> Afterward, he added about vaccines, "I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."<ref>[https://grist.org/politics/its-not-just-climate-change-some-gop-leaders-are-disregarding-the-science-on-vaccines-too/ It's not just climate change: Some GOP leaders disregard science on vaccines too], ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'', Ben Adler, February 5, 2015.

In 2014, Paul argued that the Obama administration and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) were downplaying the threat posed by [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|Ebola virus in the United States]].  Ultimately, nine people infected with [[Zaire ebolavirus|Ebola]] returned in the United States, two nurses contracted the disease within the US, and two of the returning travelers died.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rand Paul stokes Ebola fears |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/rand-paul-ebola-111547.html |last=Topaz |first=Jonathan |website=[[Politico]] |language=en |access-date=May 12, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200527115633/https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/rand-paul-ebola-111547 |archive-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref> 

In early May 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], Paul said that stay-at-home orders to halt the spread of the disease amounted to "[[dictatorship]]" by Kentucky's Democratic Governor [[Andy Beshear]].<ref>{{cite news |date=May 7, 2020 |title=Rand Paul says Kentucky living under 'dictatorship of Beshear.'

=== 2020 RNC attendance ===
In August 2020, immediately following his attendance at the keynote speech delivered by President [[Donald Trump]] for the [[2020 Republican National Convention]] held at the [[White House]], Paul was confronted by protestors on his way to a hotel with his wife. A police perimeter was formed that escorted the Pauls away from the crowd, with one of the escorting officers being pushed in the process. The protestors' main contention point with Paul was the [[shooting of Breonna Taylor]] and their demands for Paul to "say her name". However, as was pointed out by several media organizations in the aftermath of the incident, Paul had previously authored a bill named after Taylor aiming to illegalize use of [[no-knock warrant|no-knock warrants]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/08/28/rnc-2020-rand-paul-says-angry-mob-protesters-attacked-him/5653957002/|title=Sen.
