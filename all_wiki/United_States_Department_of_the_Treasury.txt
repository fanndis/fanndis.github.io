== History ==
=== Revolutionary period ===
The history of the Department of the Treasury began in the turmoil of the [[American Revolution]], when the [[Continental Congress]] at [[Philadelphia]] deliberated the crucial issue of financing a war of independence against [[Great Britain]]. The Congress had no power to [[tax levies|levy]] and [[tax collector|collect]] taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from foreign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money in the form of [[bills of credit]], promising [[fiat money|redemption]] in [[coin]] on faith in the revolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775—only a few days after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]—Congress issued $2&nbsp;million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were employed by Congress to sign and number the currency.

On July 29, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] assigned the responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary government's finances to joint Continental treasurers [[George Clymer]] and [[Michael Hillegas]]. Congress stipulated that each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To ensure proper and efficient handling of the growing [[national debt]] in the face of weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on February 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the treasury, [[settlement (finance)|settle accounts]], and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a [[Treasury Office of Accounts]], consisting of an auditor general and [[clerk]]s, was established to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public accounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, the newborn republic as a [[sovereign nation]] was able to secure loans from abroad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Banks and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War|last=Hammond|first=Bray|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref>

Despite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans, the united colonies were unable to establish a well-organized agency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called Treasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was reorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5&nbsp;million in paper Continental bills [[devaluation|devalued]] rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar [[hyperinflation|collapsed]] at a rate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against [[hard currency]]. Protests against the worthless money swept the colonies, giving rise to the expression "[[early American currency#Continental currency|not worth a Continental]]". The office has, since the late 18th century, been [[British English|customarily referred]] to as the singular “Treasury”, without any [[Article (grammar)|preceding article]], as a remnant of the country's transition from [[British English|British]] to [[American English]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3NUAAAAYAAJ|title=Reports of the secretary of the Treasury of the United States: prepared in obedience to the act of May 10, 1800|date=1851|publisher=Printed by Blair & Rives|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dewey|first=Davis Rich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSopAAAAYAAJ&q=history+of+the+united+states+treasury|title=Financial History of the United States|date=1922|publisher=Longmans, Green and Company|language=en}}</ref> For example, the department notes its guiding purpose as "Treasury's mission" instead of "the Treasury's mission."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/role-of-the-treasury|title=Role of the Treasury {{!}} U.S. Department of the Treasury|website=home.treasury.gov|access-date=2020-04-27|quote=Treasury's mission highlights its role as the steward of U.S. economic and financial systems, and as an influential participant in the world economy.}}</ref>

[[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored stability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial [[merchant]], was nicknamed "the financier" because of his reputation for procuring funds or goods on a moment's notice. His staff included a [[comptroller]], a [[treasurer]], a [[Register of the Treasury|register]], and [[auditor]]s, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when Morris resigned because of ill health. The treasury board, consisting of three commissioners, continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former colonies until September 1789.

===Creation of the Treasury===
[[Image:Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury (1789-1968).png|thumb|Original seal, dating from before 1968]]
The First Congress of the United States was called to convene in New York on March 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the Constitution. On September 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management of government finances:<blockquote>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an [[United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury]], which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|title=Chapter 12, 1 Statue. 65|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019033202/http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>[[Alexander Hamilton]] took the oath of office as the first [[Secretary of the Treasury|secretary of the treasury]] on September 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as George Washington's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' during the Revolution and was of great importance in the [[United States Constitution#1788 ratification|ratification]] of the Constitution. Because of his [[business acumen|financial and managerial acumen]], Hamilton was a logical choice for solving the problem of the new nation's heavy [[war debt]]. Hamilton's first official act was to submit a report to Congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation's financial health.

To the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon [[Debt Assumption|federal assumption]] and dollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's $75&nbsp;million debt in order to revitalize the [[public credit]]: "[T]he debt of the United States was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation."<ref name="syrett1962vol6">{{cite book|last1=Syrett|first1=Harold C. (ed.)|title=The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, vol. 6|date=1962|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231089050|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/america7/content/multimedia/ch08/documents_02.htm|accessdate=6 May 2018|ref=syrett1962vol6}}</ref> Hamilton foresaw the development of industry and trade in the United States, suggesting that government revenues be based upon [[customs duties]].<ref name="syrett1962vol6" /> His sound [[fiscal policy|financial policies]] also inspired investment in the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], which acted as the government's [[fiscal agent]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The treasury believes their seal was created by [[Francis Hopkinson#Great Seal of the United States|Francis Hopkinson]], the treasurer of loans. He submitted bills to Congress in 1780 that authorized the design of department seals, including the seal for the Board of Treasury. While it is it not certain that Hopkinson designed the seal, it is very similar to others he's done.<ref>Friedberg, A.L. (2017). Paper money of the US 21st Edition. Coin & Currency Institute. Pg. 6-7. {{ISBN|9780871840219}}</ref>

===2003 reorganization===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Treasury departement.jpg|thumb|[[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]]]]

Congress transferred several agencies that had previously been under the aegis of the Treasury Department to other departments as a consequence of the [[September 11 attacks]].  Effective January 24, 2003, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF), which had been a bureau of the Department since 1972, was extensively reorganized under the provisions of the [[Homeland Security Act|Homeland Security Act of 2002]]. The [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] functions of ATF, including the regulation of legitimate traffic in [[firearms]] and [[explosives]], were transferred to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE). The regulatory and tax collection functions of ATF related to legitimate traffic in alcohol and tobacco remained with the treasury at its new [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB).

Effective March 1, 2003, the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], the [[United States Customs Service]], and the [[United States Secret Service]] were transferred to the newly created [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security ("DHS")]].
