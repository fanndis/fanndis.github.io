In 1950, Teresa founded the [[Missionaries of Charity]], a [[Latin Church|Roman Catholic]] [[religious congregation]] that had over 4,500 [[nun]]s and was active in 133 countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. It also runs [[soup kitchen]]s, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as [[orphanage]]s and schools. Members take vows of [[chastity, poverty, and obedience]], and also profess a fourth vow – to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."<ref>Muggeridge (1971), chapter 3, "Mother Teresa Speaks", pp. 105, 113</ref>

Teresa received a number of honors, including the 1962 [[List of Ramon Magsaysay Award winners|Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize]] and 1979 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. She was [[Canonization|canonised]] on 4 September 2016, and the anniversary of her death (5 September) is her [[feast day]]. A controversial figure [[Criticism of Mother Teresa|during her life and after her death]], Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. She was praised and criticized on various counts, such as for her views on abortion and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorized biography was written by [[Navin Chawla]] and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of [[#Film and literature|films and other books]]. On 6 September 2017, Teresa and [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]] were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.

According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Teresa was in her early years when she was fascinated by stories of the lives of [[missionaries]] and their service in [[Bengal]]; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.<ref>Clucas, Joan Graff.

Teresa left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the [[Sisters of Loreto]] at [[Loreto Abbey]] in [[Rathfarnham]], Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.<ref>Clucas, Joan Graff.

During this visit to Darjeeling by train, she heard the call of her inner conscious. She felt that she should serve the poor by staying with them. She left the school. In 1950 she founded [[Missionaries_of_Charity|‘Missionaries of Charity']]. She went out to serve humanity with two saris with a blue border. <ref>https://sarkarinaukri.ws/short-note-on-mother-teresa-paragraph-essay-image/</ref>

On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she traveled by train to the [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto convent]] in Darjeeling from [[Calcutta]] for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."<ref>Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York.

She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,<ref name="IANS2016"/> replacing her traditional Loreto [[Religious habit|habit]] with a simple, white cotton [[sari]] with a blue border.

Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.<ref>Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-02-864278-3}}.</ref> Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months:

{{quote|Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only to say the word and all that will be yours again", the Tempter kept on saying.&nbsp;... Of free choice, my God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear come.<ref>Spink, Kathryn (1997).

On 7 October 1950, Teresa received [[Holy See|Vatican]] permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity.<ref>Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 62. {{ISBN|0-02-864278-3}}.</ref> In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".<ref>{{cite web|title=washingtonpost.com: Highlights of Mother Teresa's Life|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/teresa/stories/words.htm|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>

In 1952, Teresa opened her first [[hospice]] with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple into the [[Kalighat Home for the Dying]], free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).<ref>Sebba, Anne (1997).''Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image''.

The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and [[Leper colony|leper houses]] throughout India. Teresa then expanded the congregation abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters.<ref>Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York.

The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a [[Enclosed religious orders|contemplative branch]] of the Sisters followed in 1976.

When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Teresa expanded her efforts to Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work."

===Declining health and death===
Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting [[Pope John Paul II]]. Following a second attack in 1989, she received an [[artificial pacemaker]]. In 1991, after a bout of [[pneumonia]] in Mexico, she had additional heart problems. Although Teresa offered to resign as head of the Missionaries of Charity, in a [[secret ballot]] the sisters of the congregation voted for her to stay and she agreed to continue.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Blessed Mother Teresa|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobelprize/article-9071751|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

In April 1996 she fell, breaking her [[collarbone]], and four months later she had [[malaria]] and [[Left heart failure|heart failure]]. Although Teresa had [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]], her health was clearly declining. According to Archbishop of Calcutta [[Henry Sebastian D'Souza]], he ordered a priest to perform an [[exorcism]] (with her permission) when she was first hospitalized with cardiac problems because he thought she might be under attack by the devil.<ref>Bindra, Satinder (7 September 2001).

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special {{INR}}5 coin (the amount of money Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010.

Indian views of Teresa are not uniformly favorable.

[[Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya]], mayor of Kolkata from 2005 to 2010, said that "she had no significant impact on the poor of this city", glorified illness instead of treating it and misrepresented the city: "No doubt there was poverty in Calcutta, but it was never a city of lepers and beggars, as Mother Teresa presented it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-mother-teresa-snap-story.html|title=Was Mother Teresa a saint?

In February 2015 [[Mohan Bhagwat]], leader of the Hindu right-wing organization [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]], said that Teresa's objective was "to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mother-teresas-aim-was-conversion-says-bhagwat/article6926462.ece|title=Mother Teresa's aim was conversion, says Bhagwat|last=Dhar|first=Aarti|work=The Hindu|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> Former RSS spokesperson M.

When Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered, "Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her [[Nobel lecture]], she said: "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society – that poverty is so hurtable {{sic}} and so much, and I find that very difficult." Teresa singled out abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today.

Teresa may have experienced something similar to [[Jesus]], who said when he was crucified: ''"[[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|Eli Eli lama sabachthani?]]"'' ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drbo.org/chapter/47027.htm|title=Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, Gospel According to Saint Matthew Chapter 27}}</ref> Other saints (including Teresa's namesake [[Thérèse of Lisieux]], who called it a "night of nothingness") had similar experiences of [[spiritual dryness]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/223/story_22353_1.html New Book Reveals Mother Teresa's Struggle with Faith] Beliefnet, AP 2007</ref> According to James Langford, these doubts were typical and would not be an impediment to canonisation.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

After ten years of doubt, Teresa described a brief period of renewed faith.

In ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (his first [[encyclical]]), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] mentioned Teresa three times and used her life to clarify one of the encyclical's main points: "In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact that time devoted to God in prayer not only does not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but is in fact the inexhaustible source of that service."<ref>[[Pope Benedict XVI]] (25 December 2005).

Although he said, "We didn't have to prove that she was perfect or never made a mistake&nbsp;...", he had to prove that Teresa's virtue was heroic.
