'''''PinkNews''''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[online newspaper]] marketed to the [[LGBT community|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community]] ([[LGBT]]) in the UK and worldwide. It was founded by [[Benjamin Cohen (journalist)|Benjamin Cohen]] in 2005.<ref name="Press Gazette 1">{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Oliver|title=Pink News five years on: 'revenue could rise ten-fold'|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45764|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910091729/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45764|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 September 2012|publisher=Press Gazette|accessdate=21 December 2011|date=28 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/about-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> The UK editor as of March 2015 is Nick Duffy.<ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews about|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/contact-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>

It closely follows political progress on LGBT rights around the world, and carries interviews with cultural figures, politicians, and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]]. The news is split into different sections, with most recent, prominent and trending stories showing on the home page by default. People can filter news by the sections they have most interest in, including: ''transgender'', ''entertainment'', ''world'', ''politics'', ''arts'', and ''opinion''.

A paper version, ''The PinkNews'' was officially launched in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shoffman|first=Marc|title=The Pink News launches new gay era|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/06/29/the-pink-news-launches-new-gay-era/|newspaper=Pink News|date=29 June 2006}}</ref> However, ''PinkNews'' became an online-only publication when the print edition was dropped in 2007. The website continues to exist and is updated with news daily. 

''PinkNews'' pays special attention to the topic of [[religion and homosexuality]]. It became one of the few LGBT publications to have interviewed a sitting [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 2014, when [[Justin Welby]] discussed the [[Church of England]]'s approach to homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/05/13/exclusive-archbishop-of-canterbury-its-great-that-equal-marriage-is-the-law-of-the-land/ |publisher=PinkNews |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |title=Archbishop of Canterbury: It’s ‘great’ that equal marriage is the law of the land}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also runs the PinkNews Awards, which launched in 2013 and take place in Westminster annually. The PinkNews Awards, which are voted on by the public alongside a panel of judges,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/09/26/the-nominees-for-the-fifth-annual-pinknews-awards/|title=The nominees for the fifth annual PinkNews Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> honour the work of LGBT activists in the field as well as political speakers and businesses.

==Editorial policy and interviews with politicians==
The editorial stance of ''PinkNews'' is not to campaign in a partisan manner, though they do interview politicians and have a pro-LGBT stance. ''PinkNews'' does not endorse political parties in elections, but in previous elections has endorsed individual politicians regardless of party "based on their stance on gay rights issues."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/editorial-policy/|title=Pink News editorial policy|publisher=Pink News|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>

To date ''PinkNews'' has published articles by six British Prime Ministers: [[John Major]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/26/sir-john-major-we-should-remember-those-who-have-fought-for-a-more-accepting-britain/|title=Sir John Major: We should remember those who have fought for a more accepting Britain|work=PinkNews|access-date=11 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> [[Tony Blair]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=We are living in a new age of equality|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2005/12/21/tony-blair-heralds-a-new-age-of-gay-equality/|newspaper=PinkNews|date=5 December 2005}}</ref> [[Gordon Brown]],<ref name="Press Gazette 1" /> [[David Cameron]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Cameron|first=David|title=Why It's vital to kick homophobia out of sport|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/06/23/comment-why-its-vital-to-kick-homophobia-out-of-sport-by-david-cameron/|newspaper=Pink News|date=23 June 2011}}</ref>,[[Theresa May]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/19/exclusive-theresa-may-writes-in-pinknews-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-sexual-offences-act/|title=Theresa May writes for PinkNews on the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act|work=PinkNews|access-date=11 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> and[[Boris Johnson]].

==News International legal threat==
In 2006, ''PinkNews'' was threatened with legal action by [[News International]], the parent company of the British newspapers ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[News of the World]]''. Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a "gay orgy" with one using the headline "Gay as You Go". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and "false privacy" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than "[[Outing|out]]" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].
Cole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Months later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of £100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: "Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages." News International confirmed afterwards they would not be seeking damages from ''PinkNews''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=James |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/09/how-the-news-of-the-world-threatened-pinknews-after-ashley-cole-expose/ |title=How the News of the World threatened PinkNews after Ashley Cole expose |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |title=News of the World could sue website over Cole "gay orgy" story |publisher=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117052616/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/gay-news-site-threatened-if-ashley-cole-suit-succeeds/s2/a51765/ |title=Gay news site threatened if Ashley Cole suit succeeds &#124; Media news |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

==Relationship with Stonewall==
''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name="What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested "it would cost a staggering £5 billion to implement", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that "there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name="What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name="What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

Summerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an "unethical campaign” against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating "Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014. A year later, under Chief Executive [[Ruth Hunt]], Stonewall decided to begin campaigning on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/02/16/stonewall-announces-it-will-now-campaign-for-trans-rights-too/|title=Stonewall announces it will now campaign for trans rights too|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref>
