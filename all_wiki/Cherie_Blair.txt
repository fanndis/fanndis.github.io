'''Cherie Blair''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|QC}} ({{nee|'''Booth'''}}; born 23 September 1954) also known professionally as '''Cherie Booth''', is a British [[barrister]], [[lecturer]], and writer. She is married to [[Tony Blair]], who was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1997 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Booth was born in 23 September 1954 at [[Fairfield General Hospital]], [[Bury, Lancashire]], England,<ref>Blair, Cherie (2008), p. 9.</ref> and brought up in Ferndale Road, [[Waterloo, Sefton|Waterloo]], Merseyside, just north of [[Liverpool]]. Although her birth was registered as 'Cherie', owing to her maternal grandmother's influence, she was christened 'Theresa Cara' in deference to the requirement that she be given a saint's name.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speaking for Myself: My Life from Liverpool to Downing Street|last=Blair|first=Cherie|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2008}}</ref> Her father, British actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]], left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith; 14 February 1933 – 5 June 2016), <!-- Mother's real name also per memoir --> when Cherie was 8 years old. Cherie and her younger sister Lyndsey were then brought up by Gale and their paternal grandmother Vera Booth, a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] of Irish descent.

Blair has appeared in a number of leading cases. A notable example before the [[European Court of Justice]] was concerned with discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&num=80019782C19960249&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET&where= |title=CURIA – Search form |publisher=Curia.europa.eu |access-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323122357/http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en |archive-date=23 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cherie Booth in plea for gay rights|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cherie-booth-in-plea-for-gay-rights-1249821.html|access-date=29 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=10 July 1997}}</ref>

In January 2010, when sentencing a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Booth announced that she would [[Suspended sentence|suspend his prison sentence]] after describing him as a "religious man". The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man's jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: "You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour." This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given on account of the criminal's religiosity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8497365.stm|title=Complaint after Cherie Booth spares religious man jail|work=BBC News|date=4 February 2010|access-date=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/secular-society-upset-by-judge-cherie-decision-1889792.html|title=Secular society upset by Judge Cherie decision|work=The Independent|date=4 February 2010|access-date=19 October 2013|location=London, UK|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214210142/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/secular-society-upset-by-judge-cherie-decision-1889792.html|archive-date=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Office for Judicial Complaints]] released an initial statement saying they had "received a number of complaints in relation to the comments" that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0210.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015125209/http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0210.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=15 October 2010|title=Statement from the office of judicial complaints|publisher=OJC|date=10 February 2010|access-date=12 February 2010}}</ref> On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had "found that Recorder Booth's observations did not constitute judicial misconduct" and accordingly "no disciplinary action is necessary".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_1010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015125110/http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_1010.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=15 October 2010|title=Investigation Statement – Recorder Cherie Booth QC|publisher=Office for Judicial Complaints|date=10 June 2010|access-date=19 October 2013}}</ref> A private letter to the [[National Secular Society]] said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of "informal advice" from a more senior judge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10358121.stm|title=Cover-up claim over Cherie Blair court remark to Muslim|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2010|access-date=19 October 2013}}</ref>

In [[George W.

==Writings, portrayals, and coverage in books, film and theatre==
Blair co-authored, with Cate Haste, the 2004 book ''The Goldfish Bowl: Married to the Prime Minister''. The book is a compilation history of the lives of spouses of British Prime Ministers for most of the second half of the 20th century. It covers the spouses of former prime ministers [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[John Major]].

Blair wrote a book of her memoirs, published in late May 2008, entitled ''Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography'',<ref name=CB2008-book>Blair, Cherie (2008). Book cover.</ref> and the book was listed as a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' best-seller. Interviewed about the book by [[Carole MacNeil]] on the Canadian network [[CBC Television]] on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British Prime Minister who had her own career, with the media simply not knowing how to treat her fairly and objectively.<ref>''[[CBC Television]]'', 1 June 2008; interview by [[Carole MacNeil]].</ref>

Played by [[Helen McCrory]], Blair features as a character in ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' (2006), starring [[Helen Mirren]], about the aftermath of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997, and is portrayed as a fierce anti-monarchist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-queen-2006|title=The Queen Movie Review & Film Summary (2006) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=15 December 2017|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725004546/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-queen-2006|archive-date=25 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> McCrory played her again in the 2010 [[HBO]] film ''[[The Special Relationship (film)|The Special Relationship]]''.
