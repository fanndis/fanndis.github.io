He was a great-grandson of [[Benjamin H. Brewster|Benjamin Harris Brewster]] (1816–1888), an attorney and politician from New Jersey who served as [[United States Attorney General]] from 1881 to 1885 and was himself a descendent of [[Mayflower]] passenger [[William Brewster (Mayflower passenger)|William Brewster]].

He was also a great-great-great-grandson of [[Sarah Franklin Bache]] and [[Richard Bache]] and a great-great-great-great-grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States of America]]. He is also related to [[George M. Dallas|George Mifflin Dallas]] (July 10, 1792 – December 31, 1864), a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania and the 11th [[Vice President of the United States]], serving under [[James K. Polk]].

===Education===
He was educated at the [[Gilman School]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. He attended college at [[Princeton University]], and [[Johns Hopkins University]] before the U.S. entry into [[World War II]].

After the war, he completed his undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins,<ref name=ArchiveUM/> then enrolled in the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland Law School]]. He was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|Bar]] in 1949, commencing law practice in [[Towson, Maryland]], soon after.

===Personal===
Brewster had two sons, Daniel Baugh Brewster, Jr. (1956) and Gerry Leiper Brewster (1958) from his first marriage to Carol Leiper DeHavenon of Philadelphia.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/09/AR2010020903808.html Obituary: "Carol L.

On April 29, 1967, Brewster married [[Anne Moen Bullitt|Anne Moen Bullitt Biddle]] (1924–2007) at [[Glyndon, Maryland]]. She<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E4DE113AF931A3575AC0A9619C8B63&scp=1&sq=Anne%20Moen%20Bullitt%20Biddle&st=cse Obituary: "Anne Moen Bullitt Biddle"] ''New York Times.''

==Political career==

===Maryland state politics===
Brewster, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]],<ref name=ArchiveUM/> was elected as to the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] in 1950 and he served until 1958.

===National politics===
In 1958, he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from the 2nd district of Maryland, defeating the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, [[J. Fife Symington, Jr.]] He was a member of the House during the Eighty-sixth (1959–1961) and Eighty-seventh Congresses (1961–1963)—serving on the [[House Armed Services Committee]] and on the subcommittee on Military Personnel, Manpower Utilization, and Emergency Defense Transportation.<ref name=ArchiveUM/> In the House, Brewster voted for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1960]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/86-1960/h102|title=HR 8601. PASSAGE.}}</ref> 

In 1962, he ran for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the retiring Republican senator [[John Marshall Butler]], and defeated Congressman [[Edward Tylor Miller]] to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Maryland since 1946.<ref name=ArchiveUM/> He served in the Senate from 1963 to 1969. In the Senate, Brewster voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Acts of 1964]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1968/s346|title=TO PASS H.R. 2516, A BILL TO PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION IN SALE OR RENTAL OF HOUSING, AND TO PROHIBIT RACIALLY MOTIVATED INTERFERENCE WITH A PERSON EXERCISING HIS CIVIL RIGHTS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/s409|title=HR. 7152. PASSAGE.}}</ref> as well as the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and the confirmation of [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/s78|title=TO PASS S. 1564, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1967/s176|title=CONFIRMATION OF NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL, THE FIRST NEGRO APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT.|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref> He was defeated in the 1968 election by [[Charles Mathias]].

In 1964, he ran in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1964|Democratic presidential primaries]] against segregationist [[George Wallace]]. As [[Lyndon Johnson]] refused to run nationally, "[[favorite son]]s" were run in his place against Wallace, such as [[Matthew E. Welsh]] of Indiana and [[John W. Reynolds (Wisconsin governor)|John W. Reynolds]] of Wisconsin. Brewster won his state's primary but was embarrassed by Wallace's showing of 43 percent. As is required, Maryland delegates to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] voted for Brewster on the first ballot, then voted for Lyndon Johnson.

===Political positions and voting record===

Brewster focused on issues ranging from the presence of communist troops in Cuba in 1963 to proposed cuts in weekend postal service in 1964. His concern with mail practices continued in 1965 when he criticized the current "mail cover" practice which permitted holding up mail to and from persons under investigation. Stressing the importance of the right of privacy, Brewster urged U.S. Postmaster General [[Larry O'Brien]] to ban the practice except in cases of treason and national security.

In a November 1966 letter to the New York Times, Brewster declared his support for advertising or "junk" mail, which he claimed accounted for $35 billion in sales. Pointing out that 80% of the mail is for business purposes, Brewster expressed concern over possible unemployment in private business and the postal service if "junk mail" is eliminated. In 1967, he voted for a "junk mail" amendment, which would delay price increases and limit 3rd class mail rates to 3.8 cents a piece. Brewster also played a strong supporting role in national Democratic politics.

Brewster was instrumental in the passage of the monumental Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|title=Daniel B. Brewster, 83, Former Senator, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/washington/27brewster.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A10%22%7D|accessdate=10 October 2014|work=New York Times|date=27 August 2007}}</ref>

===Bribery charges===
In 1969, Brewster was [[indictment|indicted]] on 10 [[felony|criminal]] counts of [[Political corruption|solicitation and acceptance of bribes]] while a United States Senator,<ref name=Grossman2003>{{cite book

He contended that he had done nothing wrong.<ref name=BostonGlobe_Lamb_20070822>{{cite news|accessdate=December 19, 2008

At trial, the judge dismissed five of the charges, saying that Brewster's actions were protected under the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. The prosecution appealed directly to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which heard the case in 1971 and 1972. In June 1972, the Court held 6 to 3 in ''[[United States v. Brewster (1972)|United States v. Brewster]]'' that the taking of illegal bribes was not protected speech, as taking of a bribe was not part of the "performance of a legislative function."<ref name=Grossman2003/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sam J., Jr. |last=Ervin |title=The ''Gravel'' and ''Brewster'' Cases: An Assault on Congressional Independence |journal=[[Virginia Law Review]] |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1973 |pages=175–195 |doi=10.2307/1071992 |jstor=1071992 }}</ref>

The charges were reinstated. Brewster stood trial and was found "not guilty" of the bribery charges but was convicted of accepting an unlawful gratuity "without corrupt intent." However, in August 1974,<ref name=Grossman2003/>  his conviction was overturned on appeal due to the trial judge's improper instructions to the jury.<ref name=ArchiveUM/> In 1975, he pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to a single misdemeanor charge of accepting an illegal gratuity "without corrupt intent" and was fined and allowed to keep his law license. The government dropped the other charges.<ref>{{cite news | work = nytimes.com | date = June 26, 1975 | title = exsenator Brewster pleads no contest | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/26/archives/exsenator-brewster-pleads-no-contest-is-fined.html}}</ref><ref>[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/battles-baxmeyer.html]</ref>

===Later years===

He died of liver cancer on August 19, 2007, at age 83.<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=BostonGlobe_Lamb_20070822/>  He is buried at [[St. Thomas Church (Owings Mills, Maryland)|Saint Thomas' Episcopal Church Cemetery, Owings Mills, Maryland]].<ref>[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=b000813 ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]</ref>
