'''Thurgood Marshall''' (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American lawyer and civil rights activist who served as [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's [[List of African-American federal judges|first African-American]] justice. Prior to his judicial service, he successfully argued several cases before the Supreme Court, including ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.

Born in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, Marshall graduated from the [[Howard University School of Law]] in 1933. He established a private legal practice in Baltimore before founding the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], where he served as executive director. In that position, he argued several cases before the Supreme Court, including  ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', and ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the latter of which held that [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in public education is a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]].

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed Marshall to [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. Four years later, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Marshall as the [[United States Solicitor General]]. In 1967, Johnson successfully nominated Marshall to succeed retiring Associate Justice [[Tom C. Clark]] as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. Marshall retired during the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]], and was succeeded by [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=1991-07-02|title=The Supreme Court; Conservative Black Judge, Clarence Thomas, is named to Marshall's Court Seat|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/02/us/supreme-court-conservative-black-judge-clarence-thomas-named-marshall-s-court.html|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-20|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last1=Yang|first1=John E.|last2=LaFraniere|first2=Sharon|date=1991-07-02|title=Bush Picks Thomas For Supreme Court|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/07/02/bush-picks-thomas-for-supreme-court/943b9fda-e079-405e-974e-14c2d0cd999b/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-20|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:PS 103 Old W Balt HD T Marshall.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school]]

Marshall first learned how to debate from his father, who took Marshall and his brother to watch court cases; they would later debate what they had seen. The family also debated current events after dinner. Marshall said that although his father never told him to become a lawyer, he "turned me into one. He did it by teaching me to argue, by challenging my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made."<ref name="Ball">{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Howard |date=1998 |title=A Defiant Life: Thurgood Marshall & the Persistence of Racism in America |publisher=Crown |page=[https://archive.org/details/defiantlifethurg00ball/page/17 17] |isbn=0-517-59931-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/defiantlifethurg00ball/page/17 }}</ref>

Marshall attended [[Frederick Douglass Senior High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Frederick Douglass High School]] in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He attended [[Lincoln University (of Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], a [[historically black university]] in Pennsylvania. It is commonly reported{{who|date=January 2020}} that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.{{cn|date=January 2020}} But according to his application to Lincoln University,<ref name="Gibson">{{cite book|url=http://www.youngthurgood.com|title = Young Thurgood: The Making of a Supreme Court Justice | first1=Larry S. | last1=Gibson| publisher=Prometheus Books | year=2012|isbn=9781616145712|page=84}}</ref> Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet [[Langston Hughes]] and musician [[Cab Calloway]].

In September 1929, Marshall married [[Vivian Burey Marshall|Vivien Buster Burey]] and began to take his studies seriously, graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[American literature]] and [[philosophy]] in 1930.<ref name="Starks">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwWExjnyfoMC&q=Thurgood+Marshall+Alpha+Phi&pg=PA8|title = Thurgood Marshall | first1=Glenn | last1=Starks | first2=F. | last2=Erik Brooks| publisher=ABC-CLIO | year= 2012|isbn=9780313349171}}page 7 & 8</ref>

Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the [[University of Maryland School of Law]], but did not apply because of the school's policy of [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Marshall attended [[Howard University School of Law]], where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln. His mother had to pawn her wedding and engagement rings to pay the tuition. His views on discrimination were strongly influenced by the dean, [[Charles Hamilton Houston]].<ref name="Starks"/> Marshall graduated from Howard Law in 1933 ranked first in his class with an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] ''[[Latin honors#United States|magna cum laude]]''.<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|title=Biographies of the Robes: Thurgood Marshall|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/robes_marshall.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref>

==Law career==
After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit ''[[Murray v. Pearson]]''. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.<ref name=pbs />

In ''[[Murray v. Pearson]]'', Marshall represented [[Donald Gaines Murray]], a black [[Amherst College]] graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the [[University of Maryland Law School]] because of segregation. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]], the [[Princess Anne Academy]], or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by [[Nathan Margold]], Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.<ref name=eaae>{{cite book|last=Lomotey|first=Kofi|title=Encyclopedia of African American Education|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-4050-4|year=2010}}</ref> The [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] ruled against the state of [[Maryland]] and its [[Attorney General of Maryland|Attorney General]], who represented the [[University of Maryland School of Law|University of Maryland]], stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state.

===Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund===
At the age of 32, Marshall won [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'', 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]].<ref name=fjc>{{cite web| title = Biographies: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Teaching Judicial History|website=FJC|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_bush_bio_naacp.html}}</ref> As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', 321 U.S. 649 (1944); ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', 334 U.S. 1 (1948); ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'', 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'', 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most historic case as a lawyer was ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "[[separate but equal]]" public education, as established by ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.

[[File:Thurgood Marshall 1957-09-17.jpg|thumb|Marshall in 1957]]
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit [[T. R. M. Howard]], a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the [[FBI]]'s failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of [[George W. Lee]] and [[Emmett Till]]. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a '[[rugged individualism|rugged individualist]]' who did not speak for the NAACP."<ref name=Reason>Root, Damon (March 20, 2009) [http://reason.com/archives/2009/03/20/a-forgotten-civil-rights-hero A Forgotten Civil Rights Hero], ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''</ref> Two years earlier, Howard had arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] in [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi]], only days before the ''Brown'' decision.<ref>[[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]], ''Black Maverick: T. R. M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 132–35, 157–58.</ref> According to historians [[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]], "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.{{'"}}<ref name=Reason/>

===Court of Appeals and Solicitor General===
President [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed Marshall to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's [[James Eastland]], held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a [[recess appointment]]. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed him to be the [[United States Solicitor General]], the [[List of African-American firsts#1960s|first African American]] to hold the office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/news/2002/philatelic/sr02_053.htm |title=Civil Rights Giant and First Black Supreme Court Justice Honored on 2003 Black Heritage Series Stamp |publisher=United States Postal Service |date=August 7, 2002 |accessdate=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207171148/http://www.usps.com/news/2002/philatelic/sr02_053.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref> At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing [[Robert C.

===U.S. Supreme Court===
[[File:Thurgoodmarshall1967.jpg|thumb|Thurgood Marshall photographed in 1967 in the [[Oval Office]]]]
On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice [[Tom C. Clark]], saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was [[Supreme Court of the United States#Confirmation process|confirmed]] as an Associate Justice by a [[United States Senate|Senate]] vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967 (32–1 in the [[Senate Republican Conference]] and 37–10 in the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]]) with 20 members voting present or abstaining.<ref>Graham, Fred P.

Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/us/politics/13marshall.html|title=Kagan's Link to Marshall Cuts 2 Ways|first=Charlie|last=Savage|date=May 13, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of [[judicial activism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/06/28/thurgood-marshall-in-the-spotlight-at-kagan-hearing/|title=Thurgood Marshall in the Spotlight at Kagan Hearing|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Naftali|last=Bendavid|date=June 28, 2010| accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128195737|title=Kagan Quizzed About Thurgood Marshall's Record|first=Ari |last=Shapiro|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR| accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of [[individual rights]], especially the rights of criminal suspects. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of ''[[certiorari]]'' in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebrations of the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref name=cvf>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rehnquistcourtt00yarb|url-access=registration|title=The Rehnquist Court and the Constitution |accessdate=May 1, 2009|author=Tinsley E. Yarbrough|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press US | isbn=978-0-19-510346-5}}</ref> Marshall stated:

<blockquote>... the government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war and major social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights, we hold as fundamental today.<ref name=speech>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19870508&id=dh4pAAAAIBAJ&pg=941,933453|title=Justice Marshall v. the US Constitution|date=8 May 1987|newspaper=The Southwest Missourian|last=Sobran|first=Joseph|page=4A}}</ref><ref name=Taylor>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Marshall Sounds Critical Note on Bicentenial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/us/marshall-sounds-critical-note-on-bicentennial.html|date=7 May 1987|last=Taylor|first=Stuart}}</ref></blockquote>

In conclusion, Marshall stated:
{{quote|Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.<ref name=Taylor />}}

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of [[civil rights]] and [[criminal procedure]], Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In ''[[Teamsters v. Terry]]'', he held that the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] entitled the [[plaintiff]] to a [[jury trial]] in a suit against a labor union for breach of [[duty of fair representation]]. In ''[[TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.]]'', he articulated a formulation for the standard of [[Materiality (law)|materiality]] in [[United States securities law]] that is still applied and used today. In ''[[Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]'', he weighed in on the [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] consequences of the [[savings and loan crisis]], permitting a [[savings and loan association]] to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In ''[[Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney]]'', Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its [[Gender discrimination|inequitable impact on women]].

Among his many [[law clerk]]s were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge [[Douglas Ginsburg]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]]; Judge [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.|Ralph Winter]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]; Supreme Court Justice [[Elena Kagan]]; as well as notable law professors [[Susan Low Bloch]], [[Elizabeth Garrett]] (former President of [[Cornell University]]), [[Paul Gewirtz]], [[Dan Kahan]], [[Randall L. Kennedy]], [[Eben Moglen]], [[Rick Pildes]], [[Louis Michael Seidman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/seidman-louis-michael.cfm|title=Profile Louis Seidman|publisher=Georgetown Law|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> [[Cass Sunstein]], and [[Mark Tushnet]] (editor of ''Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences''); and law school deans [[Paul Mahoney (American lawyer)|Paul Mahoney]] of [[University of Virginia School of Law]], [[Martha Minow]] of [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Richard Revesz]] of [[New York University School of Law]].

Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?18624-1/retirement-justice-marshall|title=Retirement of Justice Marshall|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President [[George H.
