'''''Bourne''''' films are a series of German/American [[action thriller film]]s based on the character [[Jason Bourne]] ([[Matt Damon]]), a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Assassination|assassin]] suffering from [[Psychogenic amnesia|dissociative amnesia]] who must figure out who he is,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/jason-bourne-takes-his-case-to-moma/78614 |title=Jason Bourne Takes His Case to MoMA |first=Bruce|last=Bennett |date=May 28, 2008 |work=New York Sun |accessdate=September 10, 2009}}</ref> created by author [[Robert Ludlum]].

All three of Ludlum's novels were [[Film adaptation|adapted for the screen]], featuring Matt Damon as the title character in each. [[Doug Liman]] directed ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002) and [[Paul Greengrass]] directed ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007) and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016). [[Tony Gilroy]] co-wrote each film except for ''Jason Bourne'' and directed ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012).

Damon chose not to return for the fourth film, ''The Bourne Legacy'', which introduces a new main character, Aaron Cross ([[Jeremy Renner]]), a Department of Defense operative who runs for his life because of Bourne's actions in ''Ultimatum''. The character of Jason Bourne does not appear in ''Legacy'', but mention of his name and pictures of Damon as Bourne are shown throughout the film.<ref name=legacy>{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=John|title=The intricate birth of 'The Bourne Legacy'|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/03/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-bourne-20120805|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 3, 2012}}</ref> Damon returned for the fifth installment, ''Jason Bourne''.

The ''Bourne'' series has received generally positive critical reception and grossed over $1.6 billion. Unlike many contemporary action series, it is distinguished by its use of real stunt work, in contrast to the growing use of [[computer-generated imagery]] in action scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/19/bourne.stuntman/|title='Bourne' stunt actor shares his trade secrets|first=Mairi|last=Mackay|publisher=CNN|year=2008|accessdate=2020-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/driveon/2016/07/30/jason-bourne-car-destruction-tally-vegas/87741618/|title=Huge 'Jason Bourne' chase scene wrecked this many cars|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|publisher=USA Today|date=2016-07-30|accessdate=2020-09-02}}</ref>

===''The Bourne Identity'' (2002)===
{{Main|The Bourne Identity (2002 film)}}
A man is found floating in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with two gunshot wounds in his back and a device with the number of a Swiss [[safe deposit box]] embedded in his hip. Upon reaching shore, the man assumes the name [[Jason Bourne]] after finding a passport under that name in the safe deposit box, along with other alien passports, large amounts of assorted currencies, and a gun. He subsequently attempts to discover his true identity while countering attempts on his life by CIA assassins, eventually realizing that he is one such assassin who failed to complete his most recent mission. Bourne breaks his connections to the CIA and unites with Marie Kreutz ([[Franka Potente]]), a woman who helped him learn about his most recent actions prior to his memory loss. Bourne's conflict with the CIA reaches a climax when he takes the fight to their doorstep.

===''The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)===
{{Main|The Bourne Supremacy (film)}}
Some two years after learning that he is a trained assassin and breaking his connections with the CIA, Jason Bourne ([[Matt Damon]]) is framed for a crime to cover up the true perpetrator. An attempt on his life by Kirill ([[Karl Urban]]), a member of the Russian secret service, results in Marie's ([[Franka Potente]]) death in India. Bourne, thinking that the CIA is hunting him again, proceeds to hunt those responsible for her death and his forgotten past. Bourne discovers that Ward Abbott ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), one of the men who oversaw the program which trained Bourne to be an assassin (Operation Treadstone), had stolen millions of dollars from the CIA. Abbott had planned to frame Bourne for the theft, followed by assassinating Bourne in India. Bourne exposes Abbott to Pamela Landy ([[Joan Allen]]), the CIA officer in charge of finding Bourne. Abbott kills himself. Bourne goes to Moscow where he is identified, resulting in a long car chase through Moscow.  At the end of the chase, Kirill dies. Bourne is in Moscow to find the daughter of a Russian couple killed in his first mission. He lets her know (in person) that, despite what she had been lead to believe for a long time, one of her parents did not kill the other & then commit suicide, but that they were actually both murdered. Bourne then goes back into hiding.

===''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (2007)===
{{Main|The Bourne Ultimatum (film)}}
After six weeks of disconnection from his job, Jason Bourne ([[Matt Damon]]) learns that a British journalist ([[Paddy Considine]]) has been investigating his past and contacts him to find out who his source is. Bourne is subsequently targeted by Operation Blackbriar, an upgraded Operation Treadstone, which also has taken note of the investigation. Believing that Bourne is a threat and is seeking revenge, Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen ([[David Strathairn]]) begins a new hunt for Bourne. Bourne manages to take classified documents proving that Blackbriar has targeted U.S. citizens; he is aided by Pamela Landy, who disagreed with Vosen from the beginning and does not support Blackbriar's existence, and former Treadstone logistics technician Nicky Parsons ([[Julia Stiles]]). She may have had romantic feelings for Bourne before his final mission and resultant [[Psychogenic amnesia|amnesia]]. Bourne finally comes face to face with the person who oversaw his [[behavior modification]] as the first Treadstone operative some years earlier, memories of which [[Flashback (psychology)|resurface]]. Those responsible for Treadstone and Blackbriar are exposed, and Bourne goes underground.

===''The Bourne Legacy'' (2012)===
{{Main|The Bourne Legacy (film)}}
Aaron Cross ([[Jeremy Renner]]) is a member of Operation Outcome, a United States Department of Defense black ops program which enhances the physical and mental abilities of field operatives through pills referred to as "chems". Cross, deployed to [[Alaska]] for a training assignment, traverses rugged terrain to reach a cabin operated by an exiled Outcome operative. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne has exposed the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs in public, leading the FBI and the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] to investigate those involved. Retired Air Force Colonel Eric Byer ([[Edward Norton]]), who is responsible for overseeing the Beta program from which the CIA's Treadstone and Blackbriar were developed, decides to end Outcome and kill its agents. Cross manages to survive several attempts on his life and seeks a way to get more chems, as his supply runs out. Cross eventually comes upon Dr. Marta Shearing ([[Rachel Weisz]]), his last link to gain more chems. He discovers she has no pills but that his physical enhancements can be "viraled-out" and can become genetically permanent, so he would no longer need physical chems. He, in turn, reveals to her that without the help of the mental chem enhancements, he possesses a well-below average [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]. To avoid this mental regression, and the operatives hunting them, the two travel to a factory in [[Manila]] and with Shearing's help, Cross initiates and survives the potentially fatal process of viraling-out of his dependency on the remaining mental-enhancing pills. They evade the Manila police and an operative from the new LARX program, and successfully escape from the Philippines on a junk ship.

===''Jason Bourne'' (2016)===
{{main|Jason Bourne (film)}}
Nicky Parsons ([[Julia Stiles]]), whom Bourne sent into hiding in ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', gains access to sensitive CIA files. She contacts Bourne to share information about his past, including how he was recruited for Operation Treadstone and his father's role in that operation. Bourne learns that his father, Richard Webb ([[Gregg Henry]]), designed Operation Treadstone and was assassinated by the CIA because he did not want his son to enter the program and become a killer. CIA director Robert Dewey ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) hunts down Parsons and Bourne using a foreign asset ([[Vincent Cassel]]) and the technical skills of CIA Cyber Ops Division head Heather Lee ([[Alicia Vikander]]), while Bourne plans to avenge his father's death. Bourne first tries to make the man who recruited him into the CIA confirm his understanding of his father's death. He then plans to avenge himself against Dewey. Meanwhile, Lee wants to bring Bourne back into the CIA's special operations and Dewey allows her to believe she has his support even though he plans to eliminate Bourne.

There is a subplot involving Operation Iron Hand, a surveillance program that will have secret access to a giant social media service called Deep Dream. In the past the CIA and Deep Dream have had a contract to work together, but Aaron Kalloor ([[Riz Ahmed]]), its founder and CEO, wants to end this cooperation. When Dewey refuses to allow any such change, Kalloor plans to reveal his relationship with the CIA and its plans to violate the privacy expectations of Deep Dream's millions of users. Dewey plans to assassinate Kalloor before his planned revelations.

===Future===
In November 2016, producer [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] acknowledged that [[Universal Pictures]] is optimistic regarding a ''Jason Bourne'' sequel. In the same interview, he reported that a follow-up installment to ''The Bourne Legacy'' is unlikely although the studio has not ruled it out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/jason-bourne-sequel/|title='Jason Bourne' Sequel Likely to Happen, 'Bourne Legacy' Sequel Less Likely to Happen|author=Angie Han|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=November 29, 2016}}</ref> In March 2017, franchise star Matt Damon, cast doubt upon a sequel stating that the audience "might be done" with the character.<ref>{{cite web |last=Daniell |first=Mark |url=https://torontosun.com/2017/03/05/matt-damon-hints-jason-bourne-is-done-maybe-people-are-done-with-the-character |title=Matt Damon hints Jason Bourne is done: 'Maybe people are done with the character' |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=March 5, 2017 }}</ref>

By October 2019, Ben Smith - who has served as a producer on the franchise - confirmed that a film is currently in development. Though he would not detail the plot, nor the studio's plans, he confirmed that the sequel will tie into the ''[[Treadstone]]'' television series.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show|title=Another Bourne Movie Is In The Works, And It'll Tie Into The Treadstone TV Show|date=October 3, 2019|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref>

==Production==
Director Doug Liman stated that he had been a fan of ''[[The Bourne Identity (novel)|The Bourne Identity]]'' by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of production of Liman's previous film ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from [[Warner Brothers]] and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production.<ref name="DVD.com">''The Bourne Identity'' DVD Commentary Featuring Doug Liman (2003).</ref> Liman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]], before he eventually cast [[Matt Damon]].

==Music==
The scores of the first three films of the series were written by English composer [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]], with [[James Newton Howard]] scoring the fourth film, ''The Bourne Legacy''. 
Powell returned, with [[David Buckley]] to compose the score of the fifth film. 
Powell was not the original choice as composer for ''The Bourne Identity''—a score for the film had already been composed by [[Carter Burwell]] and recorded by an orchestra, when director Doug Liman contacted Powell to provide an alternative soundtrack as he was dissatisfied with the music. Partly for budgetary reasons, Powell scaled down the orchestral score to a mostly electronic soundtrack with strings overlaid to give it a "cinematic feel".<ref name=powell>{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tim|title=John Powell interview: 'I sold myself to the Devil, just a bit'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/john-powell-interview-i-sold-myself-to-the-devil-just-a-bit-9466955.html|accessdate=5 June 2014|work=The Independent|date=1 June 2014}}</ref>

The song "[[Extreme Ways]]" by musician [[Moby]] is used as the end title theme of all five films.

==Reception==
The ''Bourne'' series has received both critical and commercial success. ''Ultimatum'' won three [[Academy Award]]s: [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/complete-list-academy-award-winners-wbna23326714 "80th Academy Awards Winners"].
