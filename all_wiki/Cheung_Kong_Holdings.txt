The company was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972 as Cheung Kong Holdings, and developed into a [[Real estate development|property development]] and strategic investment company, with substantial interests in life sciences and other businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=0001.HK|title=Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

Cheung Kong Group became one of the largest developers in Hong Kong with a long history of property development. About one in twelve of the private residences in Hong Kong were developed by the company.

The company and [[Sun Hung Kai Properties]] together became increasingly dominant in the development of new private homes, accounting for 70% of the market in 2010, up from around half of that in 2003. This concentration, with much of the rest of the market occupied by other very large firms, is attributed to the government's policy of auctioning land in expensively large blocks, squeezing out small and mid-sized firms, according to the [[Hong Kong Consumer Council|Consumer Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Kwok | first = Vivian | title = Two developers tower over market | newspaper = South China Morning Post | date = 12 Aug 2010 | url = http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=9808d8fed026a210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=&s=News | accessdate =12 Aug 2010}}</ref>
