In September 2020, a ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' article by [[John Ioannidis]] estimated global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%{{Efn|The overall value was corrected from 0.27% to account for "the fact that only one or two types of antibodies (among IgG, IgM, IgA) might have been used" in testing.|name=|group=}} overall and 0.05% for people < 70 years, much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic. Ioannides criticized prior "average IFR ... irresponsibly circulated widely in media and social media" as "probably extremely flawed as they depended on erroneous modeling assumptions, and/or focused only on selecting mostly studies from countries high death burden (that indeed have higher IFRs), and/or were done by inexperienced authors who used overtly wrong meta-analysis methods in a situation where there is extreme between-study heterogeneity.<ref name=":12" /> As the data for his analysis was drawn "predominantly from hard-hit epicenters", Ioannides indicates that even lower "average values of 0.15–0.25% ... and 0.03–0.04% for <70 years) as of October 2020 are plausible."<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Ioannidis|first=John P.

Another metric in assessing death rate is the [[case fatality rate|case fatality ratio]] (CFR),{{efn|Some refer to 'fatality rate'; however 'fatality ratio' is more accurate as this is not per unit time.<ref name="WHOest" />|name=|group=}} which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.

Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a [[thermometer]] to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.<ref name="f4SpW">{{Cite web |url=https://intellisec.co.za/fever-screening/ |title=Fever Screening &#124; IntelliSEC &#124; Durban, Johannesburg, Cape Town |website=IntelliSEC}}</ref> Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name="NY0JD" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name="ImpCollege16mar2020" />

Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name="Lancet2020Flatten" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name="Lancet2020Flatten" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name="community mitigation" />

More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name="RwmYm" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name="shZdf" />

Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name="ImpCollege16mar2020" />

Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December 2019, the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.<ref name="original_report" /> That same day, the WHO received reports of a [[Disease cluster|cluster]] of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause in Wuhan,<ref name="AutoDW-69" /> and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.<ref name="bbc50984025" />

The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of [[Shortage|supply shortages]], stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to the factory and logistic operations.<ref name="XvcU9" /> The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. [[social influence]] and trust).<ref name="cSvA4">{{cite journal |last1=Yuen |first1=Kum Fai |last2=Wang |first2=Xueqin |last3=Ma |first3=Fei |last4=Li |first4=Kevin X. |s2cid=218856048 |title=The psychological causes of panic buying following a health crisis |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |year=2020 |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=3513 |doi=10.3390/ijerph17103513 |pmid=32443427 |pmc=7277661}}</ref> The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.<ref name="AutoDW-263" /> According to the WHO director-general [[Tedros Adhanom]], demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.<ref name="AutoDW-275" /><ref name="AutoDW-276" /> It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.<ref name="Mycfo" />

===Education===
{{Main|Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education}}<div class="excerpt">The pandemic has severely impacted educational systems globally. Most governments have temporarily closed educational institutions, with many switching to [[online education]]. As of 30 September 2020, approximately 1.077&nbsp;billion [[Learning|learners]] are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 53 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 27 are implementing local closures, impacting about 61.6 percent of the world's student population. 72 countries' schools are currently open.<ref name="ynkmU">{{Cite web|last=https://plus.google.com/+UNESCO|date=4 March 2020|title=Education: From disruption to recovery|url=https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse|access-date=12 October 2020|website=UNESCO}}</ref>
School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences. School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various [[Social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|social]] and [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|economic issues]], including [[student debt]], [[digital learning]], [[Food security|food insecurity]], and [[homelessness]], as well as access to [[Child care|childcare]], [[health care]], [[housing]], [[internet]], and [[Disability rights movement|disability services]]. The impact has been more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
