The '''Munich Security Conference''' ('''MSC'''; {{lang-de|Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz}}) is an annual [[Meeting|conference]] on [[international security]] policy that has taken place in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]] since 1963. Former names are ''Wehrkundetagung'' and ''Münchner Konferenz für Sicherheitspolitik''.<ref name="Historisches Lexikon">{{cite web | url=http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_46205 | title=Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz | author=Tobias Greiff | date= | website= | publisher=Historisches Lexikon Bayerns | language=German | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>  It is the world's largest gathering of its kind.

Over the past four decades the Munich Security Conference has become the most important independent forum for the exchange of views by international security policy decision-makers. Each year it brings together about 350 senior figures from more than 70 countries around the world to engage in an intensive debate on current and future security challenges. The list of attendees includes [[Head of state|heads of states]], [[government]]s and [[International organization|international organizations]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of parliament|members of parliament]], high-ranking representatives of [[Military|armed forces]], [[Scientist|science]], [[civil society]], as well as [[business]] and [[Mass media|media]].

The conference is held annually in February. The venue is the [[Hotel Bayerischer Hof, Munich|Hotel Bayerischer Hof]] in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. The 56th Security Conference was held from 14 to 16 February 2020.

[[File:Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin 2009.jpg|thumb|Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin]]
The conference evolved from the ''Internationale Wehrkundebegegnung'' / ''Münchner Wehrkundetagung'',<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.securityconference.de/news//article/little-patience-for-frivolous-speeches-a-personal-remembrance-of-wehrkunde-and-ewald-von-kleist/ | title=Little Patience for Frivolous Speeches - A Personal Remembrance of Wehrkunde and Ewald von Kleist | author=William S. Cohen | date=28 January 2014 | website= | publisher=Munich Security Conference | language= | accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref> which was founded in 1963 by [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.securityconference.de/news/news/article/die-muenchner-sicherheitskonferenz-trauert-um-ewald-heinrich-von-kleist/ | title=Die Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz trauert um Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist | author=Wolfgang Ischinger | date=13 March 2013 | website= | publisher=Munich Security Conference | language=German | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> The resistance fighter from the [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg circle]] advocated to prevent military conflicts such as the [[World War II|Second World War]] in the future and brought together leaders and experts in security policy for this reason. The first meeting was limited to about 60 participants; among them were [[Helmut Schmidt]] and [[Henry Kissinger]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/-muenchner-sicherheitskonferenz-vom-privat-treffen-zum-riesenzirkus-1.1875580 | title=Vom Privat-Treffen zum Riesenzirkus | author=Stefan Kornelius | date=30 January 2014 | website= | publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] | language=German | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Von Kleist led the meetings until 1997; his successor who led them from 1999 until 2008 was politician and business manager Horst Teltschik ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]). Since 2009, the conference is headed by the former diplomat [[Wolfgang Ischinger]]. Ischinger established the Munich Security Conference gGmbH non-profit foundation in 2011, which he has led since then.<ref name="Historisches Lexikon" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gcsp.ch/About-Us/Global-Fellowship-Initiative/Associate-Fellows/Ambassador-Wolfgang-ISCHINGER | title=Ambassador Wolfgang ISCHINGER | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Geneva Centre for Security Policy | language= | accessdate= 22 November 2014}}</ref>

The Munich Security Conference was canceled twice, in 1991 due to the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] and 1997 as a result of the retirement of Kleist-Schmenzin.<ref name="Historisches Lexikon" /> Under the leadership of Teltschik the Security Conference opened in 1999 for political, military and business leaders from Central and Eastern Europe as well as India, Japan and the People's Republic of China.

== Purpose ==
At this conference, under the theme of peace through dialogue, senior politicians, diplomats, military and security experts from the member countries of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], but also from other countries such as [[China]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]] and [[Russia]] are invited to discuss the current issues in security and defense policies.

The intention of the conference is to address the topical main security issues and to debate and analyze the main security challenges in the present and the future in line with the concept of networked security. A focal point of the conference is the discussion and the exchange of views on the development of the [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] relations as well as European and global security in the 21st century.

The conference is organized privately and therefore not an official government event. It is used exclusively for discussion; an authorization for binding intergovernmental decisions does not exist. Furthermore, there is - contrary to usual conventions - no common final communiqué. The high-level meeting is also used to discrete background discussions between the participants. An exception is the presentation of global political decisions, such as the exchange of instruments of [[ratification]] for the [[New START]] disarmament agreement between the United States and Russia, which was held at the conclusion of the security conference in 2011.
