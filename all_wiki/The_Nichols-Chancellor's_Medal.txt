'''The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Commencement Awards|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/commencement/archives/commencement-awards.php}}</ref> is an annual medal that is awarded by [[Vanderbilt University]].  The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal is awarded to those persons who define the 21st century and exemplify the best qualities of the human spirit.  The Medal is awarded on each Senior Class Day to persons chosen by Vanderbilt's Chancellor with the advice of the faculty and students.  Senior Class Day is the day before Vanderbilt's spring undergraduate commencement.  In 2020, Senior Class Day was renamed Graduates Day to be more inclusive to all Vanderbilt students, including graduate, professional and undergraduate students, who will earn a degree the following day. The Medal includes a cash award and is one of the university's highest honors.

==History==

The tradition of Senior Class Day was started by Chancellor [[Gordon Gee]], and the first Senior Class Day was in 2004.  Vanderbilt awarded The Chancellor's Medal to [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Shirin Ebadi]] on Senior Class Day in 2004 and 2005 respectively.  The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal replaced The Chancellor's Medal in 2006.  The first Nichols-Chancellor's Medal was awarded that year to disaster relief workers around the world and was accepted on their behalf by the first lady of the United States, [[Laura Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=First Lady Laura Bush addresses graduating Vanderbilt seniors|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2006/05/first-lady-laura-bush-addresses-graduating-vanderbilt-seniors-56711/}}</ref>  The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal was created and endowed by Edward and Janice Nichols in memory of Ed's parents, Edward Carmack Nichols and Lucile Hamby Nichols.  In 2009, a permanent endowment fund known as The Edward and Janice Nichols Endowment Fund was established at Vanderbilt to fund The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal and The Nichols Humanitarian Fund in perpetuity.

The Nichols Humanitarian Fund<ref>{{cite web|title=Nichols Humanitarian Fund|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/nicholsfund}}</ref> is a companion scholarship fund to The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal.  The purpose of fund is to enable Vanderbilt students to volunteer for humanitarian causes.  The fund awards scholarships based on merit and need to Vanderbilt students to pay the expenses of their humanitarian activities.

The $100,000 cash prize that accompanied The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal that Mrs. Bush accepted was given to Vanderbilt to start the fund.  The fund also receives substantial contributions each year from The Edward and Janice Nichols Endowment Fund.
