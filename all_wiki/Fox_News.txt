{{Main|History of Fox News}}
In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Marvin Davis]] intended to develop "a network of [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] as a fourth marketing force" to compete directly with [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through the purchase of six television stations owned by [[Metromedia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADEAE8781FD7AD&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D |title=Murdoch, partner plan 4th network |last=Lenzner |first=Robert |date=May 5, 1985 |page=1 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |via=nl.newsbank |quote=The six stations cover many of the nation's major markets&nbsp;– New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Washington.}}</ref> In July 1985, [[20th Century Fox]] announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox Filmed Entertainment]], the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5D81738F932A25754C0A963948260 |title=$55.9 Million Fox Film Loss |date=July 11, 1985 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=D19 |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref> A year later, 20th Century Fox earned $5.6 million in its fiscal third period ended May 31, 1986, in contrast to a loss of $55.8 million in the third period of the previous year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24921105.html?dids=24921105:24921105&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:FT&type=current&date=Jul+17%2C+1986&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=TURNAROUND+FOR+FOX+FILM |title=Turnaround for Fox Film |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= July 17, 1986 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105044854/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24921105.html?dids=24921105:24921105&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:FT&type=current&date=Jul+17%2C+1986&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=TURNAROUND+FOR+FOX+FILM |archive-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>

Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]'s [[BSkyB]] subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel ([[Sky News]]) in the United Kingdom in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1704677.html |title=Business Analysis: Unstoppable Sky machine rolls on as ITV troubles worsen Dawn Airey's free-to-air television experience will be invaluable to BSkyB as it moves beyond its pay-TV model |last=Shah |first=Saeed |date=September 24, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |page=21 |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508171810/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1704677.html |archive-date=May 8, 2013 |via=Highbeam.com}}</ref> With the success of his [[The Fourth Network|fourth network]] efforts in the United States,<ref>{{cite news |title=Fox is a business, if not artistic, success |last=Schulberg |first=Pete |date=July 15, 1994 |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |page=E1}}<br />{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4395441.html |title=How Fox broke from the pack to become cutting-edge network |last=Braxton |first=Greg |date=April 6, 1997 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515204930/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4395441.html |archive-date=May 15, 2007 |via=Highbeam.com}}</ref> experience gained from [[Sky News]] and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 31, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp.

In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DE1F3FF934A35753C1A960958260 |title=At the new Fox News Channel, the buzzword is fairness, separating news from bias |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Lawrie |last=Mifflin |date=October 7, 1996 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> [[Roger Ailes]] left cable television channel [[America's Talking]] (now [[MSNBC]]), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.<ref name="FoxCorporateInfo" />

At its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;<ref name=King>{{cite news |title=Fox Hunts TV News Niche with Channel Debut Today |first=Angela G. |last=King |date=October 7, 1996 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]}}</ref> however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (later ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''.

From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and "bullet points" when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the "Fox News Alert", which interrupted its regular programming when a [[breaking news]] story occurred.

To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html |first=Richard |last=Katz |date=May 1996 |title=Bold grab for subs: Murdoch offers $11 to carry Fox News |magazine=[[Multichannel News]] |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRU0fPQa?url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html |archive-date=November 23, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When [[Time Warner]] bought [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a federal [[antitrust]] [[consent decree]] required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own [[CNN]] on its [[Time Warner Cable|cable systems]]. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News).

During the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], Fox News was the first news organization to run a [[news ticker]] on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day.

==Ratings and reception==
In 2003, Fox News saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]]. At the height of the conflict, according to some reports, Fox News had as much as a 300% increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm |title=War coverage lifts News Corp |date=August 13, 2003 |website=BBC News |accessdate=November 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512061740/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm |archive-date=May 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, Fox News' ratings for its broadcast of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President [[George W. Bush]]'s address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million, and 5.0 million respectively.

Between late 2005 and early 2006, Fox News saw a brief decline in ratings. One was in the second quarter of 2006, when it lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for the ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier|Special Report with Brit Hume]]'', for example, dropped 19%. Several weeks later, in the wake of the [[2006 North Korean missile test]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the No. 1 rated cable news channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/fncs_2554_prime_downward_spiral_20939.asp |title=FNC's 25-54 Prime "Downward Spiral" |date=April 26, 2005 |website=[[TVNewser]] |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517073747/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/fncs_2554_prime_downward_spiral_20939.asp |archive-date=May 17, 2008}}<br />{{cite web |url=http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2005/narrative_cabletv_contentanalysis.asp?media=5&cat=2 |title=Cable TV: Content Analysis |date=2005 |website=The State of the News Media |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803033420/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2005/narrative_cabletv_contentanalysis.asp?media=5&cat=2 |archive-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' finishing first and second respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/ranker_april05.pdf |title=Competitive Program Ranker (M-F 6a-11p programs) |date=April 2005 |website=TVNewser |access-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614001942/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/ranker_april05.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2007}}</ref>

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] led to increased viewership for all cable news networks. For the first calendar quarter of 2020 (1 January- 31 March), Fox News had their highest-rated quarter in the network's history, with Nielsen showing a prime time average total audience of 3.387 million viewers. [[Sean Hannity]]'s program, ''[[Hannity]]'', weeknights at 9PM ET was the top-rated show in cable news for the quarter averaging 4.2 million viewers, a figure that not only beat out all of its cable news competition but also placed it ahead of network competition in the same time slot. Fox ended the quarter with the top five shows in prime time, with Fox's ''[[Tucker Carlson Tonight]]'' finishing the quarter in second overall with an average audience of 4.2 million viewers, followed by ''[[The Five (talk show)|The Five]]'', ''[[The Ingraham Angle]]'', and ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]''.

A [[Morning Consult]] survey the week after [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] 2020 showed 30 percent of Republicans in the United States had an unfavorable opinion of Fox News, while 54 percent of Republicans viewed the network favorably, compared to 67 percent before the election.

Ratings were also down for Fox News. Although it remained ahead of other networks overall, its morning show fell out of first place for the first time since 2001.

==Slogan==
Fox News Channel originally used the slogan "Fair and Balanced", which was coined by network co-founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the slogan as being a "blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a [[liberal media|liberal bias]] ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks".<ref name="nyt-fairandbalanced">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/media/fox-news-fair-and-balanced.html |title=Fox News Drops 'Fair and Balanced' Motto |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |date=June 14, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=June 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name="salon-fairandbalanced">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2017/06/15/fox-news-no-longer-fair-or-balanced-right-wing-network-sheds-longtime-slogan/ |title=Fox News no longer "fair and balanced" as network sheds longtime slogan |first=Matthew |last=Sheffield |date=June 15, 2017 |website=Salon |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref> In a 2013 interview with [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]] of the [[Hoover Institution]], Rupert Murdoch defended the company's "Fair and Balanced" slogan saying "In fact, you'll find just as many Democrats as Republicans on and so on".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rupert Murdoch discusses the future of journalism |url=https://www.hoover.org/research/rupert-murdoch-discusses-future-journalism |website=Hoover Institution}}</ref>

In August 2003, Fox News [[Fox v.

In August 2016, Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the "Fair and Balanced" slogan in favor of "Most Watched, Most Trusted"; when these changes were reported in June 2017 by [[Gabriel Sherman]] (a writer who had written a biography on Ailes), a network executive said the change "has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions".

===Benghazi attack and aftermath===

Fox News provided extensive coverage of the [[2012 Benghazi attack]], which host Sean Hannity described in December 2012 as "the story that the mainstream media ignores" and "obviously, a cover-up. And we will get to the bottom of it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/11/09/why-has-fox-news-abandoned-benghazi/ |title=Opinion - Why has Fox News abandoned Benghazi? |last=Wemple |first=Erik |date=November 9, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Programming analysis by [[Media Matters]] found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks, FNC ran 1,098 segments on the issue, including:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2014/09/16/report-foxs-benghazi-obsession-by-the-numbers/200694 |title=Report: Fox's Benghazi Obsession By The Numbers |first1=Rob |last1=Savillo |first2=Hannah |last2=Groch-Begley |date=September 9, 2014 |website=[[Media Matters]] |accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref>
* 478 segments involving [[Susan Rice]]'s September 16, 2012 Sunday news show appearances, during which she was falsely accused of lying
* 382 segments on ''Special Report'', the network's flagship news program
* 281 segments alleging a "cover-up" by the Obama administration
* 144 interviews of GOP members of Congress, but just five interviews of Democratic members of Congress and Obama administration officials
* 120 comparisons to Iran-Contra, Watergate, and the actions of the Nixon administration
* 100 segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a "stand-down order" to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi

Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack, there were [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten official investigations]], including six by Republican-controlled House committees. None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal, cover-up or lying by Obama administration officials.

On June 29, 2018, Fox News broadcast a segment by news anchor [[Bret Baier]] entitled "Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation?" which repeated some of the accusations the network had previously made about Susan Rice and [[Hillary Clinton]], but for which the women had been exonerated by the official investigations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://video.foxnews.com/v/5803740013001/?#sp=show-clips |title=Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation? |date=June 29, 2018 |website=Fox News |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017, following the [[2017 New York City truck attack]] wherein a terrorist shouted "Allahu Akbar", Fox News distorted a statement by [[Jake Tapper]] to make it appear as if he had said "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" can be used under the most "beautiful circumstances".<ref name=":21">{{Cite news |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/jake-tapper-fox-news-lying-allahu-akbar-beautiful-2017-11 |title=Jake Tapper slams Fox News for misrepresenting comments about New York City terror attack |first=Mark |last=Abadi |date=November 2, 2017 |work=Business Insider |access-date=November 2, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of "Allahu Akbar" in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances.<ref name=":21" /> A headline on FoxNews.com was preceded by a tag reading "OUTRAGEOUS".<ref name=":21" /> The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more, saying "Jake Tapper Says 'Allahu Akbar' Is 'Beautiful' Right After NYC Terror Attack" in a tweet that was later deleted.<ref name=":21" /> Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to "deliberately lie" and said "there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at ''Infowars''.

According to climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]], Fox News "has constructed an alternative universe where the laws of physics no longer apply, where the [[greenhouse effect]] is a myth, and where climate change is a hoax, the product of a massive conspiracy among scientists, who somehow have gotten the polar bears, glaciers, sea levels, superstorms, and megadroughts to play along."<ref name=":44" /> According to [[James L.

Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump's remarks that "many sides" were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/business/media/wow-stunned-tv-hosts-reacted-in-real-time-to-trump.html |title='Wow': Stunned TV Hosts Reacted in Real Time to Trump |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |date=August 15, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=August 16, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/17/in-conservative-media-an-amen-chorus-defends-trump-on-charlottesville/ |title=In conservative media, an amen chorus defends Trump's comments on Charlottesville violence |first=David |last=Weigel |date=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Some criticized Trump.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/08/16/media/fox-charlottesville-prime-time/index.html |title=After Trump's Charlottesville remarks, Fox News focuses on the left and the media |last=Byers |first=Dylan |date=August 16, 2017 |website=CNN Money |access-date=August 16, 2017}}</ref> In a press conference on August 15, Trump used the term "alt-left" to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally, a term which had been used in Fox News' coverage of the white supremacist rally.<ref name=":2" /> Several of Trump's comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-charlottesville-press-conference-white-supremacy/ |title=Trump Cribbed His Charlottesville Press Conference Straight From Fox News |first=Ashley |last=Feinberg |date=August 15, 2017 |work=WIRED |access-date=August 16, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to [[Dylan Byers]] of CNN, Fox News' coverage on the day of the press conference "was heavy with "[[whataboutism]]". The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of Trump and leftist protestors' toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry."<ref name=":7" /> Byers wrote, "it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump's presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday."<ref name=":7" />

Two of Fox News's commentators - Hannity and Laura Ingraham - promoted use of the drug [[hydroxychloroquine]] for the treatment of Coronavirus - [[off-label]] usage which at the time was supported only by [[anecdotal evidence]] - after it was touted by Trump as a possible cure.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rupar |first=Aaron |url=https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21192222/fox-news-coronavirus-coverage-dan-patrick-drugs |title=Fox News's coronavirus coverage slid back off the rails spectacularly on Monday night |date=2020-03-24 |work=Vox |access-date=2020-04-05 |language=en}}</ref> As a result of this continued skewed reporting, ''[[Washington Post]]'' media critic Erik Wemple has called Hannity to be fired.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wemple |first=Erik |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/30/hannity-must-go/ |title=Hannity must go |date=2020-03-30 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Fox News promoted a [[conspiracy theory]] that coronavirus death toll numbers were inflated with people who would have died anyway from preexisting conditions.

As a result, the [[CRTC]] denied a 2003 application requesting permission for Fox News Channel to be [[List of foreign television channels available in Canada|carried in Canada]]. However, in March 2004, a Fox executive said the venture had been shelved; in November of that year, the CRTC added Fox News to its whitelist of foreign channels that may be carried by television providers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/crtc-approves-fox-news-for-canada-1.492643 |title=CRTC approves Fox News for Canada |date=November 18, 2004 |work=CBC News |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207192831/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/11/18/fox_crtc041118.html |archive-date=February 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The most popular pay television operator, [[DStv]], does not offer FNC in its channel bouquet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guide.dstv.com/channels |title=DStv Channels |date=May 6, 2018 |website=DStv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405010514/http://guide.dstv.com/channels |archive-date=April 5, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
FNC was carried in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] by [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], which was 40-percent owned by 21st Century Fox at the time, and operates its own domestic news channel [[Sky News]]. On August 29, 2017, Sky dropped Fox News; the broadcaster said its carriage was not "commercially viable" due to average viewership of fewer than 2,000 viewers per day. The company said the decision was unrelated to 21st Century Fox's proposed acquisition of the remainder of [[Sky plc]] (which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by [[Comcast]] instead).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/26/rupert-murdochs-sky-reign-to-end-as-fox-sells-all-shares-to-comcast |title=Rupert Murdoch's Sky reign to end as Fox sells all shares to Comcast |last=Waterson |first=Jim |date=September 26, 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en |access-date=September 27, 2018}}</ref>

The potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal, who felt Sky News could similarly undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint. However, such a move would violate [[Ofcom]] broadcast codes, which requires all news programming to show due impartiality. The channel's broadcasts in the country have violated this rule on several occasions, while the channel also violated [[election silence]] rules by broadcasting analysis of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 Brexit referendum]] while polls were still open (the channel was blacked out while polls were open during the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] to comply with the rule).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/06/fox-news-shows-broke-uk-tv-impartiality-rules-ofcom-finds |title=Fox News shows broke UK TV impartiality rules, Ofcom finds |last=Ruddick |first=Graham |date=November 6, 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=November 7, 2017 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/29/sky-to-stop-broadcasting-rightwing-us-channel-fox-news-in-uk |title=Sky stops broadcasting rightwing US channel Fox News in UK |last1=Sweney |first1=Mark |last2=Ruddick |first2=Graham |date=August 29, 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=August 29, 2017|language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-news-stops-airing-uk-a-look-at-ofcom-rulings-1033789 |title=Fox News Stops Airing in U.K.: A Look at Ofcom Rulings Against It |first=Georg |last=Szalai |date=August 30, 2017 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 30, 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41087659 |title=Sky stops broadcasting Fox News in UK |date=August 29, 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=August 29, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref>
