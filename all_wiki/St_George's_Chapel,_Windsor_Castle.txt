'''St. George's Chapel''' at [[Windsor Castle]] in England is a chapel built in high-medieval [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] style. It is both a [[Royal Peculiar]], a church under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch, and the Chapel of the [[Order of the Garter]]. It is located in the [[Bailey (castle)|Lower Ward]] of the castle.<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42156565|title=Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May|author=|date=28 November 2017|publisher=|access-date=28 November 2017|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>
St. George's [[castle chapel]] was originally founded in the 14th century by [[King Edward III]] and extensively enlarged in the late 15th century. It has been the scene of many royal services, weddings and, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, burials. Although occasional monarchs and their consorts were buried at the castle from the 15th century it wasn't until the 19th century that St George's Chapel and (in the case of [[Queen Victoria]]) the nearby [[Frogmore Gardens]] superseded [[Westminster Abbey]] as the chosen burial place for the British monarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=
http://www.genealogyinengland.com/Information/windsormonarchs.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/queen-elizabeth-death-dies-what-happens-uk-london-bridge-down-a8444526.html}}</ref> Windsor, England's premier castle, is a principal residence of [[Queen Elizabeth II|the monarch]].

The running of the chapel is the responsibility of the [[dean and canons of Windsor]] who make up the [[Collegiate church|College]] of [[St. George]]. They are assisted by a [[Chapter Clerk|Clerk]], Verger and other staff. [[The Society of the Friends of St George's and Descendants of the Knights of the Garter]], a registered charity, was established in 1931 to assist the College in maintaining the chapel.

==History==
[[File:WindsorLowerBaileyJosephNash1848 edited.jpg|thumb|left|St. George's Chapel (left) at Windsor Castle in 1848, showing the absence of the [[Queen's Beasts]] on the [[pinnacle]]s (since replaced).]]

In 1348, [[King Edward III]] founded two religious colleges: [[St Stephen's Chapel|St Stephen's]] at [[Westminster]] and St. George's at Windsor. The new college at Windsor was attached to the Chapel of St. [[Edward the Confessor]] which had been constructed by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in the early thirteenth century. The chapel was then re-dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], [[George the Martyr]] and [[Edward the Confessor]], but soon became known only by its dedication to St. George.<ref name=Victoria>{{cite book|chapter=Collegiate churches: Windsor (St George's chapel)|title=A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 2|editor1=P H Ditchfield |editor2=William Page|publisher= Victoria County History|year=1907|page=106|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/berks/vol2/pp106-112}}</ref> Edward III also built the [[Aerary]] Porch in 1353&ndash;54. It was used as the entrance to the new college.

St. George's Chapel became the church of the [[Order of the Garter]]. A special service is still held in the chapel every June and is attended by members of the order. Their [[Heraldry|heraldic]] banners hang above the upper stalls of the [[Cathedral diagram|choir]], where they have a seat for life.
[[File:Windsor horseshoe cloister 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A close-up photograph of a building made with black timbers and red brick. The building has four tall, brick chimneys. A relatively modern drainpipe comes down the middle of the building.|The Horseshoe Cloister, built in 1480 and reconstructed in the 19th century]]

The period 1475–1528 saw a radical redevelopment of St. George's Chapel set in motion by [[Edward IV]] and continued by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] under the supervision of his most esteemed counsellor, [[Sir Reginald Bray]] (later [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]), and by [[Henry VIII]]. The thirteenth-century Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor was enlarged into a cathedral-like space under the direction of [[Richard Beauchamp (bishop)|Richard Beauchamp]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], and the master mason, Henry Janyns. The Horseshoe Cloister was constructed for the new community of 45 junior members: 16 vicars, a deacon gospeller, 13 lay clerks, 2 clerk epistolers and 13 choristers. The [[Choir]] of St. George's Chapel continues to this day and numbers 20. The choristers are borders at [[St George's School, Windsor Castle]]. In term time they attend practice in the chapel every morning and sing [[Matins]] and the [[Eucharist]] on Sundays and [[Evensong]] throughout the week, except on Wednesdays.

St. George's Chapel was a popular destination for pilgrims during the late medieval period, as it was considered to contain several important burials: the bodies of [[John Schorne]] and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and a fragment of the [[True Cross]] held in a [[reliquary]] called the Cross of Gneth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} It was seized from the [[Welsh people]] by Edward II after his conquest along with other sacred relics. These relics all appear to have been displayed at the eastern end of the south choir.

The Chapel suffered a great deal of destruction during the [[English Civil War]]. [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces broke into and plundered the chapel and treasury on 23 October 1642. Further pillage occurred in 1643 when the fifteenth-century chapter house was destroyed, lead was stripped off the chapel roofs, and elements of Henry VIII's unfinished funeral monument were stolen. Following his execution in 1649, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was buried in a small vault in the centre of the choir at St. George's Chapel which also contained the coffins of Henry VIII and [[Jane Seymour]]. A programme of repair was undertaken at St. George's Chapel after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].

During his life and reign, [[King George III]] was responsible for reigniting royal interest in Windsor Castle, which had been much overlooked after the House of Hanover came to the throne of the United Kingdom in 1714. On 12 August 1776 the Royal Family first attended the Sunday morning service at St George's Chapel – which they called “the Cathedral”. George III was committed to St George's Chapel; he inspired and in large part funded an extensive restoration of the chapel from 1780 to 1790.

The reign of [[Queen Victoria]] saw further changes made to the structure of the chapel. The east end of the [[Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|choir]] was reworked in memory of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. The [[Lady Chapel (Windsor)|Lady Chapel]], which had been abandoned by Henry VII, was completed. A royal mausoleum was completed underneath the [[Cathedral diagram|Lady Chapel]]. A set of steps was built at the west end of the chapel to create a ceremonial entrance to the building.

By the early twentieth century, the bowing walls, cracked vaulting, decayed stone and stripped lead required urgent attention. In 1920 a much needed ten-year restoration project began at George's Chapel, overseen by the consulting architect [[Sir Harold Brakspear]].

In the 21st century, St. George's accommodates approximately 800 people for services and events.<ref name="bbc.com"/>

===Queen's Beasts===
[[File:St Georges Chapel Windsor 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Queen's Beasts]] shown atop the pinnacles]]
On the roof of the chapel, standing on the pinnacles, and also on pinnacles at the sides, are seventy-six heraldic statues representing the [[Queen's Beasts]], showing the [[Royal supporters of England]]. They represent fourteen of the heraldic animals: the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] of [[Principality of Wales|Wales]], the [[Panthera|panther]] of [[Jane Seymour]], the [[falcon]] of [[House of York|York]], the black bull of [[Duke of Clarence|Clarence]], the [[Yale (mythical creature)|yale]] of [[Duke of Beaufort|Beaufort]], the white lion of [[Mortimer]], the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|greyhound of Richmond]], the white [[Hart (deer)|hart]] of [[Richard II]], the collared silver [[antelope]] of [[Bohun family|Bohun]], the black dragon of [[Ulster]], the [[Bohun swan|white swan]] of [[Hereford]], the [[unicorn]] of Edward III and the golden [[Deer|hind]] of [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inel.wordpress.com/2008/07/06/windsor-royal-beasts-on-st-georges-chapel-roof/|title=Windsor Royal Beasts on St George's Chapel roof|publisher=Wordpress|access-date=10 October 2014}}</ref>

The original beasts dated from the sixteenth century, but were removed in 1682 on the advice of Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. Wren had criticised the [[Reigate]] stone, the calcareous sandstone from which they were constructed. The present statues date from 1925 when the chapel was restored.<ref name="London1953">{{cite book|last= London|first=H.

==Order of the Garter==
===Garter Service===
{{more|Order of the Garter}}
[[File:Order of the Garter 01.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Emblem of the Order of the Garter]] 
Members of the [[Order of the Garter]] meet at Windsor Castle every June for the annual Garter Service. After lunch in the State Apartments (Upper Ward of the Castle), they process on foot in their robes and insignia, down to St. George's Chapel for the service. If new members are to be admitted, they are installed at the service. After the service, the members of the order return to the Upper Ward by carriage or car.

[[File:St George's Chapel Garter Day.jpg|thumb|Members of the public outside St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, waiting for the Garter Procession]]
The Order frequently attended chapel services in the distant past, however they tailed off in the 18th century and were finally discontinued in 1805. The Garter Service was revived in 1948 by [[King George VI]] for the 600th anniversary of the founding of the Order and has since become an annual event.

===Heraldry===
[[File:St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle.jpg|thumb|Interior of the chapel]]
After their installation, members are each assigned a stall in the chapel [[choir (architecture)|choir]] above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed.

A member's sword is placed beneath a helmet which is decorated with a [[mantling]] and topped with a crest, [[coronet]] or crown. Above this, a member's heraldic [[banner]] is hoisted emblazoned with his [[Coat of arms|arms]]. A [[Garter stall plate]], a small elaborately enamelled plate of brass, is affixed to the back of the stall displaying its member's name and arms with other inscriptions.

On a member's death, the sword, helmet, mantling, crest, coronet or crown, and banner are removed. A service marking the death of a late member must be held before the stall can be assigned to anyone else. The ceremony takes place in the chapel, during which the [[Military Knights of Windsor]] carry the banner of the deceased member and offer it to the [[Dean of Windsor]], who places it on the altar.

The stall plates, however, are not removed. They remain permanently affixed to the stall, so the stalls of the chapel are emblazoned with a collection of plates of the members throughout history.

==Chantries==
[[File:Castell de Windsor - Capella de Sant Jordi.JPG|right|thumb|[[Fan vaulting]] of the [[Choir (architecture)|Choir]] of St George's Chapel, with the [[Order of the Garter|Garter banners]] on either side below.]]

St George's Chapel is among the most important medieval [[chantry]] foundations to have survived in England. The college was itself part of a medieval chantry, and there are a number of other chantry elements in the form of altars and small chapels in memory of various English monarchs and of a number of prominent courtiers, deans and canons. Special services and prayers would also be offered in memory of the founder. Henry VIII had originally intended another chantry to be set up in the chapel, despite the fact that his ecclesiastical changes led to the [[Reformation]] in England and the eventual suppression of chantries.

The much-admired iron gates in the sanctuary of the chapel as well as the locks on the doors of the chapel are the work of the medieval Cornish metalsmith [[John Tresilian]].<ref name="Blackburne2008">{{cite book|last=Blackburne|first=Harry W. |title=The Romance of St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=100X0MRhNLEC&pg=PA14|year=2008|publisher=Wildside Press|isbn=978-1-4344-7428-5|pages=14–}}</ref> The status of the college as a royal foundation saved it from dissolution at the Reformation. As a result, many of the smaller chantries within the chapel were preserved. These are the only remaining chantries of their kind in England which have never been suppressed.

===Rutland Chantry===
[[File:Anne of York and Sir Thomas St. Leger.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Monumental brass]] in St Leger Chantry to [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter]] (1439–1476) and her second husband [[Thomas St. Leger|Thomas St Leger]] (c.1440–1483), founder of the chapel]] 
The Rutland [[Chantry chapel]], forming the northern transept of St George's Chapel, was founded in 1491 in honour of Sir [[Thomas St. Leger|Thomas St Leger]] (c.1440–1483) and [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter]] (1439–1476).<ref name=CollStGeoWebsite>{{cite web|title=The Rutland Chantry|author=Eleanor Cracknell|publisher=College of St George|url=https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/the-rutland-chantry|date=15 July 2011|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> Sir Thomas was Anne's second husband. She was the eldest surviving daughter of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], and thus elder sister of kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] (1442–1483, reigned 1461–1483) and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] (1452–1485, reigned 1483–1485). A [[monumental brass]] in memory of Anne of York and Sir Thomas survives on the east wall of the Rutland Chantry, the inscription of which records that the chantry was founded "with two priests singing forevermore":
<blockquote>
"Wythin thys Chappell lyethe beryed Anne Duchess of Exetur suster unto the noble kyng Edward the forte. And also the body of syr Thomas Sellynger knyght her husband which hathe funde within thys College a Chauntre with too prestys sy’gyng for ev’more. On whose soule god have mercy. The wych Anne duchess dyed in the yere of oure lorde M Thowsande CCCCl xxv" 
</blockquote>

The chantry received its current name in honour of the [[Earl of Rutland|earls of Rutland]], descendants of Anne and Sir Thomas, their daughter, also Anne, married to [[George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros]] and their son, [[Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland]]. The tomb of George and Anne Manners is a prominent feature of the chantry. Their effigies are carved in English alabaster.<ref name=CollStGeoWebsite />

The chantry comprises five panels which represent the [[Annunciation]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Adoration of the Magi]], the [[Temptations of Christ]] in the wilderness and the [[Miracle at Cana]]. They were commissioned from embroiderer [[Beryl Dean]] and took five years to complete. Only one panel is normally on display to the public, but the others may be seen on request.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/news/beryl-dean-panels/|title=Beryl Dean Panels|website=College of St George|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref>
