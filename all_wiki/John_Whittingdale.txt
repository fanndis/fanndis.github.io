==Parliamentary career==
Whittingdale entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1992 as the MP for [[South Colchester and Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|South Colchester and Maldon]]. He was appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|PPS]] to [[Eric Forth]], Minister of State for Education and Employment but resigned, as is customary, after voting against the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] for an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Consideration of amendments|amendment]] that would have allowed media publishers with more than a 20% share of the national press market to buy an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/mary-ann-sieghart/mary-ann-sieghart-and-the-real-winners-will-be-2315447.html ''The Independent'' And the Real Winners Will Be...], 18 July 2011</ref>

He was later [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Culture, Media and Sport Secretary|Culture Secretary]] from 2004 until the [[reshuffle]] following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|general election in 2005]], at which he was returned as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Maldon and Chelmsford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon and Chelmsford East]]. In 2005, he was appointed to the Executive of [[Conservative Way Forward]], a [[Thatcherite]] [[Advocacy group|pressure group]] within the [Conservative Party. He is a council member of [[The Freedom Association]] and of the [[European Foundation (think tank)|European Foundation]]. In 2008, he was elected as a Parliamentary Member to the Board of the Conservative Party and Vice Chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary [[1922 Committee]]. In 2011, he was Chairman of the [[Football Governance Inquiry]]. In 2012, he was Chairman of the [[Joint Committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Joint Parliamentary Committee]] on Privacy and Injunctions. {{As of|2019|5}} he was Vice Chair of the [[All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allpartyipgroup.org.uk/activeMembers.html |title=Officers|website=All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group|accessdate= 15 May 2019}}</ref>

Whittingdale was among the 175 MPs who voted against the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|Same-sex Marriage Bill]] in 2013.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2013/feb/06/gay-marriage-vote-map-mp|title=Gay marriage how did your mp vote Map |publisher=guardian.com |date=6 February 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> In 2014, Whittingdale along with six other Conservative MPs voted against the [[Act of Parliament#Bills|Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill]] which would require all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/equal-pay-seven-male-tory-mps-vote-against-bill-to-make-big-companies-reveal-gender-pay-gap-9928964.html|title=Equal Pay: Seven male Tory MPs vote against bill to make big companies reveal gender pay gap |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=16 December 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>

He was in favour of [[Brexit]] during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU membership referendum]].<ref name="sacking"/> Following the referendum, which resulted in a narrow majority in favour of Brexit, he was one of several Conservative MPs who signed a letter to Theresa May urging that the UK withdraw from both the [[European Single Market]] and the [[European Union Customs Union|Customs Union]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Media Select Committee===
On 14 July 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04400.pdf|title=www.parliament.uk}}</ref> he became the Chairman of the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee]]. In this role he led the committee's 2009/2010 investigation into libel and privacy issues, including the [[News International phone hacking scandal]] after ''[[The Guardian]]'' first revealed the extent of the practice at the ''[[News of the World]]''. He was alleged to have warned members of the committee to consider not compelling former ''News of the World'' editor [[Rebekah Brooks]] to testify due to the potential risk that their personal lives would be investigated in revenge, but has strongly denied the accusation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielknowles/100097339/the-mps-who-will-take-on-the-murdochs |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=The MPs who will take on the Murdochs |date=18 July 2011}}</ref>

In April 2011 he called for a public inquiry into phone hacking at the ''News of the World'' and to why a series of investigations by [[Scotland Yard]] failed to link any [[News UK|News International]] employees to phone hacking other than the ''News of the World'''s former royal editor, [[Clive Goodman]]. Whittingdale said: "There are some very big questions; what I find [most] worrying is the apparent unwillingness of the police, who had the evidence and chose to do nothing with it. That's something that needs to be looked into."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/13/news-of-the-world-phone-hacking ''The Guardian'' report on hacking], 13 April 2011</ref>

With just one out of three of News International's senior executives agreeing to appear before the committee session on 19 July, Whittingdale took the rarely used step of issuing a [[summons]] to compel the [[Murdoch family|Murdochs]] to attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/Call-for-Rupert-Murdoch-James-Murdoch-and-Rebekah-Brooks-to-give-evidence|title=Committee calls Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks|work=UK Parliament}}</ref> Whittingdale said [[Select Committees]] had taken such steps against individuals in the past and they had complied and continued "I hope very much that the Murdochs will respond similarly."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/14/phone-hacking-rupert-murdoch-summonsed-appear-mps ''The Guardian'' report on hacking scandal], 14 July 2011.</ref> They both did, on 19 July, in what one [[newspaper|paper]] described as the most important Select Committee hearing in parliamentary history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/19/phone-hacking-rupert-murdoch-rebekah-brooks-mps |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Andrew |last1=Sparrow |first2=Paul |last2=Owen |first3=Matt |last3=Wells |title=Phone hacking: Murdochs and Rebekah Brooks face MPs |date=19 July 2011}}</ref>

For its successful work on the [[phone hacking scandal]], Whittingdale accepted ''[[The Spectator]]'''s 2011 "Inquisitor of the Year" award on behalf of the [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee|Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee]].

=== Funding and expenses ===
In 2012 Whittingdale received £8,000 for 32 hours' work as a [[non-executive director]] of Audio Network plc, an online music catalogue.<ref name=tw4y>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/john_whittingdale/maldon|title=John Whittingdale Conservative MP for Maldon|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> He was also reimbursed expenses for official visits to Yalta, Taiwan and Armenia.<ref name=tw4y/>

===Culture Secretary===
Whittingdale was sworn into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in May 2015 as [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/privy-council-appointments-may-2015|title=Privy Council appointments: May 2015|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref>

In April 2016, Shadow Culture Secretary [[Maria Eagle]] called for Whittingdale to recuse himself from decisions regarding the outcome of the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into press ethics because the story about Whittingdale's former girlfriend being a [[prostitution|sex worker]] exposed him to pressure from the press.<ref name=":0" /> A week later, it emerged that Whittingdale had accepted hospitality from the [[Lap Dancing Association]] in about 2008 at which time Whittingdale and two other MPs visited two clubs in one evening, while the industry's licensing was under investigation by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee. The hospitality was not declared in the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards|Register of members' interests]], or later when Whittingdale later spoke out in the Commons against new regulations introduced by the Labour government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Joseph|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/culture-secretary-john-whittingdale-caught-in-lapdance-club-row-a3228586.html|title=John Whittingdale caught in lapdance club row|work=London Evening Standard|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Oliver|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/john-whittingdale-admits-to-taking-free-dinner-with-performers-at-lapdance-club-a6991051.html|title=John Whittingdale admits to taking free dinner with performers at lapdance club|work=The Independent|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>

On 14 July 2016, Whittingdale was dismissed from his position as Culture Secretary by the new Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]].<ref name="sacking" />

In July 2016, shortly after his sacking, ''The Guardian'' criticised Whittingdale over his decision to turn down a request from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for the release of historic documents relating to [[Mark Thatcher]]'s dealings with the [[Oman|government of Oman]] in the 1980s. [[Roy Greenslade]] wrote that few, "apart from the man himself and his friends", could disagree with the argument that the public had a  right to know.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/21/why-should-files-on-mark-thatcher-and-profumo-remain-secret|title=Why should files on Mark Thatcher (and Profumo) remain secret?|work=The Guardian|author=Roy Greenslade|date=21 July 2016|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref>

Whittingdale returned to DCMS in February 2020, but as a Minister of State rather than Secretary of State.

==Personal life==
Whittingdale married Ancilla Campbell Murfitt, a nurse and school governor, in 1990; the couple had two (now adult) children before their divorce.<!-- No RS traced for 2007. --><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/candidates/candidates/3/39205.stm|title=Vote 2001: Candidate; John Whittingdale|website=BBC News|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/18/john-whittingdale-culture-secretary-bbc-rupert-murdoch|title=John Whittingdale, the horror fan putting the frighteners on the BBC|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> Whittingdale's half-brother is Charles Napier, former treasurer of the defunct  [[Paedophile Information Exchange]], who was most recently convicted of child sexual abuse offences in November 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11238339/Charles-Napier-admits-string-of-historic-sex-offences-against-boys.html|title=Charles Napier admits string of historic sex offences against boys|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 November 2014|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>

On 12 April 2016, British media reported Whittingdale had been involved in a relationship with a female sex worker between August 2013 and February 2014. In a statement to the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme, he said he had been unaware of his girlfriend's true occupation after meeting her through [[Match.com]], and that he had ended the relationship after he had discovered it through reports that the story was being offered for publication to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36031743|title=Minister John Whittingdale admits relationship with sex worker|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2016|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/12/minister-john-whittingdale-admits-relationship-with-sex-worker/|title=John Whittingdale had relationship with 'dominatrix'|author=Dominiczak, Peter|date=13 April 2016|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> On 13 April 2016, [[David Cameron]]'s spokesman said, "John Whittingdale's view was that this was in the past, and had been dealt with."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/pm-knew-nothing-about-whittingdale-story-until-10-days-ago-says-no-10|title=Whittingdale didn't tell PM about relationship with sex worker, No 10 says|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=13 April 2016|last2=Stewart|first2=Heather|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=13 April 2016}}</ref>
