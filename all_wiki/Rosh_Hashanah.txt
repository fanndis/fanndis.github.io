'''Rosh Hashanah''' ({{lang-he-n|רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה}}), literally meaning "head [of] the year", is the [[Jewish]] [[New Year]]. The [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] name for this holiday is '''Yom Teruah''' ({{Hebrew|יוֹם תְּרוּעָה}}), literally "day of shouting or blasting". It is the first of the Jewish [[High Holy Days]] ({{Hebrew|יָמִים נוֹרָאִים}} ''Yamim Nora'im''. "Days of Awe") specified by {{Bibleref2|Leviticus 23:23–32}} that occur in the early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere.

Rosh Hashanah is a two-day celebration that begins on the first day of [[Tishrei]], which is the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar#New year|ecclesiastical year]]. In contrast to the ecclesiastical year, where the first month [[Nisan]], the Passover month, marks Israel's exodus from Egypt, Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the civil year, according to the teachings of Judaism, and is the traditional anniversary of the creation of [[Adam and Eve]], the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, and the inauguration of humanity's role in God's world.

Rosh Hashanah customs include sounding the [[shofar]] (a cleaned-out ram's horn), as prescribed in the [[Torah]], following the prescription of the Hebrew Bible to "raise a noise" on ''Yom Teruah''. Its rabbinical customs include attending synagogue services and reciting special liturgy about [[teshuva]], as well as enjoying festive meals. Eating symbolic foods is now a tradition, such as apples dipped in honey, hoping to evoke a sweet new year.

==Etymology==
"Rosh" is the Hebrew word for "head", "ha" is the definite article ("the"), and "shanah" means year. Thus "Rosh HaShanah" means 'head [of] the year', referring to the Jewish day of new year.<ref name="Etym">{{cite web | title=rosh hashanah | website=Origin and meaning of phrase rosh hashanah by Online Etymology Dictionary | url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/rosh%20hashanah | access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><ref name=WHATIS>{{cite web | title=What Is Rosh Hashanah? – The Jewish New Year, anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, a day of judgment and coronation, and sounding of the shofar ... – High Holidays | website=Chabad Lubavitch | date=2019-08-27 | url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4762/jewish/What-Is-Rosh-Hashanah.htm | access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>

The term "Rosh Hashanah" in its current meaning does not appear in the [[Torah]]. {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:24|HE}} refers to the festival of the first day of the seventh month as ''zikhron teru'ah'' ("a memorial of blowing [of horns]"); it is also referred to in the same part of Leviticus as '{{Hebrew|שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹן}}' (''shabbat shabbaton'') or ultimate Sabbath or meditative rest day, and a "holy day to God". These same words are commonly used in the Psalms to refer to the anointed days. {{bibleverse||Numbers|29:1|HE}} calls the festival ''yom teru'ah'' ("day of blowing [the horn]"). The term ''rosh hashanah'' appears once in the Bible ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|40:1|HE}}), where it has a different meaning: either generally the time of the "beginning of the year", or possibly a reference to [[Yom Kippur]],<ref name="Jacobs">Jacobs, Louis. "Rosh Ha-Shanah." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 17. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. 463–66.</ref> or to the month of [[Nisan]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:2|HE}} refers to the month of [[Aviv]] (later renamed Nisan) as "the first month of the year", and in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:18|HE}} "the first month" unambiguously refers to Nisan, the month of [[Passover]], as made plain by {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:21|HE}}.</ref><ref name=Mulder>{{cite book|last=Mulder|first=Otto|title=Simon the High Priest in Sirach 50: An Exegetical Study of the Significance of Simon the High Priest As Climax to the Praise of the Fathers in Ben Sira's Concept of the History of Israel|year=2003|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004123168|page=170}}</ref>

In the Jewish prayer-books (i.e., the [[Siddur]] and [[Machzor]]), Rosh Hashanah is also called ''Yom Hazikaron'' (the day of remembrance),<ref name=WHATIS/> not to be confused with the [[Yom Hazikaron|modern Israeli remembrance day]] of the same name.

Rosh Hashanah marks the start of a new year in the Hebrew calendar (one of four "new year" observances that define various legal "years" for different purposes as explained in the [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Mishnah and Talmud]]).<ref name=WHATIS/> It is the new year for people, animals, and legal contracts. The [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Mishnah]] also sets this day aside as the new year for calculating calendar years, [[shmita]] and [[yovel]] years. Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of Man.<ref name=Chein>{{Cite web |last=Chein |first=Rochel |title=High Holidays |website=Why is Rosh Hashanah considered the Jewish New Year? |date=2019-08-27 |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/562052/jewish/Why-is-Rosh-Hashanah-considered-the-Jewish-New-Year.htm |access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>

==Origin==
The origin of the Hebrew New Year is connected to the beginning of the economic year in the agricultural societies of the [[ancient Near East]].<ref name=JewishEnc>{{Cite encyclopedia |authors=[[Isidore Singer]], J. F. McLaughlin, [[Wilhelm Bacher]], [[Julius Eisenstein|Judah David Eisenstein]] |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|title=New-Year |year=1901–1906 |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls |location=New York |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11499-new-year |access-date=2018-09-10 }}</ref> The New Year was the beginning of the cycle of sowing, growth, and harvest; the harvest was marked by its own set of major agricultural festivals.<ref name=JewishEnc/> The Semites generally set the beginning of the new year in autumn, while other ancient civilizations chose spring for that purpose, such as the [[History of Iran|Persians]] or [[ancient Greece|Greeks]]; the primary reason was agricultural in both cases, the time of sowing the seed and bringing in the harvest.<ref name=JewishEnc/>

In Jewish law, four major New Years are observed, each one marking a beginning of sorts. The lunar month [[Nisan]] (usually corresponding to the months March–April in the [[Gregorian calendar]]) is when a new year is added to the reign of Jewish kings, and it marks the start of the year for the three Jewish pilgrimages.<ref>[[Mishnah]], ''Rosh Hashanah'' 1:1</ref> Its injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: "This month shall be unto you ''the beginning'' of months" <small>(Exo. 12:2)</small>. However, ordinary years, [[Shmita|Sabbatical years]], [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilees]], and dates inscribed on legal deeds and contracts are reckoned differently; such years begin on the first day of the lunar month [[Tishri]] (usually corresponding to the months September–October in the Gregorian calendar). Their injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: "Three times in the year you shall keep a feast unto me… the feast of unleavened bread ([[Passover]])… the feast of harvest ([[Shavuot]])… and the feast of ingathering ([[Sukkot]]) which is ''at the departing of the year''" <small>(Exo. 23:14–16)</small>. "At the departing of the year" implies that the new year begins here.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]]; Poskim</ref>

The reckoning of Tishri as the beginning of the Jewish year began with the early Egyptians and was preserved by the Hebrew nation,<ref>Josephus writes in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (1.3.§ 3) concerning the "second month", when the flood of waters appeared in the days of Noah: "This calamity happened in the six-hundredth year of Noah's government, in the second month, called by the Macedonians ''Dius'', but by the Hebrews ''Marchesuan''; for so did they order their year in Egypt; but Moses appointed that ''Nisan'', which is the same with ''Xanthicus'', should be the first month for their festivals, because he brought them out of Egypt in that month: so that this month began the year as to all the solemnities they observed to the honour of God, '''although he preserved the original order of the months as to selling and buying, and other ordinary affairs'''."</ref> being also alluded to in the Hebrew Bible <small>(Genesis 7:11)</small> when describing the [[Great Deluge]] at the time of Noah. This began during the "second month" (''[[Marheshvan]]'') counting from Tishri, a view that has largely been accepted by the Sages of Israel.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Rosh Hashana'' 11b–12a; Rabbi Yehoshua says that the flood was in the second month counting from Nisan, but Rabbi Eliezer says that it was in the second month counting from Tishri, and the Sages agree with Rabbi Eliezer; [[Aramaic Targum]] of [[Pseudo-Jonathan|Pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel]] on Genesis 7:11: "In the six-hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, being the month of Marheshvan, for hitherto they did not count the [lunar] months except from Tishri, insofar that it is the New Year for the completion of the universe."</ref>

==Religious significance==
The [[Mishnah]] contains the second known reference to Rosh Hashanah as the "day of judgment" (''Yom haDin'').<ref>Tractate on Rosh Hashanah I,2</ref> In the Talmud [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|tractate on Rosh Hashanah]], it states that three books of account are opened on Rosh Hashanah, wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of the intermediate class are recorded. The names of the righteous are immediately inscribed in the [[book of life]] and they are sealed "to live". The intermediate class is allowed a respite of ten days, until Yom Kippur, to reflect, repent and become righteous;<ref>Tractate on Rosh Hashanah, I,16b</ref> the wicked are "blotted out of the book of the living forever".<ref>{{Bibleverse||Psalms|69:29|HE}}</ref>

Some [[midrash]]ic descriptions depict God as sitting upon a [[throne]], while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened for review, and each person passes in front of Him for evaluation of his or her deeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/rosh-hashanah-from-the-torah-to-the-temples/|title=Rosh Hashana from the Torah to the Temples|access-date=2020-09-17}}</ref>

"The Holy One said, 'on Rosh Hashanah recite before Me [verses of] Sovereignty, Remembrance, and Shofar blasts (''malchiyot, zichronot, shofrot''): Sovereignty so that you should make Me your King; Remembrance so that your remembrance should rise up before Me. And through what? Through the Shofar.' (Rosh Hashanah 16a, 34b)"<ref>ArtScroll Machzor, Rosh Hashanah. Overview, p. xv.</ref>

This is reflected in the prayers composed by classical rabbinic sages for Rosh Hashanah found in traditional Ashkenazi [[machzor]]im where the theme of the prayers is the "coronation" of God as King of the universe, in preparation for the acceptance of judgments that will follow on that day.

==Shofar blowing==
{{main|Shofar blowing}}
[[File:Jemenittisk sjofar av kuduhorn.jpg|250px|right|thumb| [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite-style shofar]]]]
[[File:The National Library of Israel - Shofar Prayer, Ashkenazi version - 1785188 SHOFAR78.ogg|thumb|Shofar blowing for Rosh Hashana, Ashkenaz version]]
The best-known ritual of Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the [[shofar]], a musical instrument made from an animal horn. The shofar is blown at various instances during the Rosh Hashanah prayers, with a total of 100 blasts over the day.<ref name="chabad100">{{cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4387/jewish/100-Sounds.htm |title=One Hundred Sounds |first=Rabbi Eliyahu |last=Kitov |access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref>

While the blowing of the shofar is a Biblical statute, it is also a symbolic "wake-up call", stirring Jews to mend their ways and repent. The shofar blasts call out: "Sleepers, wake up from your slumber! Examine your ways and repent and remember your Creator."<ref>''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Laws of Repentance 3:4.</ref>

==Prayer service==
On Rosh Hashanah day, religious poems called ''[[piyyut]]im'', are added to the regular [[Jewish prayer services|services]]. A special prayer book, the [[mahzor]] (plural ''mahzorim''), is used on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.<ref name="Shurpin 2019">{{cite web | last=Shurpin | first=Yehuda | title=Why Is the High Holiday Prayerbook Called a "Machzor"? – Questions & Answers | website=Chabad Lubavitch | date=Sep 25, 2019 | url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4114669/jewish/Why-Is-the-High-Holiday-Prayerbook-Called-a-Machzor.htm | access-date=Sep 29, 2019}}</ref> A number of additions are made to the regular service, most notably an extended repetition of the [[Amidah]] prayer for both [[Shacharit]] and [[Mussaf]].

Biblical verses are recited at each point. According to the [[Mishnah]], ten verses (each) are said regarding kingship, remembrance, and the shofar itself, each accompanied by the blowing of the shofar. A variety of ''[[piyyut]]im'', medieval penitential prayers, are recited regarding themes of repentance. The ''Alenu'' prayer is recited during the repetition of the Mussaf [[Amidah]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gold|first=Ave|title=Rosh Hashanah – Its Significance, Laws, and Prayers : Presentation Anthologized from Talmudic Traditional Sources|publisher=Mesorah Publications|year=1983|isbn=978-0899061955|location=Brooklyn|pages=101}}</ref>

The [[Mussaf]] [[Amidah]] prayer on Rosh Hashanah is unique in that apart from the first and last three blessings, it contains three central blessings making a total of nine. These blessings are entitled "Malchuyot" (Kingship, and also includes the blessing for the holiness of the day as is in a normal Mussaf), "Zichronot" (Remembrance), and "Shofarot" (concerning the Shofar). Each section contains an introductory paragraph followed by selections of verses about the "topic". The verses are three from the [[Torah]], three from the [[Ketuvim]], three from the [[Nevi'im]], and one more from the Torah. During the repetition of the Amidah, the [[Shofar]] is sounded (except on Shabbat) after the blessing that ends each section.<ref name="MyJewishLearning2003">{{cite web | title=Rosh Hashanah Musaf Amidah | website=My Jewish Learning | date=Feb 17, 2003 | url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/rosh-hashanah-musaf-amidah/ | access-date=Sep 29, 2019}}</ref> Recitation of these three blessings is first recorded in the [[Mishna]],<ref>Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 4:5–6</ref> though writings by [[Philo]] and possibly even {{Bibleverse|Psalms|81|HE}} suggest that the blessings may have been recited on Rosh Hashanah even centuries earlier.<ref>Hoenig, Sidney B.

==Customs==
===Days before Rosh Hashanah===
Rosh Hashanah is preceded by the month of [[Elul]], during which Jews are supposed to begin a self-examination and repentance, a process that culminates in the ten days of the ''Yamim Nora'im'', the Days of Awe, beginning with Rosh Hashanah and ending with the holiday of [[Yom Kippur]].<ref name=elul>{{cite web | title=The Month of Elul – Inventory Season – Mitzvah Minutes | website=Chabad Lubavitch | date=Sep 25, 2019 | url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/706431/jewish/Elul.htm | access-date=Sep 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The High Holidays – Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur – Yamim Nora'im (Days of Awe) or High Holy Days | website=Chabad Lubavitch | date=Sep 25, 2019 | url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/36130/jewish/High-Holidays.htm | access-date=Sep 29, 2019}}</ref>

The ''shofar'' is traditionally blown each morning for the entire month of [[Elul]], the month preceding Rosh Hashanah. The sound of the ''shofar'' is intended to awaken the listeners from their "slumbers" and alert them to the coming judgment.<ref name="ReferenceB">[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah|Yad]]'', Laws of Repentance 3:4</ref><ref name=elul/>
The shofar is not blown on [[Shabbat]].<ref>[[Halakha|Jewish Law]] permits the Shofar to be blown in the presence of a rabbinical court called the [[Sanhedrin]], which had not existed since ancient times. A recent group of Orthodox rabbis in [[Israel]] claiming to constitute a [[Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin|modern Sanhedrin]] held, for the first time in many years, an Orthodox shofar-blowing on Shabbat for Rosh Hashanah in 2006.

In the period leading up to Rosh Hashanah, penitential prayers called ''[[selichot]]'', are recited. The Sephardic tradition is to start at the beginning of Elul, while the Ashkenazi practice is to start a few days before Rosh Hashanah.<ref name=elul/>

The day before Rosh Hashanah day is known as ''Erev Rosh Hashanah'' ("Rosh Hashanah eve").<ref name="The Forward 2014">{{cite web | title=What Do We Mean by 'Erev Rosh Hashanah?' | website=The Forward | date=2014-09-24 | url=https://forward.com/culture/206201/what-do-we-mean-by-erev-rosh-hashanah/ | access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref> It is the 29th day of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]], ending at sundown, when Rosh Hashanah commences.

In many cases, the name of the food in Hebrew or Aramaic represents a play on words (a pun). The Yehi Ratzon platter may include apples (dipped in honey, baked or cooked as a compote called ''mansanada''); dates; pomegranates; black-eyed peas; pumpkin-filled pastries called ''rodanchas''; leek fritters called ''keftedes de prasa''; beets; and a whole fish with the head intact. It is also common to eat stuffed vegetables called ''legumbres yaprakes''.<ref>Sternberg, Robert ''The Sephardic Kitchen: The Healthful Food and Rich Culture of the Mediterranean Jews'', Harper Collins, 1996, pp. 320–21, {{ISBN|0-06-017691-1}}</ref>

Some of the symbolic foods eaten are [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[leek]], [[spinach]] and [[gourd]], all of which are mentioned in the [[Talmud]]:<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Keritot'' 6a)</ref> "Let a man be accustomed to eat on New Year's Day gourds (קרא), and fenugreek (רוביא),<ref>[[Rashi]] (ibid.) calls ''rubia'' by its Hebrew name "tiltan" (Heb. תלתן), which word he explains elsewhere as being [[fenugreek]]. However, Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]], in one of his ''responsum'' in "Otzar Ha-Geonim", seems to suggest that ''"rubia"'' (Heb. רוביא) means cowpeas, or what others call, "black-eyed peas" (פול המצרי). Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s disciple, Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob]] (in his Commentary known as ''Ketav Hamafteah''), thus explains the word לוביא, in our case spelled רוביא, as meaning non-other than cowpeas (פול המצרי), describing them as having a "dark eye in its center". Jews of North-Africa traditionally make use of stringed beans in place of ''rubia''.</ref> leeks (כרתי), beet [leaves] (סילקא), and dates (תמרי).”

===Tashlikh===
{{main|Tashlikh}}
[[File:Aleksander Gierymski, Święto Trąbek I.jpg|thumb|[[Hasidic Jew]]s performing [[tashlikh]] on Rosh Hashanah, painting by [[Aleksander Gierymski]], 1884]]

The ritual of [[tashlikh]] is performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah by Ashkenazic and most Sephardic Jews (but not by Spanish and Portuguese Jews or some Yemenites). Prayers are recited near natural flowing water, and one's sins are symbolically cast into the water. Many also have the custom to throw bread or pebbles into the water, to symbolize the "casting off" of sins. In some communities, if the first day of Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbat, ''tashlikh'' is postponed until the second day. The traditional service for ''tashlikh'' is recited individually and includes the prayer "Who is like unto you, O God...And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea", and Biblical passages including {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|11:9|HE}} ("They will not injure nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be as full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea") and {{Bibleverse-lb||Psalms|118:5–9|HE}}, {{Bibleverse||Psalms|121|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Psalms|130|HE}}, as well as personal prayers. Though once considered a solemn individual tradition, it has become an increasingly social ceremony practiced in groups. Tashlikh can be performed any time until [[Hoshana Rabba]], and some [[Hasidic]] communities perform Tashlikh on the day before [[Yom Kippur]].<ref name="Kumer 2019">{{cite web | last=Kumer | first=Dinka | title=What is Tashlich? – High Holidays | website=Chabad Lubavitch | date=Sep 25, 2019 | url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/564247/jewish/What-is-Tashlich.htm | access-date=Sep 29, 2019}}</ref>

===Greetings===
The [[Hebrew]] common [[Jewish greetings|greeting]] on Rosh Hashanah is ''Shanah Tovah'' ({{lang-he-n|שנה טובה}}; {{IPA-he|ʃaˈna toˈva|pron}}), which translated from Hebrew means "[have a] good year".<ref name="ChabadGreetingTranslation">{{cite web |url= https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/174683/jewish/New-Year-Greetings-Explained.htm |title= What Is Shanah Tovah?

A more formal greeting commonly used among religiously observant Jews is ''Ketivah VaChatimah Tovah'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|כְּתִיבָה וַחֲתִימָה טוֹבָה}}), which translates as "A good inscription and sealing [in the Book of Life]",<ref name="ChabadGreetingTranslation"/> or ''L'shanah tovah tikatevu v'tichatemu'' meaning "May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year".<ref name="JewishJournalGreetings"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Jewish-Holiday-Greetings.html |title=Jewish Holiday Greeting Chart |publisher=Patheos.com |date=July 26, 2012 |access-date=2018-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926072004/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Jewish-Holiday-Greetings.html |archive-date=September 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After Rosh Hashanah ends, the greeting is changed to ''G’mar chatimah tovah'' (Hebrew: {{hebrew|גמר חתימה טובה}}) meaning "A good final sealing", until [[Yom Kippur]].<ref name="ChabadGreetingTranslation"/> After Yom Kippur is over, until [[Hoshana Rabbah]], as [[Sukkot]] ends, the greeting is ''Gmar Tov'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|גְּמָר טוֹב}}), "a good conclusion".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Sol |title=Dictionary of Jewish Usage: A Guide to the Use of Jewish Terms |date=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=978-0742543874 |page=53}}</ref>

===In Karaite Judaism===
Unlike the denominations of Rabbinical Judaism, [[Karaite Judaism]] believes the Jewish New Year starts with the first month and celebrates this holiday only as it is mentioned in the Torah, that is as a day of rejoicing and shouting.<ref name="Kar">{{cite web|url=http://www.nehemiaswall.com/yom-teruah-day-shouting-became-rosh-hashanah |title=How Yom Teruah Became Rosh Hashanah |publisher=Nehemia's Wall |date=September 26, 2014 |access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> Additionally, Karaites believe the adoption of the name "Rosh Hashanah" in place of Yom Teruah "is the result of pagan Babylonian influence upon the Jewish nation,<ref name="Kar"/> that began during the Babylonian exile with the adoption of the Babylonian month names instead of the numbering present in the Torah (Leviticus 23; Numbers 28).<ref name="Kar"/> Karaites allow no work on the day except what is needed to prepare food (Leviticus 23:23, 24).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.karaites.org/karaite-customs-and-traditons.html |title=Karaite Jews of America |publisher=The Karaite Jews of America |access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>

===In Samaritanism===
[[Samaritans]] preserve the biblical name of the holiday, ''Yom Teruah'', and do not consider the day to be a [[New Year]]'s day.<ref name="Israelite Samaritan Information">{{cite web | title=Festival 2016: Seven Festivals Celebrated in the Israelite Samaritan Year | website=Israelite Samaritan Information Institute | date=2012-10-21 | url=https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/festival/ | access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>

==Duration and timing==
{{see also|Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000–2050}}
The Torah defines Rosh Hashanah as a one-day celebration, and since days in the Hebrew calendar begin at sundown, the beginning of Rosh Hashanah is at sundown at the end of 29 [[Elul]]. Since the time of the destruction of the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE and the time of Rabban [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]], [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] Jewish law appears to be that Rosh Hashanah is to be celebrated for two days, because of the difficulty of determining the date of the [[new moon]].<ref name="Jacobs"/> Nonetheless, there is some evidence that Rosh Hashanah was celebrated on a single day in Israel as late as the thirteenth century [[Common Era|CE]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/list-articles/47-hagim-articles/756-rosh-hashana-in-israel-one-day-or-two|title = Rosh HaShanna in Israel: One Day or Two?|access-date=2018-09-10|author = Rav David Bar-Hayim|work = Machon Shilo website|publisher = Machon Shilo|location = [[Jerusalem]]|quote = Includes link for Audio Shiur in English }}</ref>

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] now generally observe Rosh Hashanah for the first two days of [[Tishrei]], even in [[Israel]] where all other Jewish holidays dated from the new moon last only one day. The two days of Rosh Hashanah are said to constitute "''Yoma Arichtah''" (Aramaic: "''one'' long day"). In [[Reform Judaism]], while most congregations in North America observe only the first day of Rosh Hashanah, some follow the traditional two-day observance as a sign of solidarity with other Jews worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/practice/ask-rabbi/do-reform-jews-celebrate-one-or-two-days-rosh-hashanah|title=Do Reform Jews Celebrate One or Two Days of Rosh HaShanah?|date=August 21, 2013|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]], who do not recognize Rabbinic [[oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Jewish oral law]] and rely on their own understanding of the Torah, observe only one day on the first of Tishrei, since the second day is not mentioned in the [[Written Torah]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenspoon|first=Leonard Jay|title=Rites of Passage: How Today's Jews Celebrate, Commemorate, and Commiserate|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1557535771|location=West Lafayette, IN|page=144}}</ref>

===Date===

Originally, the date of Rosh Hashanah was determined based on observation of the new moon ("[[molad]]"), and thus could fall out on any day of the week. However, around the third century CE, the [[Hebrew calendar]] was fixed, such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah never falls out on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday.<ref name=":10">Tractate Rosh Hashanah 20a</ref><ref>A popular [[mnemonic]] is "''lo adu rosh''" ("Rosh [Hashanah] is not on ''adu''"), where ''adu'' has the [[gematria|numerical value]] 1-4-6 (corresponding to the numbering of days in the Jewish week, in which Saturday night and Sunday daytime make up the first day).</ref>

Rosh Hashanah occurs 163 days after the first day of [[Passover]], and thus is usually (but not always) determined by the new moon closest to the [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]].

In terms of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the earliest date on which Rosh Hashanah can fall is September 5, as happened in 1842, 1861, 1899, and 2013. The latest Gregorian date that Rosh Hashanah can occur is October 5, as happened in 1815, 1929, and 1967, and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Rosh Hashanah falling no earlier than September 6. Starting in 2214, the new latest date will be October 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oztorah.com/2010/07/an-early-rosh-hashanah-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=An early Rosh HaShanah? – Ask the Rabbi |publisher=Oztorah.com |access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>
