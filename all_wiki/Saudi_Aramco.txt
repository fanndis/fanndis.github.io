==History==
Saudi Aramco's origins trace to the oil shortages of [[World War&nbsp;I]] and the exclusion of American companies from [[Mesopotamia]] by the United Kingdom and France under the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Petroleum Agreement]] of 1920.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conference of San Remo|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521598/Conference-of-San-Remo|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227212355/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521598/Conference-of-San-Remo|archive-date=27 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The US administration at the time had popular support for an "[[Open Door policy]]", which [[Herbert Hoover]], secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. [[Standard Oil of California]] (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Owen|first=E.W.|title=Trek of the Oil Finders: A History of Exploration for Petroleum|year=1975|publisher=AAPG|location=Tulsa|pages=1290–93}}</ref>

Through its subsidiary company,   the [[Bahrain Petroleum Company|Bahrain Petroleum Co.]] (BAPCO), SoCal struck oil in [[Bahrain]] in May 1932. This event heightened interest in the oil prospects of the Arabian mainland. On 29 May 1933, the Saudi Arabian government granted a concession to SoCal in preference to a rival bid from the [[Iraq Petroleum Company|Iraq Petroleum Co.]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Yergin|first=Daniel|title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1439110126|pages=265–74}}</ref> The concession allowed SoCal to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia. SoCal assigned this concession to a wholly owned [[subsidiary]], California-Arabian Standard Oil (CASOC). In 1936, with the company having had no success at locating oil, the [[Texaco|Texas Oil Co.]] (Texaco) purchased a 50% stake of the concession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/igpr/APAG/apagoilhistory.html|title=Oil Company Histories|publisher=Virginia University|accessdate=9 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806170827/http://www.virginia.edu/igpr/APAG/apagoilhistory.html|archive-date=6 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> After four years of fruitless exploration, the first success came with the seventh drill site in [[Dhahran]] in 1938, a well referred to as ''Dammam No. 7''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196301/seven.wells.of.dammam.htm|title=Seven Wells Of Dammam|website=Saudi Aramco World|access-date=23 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224160902/http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196301/seven.wells.of.dammam.htm|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This well immediately produced over {{convert|1500|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, giving the company confidence to continue.

In 1950, [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]] threatened to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] his country's oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHfVWjHAjCoC&pg=PA108|title=From Arab Nationalism to OPEC: Eisenhower, King Saʻūd, and the making of U.S-Saudi relations|work=Nathan J.

A similar process had taken place with American oil companies in [[Venezuela]] a few years earlier.

In 1975, the Saudi Arabia second five-year economic plan included a Master Gas Plan. Natural gas would be used to generate power, rather than [[gas flare|flaring the gas]]. The plan counted on using the [[associated gas]], but by 1985, Aramco was able to include a billion [[standard cubic foot]] per day (Bscfd) of non-associated gas. This non-associated gas was produced from the Kuff [[formation (geology)|Formation]], which is a [[limestone]] 650 m below the oil producing Arab Zone. In 1994, Aramco discovered more non-associated gas in the deeper Jawf [[sandstone]] formation, and built plants in Hawiyah and [[Haradh]] to process it. This increased the capacity of the Master Gas System to 9.4 billion scfd.<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|98–100,104,129–130,229}}

In 1973, following US support for Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]], the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% "participation interest" in Aramco's assets. It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974 and acquired the remaining 40% interest in 1976. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a [[royal decree]] created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)<ref name=se25>{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/timelineInfo.xml|publisher=Saudi Embassy|accessdate=25 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226175236/http://www.saudiembassy.net/timelineInfo.xml|archive-date=26 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners.

In Sept. 1990, after the start of the [[Gulf War]], Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition]] aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, [[Khurais oil field|Khurais]], and Ghawar oil wells with associated [[gas oil separation plant]]s, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been mothballed during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in Dec. 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort.<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|125,135,148–149,155–156}}

Starting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted. By 2016, about 70% of Aramco's crude oil sales were to Asia.<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|168,176,184–185}}

In May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming 3 joint ventures with 8 [[International Oil Company|IOCs]] for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage. Core Venture 1 included south Ghawar and north [[Rub' Al-Khali]], Core Venture 2 included the [[Red Sea]], while Core Venture 3 involved [[Shaybah]] and Kidan. In 2003, [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Total S.A.]] formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3. In 2004, Core Venture 1 became three separate joint ventures with Saudi Aramco holding 20%, one with [[Lukoil]], a second with [[Sinopec]], and a third with [[Repsol]].<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|228–232}}

By 2004, Aramco was producing 8.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) out of a potential 10 mbpd. In 2005, Aramco launched a five-year plan to spend $50 billion to increase their daily capacity to 12.5 mbpd by increasing production and refining capacity and doubling the number of drilling rigs.<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|241–242}}

In 2005, Saudi Aramco was the world's largest company with an estimated market value of $781 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5de6ef96-8b95-11db-a61f-0000779e2340.html|title=Financial Times Non-public Top 150|work=Financial Times|accessdate=23 September 2012|date=14 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006152315/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5de6ef96-8b95-11db-a61f-0000779e2340.html|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding $130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in Jan. 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd.<ref name=Ali/>{{rp|265–267}}

In 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-26/saudi-aramco-starts-production-from-karan-gas-field-in-july-1-.html|newspaper=Bloomberg|first=Anthony|last=DiPaola|title=Saudi Aramco Starts Production From Karan Gas Field in July|date=26 July 2011|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006211458/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-26/saudi-aramco-starts-production-from-karan-gas-field-in-july-1-.html|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Global Medium Term Note Programme===

Saudi Aramco announced hiring international banks to accomplish a multi-tranche U.S. dollar-denominated bond issuance on 16 November 2020. The announcement was made by the oil company on the lookout for cash following low oil prices and the impact of the [[coronavirus]] crisis. According to a bourse filing made by Aramco, the like of [[Goldman Sachs]], [[HSBC]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[JPMorgan]], and NCB Capital were hired by the company for organizing investor calls prior to the planned transaction. The document published by one of the other banks said to be involved in the deal showed that the deal included BNP Paribas, MUFG, BofA Securities, SMBC Nikko, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Societe Generale, and BOC International.

===Refining and chemicals===
While the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country's oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in [[Petron Corporation]], the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country.<ref name="aramcoaboutus"/> In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57 percent of Petron's stock. Ashmore's payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40% stake. In the same month, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1 percent of Petron. In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation.

==Saudization==
The original concession agreement included Article 23; as [[Ali Al-Naimi]] pointed out, this was a "key building block in the shaping of Saudi society for decades to come." It reads, "The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the company can find suitable Saudi employees it will not employ other nationals." The first company school was started in May 1940 in the Al-Khobar home of Hijji bin Jassim, company interpreter, translator and first instructor. Al-Naimi pointed out, "From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia." Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7&nbsp;AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. In 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in Nov. 1983. As Al-Naimi states, "The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals." Al-Naimi acknowledged [[Thomas Barger]]'s championing of Saudization, "You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort." In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. In 1988, Al-Naimi became [[CEO]] and [[Hisham Nazer]] became [[chairman]], the first Saudis to hold those positions. The "pinnacle of Saudization" occurred when the [[Shaybah]] oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an [[expatriate]] workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, "be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise."<ref name="Ali">{{cite book|last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali|title=Out of the Desert|date=2016|publisher=Portfolio Penguin|location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250|pages=14, 26–28, 50–51, 76, 93, 109–110, 119, 122–123, 129, 143, 222}}</ref>

Saudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic [[CO2 emissions|{{CO2}} emissions]] since 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions|title=Revealed: the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions|accessdate=5 May 2020|website=The Guardian|date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

In a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its $2tn market debut, 10 green groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the fight against [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and [[human rights]] abuses committed by the Saudi regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/banks-warned-over-saudi-aramco-by-environmental-groups|title=Banks warned over Saudi Aramco by environmental groups|accessdate=17 October 2019|website=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017053905/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/banks-warned-over-saudi-aramco-by-environmental-groups|archive-date=17 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 6 November 2019, Saudi Aramco joined the [[World Bank]]'s initiative to reduce [[gas flare|gas flaring]] to zero by 2030. The firm reported flaring of less than 1 per cent of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://africazine.com/saudi-aramco-joins-initiative-to-reduce-flaring-to-zero-by-2030/|title=Saudi Aramco joins initiative to reduce flaring to zero by 2030|accessdate=6 November 2019|website=Africazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107135509/https://africazine.com/saudi-aramco-joins-initiative-to-reduce-flaring-to-zero-by-2030/|archive-date=7 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
