'''Kovin''' ({{Lang-sr-Cyrl|Ковин}}) is a town and municipality located in the [[South Banat District]] of the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]], Serbia. The town has a population of 13,515, while the municipality has 33,722 inhabitants.

In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the town is known as '''Cuvin''', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as '''Kevevára''' or (until 1899) '''Temeskubin''', and in [[German language|German]] as '''Kubin''' or '''Temeschkubin'''.  In the past, the town was also known as '''Donji Kovin''' ("lower Kovin") in contrast to the town with same name in [[Hungary]] that was known in Serbian as ''[[Ráckeve|Gornji Kovin]]'' ("upper Kovin") and in Hungarian as ''Ráckeve'' ("the Serb Kovin").

== History ==
The [[Dacians|Dacian]] tribe of [[Albocenses]] dwelled in this area in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Ptolemy's Geographia</ref> There are remains of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[fortress]] called ''[[Contra Margum]]'', opposite to the [[Margum Dubravica|Margum]], a fortress on the other side of the Danube. In the 9th and 10th centuries, this area was populated by [[Slavs]] and [[Romanians]]<ref>Anonymus, Gesta Hungarorum, Mentor Publishers,2000, p.120, {{ISBN|973-98955-9-X}}</ref> and [[Voivode]] [[Glad (duke)|Glad]] ruled over the region. Glad was defeated by the [[Hungarians]], and the area was included into the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In the 11th century, one of the descendants of Glad, [[Ahtum]], ruled over the region but he, too, was defeated by the Hungarians.

The earliest mention of the settlement was in 1071 as ''Keuee''. Kovin is mentioned in the 12th century as a seat of the county, which included most of the western [[Banat]]. Since the 14th century, the city has had a large [[Serbs|Serb]] population that escaped there from [[Serbia]] under threat by the [[Ottomans]]. The Serbian despot [[Lazar Branković]] took control over the city in 1457, but in the next year it came again under control of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the 16th century, the city was included in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and became a part of the Ottoman [[Temeşvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Temeşvar]]. During the Ottoman rule (16th-17th century), Kovin was mostly populated by ethnic [[Serbs]]. In 1716, it became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and belonged to the Habsburg [[Banat of Temeswar]] until 1751 when it became part of the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]] ([[Banat Krajina]]).

In 1848/1849, Kovin was part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]], but in 1849 it was again placed under administration of the Military Frontier. With the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1873, Kovin was incorporated into [[Temes County|Temes county]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. According to the 1910 census, Kovin District had a population of 35,482, of whom 21,795 spoke [[Serbian language|Serbian]], 6,587 [[German language|German]], 5,705 [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and 5,355 [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060309202200/http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Temes “Temes County”], talmamedia.com.</ref>

This town had a significant role in the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Wien>Manfried, Rauchensteiner.  ''The First World War and the End of the Habsburg Monarchy, 1914-1918'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEpLBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127 p. 27] ([[Böhlau Verlag]], Vienna, 2014).</ref>  In July 1914, a purported military skirmish here was a proximate cause of the declaration of war against Serbia by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], but the report of such skirmish was apparently false, or greatly exaggerated.<ref name=Wien />

In 1918, Kovin became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1929). Between 1918 and 1922, it was part of Banat county; between 1922 and 1929 part of the Podunavska oblast; and between 1929 and 1941 part of the [[Danube Banovina]]. Between 1941 and 1944, Kovin was under [[Axis Powers|Axis]] occupation and was part of the autonomous [[Banat]] region within [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]]-[[Serbia|occupied Serbia]]. The town was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944.<ref>[http://www.danas.rs/20040417/vikend3.html Serbs were not specially chosen as targets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725135730/http://www.danas.rs/20040417/vikend3.html |date=2011-07-25 }}, [[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]</ref> In 1945, it became part of the Socialist Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] within the Socialist Republic of [[Serbia]] and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In 1992, Kovin became part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was in 2003 transformed into the state union of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. Since 2006, the town is part of an independent [[Serbia]].
