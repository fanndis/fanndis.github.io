'''Christian Science''' is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the [[#Metaphysical family|metaphysical family]] of [[new religious movement]]s.{{refn|group=n|name=Saliba2003p26}} It was developed in 19th-century [[New England]] by [[Mary Baker Eddy]], who argued in her 1875 book ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|Science and Health]]'' that sickness is an illusion that can be [[faith healing|corrected by prayer]] alone.{{refn|group=n|The book was called ''Science and Health with a Key to the Scriptures'' from 1883, when a 20-page glossary was added containing Eddy's definitions of biblical terms.

Several periods of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] revival nurtured a proliferation of new religious movements in the United States.<ref>[[William G. McLoughlin]], ''Revivals, Awakenings, and Reform'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980, pp.&nbsp;10–11, 16–17.{{pb}}

[[Charles S.

The term ''metaphysical'' referred to the movement's philosophical [[idealism]], a belief in the primacy of the mental world.{{refn|group=n|John K. Simmons, 1995: "The broad descriptive term 'metaphysical' is not used in a manner common to the trained philosopher. Instead, it denotes the primacy of Mind as ''the'' controlling factor in human experience. At the heart of the metaphysical perspective is the theological/ontological affirmation that God is perfect Mind and human beings, in reality, exist in a state of eternal manifestation of that Divine Mind."<ref>Simmons 1995, p.&nbsp;61.</ref>}} Adherents believed that material phenomena were the result of mental states, a view expressed as "life is consciousness" and "God is mind." The supreme cause was referred to as [[Absolute (philosophy)|Divine Mind]], Truth, God, Love, Life, Spirit, Principle or Father–Mother, reflecting elements of [[Platonism|Plato]], [[Hindu idealism|Hinduism]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Emanuel Swedenborg|Swedenborg]], and [[transcendentalism]].<ref>Dell De Chant, "The American New Thought Movement," in Eugene Gallagher and Michael Ashcraft (eds.),  ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Company, 2007, pp.&nbsp;81–82.</ref><ref>[[William James]], ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (Gifford Lectures, Edinburgh), New York: Longmans, Green, & Co, 1902, pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AezbiIYHssC&pg=PA75 75–76]; [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/412169/New-Thought "New Thought"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 2014.</ref>

The metaphysical groups became known as the mind-cure movement because of their strong focus on healing.<ref>de Chant 2007, p.&nbsp;73.</ref>{{refn|group=n|[[William James]], 1902: "To my mind a current far more important and interesting religiously&nbsp;...

The central figure and prophet of the emerging synthesis was Phineas P. Quimby, 'the John the Baptist of Christian Science,' whose faith-healing work began in 1838. Quimby and his followers taught the overwhelming importance of thought in shaping reality, a message that was crucial for healing. If disease existed only as thought, then only by curing the mind could the body be set right: disease was a matter of wrong belief."<ref>[[Philip Jenkins]], ''Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History'', Oxford University Press, 2000, pp.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/details/mysticsmessiahsc00phil/page/53 53–54].</ref>}} [[Mary Baker Eddy]] had been a patient of his, [[#Eddy's debt to Quimby|leading to debate]] about how much of Christian Science was based on his ideas.<ref name=Simmons1995p64 />

Christian Science leaders place their religion within mainstream Christian teaching, according to [[J. Gordon Melton]], and reject any identification with the New Thought movement.{{refn|group=n|name=Melton1992p36}} Eddy was strongly influenced by her [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] upbringing.<ref>Catherine Albanese, ''A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007, p.&nbsp;284.</ref> According to the church's tenets, adherents accept "the inspired Word of the Bible as [their] sufficient guide to eternal Life&nbsp;... acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God&nbsp;... [and] acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness."<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;121; Eddy, ''Manual of the Mother Church'', pp.&nbsp;15–16.</ref> When founding the Church of Christ, Scientist, in April 1879, Eddy wrote that she wanted to "reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing".<ref name=lostelement /> Later she suggested that Christian Science was a kind of [[second coming]] and that ''[[Science and Health]]'' was an [[Biblical inspiration|inspired text]].{{refn|group=n|[[Mary Baker Eddy]], 1891: "The second appearing of Jesus is, unquestionably, the spiritual advent of the advancing idea of God, as in Christian Science."<ref>Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', The First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1891, p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/retrospectionint00eddy#page/70/mode/1up 70].</ref>{{pb}}
Eddy, January 1901: "I should blush to write of ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures'' as I have, were it of human origin, and I, apart from God, its author. But, as I was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of heaven in divine metaphysics, I cannot be super-modest in my estimate of the Christian Science textbook."<ref>Eddy, ''Christian Science Journal'', January 1901, reprinted in "The Christian Science Textbook," ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', Boston: Alison V. Stewart, 1914, p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/firstchurchchri04eddygoog#page/n143/mode/1up 115].</ref>}}<ref>David L. Weddle, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1510020 "The Christian Science Textbook: An Analysis of the Religious Authority of Science and Health by Mary Baker Eddy"], ''The Harvard Theological Review'', 84(3), 1991, p.&nbsp;281; Gottschalk 1973, p.&nbsp;xxi.</ref> In 1895, in the ''Manual of the Mother Church'', she ordained the Bible and ''Science and Health'' as "Pastor over the Mother Church".<ref>Eddy, ''Manual of the Mother Church'', p.&nbsp;58; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1510020 Weddle 1991], p.&nbsp;273.</ref>

Christian Science theology differs in several respects from that of traditional Christianity. Eddy's ''Science and Health'' reinterprets key Christian concepts, including the [[Trinity]], divinity of [[Jesus]], [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; beginning with the 1883 edition, she added ''with a Key to the Scriptures'' to the title and included a glossary that redefined the Christian vocabulary.{{refn|group=n|name=Melton1992p36|[[J. Gordon Melton]], 1992: "Almost as much as the medical controversy, charges of heresy from orthodox Christian churches have hounded the Church. Leaders of Christian Science insist that they are within the mainstream of Christian teachings, a concern which leads to their strong resentment of any identification with the New Thought movement, which they see as having drifted far from their central Christian affirmations. At the same time, strong differences with traditional Christian teachings concerning the Trinity, the unique divinity of Jesus Christ, atonement for sin, and the creation are undeniable. While using Christian language, ''Science and Health with Key to Scriptures'' and Eddy's other writings radically redefine basic theological terms, usually by the process commonly called allegorization. Such redefinitions are most clearly evident in the glossary to ''Science and Health'' (pages 579–599)."<ref>[[J. Gordon Melton]], "Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science)," ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'', New York: Routledge, 1992, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KRTGzgpDvL4C&pg=PA36 36].</ref>{{pb}}
[[Rodney Stark]], 1998: "But, of course, Christian Science was not just another Protestant sect. Like Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy added too much new religious culture for her movement to qualify fully as a member of the Christian family—as all the leading clerics of the time repeatedly and vociferously pointed out. However, unlike Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical Society, and like the Mormons, Christian Science retained an immense amount of Christian culture. These continuities allowed converts from a Christian background to preserve a great deal of cultural capital."{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=195}}}} At the core of Eddy's theology is the view that the spiritual world is the only reality and is entirely good, and that the material world, with its evil, sickness and death, is an illusion. Eddy saw humanity as an "idea of Mind" that is "perfect, eternal, unlimited, and reflects the divine", according to [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]]; what she called "mortal man" is simply humanity's distorted view of itself.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NWVP5kDBJcC&pg=PA122 122].</ref> Despite her view of the non-existence of evil, an important element of Christian Science theology is that evil thought, in the form of [[#MAM|malicious animal magnetism]], can cause harm, even if the harm is only apparent.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NWVP5kDBJcC&pg=PA127 127]; Moore 1986, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SG2qNXqdNHsC&pg=PA112 112]; Simmons 1995, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=og_u0Re1uwUC&pg=PA62 62].</ref>

Eddy viewed God not [[Personal god|as a person]] but as "All-in-all". Although she often described God in the language of personhood—she used the term "Father–Mother God" (as did [[Ann Lee]], the founder of [[Shakerism]]), and in the third edition of ''Science and Health'' she referred to God as "she"—God is mostly represented in Christian Science by the synonyms "Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love".<ref>For personhood, "Father–Mother God" and "she", see Gottschalk 1973, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPDduA4B7-MC&pg=PA52 52]; for Ann Lee, see Stokes 2014, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kOwJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA186 186].

Eddy accepted as true the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] up to chapter 2, verse 6—that God created man in his image and likeness—but she rejected the rest "as the story of the false and the material", according to Wilson.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;122; Gottschalk 1972, p.&nbsp;xxvii; [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-2/ "Genesis Chapter 2"], kingjamesbibleonline.org.</ref> Her theology is [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]]: she viewed the Trinity as suggestive of [[polytheism]].{{refn|group=n|Eddy, ''Science and Health'': "The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or Tri-unity) suggests polytheism, rather than the one ever-present I AM."<ref>Eddy, ''Science and Health'', p.&nbsp;256; Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;127.</ref>}} She saw Jesus as a Christian Scientist, a "Way-shower" between humanity and God,<ref>Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/retrospectionint00eddy#page/26/mode/1up 26].</ref> and she distinguished between Jesus the man and the concept of Christ, the latter a synonym for Truth and Jesus the first person fully to manifest it.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;121; {{harvnb|Stark|1998|pp=199}}</ref> The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] was not a divine sacrifice for the sins of humanity, the atonement (the forgiveness of sin through Jesus's suffering) "not the bribing of God by offerings", writes Wilson, but an "at-one-ment" with God.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;124.</ref> Her views on life after death were vague and, according to Wilson, "there is no doctrine of the soul" in Christian Science: "[A]fter death, the individual continues his probationary state until he has worked out his own salvation by proving the truths of Christian Science."<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;125.</ref> Eddy did not believe that the dead and living could communicate.<ref>Gottschalk 1973, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPDduA4B7-MC&pg=PA95 95].</ref>

To the more conservative of the Protestant clergy, Eddy's view of ''Science and Health'' as divinely inspired was a challenge to the Bible's authority.<ref>Melton 1992, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KRTGzgpDvL4C&pg=PA36 36].</ref> "Eddyism" was viewed as a cult; one of the first uses of the modern sense of the word was in A.

She has delivered to them a religion which has revolutionized their lives, banished the glooms that shadowed them, and filled them and flooded them with sunshine and gladness and peace; a religion which has no hell; a religion whose heaven is not put off to another time, with a break and a gulf between, but begins here and now, and melts into eternity as fancies of the waking day melt into the dreams of sleep.
They believe it is a Christianity that is in the New Testament; that it has always been there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through disuse and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths, its lamentations into songs of emancipation and rejoicing.<ref name=Twainquote>Mark Twain, ''Christian Science'', p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J_NsuqC3V3AC&pg=PA180 180]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aei4Ttb4-g "Mark Twain & Mary Baker Eddy, a film by Val Kilmer"], ''YouTube'', from 04:30 mins.</ref></div>

Born Mary Morse Baker on a farm in Bow, New Hampshire, Eddy was the youngest of six children in a family of Protestant [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalists]]. Her father, Mark Baker, was a deeply religious man, although, according to one account, "Christianity to him was warfare against sin, not a religion of human brotherhood."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Sutherland Bates|last2=Dittemore|first2=John V.|author-link2=John V.

My favorite studies were natural philosophy, logic, and moral science. From my brother Albert I received lessons in the ancient tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. My brother studied Hebrew during his college vacations.

[[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] and [[John V.

She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.{{sfn|Bates|Dittemore|1932|pp=16–17, 25}}{{pb}}
According to [[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]], Eddy "may have attended Holmes Academy at Plymouth in 1838 and certainly attended Sanbornton Academy in 1842."

[[Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]]: "The leaders of the medical schools, through the hypocrisy of their profession, deceive the people into submission to their opinions, while democracy forges the fetters which are to bind them to disease. Science, which would destroy this bondage, is looked upon as blasphemy when it dares oppose the faculty, and religion has no place in medical science. So in the church the religion of Jesus' Science is never heard; for it would drive aristocracy out of the pulpit, and scatter seeds of freedom among the people. Nevertheless, the religion of Christ is shown in the progress of Christian Science, while the religion of society decays as the liberal principles are developed.

Eddy first used mental healing on a patient in March 1864, when one of Quimby's patients in Portland, Mary Ann Jarvis, suffered a relapse when she returned home to Warren, Maine. Eddy stayed with her for two months, giving Jarvis mental healing to ease a breathing problem, and writing to Quimby six times for absent treatment for herself. She called the latter "angel visits"; in one of her letters to Quimby, she said that she had seen him in her room.

On Thursday, February 1, 1866, Mary Baker Eddy, then known as Mary Patterson, fell on the ice in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]].<ref>Milmine 1909, 84; Powell 1950, 109.</ref> She had been on the way to a [[Good Templars]] meeting, an organization supporting the [[temperance movement]], with friends from the organization.<ref>Koestler-Grack 2004, 3; Wilbur 1908, 128</ref> After her fall, the ''Lynn Reporter'' wrote that she was "in an insensible condition" and had internal injuries,<ref name=Gill161/> and the notes of Dr. Alvin M. Cushing, a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctor, who was called to the scene, state that he found Eddy "partially unconscious, semi-hysterical and complaining by word and action of severe pain in the back of her head and neck."<ref name=milmine84>Milmine 1909, 84.</ref> She was taken to the nearest house, that of [[Samuel M.

The next morning Eddy asked to be taken to her home in Swampscott, which Cushing arranged for against his own professional advice.<ref>Studdert Kennedy 1947, 130-131; Peel 1966, 195.</ref> In order to dull the pain of moving, Cushing gave Eddy "one-eighth of a grain of morphine" (a common painkiller at the time<ref>Gill 1998, 546.</ref>) according to his notes from the period.<ref name=milmine84/> Cushing also stated that Eddy was "a very interesting patient" who was "one of the most sensitive to the effects" of the morphine that he ever saw, and that to his surprise, the dose put her "sound asleep."<ref name=milmine85/>{{refn|group=n|Gill wrote that Milmine, one of the most well known critics of Eddy, may have inadvertently proved wrong the common claim among critics that Eddy was a life-long morphine addict by publishing Cushing's account, for a real morphine addict would have barely been effected by such a small dose.<ref name=Gill164/>}} Her husband Daniel Patterson was out of town at the time,<ref>Nenneman 1997, 85.</ref> but she was attended to by friends, Carrie Millett and Mary Wheeler, who took turns watching by her bedside.

Although Cushing had not visited Eddy on that Sunday, on Monday Cushing visited her again to check up.<ref name=milmine85>Milmine 1909, 85.</ref> According to his notes, Cushing visited her next about a week later on February 13, at which point the bill was paid and he declared that she was in a "normal condition."<ref name=milmine85/> The next day she sent a letter to [[Julius Dresser]], a fellow student of Quimby and future critic of Eddy, telling him that she had fallen on the sidewalk, was "taken up for dead, came to consciousness... but to find [herself] the helpless cripple [she] was before [she] saw Dr. Quimby." She further stated that despite the physician's predictions, she had gotten out of bed and walked by herself; but now she was frightened and wanted Dresser's help.<ref>Silberger 1980, 94; Wilbur 1908, 134-135</ref> On March 2, Dresser sent a letter declining her request, suggesting she could do more for herself than he could, and refusing to step into Quimby's shoes as a healer.<ref>Silberger 1980, 95; Studdert Kennedy 1947, 133-134.</ref> Eddy's letter was later used by Milmine to accuse Eddy of basically making up the whole thing, saying that in asking Dresser for help, it showed she had not fully recovered.<ref>Milmine 1909, 82-83.</ref> Huge Studdert Kennedy writes that her asking for help may have been occasioned by her fear of previous experiences with relapses from physical difficulties, particularly under Quimby's treatment.<ref>Studdert Kennedy 1947, 131-133.</ref>

Milmine's critical ''McClure's'' biography also claimed that she wasn't really injured much or at all to begin with; in 1908 they solicited<ref>Gill 1998, 163.</ref> an affidavit from Cushing in which he stated he never took Eddy's injury to be serious, and never heard anything about a miraculous cure.<ref name=milmine85/> He also stated that it was he, and not God, that cured her.<ref>Wilbur 1908, 128</ref> Nenneman notes that Cushing was "not disposed to be friendly toward the progress Christian Science was making" at the time, and it may have "tampered his recollections."<ref>Nenneman 1997, 87.</ref>{{refn|group=n|According to Robert Peel, Cushing wrote to Milmine saying "You are certainly showing the old lady up all right... My sons and others are very much stirred up that my name should appear in such a sacrilegious affair as Christian Science."<ref>Peel 1966, 346.</ref>}} Gill wrote that the church countered the Cushing affidavit by collecting affidavits from various Lynn and Swampscott neighbors, and that according to these affidavits "everyone at the time had been convinced that [Eddy] had done great damage to her spine, and those familiar with her injuries regarded her sudden ability to rise from bed and walk out of the sick room as next to miraculous."<ref name=Gill164>Gill 1998, 164.</ref>

Christian Scientists have often seen the event as leading to a divine revelation and healing which changed Eddy's life; a life which before the fall was preparatory, a time of learning, for her work after; while critics see the event as basically meaningless and only used by Eddy to claim divine inspiration.<ref>Silberger 1980, 98.</ref> Psychoanalyst Julius Silberger argues the truth is probably somewhere in-between, and that it clearly did have some effect on her, since her life and actions were "startlingly different" before and after the event.<ref>Silberger 1980, 98-100.</ref> [[Gillian Gill]] wrote: 
{{quote|"Whatever moral and religious interpretation one places upon it, the fall in Lynn clearly marked a turning point in [Eddy's] life, the moment when she began to take charge of her life... She herself consistently, and with increasing fervor and conviction, attributed that change to a new understanding of God's relation to the world, and to a new sense of her own special divine mission. Whether we label this delusion or revelation, the fact remains that the woman was fundamentally empowered, and that there was no external, material change to account for that increase of power."<ref>Gill 1998, 166-167</ref>}}

In March 1866, a month after the fall, Eddy and her husband (then married for 13 years) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn. At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted, unable to pay the $1.50 weekly rent. He appears to have returned briefly—they moved to a boarding house in July, and in August he paid Dr. Cushing's bill from the fall—but the marriage was over. He sent her $200 a year for a time, and they divorced in 1873.<ref>{{harvnb|Bates|Dittemore|1932|pp=114–117}}; Gill 1998, pp. 169–170.</ref>

Her first student was Hiram Crafts, a shoe worker in whose house she stayed, who advertised for patients himself in May 1867, offering a cure for "Consumption, Catarrh, Scrofula, Dyspepsia and Rheumatism." Eddy asked Crafts to set up a practice with her, but the plan came to nothing.{{sfn|Bates|Dittemore|1932|pp=118–120}} In addition to teaching, Eddy had started to write; toward the end of 1866 she began work on an allegorical interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], intended as the first volume of a book (never published), ''The Bible in its Spiritual Meaning''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bates|Dittemore|1932|pp=126, 131–135}}; Thomas 1994, p. 124–134; Gottschalk 2006, pp. 80–81.</ref>

In the summer of 1868, while lodging with spiritualist Sarah Bagley in Amesbury, Eddy advertised for students in a Spiritualist magazine, the ''[[Banner of Light]]'', as Mary B. Glover (her first husband's surname). The ad promised a "principle of science" that would heal with "[n]o medicine, electricity, physiology or hygiene required for unparalleled success in the most difficult cases".<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, p.

Eddy stayed there for two years, from 1868 to 1870, teaching Wentworth with Quimby's unpublished essay, "Questions and Answers." She acknowledged that the manuscript was Quimby's, and spoke often of how she had promised to teach his healing method, which at the time she called Moral Science.<ref name=CM1909p125>Cather and Milmine 1909, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmarybakerg00milmuoft#page/138/mode/2up 125–130].</ref>{{refn|group=n|Those who met Eddy at the Wentworths recalled her saying: "I ''learned'' this from Dr. ''Quimby'', and he made me ''promise'' to teach it to at least ''two'' persons before I ''die''".<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, p.

Eddy was asked to leave the Wentworths' in early 1870.

Eddy allowed her students to make copies of the manuscripts, but they were forbidden, under a $3,000 bond, from showing them to anyone. The students agreed to pay Eddy 10 percent annually of income derived from her work, and $1,000 if they failed to practice or teach it.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907may/97-118/ May 1907], pp. 100–101.</ref> She at first taught them to rub patients' heads, to "lay [their] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and [[solar plexus]] before class in preparation.<ref>Bates and Dittemore 1932, pp.&nbsp;144, 146.</ref> The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either.

Kennedy decided toward the end of 1871 to end his business partnership with Eddy.

Once Kennedy and Eddy had settled their financial affairs in May 1872, she was left with $6,000.<ref name=CatherMay1907p107 /> Peel writes that at this point she had already written 60 pages of ''Science and Health''.<ref>Peel 1966, p. 272.</ref> She was renting rooms in Lynn at 9 Broad Street, when 8 Broad Street came on the market. In March 1875 she purchased it for $5,650, taking in students to pay the mortgage.

Shortly after moving in, Eddy became close to another student, Daniel Spofford. He was 33 years old and married when he joined her class; he later left his wife in the hope that he might marry Eddy, but his feelings were not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday. They called themselves the Christian Scientists' Association.<ref>Peel 1996, pp. 286–287.</ref>

Eddy changed printers for the second edition, which was also poorly proofread, and for the third edition in 1881 switched again, this time to John Wilson & Sons, University Press, Cambridge, MA.

''Science and Health'' expanded on Eddy's view that sickness was a mental error.{{refn|group=n|Eddy, ''Science and Health'', 1875: "Palsy is a belief that attacks mind, and holds a limb inactive independent of the mind's consent, but the fact that a limb is moved only with mind proves the opposite, namely, that mind renders it also immovable."<ref>Eddy, [http://www.mbeinstitute.org/Books/1875/1875Ch8.html "Healing the sick"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225025549/http://mbeinstitute.org/Books/1875/1875Ch8.html |date=2013-02-25 }}, ''Science and Health'', 1875, p. 439.</ref>}} People said that simply reading ''Science and Health'' had healed them; cures were claimed for everything from cancer to blindness. Eddy wrote in the ''New York Sun'' in December 1898, in an article called "To the Christian World," that she had personally healed tuberculosis, diphtheria and "at one visit a cancer that had eaten the flesh of the neck and exposed the jugular vein so that it stood out like a cord. I have physically restored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, and have made the lame walk."{{refn|group=n|Eddy, December 16, 1898: "After my discovery of Christian Science, I healed consumption in the last stages, a case which the M.D.'s, by verdict of the stethoscope and the schools, had declared incurable, because the lungs were mostly consumed. I healed malignant diphtheria and carious bones that could be dented by the finger, saving the limbs when the surgeon's instruments were lying on the table ready for their amputation. I have healed at one visit a cancer that had eaten the flesh of the neck and exposed the jugular vein so that it stood out like a cord.

[https://archive.org/stream/firstchurchofchr025073mbp#page/n121/mode/1up 105].</ref>}} Eddy wrote that her views had derived, in part, from having witnessed the apparent recovery of patients she had treated with homeopathic remedies so diluted they were drinking plain water. She concluded that Divine Mind was the healer:

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;padding-left:1em">
The author has attenuated ''Natrum muriaticum'' (common table-salt) until there was not a single saline property left&nbsp;... and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light.

Christian Science is always the most skilful surgeon, but surgery is the branch of its healing which will be last acknowledged.

[[Rodney Stark]] writes that a key to Christian Science's appeal at the time was that its success rate compared favorably with that of physicians, particularly when it came to women's health. Most doctors had not been to medical school, there were no antibiotics, and surgical practices were poor. By comparison the placebo effect (being treated at all, no matter what the treatment was) worked well. Stark argues that the "very elaborate and intensely psychological Christian Science 'treatments' maximize such effects, while having the advantage of not causing further harm."{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=197}}

While Eddy argued that reality was entirely spiritual (and therefore entirely good), it remained true that human beings were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted", writes Wilson.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NWVP5kDBJcC&pg=PA127 127]; also see Gottschalk 1973, pp.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/details/emergenceofchris00step/page/128 128], [https://archive.org/details/emergenceofchris00step/page/148 148–149].</ref> To defend herself against it, Eddy organized "watches", during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give "adverse treatment" to her enemies. This was called "taking up the enemy in thought". According to former students, Eddy would tell them to say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): "You are affected as you wish to affect me. Your evil thought reacts upon you," then to call Kennedy bilious, consumptive or poisoned by arsenic.<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmarybakerg00milmuoft#page/n351/mode/1up 304]; Bates and Dittemore 1932, p.&nbsp;254; Moore 1986, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SG2qNXqdNHsC&pg=PA113 113].</ref>

Eddy set up what she called a secret society of her students (known as the P.&nbsp;M., or private meeting) to deal with malicious animal magnetism, but she said that the group only met twice.<ref>Eddy, ''Miscellaneous Writings, 1883–1896'', p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneouswr03eddygoog#page/n368/mode/1up 350].</ref> In her later years, Wilson writes, Eddy came to see animal magnetism as an impersonal force and concluded that individuals ought not to be "taken up in thought".<ref name=Wilson1961p127>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NWVP5kDBJcC&pg=PA127 127].</ref> From 1890 she felt that her students were focusing on it too much, and thereafter public discussion of malicious animal magnetism declined, although Gottschalk adds that it continued to play an important role in the teaching of Christian Science.<ref>Gottschalk 1972, p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/details/emergenceofchris00step/page/149 149]; also see Moore 1986, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SG2qNXqdNHsC&pg=PA113 113].</ref> [[Adam H.

=== Witchcraft trial, conspiracy charge ===
{{further|Salem witchcraft trial (1878)}}
[[File:Daniel Spofford 2.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Daniel Spofford]]

In May 1878 Eddy brought a case against Daniel Spofford, in Salem, Massachusetts, for practicing mesmerism. It came to be known as the second Salem witchcraft trial. The case was filed in the name of one of Spofford's patients, Lucretia Brown, who said that he had bewitched her, though Eddy appeared in court on Brown's behalf.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907jul/105-120/ July 1907], p.&nbsp;344ff; for the complaint, p.&nbsp;347; {{harvnb|Peel|1971|pp=40–45}}; {{harvnb|Gill|1998|p=253ff}}.</ref> In preparation for the hearing, Eddy organized a 24-hour watch at 8 Broad Street, during which she asked 12 students to think about Spofford for two hours each and block malicious mesmerism from him.<ref>Gill 1998, p.&nbsp;397; Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907jul/105-120/ July 1907], p.&nbsp;346.</ref> She arrived at the court with 20 supporters, including Amos Bronson Alcott (a "cloud of witnesses," according to the ''Boston Globe''), but Judge [[Horace Gray]] dismissed the case.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907jul/105-120/ July 1907], pp.&nbsp;347–348; {{harvnb|Bates|Dittemore|1932|p=193}}; for Alcott, {{harvnb|Peel|1971|p=44}}.</ref>

{{anchor|conspiracy}}The attempt to have Spofford tried was not the end of the dispute. In October 1878 Eddy's husband and another student, Edward Arens, were charged with conspiring to murder Spofford. A barman said they had offered him $500 to do it; after a complex series of claims and counter-claims, the charges were dropped when a witness retracted his statement.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907aug/99-114/ August 1907], pp.&nbsp;450ff, 455; Bates and Dittemore 1932, pp.&nbsp;194–201; Peel 1971, pp.&nbsp;50–58; Gill 1998, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiEMHjyvTGEC&pg=PA257 257].</ref> Eddy attributed the allegation to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of ''Science and Health'', just published.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907aug/99-114/ August 1907], p.&nbsp;454.</ref> Her lawyer had to apply for an [[Attachment (law)|attachment]] order against her house to collect his fee.<ref>Bates and Dittemore 1932, p.&nbsp;201.</ref>

[[File:Calvin A. Frye.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|[[Calvin Frye]] (1845–1917) was one of the few students who stayed with Eddy in 1881; he remained loyal to her for the rest of her life.]]

On August 23, 1879, 26 members of the Christian Scientists' Association were granted a charter to form the Church of Christ (Scientist).<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907aug/99-114/ August 1907], p. 458.</ref> Services were held in people's homes in Lynn and later in Hawthorne Hall, Boston.{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=189}} On January 31, 1881, Eddy was granted a charter to form the Massachusetts Metaphysical College to teach "pathology, ontology, therapeutics, moral science, metaphysics, and their application to the treatment of disease." The college lived wherever Eddy did; a new sign appeared on 8 Broad Street.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907sep/103-118/ September 1907], p.&nbsp;567; Bates and Dittemore 1932, p.&nbsp;210.</ref>

In October 1881 there was a revolt. Eight church members resigned, signing a document complaining of Eddy's "frequent ebullitions of temper, love of money, and the appearance of hypocrisy." Only a few students remained, including [[Calvin Frye]], who became Eddy's most loyal personal assistant. They appointed Eddy pastor of the church in November 1881, and drew up a resolution in February 1882 that she was "the chosen messenger of God to the nations."<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907aug/99-114/ August 1907], pp. 460–461; Bates and Dittemore 1932, pp. 213–215; {{harvnb|Stark|1998|p=189}}</ref>

Despite the support, the resignations ended Eddy's time in Lynn. The church was struggling and her reputation had been damaged by the disputes. By now 61 years old, she decided to move to Boston, and in early 1882 rented a house at 569 [[Columbus Avenue (Boston)|Columbus Avenue]], a silver plaque announcing the arrival of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College.<ref>Cather and Milmine (''McClure's''), [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907aug/99-114/ August 1907], p. 462; [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/McClures-1907sep/103-118/ September 1907], p. 568.</ref> The college's prospectus, published in 1884, offered three diplomas: Christian Scientist (C.S.) for Christian Scientists' Association members; Christian Metaphysician (C.M.) for Eddy's 12-lesson course and three years' practice; and Doctor of Christian Science (D.C.S.) for C.M.s whose "life and character conform to Divine science."

=== Death of Asa Gilbert Eddy ===
Eddy's husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, died of heart disease on June 4, 1882, shortly after the move to Boston. She invited the ''Boston Globe'' to her home on the day of his death to allege that he had been killed by malicious animal magnetism, courtesy of "certain parties here in Boston, who had sworn to injure them." The ''Globe'' wrote:

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;padding-left:1em;text-align:justify">
She had formerly had the same symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered it to be the mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned he said that he was unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/578807982.html "Mesmerism or Arsenic"], ''Boston Daily Globe'', June 4, 1882; Bates and Dittemore 1932, p. 219; Gill 1999, pp. 287–289.</ref></div>

Gordon]], in a letter read out by [[Josephus Flavius Cook|Joseph Cook]] during one of his popular Monday lectures at [[Tremont Temple]] in Boston. She demanded a right of reply, and on March 16, 1885, she told the congregation that she was not a Spiritualist, and that she believed in God as the Supreme Being and in the atonement.

Eddy was also accused, by Walter M. Haushalter in his ''Mrs. Eddy Purloins from Hegel'', Boston: A. A.

When a prospective student asked in 1871 whether her methods had been used before, she replied:

''Never'' advertised, and practiced by only one individual who healed me, Dr. Quimby of Portland, ME., an old gentleman who had made it a research for twenty-five years, starting from the standpoint of magnetism thence going forward and leaving that behind.

The charge that Christian Science came from Quimby, not divine revelation, stemmed in part from Eddy's use of Quimby's manuscript ''(right)'' when teaching Sally Wentworth and others in 1868–1870.{{refn|group=n|[[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] and [[John V.

In his conversations with me and in his scribblings, the word science was not used at all, till one day I declared to him that back of his magnetic treatment and manipulation of patients, there was a science, and it was the science of mind, which had nothing to do with matter, electricity, or physics."<ref>Eddy, "Reminiscences," ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', pp.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/firstchurchofchr025073mbp#page/n322/mode/1up 306–307].</ref><br>
Eddy, 1889: "Mr. Quimby's son has stated&nbsp;... that he has in his possession all his father's written utterances; and I have offered to pay for their publication, but he declines to publish them; for their publication would silence the insinuation that Mr. Quimby originated the system of healing which I claim to be mine."<ref>Eddy, ''Science and Health'', 1889, p.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_q0RaE6cbkRQC/page/n13 7].</ref><br>
Eddy, 1891: "In 1870 I copyrighted the first publication on spiritual, scientific Mind-healing, entitled ''The Science of Man''.

In July 1904 the ''New York Times'' obtained a copy of the Quimby manuscript from Sally Wentworth's son, and juxtaposed passages with ''Science and Health'' to highlight the similarities. It also published Eddy's handwritten notes on Quimby's manuscript to show what the newspaper alleged was the transition from his words to hers.{{refn|group=n|''New York Times'', July 10, 1904: The similarities included "Error is sickness, Truth is health" (Quimby manuscript), "Sickness is part of the error which ''Truth casts out''" (''Science and Health''); "Truth is God" (Quimby), "Truth is God" (''S&H''); "Error is matter" (Quimby), "Matter is mortal error" (''S&H''); "Matter has no intelligence" (Quimby), "The fundamental error of mortal man is the belief that matter is intelligent" (''S&H'').<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/10/432173842.pdf "True Origin of Christian Science"], ''The New York Times'', July 10, 1904.</ref>}}<ref>Also see Quimby, [https://archive.org/stream/quimbymanuscript00quim#page/165/mode/1up "Questions and Answers"], ''The Quimby Manuscripts'', chapter 13; Cather and Milmine 1909, pp.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmarybakerg00milmuoft#page/138/mode/2up 125–133].<br>

Eddy's biographers continued to disagree about his influence on Eddy.

In 1887 Eddy started teaching a "metaphysical obstetrics" course, two one-week classes. She had started calling herself "Professor of Obstetrics" in 1882; ''McClure's'' wrote: "Hundreds of Mrs. Eddy's students were then practising who knew no more about obstetrics than the babes they helped into this world."<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, p.

All were acquitted during the trial, or convictions were overturned on appeal.<ref>Schoepflin 2003, p.&nbsp;212.</ref>

The first manslaughter charge was in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended to her daughter during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued that they might have died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted.<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, pp.&nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmarybakerg00milmuoft#page/n407/mode/2up 354–355]; Bates and Dittemore 1932, p.&nbsp;282; Peel 1971, p.&nbsp;237; Schoepflin 2003, pp.&nbsp;82–85.{pb}}

From then until the 1990s [[#Child deaths|around 50 parents and practitioners]] were prosecuted, and often acquitted, after adults and children died without medical care; charges ranged from neglect to second-degree murder.<ref>Schoepflin 2003, pp.&nbsp;212–217.</ref> The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) declared war on Christian Scientists; in 1895 its journal called Christian Science and similar ideas "molochs to infants, and pestilential perils to communities in spreading contagious diseases."<ref>Cunningham 1967, p.&nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1846660?seq=18 902]; Peters 2007, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> Juries were nevertheless reluctant to convict when defendants believed they were helping the patient. There was also opposition to the AMA's effort to strengthen medical licensing laws.<ref>Schoepflin 2003, p.&nbsp;189; Peters 2007, p.&nbsp;100.</ref> Historian Shawn Peters writes that, in the courts and public debate, Christian Scientists and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] linked their healing claims to early Christianity to gain support from other Christians.<ref>Peters 2007, pp.&nbsp;107–108.</ref>

Vaccination was another battleground. A Christian Scientist in Wisconsin won a case in 1897 that allowed his son to attend public school despite not being vaccinated against [[smallpox]]. Others were arrested in 1899 for avoiding vaccination during a smallpox epidemic in Georgia. In 1900 Eddy advised adherents to obey the law, "and then appeal to the gospel to save&nbsp;...[themselves] from any bad results."<ref>Michael Willrich, ''Pox: An American History'', Penguin Press, 2011, pp.&nbsp;260–261.</ref> In October 1902, after seven-year-old Esther Quimby, the daughter of Christian Scientists, died of [[diphtheria]] in White Plains, New York (she had received no medical care and had not been quarantined), the authorities pursued manslaughter charges. The controversy prompted Eddy to declare that "until public thought becomes better acquainted with Christian Science, the Christian Scientists shall decline to doctor infectious or contagious diseases", and from that time the church required Christian Scientists to report contagious diseases to health boards.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/11/14/101094293.pdf "Christian Scientists' change of front"], ''The New York Times'', November 14, 1902; Peters 2007, pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDUElGmA3vkC&pg=PA94 94–95];</ref>

In 1888 Eddy became close to another of her students, Ebenezer Johnson Foster, a homeopath and graduate of the [[Hahnemann Medical College]]. He was 41 and she was 67, but apparently in need of affection and loyalty she adopted him legally in November that year, and he changed his name to Ebenezer Johnson Foster Eddy.<ref name=Ebenezer />

A year later, in October 1889, Eddy closed the Massachusetts Metaphysical College; according to Bates and Dittemore, the state attorney was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed the mortgage on the land in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased it herself for $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her.<ref>Bates and Dittemore 1932, pp.&nbsp;299–303.</ref> The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.<ref>Wilson 1961, p.&nbsp;159.</ref>

The cornerstone of [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], containing the Bible, Eddy's writings and a list of directors and financial contributors, was laid in May 1894 in the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] area of Boston.<ref>Gill 1998, p.&nbsp;360.</ref> Church members raised funds for the construction, and the building was finished in December 1894 at a cost of $250,000.<ref>Ivey 1999, pp.&nbsp;50, 52.</ref> It contained a "Mother's Room" in the tower for Eddy's personal use, furnished with rare books, silks, tapestries, rugs, a dressing gown and slippers, though she spent only one night there and it was later turned into a storage room. The archway into the room was made of Italian marble, and the word ''Mother'' was engraved on the floor.<ref>Joseph Armstrong, [https://archive.org/stream/motherchurch00unkngoog#page/n8/mode/2up ''The Mother Church''], Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, 1913, pp.&nbsp;73–81; Gill 1998, pp.&nbsp;xiv, 363.</ref>

Within two years the Boston membership had exceeded the original church's capacity. By 1903 the block around the church had been purchased by Christian Scientists, and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension, accommodating 5,000 people, was completed at a cost of $2 million.<ref>Ivey 1999, pp.&nbsp;70–75; Gill 1998, p.&nbsp;xii.</ref> This attracted the criticism that, whereas Christian Scientists spent money on a magnificent church, they maintained no hospitals, orphanages or missions in the slums.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1846660 Cunningham 1967], pp.&nbsp;901–902.</ref>

Christian Science went on to become the fastest-growing American religion in the early 20th century.

Twain described Eddy as "[g]rasping, sordid, penurious, famishing for everything she sees—money, power, glory—vain, untruthful, jealous, despotic, arrogant, insolent, pitiless where thinkers and hypnotists are concerned, illiterate, shallow, incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines, immeasurably selfish."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/christianscience002930mbp/christianscience002930mbp_djvu.txt Twain 1907], p.&nbsp;284.</ref>

''Science and Health'' he called "strange and frantic and incomprehensible and uninterpretable," and argued that Eddy had not written it herself.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/christianscience002930mbp/christianscience002930mbp_djvu.txt Twain 1907], p.&nbsp;29.</ref> "There is nothing in Christian Science that is not explicable," he wrote, "for God is one, Time is one, Individuality is one, and may be one of a series, one of many, as an individual man, individual horse; whereas God is one, not one of a series, but one alone and without an equal."<ref name=TwainCosmopolitan /> Eddy apart, Twain felt ambivalent toward mind-cure, arguing that "the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful."{{refn|group=n|[[Mark Twain]], 1907: "For the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful: the power, through loving mercifulness and compassion, to heal fleshly ills and pains and grief—all—with a word, with a touch of the hand! This power was given by the Saviour to the Disciples, and to all the converted. All—every one. It was exercised for generations afterwards. Any Christian who was in earnest and not a make-believe, not a policy-Christian, not a Christian for revenue only, had that healing power, and could cure with it any disease or any hurt or damage possible to human flesh and bone. These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago it would be difficult to satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/christianscience002930mbp/christianscience002930mbp_djvu.txt Twain 1907], p.&nbsp;284.

=== Next Friends suit, Eddy's death{{anchor|Next Friends}} ===
{{further|Christian Science Monitor}}
[[File:Mary Baker Eddy (1892), by S. A. Bowers (3).jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|[[Mary Baker Eddy]], 1892]]

In March 1907 several of Eddy's relatives filed an unsuccessful lawsuit, the "Next Friends suit," against members of Eddy's household, alleging that she was unable to manage her own affairs. [[Calvin Frye]], her long-time personal assistant, was a particular target of the allegations. The ''[[New York World]]''{{'s}} front-page story in October 1906, headline "Mrs. Mary Baker G.

Stark attributes the rise of the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison.{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=197–198}} Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced.{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=195}} It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=198–199}}

In 1906, 72 percent of Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 percent of the population.<ref>Stark 1998, pp.&nbsp;203–204.</ref> The church was attractive to women because it offered professional opportunities when it was difficult for women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the ''Christian Science Journal'', 12 were women.{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=206, 212}}

The increased efficacy of medicine around World War II heralded the religion's decline. Stark charts the use of [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] to kill bacteria, the availability of [[penicillin]] in the 1940s and breakthroughs in [[immunology]].{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=211–212}} Other factors were increased career opportunities for women,{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=212}} and that much of the membership was elderly. In 1998 30 percent of Christian Scientists were over 65. Eddy was in her sixties by the time the movement began to spread. Stark writes that the "characteristics of the earliest members of a movement will tend to be reproduced in subsequent converts."{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=203, 205}} A significant percentage of Scientists remained single (Eddy placed little emphasis on marriage and family), or became Scientists when their children were adults and unlikely to be converted.{{refn|group=n|[[Rodney Stark]], 1998: "[M]any female Christian Scientists never married, and many who did marry and have children did not convert until after their children were grown up.&nbsp;... Christian Science is at least ambivalent towards marriage and sex and therefore tends to appeal to those to whom these least appeal. Mrs Eddy strongly advocated celibacy, but admitted that it would be irresponsible to prohibit marriage at present. This would be realized in a later stage of historical awareness. Nevertheless, she made it clear that when possible, it was better not to marry."{{sfn|Stark|1998|p=204}}}} Christian Science did not have missionaries, so it relied on internal growth, but the conversion rate within families was not high. In a study cited by Stark, of 80 people raised within Christian Science just 26 (33 percent) became Scientists themselves.{{sfn|Stark|1998|pp=202, 208}}

Christian Scientists avoid almost all medical treatment, relying instead on Christian Science prayer.<ref>Battin 1999, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_XqLtMpuIwkC&pg=PA7 7].</ref> This consists of silently arguing with oneself; there are no appeals to a personal god, and no set words.<ref>{{harvnb|Stark|1998|pp=196–197}}; Gottschalk 2006, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC&pg=PA86 86].</ref> [[Caroline Fraser]] wrote in 1999 that the practitioner might repeat: "the allness of God using Eddy's seven synonyms—Life, Truth, Love, Spirit, Soul, Principle and Mind," then that "Spirit, Substance, is the only Mind, and man is its image and likeness; that Mind is intelligence; that Spirit is substance; that Love is wholeness; that Life, Truth, and Love are the only reality." She might deny other religions, the existence of evil, [[mesmerism]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], and the symptoms of whatever the illness is. She concludes, Fraser writes, by asserting that disease is a lie, that this is the word of God, and that it has the power to heal.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=94–96}}

In the hierarchy of the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], only the Mother Church in Boston, [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], uses the [[definite article]] in its name. Otherwise the first Christian Science church in any city is called First Church of Christ, Scientist, then Second Church of Christ, Scientist, and so on, followed by the name of the city (for example, [[:File:Third Church of Christ, Scientist, Curzon Street - geograph.org.uk - 262248.jpg|Third Church of Christ, Scientist, London]]). When a church closes, the others in that city are not renamed.<ref>Stark 1998, p.&nbsp;193.</ref>

Founded in April 1879, the Church of Christ, Scientist is led by a president and five-person board of directors.

The Church of Christ, Scientist is a [[Laity|lay church]] which has no ordained clergy or rituals, and performs no baptisms; with clergy of other faiths often performing marriage or funeral services since they have no clergy of their own. Its main religious texts are the [[Bible]] and ''Science and Health''. Each church has two [[Reader (Christian Science Church)|Readers]], who read aloud a "Bible lesson" or "lesson sermon" made up of selections from those texts during the Sunday service, and a shorter set of readings to open Wednesday evening testimony meetings. In addition to readings, members offer testimonials during the main portion of the Wednesday meetings, including recovery from ill health attributed to prayer. There are also [[Christian Science Hymnal|hymns]], time for silent prayer, and repeating together the [[Lord’s Prayer]] at each service.<ref>[[Stuart M. Matlins]]; Arthur J.

The [[Christian Science Publishing Society]] publishes several periodicals, including the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', winner of seven [[Pulitzer Prize]]s between 1950 and 2002. This had a daily circulation in 1970 of 220,000, which by 2008 had contracted to 52,000. In 2009 it moved to a largely online presence with a weekly print run.<ref>Stephanie Clifford, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29paper.html "Christian Science Paper to End Daily Print Edition"], ''The New York Times'', October 28, 2008; Jon Fine, [http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-10-28/the-christian-science-monitor-to-become-a-weeklybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice "The Christian Science Monitor to Become a Weekly"], ''Business Week'', October 28, 2008; David Cook, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1029/p25s01-usgn.html "Monitor shifts from print to Web-based strategy"], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', October 29, 2008.</ref> In the 1980s the church produced its own television programs, and in 1991 it founded a 24-hour news channel, which closed with heavy losses after 13 months.<ref>Seth Faison, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/business/the-media-business-new-deadline-for-monitor-channel.html "The Media Business; New Deadline for Monitor Channel"], ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1992.</ref>

The church also publishes the weekly ''[[Christian Science Sentinel]]'', the monthly ''[[The Christian Science Journal|Christian Science Journal]]'', and the ''[[The Herald of Christian Science|Herald of Christian Science]]'', a non-English publication. In April 2012 JSH-Online made back issues of the ''Journal'', ''Sentinel'' and ''Herald'' available online to subscribers.<ref>[http://jsh.christianscience.com/learn-more "Learn more about JSH-Online"], christianscience.com.</ref>

The church faced internal dissent in 1991 over its decision to publish ''[[The Destiny of The Mother Church]]''. Written and privately printed in 1943 by [[Bliss Knapp]], former president of the Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] of the New Testament.<ref>Gardner 1993, pp. 210–214; [https://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/xsci/suffer.htm Fraser (''Atlantic'') 1995]; {{harvnb|Fraser|1999|p=369ff}}</ref> Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.<ref>Peter Steinfels, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/us/fiscal-and-spiritual-rifts-shake-christian-scientists.html "Fiscal and Spiritual Rifts Shake Christian Scientists"], ''The New York Times'', February 29, 1992; [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/xsci/suffer.htm Fraser (''Atlantic'') 1995].</ref>
