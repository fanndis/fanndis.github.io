'''General elections''' were held in [[Denmark]] on 8 February 2005.<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p525 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]'s [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] retained the largest number of seats in [[Folketinget|parliament]]. The governing coalition between the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] remained intact, with the [[Danish People's Party]] providing the parliamentary support needed for the minority government. The [[Det Radikale Venstre|Danish Social Liberal Party]] made the biggest gains of any party, although it remains outside the governing group of parties. The election marked the second time in a row that the [[Socialdemokraterne|Social Democrats]] were not the largest party in the parliament, a change from most of the 20th century. The party lost 5 seats and leader [[Mogens Lykketoft]] resigned immediately after the election.

The prime minister called the elections on 18 January. He claimed that he would have called it earlier, but the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] which killed a number of Danes delayed it. Rasmussen still had almost a year left in his term, but said he wanted to call the election before municipal elections in November. His reasoning was that he wanted a clear mandate for the municipal and county government restructuring that his government was implementing.

From the last election the governing coalition of Venstre and the Conservative People's Party had 94 of the 175 seats together with the supporting Danish People's Party. This number was unchanged after the 2005 election. Voter turnout was 84.5% in Denmark proper, 73.0% in the [[Faroe Islands]] and 59.4% in [[Greenland]].<ref>Nohlen & Stöver, p550</ref> This was the last election in which [[Counties of Denmark|counties]] were used as constituencies.

==Campaign==
[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] campaigned on their municipal restructuring plan, as well as a continuation of the "tax-freeze" and tight immigration requirements. They also promised to see 60,000 jobs created during a second term.

The largest opposition party, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] led by Mogens Lykketoft focused on employment, which they claim has decreased under the current government.

The [[Danish People's Party]], who support the Venstre–[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] coalition, criticized the "tax-freeze" but agreed, conditionally, to support it for another parliamentary term. They also wanted increasingly tough immigration restrictions.

==Results==
63 out of the 179 members of the new folketing were newly elected. Although women made up 38% of the total, several women held prominent positions, notably [[Pia Kjærsgaard]], leader of the third largest party, [[Danish People's Party]]. [[Marianne Jelved]] (leader of the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Danish Social Liberal Party]]), [[Connie Hedegaard]] ([[Minister for the Environment (Denmark)|Minister of the Environment]]), [[Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil]] (front figure of [[Enhedslisten]]) and [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] (later elected as leader of [[Socialdemokraterne|Social Democrats]]) were other important woman in the parliament. A couple of parties, including the Social Democrats were holding leadership races, which might have been won by women. 9 of the top 20 candidates, in terms of personal votes, were women.
