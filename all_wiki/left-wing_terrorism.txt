{{terrorism}}
'''Left-wing terrorism''' or '''far-left terrorism''', sometimes called '''Marxist–Leninist  terrorism''' or '''revolutionary/left-wing terrorism''', is [[terrorism]] meant to overthrow [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]] and replace them with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already [[socialist state]]s as [[activism]] against the current ruling government.<ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45">Aubrey, pp. 44–45</ref><ref name="Moghadam, p. 56">Moghadam, p.56</ref> It has taken vivid manifestations across the world and presented diverging dynamics and relationships with national governments and political economies.

Most left-wing terrorist groups that had operated in the 1970s and 1980s disappeared by the mid-1990s. One exception was the Greek [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November]] (17N), which lasted until 2002. Since then, left-wing terrorism has been minor in the Western world compared with other forms, and is mostly carried out by insurgent groups in the developing world.<ref name="Silke2018">{{cite book|author=Andrew Silke|title=Routledge Handbook of Terrorism and Counterterrorism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23tqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT113|date=3 September 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-59270-9|chapter=8|quote="During the last two decades, left-wing terrorism has commonly been perceived as a relatively minor phenomenon even if at times predictions have been made about its return. ...

== Ideology ==
Left-wing terrorists have been influenced by various communist and socialist currents, including Marxism.<ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"/> [[Narodnaya Volya]], a 19th-century terrorist group that killed Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1881<ref name="Czar trial">{{cite news|title=Trial of the Czar's Assassins|newspaper=Wanganui Herald|volume=XV|issue=4132|date=7 May 1881|page=2|agency=[[United Press Association]]|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=WH18810507.2.14}}</ref> and developed the concept of [[propaganda of the deed]], is a major influence.<ref>Moghadam, p. 50</ref>

According to Sarah Brockhoff, [[Tim Krieger]] and Daniel Meierrieks, while left-wing terrorism is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist terrorism is ethnically motivated.<ref>Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks</ref> They argue that the revolutionary goal of left-wing terrorism is non-negotiable whereas nationalist terrorists are willing to make concessions.<ref>Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 3</ref> They suggest that rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups.<ref name="Brockhoff p. 17">Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 17</ref> Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for [[national liberation]] groups employing terrorism, such as [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the South American [[Tupamaros]], seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism.<ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"/> Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]], incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.<ref>Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 18</ref>

David Brannan writes that left-wing terrorists and insurgents tend not to engage in indiscriminate attacks on the public as it not only runs contrary to the [[socialist]] ideals they espouse of being protectors of the working class, but they also do not want to alienate large swaths of the working population as such organizations and individuals seek to gain their support.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Tan|editor-first=Andrew T .H. |last= Brannan|first=David|date=2010 |title=Politics of Terrorism: A Survey|chapter=Left- and Right-wing Political Terrorism| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXerAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=60 |isbn=9781857435795}}</ref> Other researchers argue that left-wing terrorism may not be less indiscriminate than its right-wing counterpart.<ref>Silke, Andrew, ed.

== History ==
Left-wing terrorism has its roots in 19th and early 20th century [[anarchist terrorism]] and became pronounced during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 2–3</ref> Modern left-wing terrorism developed in the context of the [[Protests of 1968|political unrest of 1968]]. In Western Europe, notable groups included the West German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), the Italian [[Red Brigades]], the French [[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]] (AD) and the Belgian [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC). Asian groups have included the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], although the latter organization later adopted [[nationalist terrorism]]. In Latin America, groups that became actively involved in terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s included the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]], the Peruvian [[Shining Path]] and the Colombian [[19th of April Movement]].<ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/>

A 2014 paper by Kis-Katos et al concluded that left-wing terrorism was the most prevalent terrorism in the past but has largely declined in the present day.<ref>Kis-Katos, Krisztina, Helge Liebert, and Günther G. Schulze. "On the heterogeneity of terror." European Economic Review 68 (2014): 116-136.</ref>

=== Canada ===
The [[Front de libération du Québec]] was a Marxist–Leninist group active in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, promoting socialist insurrection and an independent Quebec. They are known for over 160 bombings and other violent incidents that killed eight, and for the kidnap-murder of Quebec politician [[Pierre Laporte]] in 1970.<ref>Gérard Pelletier. The October crisis. McClelland and Stewart, 1971. Pp. 55.</ref>

The [[Squamish Five]] bombed the Dunsmuir BC Hydro substation, [[Litton Industries bombing|Litton Industries]] and firebombed three Red Hot Video locations in the early 1980s, with their activities ending with their arrest in 1985.

==== May 19th Communist Organization ====
The [[May 19th Communist Organization]], also referred to as the May 19 Communist Coalition, was a United States-based, self-described revolutionary organization formed by splintered-off members of the [[Weather Underground]] and the [[Black Liberation Army]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Way The Wind Blew: A History Of The Weather Underground|last= Jacobs |first= Ron|year= 1997|publisher= Verso|isbn= 1-85984-167-8 |pages= 76–77|url= https://archive.org/stream/TheWayTheWindBlewAHistoryOfTheWeatherUnderground/waythewindblew_djvu.txt|accessdate= December 28, 2009}}</ref> The M19CO name was derived from the birthdays of [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Malcolm X]].

=== Latin America ===
Stefan M. Aubrey describes the [[Sandinistas]], [[Shining Path]], [[19th of April Movement]], and [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) as the main organizations involved in left-wing terrorism in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. These organizations opposed the United States government and drew local support as well as receiving support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.<ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/>

==== FARC ====
The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) is a Marxist–Leninist organization in Colombia which has engaged in vehicle bombings, gas cylinder bombs, killings, landmines, kidnapping, extortion and hijacking as well as guerilla and conventional military. The United States Department of State includes the FARC-EP on its list of foreign terrorist organizations, as does the European Union. It funds itself primarily through extortion, kidnapping and their participation in the [[illegal drug trade]].<ref>[[BBC News]]. "Colombia's Most Powerful Rebels." September 19, 2003.

Businesses operating in rural areas, including agricultural, oil, and mining interests, were required to pay "vaccines" (monthly payments) which "protected" them from subsequent attacks and kidnappings. An additional, albeit less lucrative, source of revenue was highway blockades in which guerrillas stopped motorists and buses in order to confiscate jewelry and money. An estimated 20 to 30 percent of FARC combatants are under 18 years old, with many as young as 12 years old, for a total of around 5000 children.<ref name="Children">[[Human Rights Watch]].

==== Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Naxalites ====
Armed [[Naxalite]] groups operate across large parts of the central and eastern rural regions of India. Informed by the [[People's War]] strategy of [[Maoism]], the most prominent of the groups is the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]], formed through the merging of two previous Naxalite organizations, the [[People's War Group]] and the [[Maoist Communist Centre of India]] (MCC). Armed Naxalite movements are considered India's largest internal security threat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Maoist Violence|url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm?v=in_detail|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=16 November 2010|date=27 August 2008}}</ref> Naxalite militants have engaged in numerous terrorist attacks and human rights violations in India's [[Red Corridor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Kanchan|title=Naxals, India's enemy within|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/nov/25kanch.htm|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=16 November 2010|date=25 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=India's Naxalites: A spectre haunting India|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7799247?story_id=7799247|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=16 November 2010|date=17 August 2006}}</ref> A ''Frontline'' magazine article calls the [[Bhamragad]] [[Taluka]], where the [[Madia Gond]] [[Adivasi]]s live, the heart of the Naxalite-affected region in [[Maharashtra]].<ref>Guerilla zone, Cover Story, Frontline, Volume 22, Issue 21, Oct. 08–21, 2005 DIONNE BUNSHA in Gadchiroli {{cite web |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2221/stories/20051021008701600.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221144918/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2221/stories/20051021008701600.htm |archive-date=2009-02-21}}</ref>

==== Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ====
The [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] has been responsible for hundreds of attacks on government and civilian targets.
After the [[United People's Front of Nepal]] (UPF)'s Maoist wing, CPN-M, performed poorly in elections and was excluded from the 1994 election, the Maoists turned to [[insurgency]]. They aimed to overthrow Nepal's monarchy and parliamentary democracy, and to change Nepalese society, including a purge of the nation's elite class, a state takeover of private industry, and collectivization of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viasatprovider.com/|title=Viasat Internet {{!}} Provider of Fast Satellite Internet|website=ViaSat Internet Provider|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/nepal/terroristoutfits/index.html|title=Nepal Terrorist Groups - Maoist Insurgents|website=www.satp.org|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> In [[Nepal]], attacks against civilian populations occurred as part of Maoist strategy, leading [[Amnesty International]] to state: <blockquote>The CPN (Maoist) has consistently targeted private schools, which it ideologically opposes. On the 14 April 2005 the CPN (Maoist) demanded that all private schools shut down, although this demand was withdrawn on 28 April. Following this demand, it bombed two schools in western Nepal on 15 April, a school in Nepalganj, Banke district on 17 April and a school in Kalyanpur, Chitwan on 21 April. CPN (Maoist) cadres also reportedly threw a bomb at students taking classes in a school in Khara, Rukum district.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA310542005?|title=Nepal: Children caught in the conflict - Amnesty International|date=2005-11-07|access-date=2019-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107070737/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA310542005|archive-date=2005-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> </blockquote>

==== Japanese Red Army ====
The [[Japanese Red Army]] (JRA) was founded in 1969 as the "Red Army Faction" by students impatient with the Communist Party. In 1970, they hijacked a plane to North Korea, where nine of their members were interned. Fourteen members were killed during an internal purge. In 1971, the renamed JRA formed a connection with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and established a base in Lebanon. Their major terrorist acts included an armed attack on the Tel Aviv airport, hijacking planes to Libya and Bangladesh, kidnapping the French ambassador to the Hague, and bombing a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) nightclub in Naples, Italy. By the mid-1990s, their level of activity had declined and the US State Department no longer considered them a terrorist threat. In 2001, their leader announced the dissolution of the group, although some of its members were in prison and others were still wanted by police.<ref>Atkins, pp. 157–58</ref>

==== Pakistan ====
Left-wing groups like the Pakhtoon Zalmay, Al-Zulfiqar organisation (AZO) and the MQM including its predecessor the Muhajir Qaumi Movement committed numerous acts of violence including bombings, targeted killings, disinformation and assassinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trackingterrorism.org/group/al-zulfikar|title=al Zulfikar {{!}} Terrorist Groups {{!}} TRAC|website=www.trackingterrorism.org|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>

=== Europe ===
Typically small and urban-based, left-wing terrorist organizations in Europe have been committed to overthrowing their countries' governments and replacing them with regimes guided by Marxist–Leninist ideology. Although none have achieved any degree of success in accomplishing their goals, they have caused serious security problems in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, France, Turkey, Portugal and Spain.<ref>Plushinsky, p. 16</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=Which book?

==== Action Directe ====
[[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]] (AD) was active in France between 1979 and 1987. Between 1979 and 1985, they concentrated on non-lethal bombings and strafings of government buildings, although they assassinated a French Ministry of Defense official. Following arrests of some of its members, the organization declined and became inactive.<ref>Pluchinsky, p. 134</ref> The French government has banned the group.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Europe wary of banning parties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2217919.stm |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref>

==== Communist Combatant Cells ====
The [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC) was founded in 1982 in Belgium by [[Pierre Carette]]. With about ten members, the CCC financed its activities through a series of bank robberies. Over the course of 14 months, they carried out 20 attacks against property, mostly [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) facilities. Despite attempts to avoid loss of life, there were casualties as a result of these attacks. After Carette and other members were arrested in 1985, the group ceased to be operational. Carette served 17 years of a life sentence, although his colleagues that were convicted with him were released earlier.<ref>Atkins, pp. 62–63</ref>

The group has committed a number of kidnappings, initially for political reasons, later on, mainly for extortion. Its last attack was committed in 2006, when GRAPO militants shot dead Ana Isabel Herrero, the owner of a temporary work agency in [[Zaragoza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertaddigital.com:6681/noticias/noticia_1276307643.html|title=Libertad Digital: El último grupo de los GRAPO tenía previsto volver a atentar|accessdate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226121106/http://www.libertaddigital.com:6681/noticias/noticia_1276307643.html|archive-date=26 December 2011}}</ref>

==== Irish National Liberation Army ====
The [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) is an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] [[Communism|communist]] [[paramilitary]] group formed on 10 December 1974, during "[[the Troubles]]". It seeks to remove [[Northern Ireland]] from the [[United Kingdom]] and create a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] encompassing [[United Ireland|all of Ireland]]. It is the [[paramilitary]] wing of the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] (IRSP).

The INLA was founded by former members of the [[Official Irish Republican Army]] who opposed that group's ceasefire. It was initially known as the "People's Liberation Army" or "People's Republican Army". The INLA [[Timeline of Irish National Liberation Army actions|waged a paramilitary campaign]] against the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in Northern Ireland. It was also active to a lesser extent in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. High-profile attacks carried out by the INLA include the [[Droppin Well bombing]], the [[1994 Shankill Road killings]] and the [[Assassination of Airey Neave|assassinations of Airey Neave in 1979]] and [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright in 1997]]. However, it was smaller and less active than the main republican paramilitary group, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]]. It was also weakened by feuds and internal tensions. Members of the group used the covernames People's Liberation Army (PLA), People's Republican Army (PRA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=31&month=12&year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref> and [[Catholic Reaction Force]] (CRF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch83.htm#201183|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1983|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref> for attacks its volunteers carried out but the INLA did not want to claim responsibility for.<ref>https://fas.org/irp/world/para/inla.htm</ref>
