The [[United States of America|United States]] '''Food and Drug Administration''' ('''FDA''' or '''USFDA''') is a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting [[public health]] through the control and supervision of [[food safety]], [[tobacco]] products, [[dietary supplement]]s, [[Prescription drug|prescription]] and [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[pharmaceutical drug]]s (medications), [[vaccine]]s, [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[blood transfusion]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, [[Animal feed|animal foods & feed]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/default.htm |title= Animal Food & Feeds |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date= March 14, 2015 }}</ref> and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary products]].

The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the [[Public Health Service Act]], as well as associated regulations. Much of this regulatory-enforcement work is not directly related to food or drugs, but involves such things as regulating [[lasers]], [[cellular phones]], and [[condoms]], as well as control of disease in contexts varying from household [[pet]]s to [[sperm donation|human sperm donated]] for use in [[assisted reproduction]].

The FDA is led by the [[Commissioner of Food and Drugs]], appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Commissioner reports to the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]]. [[Stephen Hahn (oncologist)|Stephen M.

=== Headquarters ===
FDA headquarters facilities are currently located in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] in Maryland.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-27|title=Buildings and Facilities|url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/jobs-and-training-fda/buildings-and-facilities|access-date=2020-10-03|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en}}</ref>

=== White Oak Federal Research Center ===
Since 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on {{Convert|130|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of the [[White Oak Federal Research Center]] in the White Oak area of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].<ref name="White Oak" /><ref name="coordinates">Coordinates of FDA Headquarters at White Oak, Maryland: {{coord|39.0353363|-76.9830894|region:US-MD_type:landmark|format=dms|name=FDA Headquarters at White Oak, Maryland}}</ref> In 2001, the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], its headquarters in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately {{Convert|3800000|sqft|m2|abbr=off}} of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the [[Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration|Office of the Commissioner]] (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),&nbsp; the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER), the [[FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health|Center for Devices and Radiological Health]] (CDRH), the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER) and offices for the [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|date=2019-02-08|title=White Oak Campus Information|url=http://www.fda.gov/about-fda/buildings-and-facilities/white-oak-campus-information|access-date=2020-04-02|website=FDA|language=en}}</ref>

With the passing of the [[FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017]], the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately {{Convert|1600000|sqft|m2|abbr=off}} of office and special use space to their existing facilities. The [[National Capital Planning Commission]] approved a new master plan for this expansion in December 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|title=FDA White Oak Master Plan|url=https://www.ncpc.gov/projects/MP201/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=National Capital Planning Commission|language=en}}</ref> and construction is expected to be completed by 2035, dependent on GSA appropriations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/BuildingsandFacilities/WhiteOakCampusInformation/ucm057328.htm| title=White Oak Campus Project Schedule| date=October 8, 2015}}</ref>

===Field Locations===

==== The Office of Regulatory Affairs ====
The Office of Regulatory Affairs is considered the agency's "eyes and ears," conducting the vast majority of the FDA's work in the field. Its employees, known as Consumer Safety Officers, or more commonly called, Investigators, inspect production and warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product. The Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. Districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the [[United States federal court system|Federal court system]]. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency's network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken. Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.

==== The Office of Criminal Investigations ====
[[File:US Food and Drug Administration Office 20180930.jpg|thumb|left|Jamaica, Queens, NY Regional Office - USFDA]]
The Office of Criminal Investigations was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. To do so, OCI employs approximately 200 Special Agents nationwide who, unlike ORA Investigators, are armed and do not focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. OCI agents pursue and develop cases where individuals and companies have committed criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims, or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving violations of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and work closely with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Assistant Attorney General]], and even [[Interpol]]. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources—including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI—and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.

==== Other locations ====
The FDA has a number of other field locations across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2020-05-21|title=Buildings and Facilities|url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/jobs-and-training-fda/buildings-and-facilities|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421020851/https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/jobs-and-training-fda/buildings-and-facilities|archive-date=2020-04-21|access-date=2020-05-20|website=FDA.gov|language=en}}</ref>

==Scope and funding==
The FDA regulates more than US${{Format price|2400000000000}} worth of consumer goods, about 25% of consumer expenditures in the United States. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics and $18 billion in vitamin supplements. Much of these expenditures are for goods imported into the United States; the FDA is responsible for monitoring imports.<ref name="NYT-2Nov08"/>

The FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2012 totaled $4.36 billion,<ref name=train/> while the proposed 2014 budget is $4.7 billion.<ref name=wright2013/>  About $2 billion of this budget is generated by user fees.

In February 2008, the FDA announced that the Bush Administration's FY 2009 budget request for the agency was just under $2.4 billion: $1.77 billion in budget authority (federal funding) and $628 million in user fees. The requested budget authority was an increase of $50.7 million more than the FY 2008 funding – about a three percent increase. In June 2008, Congress gave the agency an emergency appropriation of $150 million for FY 2008 and another $150 million.<ref name="NYT-2Nov08">{{Cite news|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=November 2, 2008 |last=Harris |first=Gardiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02fda-t.html |title=The Safety Gap}}</ref>

==Regulatory programs==
{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}

As of 2015, the agency regulates more than $1 trillion in consumer products, including:
* $466 billion in food
* $275 billion in drugs
* $60 billion in cosmetics
* $18 billion in vitamin supplements<ref>Food and Drug Administration. https://www.fda.gov/ . Accessed October 12, 2016</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2019}}
The programs for safety regulation vary widely by the type of product, its potential risks, and the regulatory powers granted to the agency. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections.  Inspection observations are documented on [[Form 483]].

In June 2018, the FDA released a statement regarding new guidelines to help food and drug manufacturers "implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611177.htm |title=Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new guidance to help manufacturers implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|first1=Scott|last1=Gottlieb|date=June 19, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> One of the new guidelines includes the Intentional Adulteration (IA) rule, which requires strategies and procedures by the food industry to reduce the risk of compromise in facilities and processes that are significantly vulnerable.

The FDA also uses tactics of regulatory shaming,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yadin|first=Sharon|date=2019|title=Regulatory Shaming|journal=Environmental Law (Lewis & Clark)|volume=49|pages=41|ssrn=3290017}}</ref> mainly through online publication of non-compliance, warning letters, and "shaming lists."  Regulation by shaming harnesses firms' sensitivity to reputational damage. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online "black list," in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yadin|first=Sharon|date=2019|title=Shaming Big Pharma|url=http://yalejreg.com/shaming-big-pharma/|journal=Yale Journal on Regulation Bulletin|volume=36|pages=17}}</ref>

The FDA frequently works with other federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions.

===Food and dietary supplements===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}
{{Main|Regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}
The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration is governed by various statutes enacted by the [[United States Congress]] and interpreted by the FDA. Pursuant to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] of both the composition and the health benefits of foods.

The FDA subdivides substances that it regulates as food into various categories—including foods, [[food additive]]s, added substances (man-made substances that are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and [[dietary supplements]]. Dietary supplements or dietary ingredients include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and. enzymes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements/dietary-supplement-products-ingredients|title=Dietary Supplement Products & Ingredients|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|date=2020-03-17|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Specific standards the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category.

Under the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]] (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. These manufacturers and distributors are not allowed to advertise their products in an adulterated way, and they are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their product.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements|title=Dietary Supplements|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|date=2020-02-04|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>

The FDA has a “Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List” that includes ingredients that sometimes appear on dietary supplements but need further evaluation further.<ref>{{cite web | title = Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List | publisher = U.S. Food & Drug Administration | url = https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-products-ingredients/dietary-supplement-ingredient-advisory-list | access-date = 10 May 2020}}</ref> An ingredient is added to this list when it is excluded from use in a dietary supplement, does not appear to be an approved food additive or recognized as safe, and/or is subjected to the requirement for pre-market notification without having a satisfied requirement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|date=2019-12-20|title=Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-products-ingredients/dietary-supplement-ingredient-advisory-list|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref>

===="FDA-Approved" vs. "FDA-Accepted in Food Processing"====
The FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the [[food processing industry]].<ref>[http://www.decc.com/fda-acceptable-vs-fda-approved.php FDA Approved Coatings vs. FDA Acceptable Coatings – DECC Company – DECC Company]. Decc.com. Retrieved on October 23, 2013.</ref> There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings, nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are "FDA Compliant" or "FDA Acceptable".

===Medical countermeasures (MCMs)===
{{further|Biosecurity|Bioterrorism|Biosecurity in the United States}}
Medical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as [[biologics]] and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s that can protect from or treat the effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats.<ref name="fdamcm">{{cite web|title=What are Medical Countermeasures?|url=https://www.fda.gov/EmergencyPreparedness/Counterterrorism/MedicalCountermeasures/AboutMCMi/ucm431268.htm|website=FDA: Emergency Preparedness and Response|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> The FDA runs a program called the "FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government.

===Medications===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}
[[File:FDA Bldg 51 - Main Entrance (5161374834).jpg|thumb|FDA Building 51 houses the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]].|alt=]]

The [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs.  A drug is considered "new" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different [[excipient]]s or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. The most rigorous requirements apply to ''new molecular entities'': drugs that are not based on existing medications.

====New medications====
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
New drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a [[new drug application]] (NDA).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/ | title = New Drug Application (NDA) | publisher=Food and Drug Administration | access-date = November 20, 2012}}</ref> Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|10}}'''  Critics, however, argue that the FDA standards are not sufficiently rigorous, allowing unsafe or ineffective drugs to be approved.<ref>{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |last=Stegenga |first=Jacob |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&lang=en&}}</ref> New drugs are available only by prescription by default.  A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. A drug that is approved is said to be "safe and effective when used as directed".

Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. This was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of [[ZMapp]] and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective.

=====Advertising and promotion=====
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion reviews and regulates prescription drug advertising and promotion through surveillance activities and issuance of enforcement letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Advertising and promotion for over-the-counter drugs is regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].  The FDA also empowers third-party enforcer-firms to engage in some regulatory oversight, e.g. the FDA expects pharmaceutical companies companies to make sure that third-party suppliers and labs abide by the agency’s health and safety guidelines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2020-04-01|title=The New Gatekeepers: Private Firms as Public Enforcers|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/800|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=106|issue=2|pages=467}}</ref>{{rp|4}}

The drug advertising regulation<ref>21 CFR 202: Prescription Drug Advertising.</ref> contains two broad requirements: (1) a company may advertise or promote a drug only for the specific indication or medical use for which it was approved by FDA. Also, an advertisement must contain a "fair balance" between the benefits and the risks (side effects) of a drug.

The term [[off-label]] refers to drug usage for indications other than those approved by the FDA.

=====Post-market safety surveillance=====
After NDA approval, the sponsor must review and report to the FDA every patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis.<ref>21 CFR 314.80: Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences</ref> The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its [[MedWatch]] program.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program]. Accessed October 9, 2007</ref> These reports are called "spontaneous reports" because reporting by consumers and health professionals is voluntary.

While this remains the primary tool of [[Postmarketing surveillance|post-market safety surveillance]], FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional [[clinical trials]], called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called [[Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies]] (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=LS|last2=Loh|first2=M|last3=Perrone|first3=J|title=Assuring safety of inherently unsafe medications: the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.|journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology|date=June 2014|volume=10|issue=2|pages=165–72|doi=10.1007/s13181-013-0374-z|pmid=24414251|pmc=4057549}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=WV|last2=Bramlet|first2=DA|last3=Ross|first3=JL|last4=Underberg|first4=JA|title=JCL roundtable: Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.|journal=Journal of Clinical Lipidology|date=October 14, 2016 |volume=10|issue=6|pages=1288–1296|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2016.10.007|pmid=27919344}}</ref>  For example, [[thalidomide]] can cause birth defects, but has uses that outweigh the risks if men and women taking the drugs do not conceive a child; a REMS program for thalidomide mandates an auditable process to ensure that people taking the drug take action to avoid pregnancy; many [[opioid]] drugs have REMS programs to avoid addiction and diversion of drugs.<ref name=Nelson/> The drug [[isotretinoin]] has a REMS program called [[iPLEDGE]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kovitwanichkanont|first1=T|last2=Driscoll|first2=T|title=A comparative review of the isotretinoin pregnancy risk management programs across four continents.|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1035–1046|date=6 March 2018|doi=10.1111/ijd.13950|pmid=29508918}}</ref>

====Generic drugs====
Generic drugs are chemical and therapeutic equivalents of [[name-brand]] drugs whose patents have expired.<ref name="TNBK"/> Approved generic drugs should have the same dosage, safety, effectiveness, strength, stability, and quality, as well as route of administration. In general, they are less expensive than their name brand counterparts, are manufactured and marketed by other companies and, in the 1990s, accounted for about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States.<ref name="TNBK"/> For approval of a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug.<ref name="Therapeutic Equivalance of Generic Drugs">{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm073182.htm |title=Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Drugs|access-date=August 30, 2012|publisher=Food and Drug Administration |year=1998}}</ref> This is called an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA).<ref>{{cite web | title = Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) | publisher = U.S. Food & Drug Administration | url = https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/abbreviated-new-drug-application-anda | access-date = 10 May 2020}}</ref> As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=====Generic drug scandal=====
In 1989, a major scandal erupted involving the procedures used by the FDA to approve generic drugs for sale to the public.<ref name="TNBK">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cohen |first=Lynne |article=Government Policies and Programs&nbsp;– United States&nbsp;– Generic Drug Scandal |title=The New Book of Knowledge&nbsp;– Medicine And Health |date=1990 |p=276–281 |isbn=978-0-7172-8244-9}}</ref> Charges of corruption in generic drug approval first emerged in 1988 during the course of an extensive congressional investigation into the FDA. The oversight subcommittee of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee|United States House Energy and Commerce Committee]] resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by [[Mylan Laboratories Inc.]] of [[Pittsburgh]]. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in [[racketeering]] and in violations of [[antitrust law]]. "The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications" and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from generic drugs makers, and two companies ([[Par Pharmaceutical]] and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/business/fda-details-problems-at-drug-makers.html | work=The New York Times | title=F.D.A. Details Problems at Drug Makers | date=September 12, 1989}}</ref> pleaded guilty to giving bribes.

Furthermore, it was discovered that several manufacturers had falsified data submitted in seeking FDA authorization to market certain generic drugs. Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of New York, which sought approval of a generic version of the drug [[Dyazide]], a medication for high blood pressure, submitted Dyazide, rather than its generic version, for the FDA tests. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. Dozens of drugs were eventually suspended or recalled by manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed securities fraud charges against the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company, a major generic manufacturer based in Long Island, New York.<ref name="TNBK"/>

====Over-the-counter drugs====
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs like [[aspirin]] are drugs and combinations that do not require a doctor's prescription.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] FDA. Retrieved August 30, 2012.</ref> The FDA has a list of approximately 800 approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Many OTC drug ingredients had been previously approved prescription drugs now deemed safe enough for use without a [[physician|medical practitioner]]'s supervision like [[ibuprofen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/cder/handbook/otcintro.htm | title=FDA CDER Handbook: Over-the-Counter Drug Products | access-date=October 9, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-date=May 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512224542/https://www.fda.gov/cder/handbook/otcintro.htm }}</ref>

====Ebola treatment====
In 2014, the FDA added an [[Ebola]] treatment being developed by Canadian pharmaceutical company [[Tekmira Pharmaceuticals|Tekmira]] to the [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track program]], but halted the phase 1 trials in July pending the receipt of more information about how the drug works. This was seen as increasingly important in the face of a [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|major outbreak of the disease in West Africa]] that began in late March 2014 and ended in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah |title=The FDA recently halted trials on a potential Ebola treatment |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/3/5962381/ebola-outbreak-vaccine-fda-halted-trials |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=August 4, 2014|date=2014-08-03 }}</ref>

{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
[[File:Blood Research- Saving Lives (8352) (9759352093).jpg|thumb|FDA scientist prepares blood donation samples for testing]]
The [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ |title=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) |publisher=Food and Drug Administration|date=March 2, 2017 |access-date=May 12, 2017}}.</ref> These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a [[Biologics license application|Biologics License Application]] (BLA), similar to that for drugs.

The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]], with additional authority established by the 1944 [[Public Health Service Act]]. Along with these Acts, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the [[National Institutes of Health]]; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972.

===Medical and radiation-emitting devices===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
[[File:FDA Bldg 62 - Exterior (5161375340).jpg|thumb|FDA Building 62 houses the [[FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health|Center for Devices and Radiological Health]].|alt=]]
The [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]] (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all [[medical device]]s, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/ucm300639.htm CDRH Mission, Vision and Shared Values] Retrieved August 30, 2012.</ref> The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple [[toothbrush]] to complex devices such as implantable [[neurostimulator]]s. CDRH also oversees the safety performance of non-medical devices that emit certain types of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Examples of CDRH-regulated devices include [[cellular phones]], [[Airport security|airport baggage screening equipment]], [[television|television receivers]], [[microwave oven]]s, [[tanning booth]]s, and [[laser|laser products]].

CDRH regulatory powers include the authority to require certain technical reports from the manufacturers or importers of regulated products, to require that radiation-emitting products meet mandatory safety performance standards, to declare regulated products defective, and to order the recall of defective or noncompliant products. CDRH also conducts limited amounts of direct product testing.

===="FDA-Cleared" vs "FDA-Approved"====
Clearance requests are for medical devices that prove they are "substantially equivalent" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate "safety and efficacy", for example it may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Both aspects need to be proved or provided by the submitter to ensure proper procedures are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194460.htm|title=What does it mean when FDA "clears" or "approves" a medical device?|publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref>

===Cosmetics===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
Cosmetics are regulated by the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]], the same branch of the FDA that regulates food. Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make "structure or function claims" that make them into drugs (see [[Cosmeceutical]]). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/summary-cosmetics-labeling-requirements|title=Summary of Cosmetics Labeling Requirements|date=August 2, 2018|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

According to the industry advocacy group the [[American Council on Science and Health]], though the cosmetic industry is predominantly responsible in ensuring the safety of its products, the FDA also has the power to intervene when necessary to protect the public but in general does not require pre-market approval or testing. The ACSH says that companies are required to place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested and that experts in cosmetic ingredient reviews also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on the use of ingredients, but also lack legal authority. According to the ACSH, overall the organization has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted, but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety and a clear definition of what is meant by 'safety' so that all chemicals are tested on the same basis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ross G |title=A perspective on the safety of cosmetic products: a position paper of the American Council on Science and Health |journal=Int.

The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were scheduled to be required to appear on packaging by September 2012. The implementation date is uncertain, due to ongoing proceedings in the case of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v.

===Regulation of living organisms===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}
With acceptance of premarket notification 510(k) k033391 in January 2004, the FDA granted Dr. Ronald Sherman permission to produce and market [[medical maggots]] for use in humans or other animals as a prescription medical device. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device.

In June 2004, the FDA cleared ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'' (medicinal leeches) as the second living organism to be used as a medical device.

The FDA also requires milk to be [[pasteurized]] to remove [[bacteria]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==History==
{{Main|History of the Food and Drug Administration}}

Up until the 20th century, there were few federal laws regulating the contents and sale of domestically produced food and pharmaceuticals, with one exception being the short-lived [[Vaccine Act of 1813]]. The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Division of Chemistry]], later its '''Bureau of Chemistry.''' Under [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Wiley's advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalists like [[Upton Sinclair]], and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the [[Progressive Era]].<ref name="FDAHist">{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm|title=FDA History&nbsp;— Part I|publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref> The [[Biologics Control Act|Biologics Control Act of 1902]] was put in place after a [[diphtheria]] antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse name [[Jim (horse)|Jim]] who had contracted tetanus.

[[File:Portrait of Dr. Harvey W. Wiley (FDA 107) (8203830456).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harvey W. Wiley]], chief advocate of the Food and Drug Act]]

In June 1906, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed into law the [[Pure Food and Drug Act|Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]], also known as the "Wiley Act" after its chief advocate.<ref name="FDAHist"/> The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food that had been "adulterated". The Act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of "adulterated" drugs, in which the "standard of strength, quality, or purity" of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the ''[[United States Pharmacopeia]]'' or the ''[[National Formulary]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/wileyact.htm|title=Laws Enforced by FDA|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|publisher=Food and Drug Administration}}</ref>

The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such "adulteration" or "misbranding" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.<ref name="FDAHist"/> Wiley used these new regulatory powers to pursue an aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau's authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, which narrowly defined the bureau's powers and set high standards for proof of fraudulent intent.<ref name="FDAHist"/> In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-03-14|title=History of FDA's Internal Organization|url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/history-fdas-fight-consumer-protection-and-public-health/history-fdas-internal-organization|access-date=2020-10-03|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en}}</ref> This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later.<ref name="milestones">{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/miles.html|title=Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History}}</ref>

By the 1930s, [[Muckraker|muckraking]] journalists, consumer protection organizations, and federal regulators began mounting a campaign for stronger regulatory authority by publicizing a list of injurious products that had been ruled permissible under the 1906 law, including [[radioactive]] [[beverages]], the [[mascara]] Lash lure which caused blindness, and worthless "cures" for [[diabetes]] and [[tuberculosis]]. The resulting proposed law was unable to get through the [[Congress of the United States]] for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir Sulfanilamide]] tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|title=Medical Disasters and the Growth of FDA|date=February 2010|page=7|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf|access-date=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signed the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove [[fraudulent intent]]. Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of "[[Prescription drug|prescription-only]]" drugs was securely codified into law by the [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]] in 1951. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs.<ref name="FDAHist"/>

Outside of the US, the drug [[thalidomide]] was marketed for the relief of general nausea and [[morning sickness]], but caused birth defects and even the death of thousands of babies when taken during pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/87th/620817.html Report of Congressman Morris Udall on thalidomide and the Kefauver hearings].</ref> American mothers were largely unaffected as Dr. [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] of the FDA refused to authorize the medication for market. In 1962, the [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]] to the FD&C Act was passed, which represented a "revolution" in FDA regulatory authority.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Temple |first = R |year=2002 |title=Policy developments in regulatory approval |journal=Statistics in Medicine |pmid=12325110 |volume=21 |issue=19 |pages=2939–2948 |doi=10.1002/sim.1298 |url = https://zenodo.org/record/1229361 }}</ref> The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate "substantial evidence" of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety. This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern form.

These reforms had the effect of increasing the time, and the difficulty, required to bring a drug to market.<ref name="'70s 180">{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/180 180]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/180}}</ref>  One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]], more commonly known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act" after its chief sponsors. The act extended the patent exclusivity terms of new drugs, and tied those extensions, in part, to the length of the FDA approval process for each individual drug. For generic manufacturers, the Act created a new approval mechanism, the [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA), in which the generic drug manufacturer need only demonstrate that their generic formulation has the same active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties ("bioequivalence") as the corresponding brand-name drug. This Act has been credited with, in essence, creating the modern generic drug industry.<ref name="HatchWaxman">{{cite journal |last=Karki |first = L. |year=2005 |title=Review of FDA Law Related to Pharmaceuticals: The Hatch-Waxman Act, Regulatory Amendments and Implications for Drug Patent Enforcement |journal=Journal of the Patent & Trademark Office Society |volume=87 |pages=602–620 }}</ref>

Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the [[AIDS]] epidemic. In the mid- and late 1980s, [[ACT-UP]] and other [[HIV]] activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html|title=ACT UP/NY Chronology 1988|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref>  Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/SpeedingAccesstoImportantNewTherapies/ucm181838.htm |title=FDA Website: Expanded Access and Expedited Approval of New Therapies Related to HIV/AIDS |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 1, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101115339/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/SpeedingAccesstoImportantNewTherapies/ucm181838.htm }}</ref> All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through these accelerated approval mechanisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/speeding.html |title=FDA report on accelerated approval process |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082655/https://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/speeding.html }}</ref> Frank Young, then commissioner of the FDA, was behind the Action Plan Phase II, established in August 1987 for quicker approval of AIDS medication.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Reagan, Regulation, and the FDA: The US Food and Drug Administration's Response to HIV/AIDS, 1980–90|last = Richert|first = Lucas|date = 2009|journal = Canadian Journal of History|volume = 44|issue = 3|pages = 467–488|doi = 10.3138/cjh.44.3.467}}</ref>

In two instances, state governments have sought to legalize drugs that the FDA has not approved. Under the theory that federal law, passed pursuant to Constitutional authority, overrules conflicting state laws, federal authorities still claim the authority to seize, arrest, and prosecute for possession and sales of these substances,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} even in states where they are legal under state law. The first wave was the legalization by 27 states of [[laetrile]] in the late 1970s. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=127773447|title=Medicinal Marijuana: A Patient-Driven Phenomenon|date=June 14, 2010|work=NPR.org|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name="quack-laetrile">{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html|title=The Rise and Fall of Laetrile|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref> The second wave concerned [[medical marijuana]] in the 1990s and 2000s. Though [[Cannabis in Virginia|Virginia passed legislation]] allowing doctors to recommend cannabis for glaucoma or the side effects of chemotherapy, a more widespread trend began in California with the [[1996 California Proposition 215|Compassionate Use Act of 1996]].

The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/CriticalPathOpportunitiesReports/ucm077262.htm Innovation or Stagnation:  Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products] FDA.

===Patients' rights to access unapproved drugs===
The [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] was created after ''Randall v. U.S.'' ruled in favor of [[Robert C. Randall]] in 1978, creating a program for [[medical marijuana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dp3e4y/the-us-government-has-sent-this-guy-300-joints-each-month-for-34-years|title=The US Government Has Sent This Guy 300 Joints Each Month for 34 Years|date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

A 2006 court case, ''[[Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach]]'', would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The Abigail Alliance argued that the FDA must license drugs for use by terminally ill patients with "desperate diagnoses," after they have completed Phase I testing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abigail-alliance.org/WLF_FDA.pdf |title= Abigail Alliance Citizen Petition to FDA |access-date= March 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070221153207/http://abigail-alliance.org/WLF_FDA.pdf |archive-date= February 21, 2007 |url-status= dead }}&nbsp;{{small|(119&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> The case won an initial appeal in May 2006, but that decision was reversed by a March 2007 rehearing. The [[US Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, and the final decision denied the existence of a right to unapproved medications.

[[Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration|Critics]] of the FDA's regulatory power argue that the FDA takes too long to approve drugs that might ease pain and human suffering faster if brought to market sooner.  The AIDS crisis created some political efforts to streamline the approval process.  However, these limited reforms were targeted for AIDS drugs, not for the broader market.  This has led to the call for more robust and enduring reforms that would allow patients, under the care of their doctors, access to drugs that have passed the first round of clinical trials.<ref>{{cite book |title=Free To Choose Medicine: How Faster Access to New Drugs Would Save Countless Lives and End Needless Suffering: Bartley J.

===Post-marketing drug safety monitoring===
The widely publicized recall of [[Vioxx]], a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) now estimated to have contributed to fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] in thousands of Americans, played a strong role in driving a new wave of safety reforms at both the FDA rulemaking and statutory levels. Vioxx was approved by the FDA in 1999 and was initially hoped to be safer than previous NSAIDs, due to its reduced risk of intestinal tract bleeding. However, a number of pre- and post-marketing studies suggested that Vioxx might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, and this was conclusively demonstrated by results from the APPROVe trial in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib in a colorectal adenoma chemoprevention trial|last=Bresalier |first=RS |s2cid=8161299 |pmid=15713943 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa050493 |volume=352 |issue=11 |date=March 2005 |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |pages=1092–102}}</ref>

Faced with numerous lawsuits, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it from the market. The example of Vioxx has been prominent in an ongoing debate over whether new drugs should be evaluated on the basis of their absolute safety, or their safety relative to existing treatments for a given condition. In the wake of the Vioxx recall, there were widespread calls by major newspapers, medical journals, consumer advocacy organizations, lawmakers, and FDA officials<ref name="Graham">{{cite web|url= http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/111804dgtest.pdf |title=David Graham's 2004 testimony to Congress }}&nbsp;{{small|(28.3&nbsp;KB)}} Retrieved August 30, 2012.</ref> for reforms in the FDA's procedures for pre- and post-market drug safety regulation.

In 2006, a [[United States congressional committee|Congressional committee]] was appointed by the [[Institute of Medicine]] to review pharmaceutical safety regulation in the U.S. and to issue recommendations for improvements. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, [[biostatistics]], law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the [[drug company|pharmaceutical]], hospital, and [[health insurance]] industries. The authors found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Panel: FDA needs more power, funds |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=September 23, 2006}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20121023223500/http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2006/09/23/panel_fda_needs_more_power_funds/ Webcitation.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11750&page=205 Books.nap.edu] Executive Summary of the 2006 IOM Report ''The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public''</ref> Some of the committee's recommendations were incorporated into drafts of the PDUFA IV amendment, which was signed into law as the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/advance/fdaaa.html|title=Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref>

As of 2011, Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPS) have been created to ensure risks of a drug never outweigh the benefits of that drug within the post-marketing period. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. The Risk Minimization Action Plans are set in place depending on the overall level of risk a prescription drug is likely to pose to the public.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Qato DM, Alexander GC |title=Post-Marketing Drug Safety and the Food and Drug Administration's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies|journal=JAMA|volume=306|pages=1595–1596|year=2011|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1457|pmid=21990303|issue=14}}</ref>

===Pediatric drug testing===
Prior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} This became a major concern of [[pediatrician]]s as evidence accumulated that the physiological response of children to many drugs differed significantly from those drugs' effects on adults. Children react differently to the drugs because of many reasons, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that few medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.<ref name = "PedReg"/>

Also, because children were thought to be ethically restricted in their ability to give [[informed consent]], there were increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, as well as greater concerns about [[legal liability]]. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, "off-label" manner, with dosages "extrapolated" from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.<ref name = "PedReg"/>

An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of [[New Drug Application]]s. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA's statutory authority.<ref name="PedReg">{{Cite journal|author=Politis P |year=2005 |title=Transition From the Carrot to the Stick: The Evolution of Pharmaceutical Regulations Concerning Pediatric Drug Testing |journal=Widener Law Review |volume=12 |page=271}}</ref>

While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act|Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997]] to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The [[Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act|Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007]] reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the [[Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003]], Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a "last resort" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.<ref name="PedReg"/>

===Priority review voucher (PRV)===
The [[priority review voucher]] is a provision of the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]], which awards a transferable "priority review voucher" to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a [[neglected tropical diseases]]. The system was first proposed by [[Duke University]] faculty David Ridley, Henry Grabowski, and Jeffrey Moe in their 2006 ''[[Health Affairs]]'' paper: "Developing Drugs for Developing Countries".<ref name=Ridley06>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridley DB, Grabowski HG, Moe JL |title=Developing drugs for developing countries |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16522573 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.313 |doi-access=free }}</ref> President Obama signed into law the [[Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act|Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012]] which extended the authorization until 2017.<ref name="PLAW_2012">{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ144/pdf/PLAW-112publ144.pdf | title=Section 529 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Incentive Program, Public Law 112-144 | publisher=Public Law | date=July 9, 2012 | access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>

===Rules for generic biologics===
Since the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of [[cancer]], [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], and other conditions have been [[protein]]-based [[biologic medical product|biotechnology drugs]], regulated by the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]]. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug [[Avastin]] costs $55,000 for a year of treatment,{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} while the [[enzyme replacement therapy]] drug [[Imiglucerase|Cerezyme]] costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by [[Gaucher's Disease]] patients for life.<ref name="govtrack.us">{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr1038|title=To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the licensing of comparable and interchangeable biological products, and for other purposes.

Biotechnology drugs do not have the simple, readily verifiable chemical structures of conventional drugs, and are produced through complex, often proprietary, techniques, such as transgenic mammalian cell cultures. Because of these complexities, the 1984 [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act|Hatch-Waxman Act]] did not include biologics in the [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA) process. This precluded the possibility of generic drug competition for biotechnology drugs. In February 2007, identical bills were introduced into the House to create an ANDA process for the approval of generic biologics, but were not passed.<ref name="govtrack.us"/>

===Mobile medical applications===
In 2013, a guidance was issued to regulate [[mobile medical apps|mobile medical applications]] and protect users from their unintended use. This guidance distinguishes the apps subjected to regulation based on the marketing claims of the apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ConnectedHealth/MobileMedicalApplications/ucm255978.htm|title=Mobile Medical Applications|publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref> Incorporation of the guidelines during the development phase of these apps has been proposed for expedited market entry and clearance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yetisen A.

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration}}
The FDA has regulatory oversight over a large array of products that affect the health and life of American citizens.<ref name="FDAHist"/> As a result, the FDA's powers and decisions are carefully monitored by several governmental and non-governmental organizations. A $1.8{{nbsp}}million 2006 [[Institute of Medicine]] report on pharmaceutical regulation in the U.S. found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the [[regulations|regulatory powers]], funding, and independence of the FDA.<ref name=IOM2006>{{Cite book|first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Panel: FDA needs more power, funds |work= The Boston Globe |date=September 23, 2006}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20121023223500/http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2006/09/23/panel_fda_needs_more_power_funds/ Webcitation.org]</ref><ref>Committee on the Assessment of the US Drug Safety System. (2006). ''The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public''. [[Institute of Medicine]]. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11750#toc Free full-text].</ref>

Nine FDA scientists appealed to then president-elect [[Barack Obama]] over pressures from management, experienced during the [[George W. Bush]] presidency, to manipulate data, including in relation to the review process for medical devices. Characterized as "corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk," these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report<ref name=IOM2006/> on the agency as well.<ref>{{cite news |vauthors=Mundy A, Favole JA |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123142562104564381 |title=FDA Scientists Ask Obama to Restructure Drug Agency |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 8, 2009}}</ref>

The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. According to an analysis published on the website of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Mercatus Center]], many feel the FDA oversteps its regulatory powers, and undermines small business and small farms in favor of large corporations. Three of the FDA restrictions under their analysis are the permitting of new drugs and devices, the control of manufacturer speech, and the imposition of prescription requirements. The authors argue that in the increasingly complex and diverse food marketplace, the FDA is not equipped to adequately regulate or inspect food.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Williams, Richard |author2=Robert Scharff |author3=David Bieler  |name-list-style=amp |date=February 2010 |title=Food Safety in the 21st Century |work=Mercatus On Policy |page=71 |url=http://mercatus.org/publication/food-safety-21st-century}}</ref>{{verify source|date=May 2013}}

However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. [[Diana Zuckerman]] and Paul Brown of the [[National Research Center for Women and Families]], and Dr. [[Steven Nissen]] of the [[Cleveland Clinic]], published in the [[Archives of Internal Medicine]], showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for "serious health problems or death" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, [[510(k)|510(k) process]].  In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.  Of the 113 devices recalled, 35 were for cardiovascular health purposes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Medical Device Recalls and the FDA Approval Process |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=171 |issue=11 |pages=1006–11 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.30 |pmid=21321283 |year=2011 |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Diana M. |last2=Brown |first2=Paul |last3=Nissen |first3=Steven E. |doi-access=free }}</ref>
