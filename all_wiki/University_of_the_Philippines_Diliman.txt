[[File:UP Oblation 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Oblation Plaza showing the Oblation monument and the facade of Quezon Hall.]]
The population of students continued to rise in succeeding years, reaching to 7,849 in 1928 from the initial 67 when the university was established in 1908. The need became apparent for UP to create more buildings and academic units, which would have been hampered by its small location in the heart of Manila. In 1939, the Board of Regents acquired a 493-hectare land in the Diliman District of the newly established Quezon City. Construction began on the area on the same year. The development of the area was then stalled by World War II, with invading Japanese troops occupying some of the buildings built. By 1942, the university was forced to close down some of its colleges, with only the Colleges of Medicine, Engineering, and Pharmacy maintaining their operations.

When the war ended in 1945, the buildings intended to be the homes of the College of Law and the College of Liberal Arts were left with extensive damages. The university administration led by UP President Bienvenido Gonzales sought a grant worth P13 million from the US-Philippines War Damage Commission to restore the damaged facilities and to construct new ones so that the transfer of the university from Manila to Diliman could be pushed through. Through a symbolic ceremony of transferring the Oblation from Manila to Diliman, the whole university's administration was relocated to the new campus. New buildings were constructed in response to the creation of more academic degrees.

Organization of the newly established institutes and the reformulation of programs followed with the establishment of programs such as the General Education Program, a delegated roster of core courses required to be taken by all students at the undergraduate level. Under the presidency of UP President Vicente Sinco, a University College was made to address the need of a much-organized college structure. The College of Arts and Sciences was created to offer major subjects in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.

By the end of [[Carlos P. Romulo]]'s term as UP President in 1968, UP had also become not only an institution of education, but also a center of research, a veritable think tank, while many of its faculty served as advisers and consultants in the national government. Romulo's administration was marked by the establishment of the Population Institute, the Law Center and the Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry Training Center in 1964, the Institute of Mass Communication (now [[College of Mass Communication]]), the College of Business Administration, and the Institute of Planning in 1965, the [[UP Computer Center]], the Institute for Small-Scale Industries in 1966, the Institute of Social Work and Community Development in 1967 and the Asian Center in 1968.

UP Diliman became the bastion of activism in the 1960s and 1970s, with various tumultuous events eventually contributing to the declaration of Martial Law in 1972.<ref name="STP">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzJOswEACAAJ |title=Serve the people: ang kasaysayan ng radikal na kilusan sa Unibersidad ng Pilipinas |last1=Lumbera |first1=Bienvenido |last2=Taguiwalo |first2=Judy |last3=Tolentino |first3=Roland |last4=Guillermo |first4=Ramon |last5=Alamon |first5=Arnold |date=2008 |publisher=Ibon Books |isbn=978-971-0483-43-3 |language=tl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rodis|first=Rodel|title=First Quarter Storm remembered|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20100204-251226/First-Quarter-Storm-remembered|accessdate=August 4, 2010|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=February 4, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209045654/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20100204-251226/First-Quarter-Storm-remembered|archivedate=February 9, 2010}}</ref> In this period, UP Diliman became a center of dissent towards the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]]' administration. The year 1971 marked an important event in the Philippine history when the entire Diliman campus was declared the [[Diliman Commune]], and became free from government control. Students and faculty members took over the campus in response to increasing military presence and the increase of oil prices. The students established full control of the campus for a month, barricading the streets with chairs and tables.

The university sustained its priorities of pushing for advancement in education despite the political unrest during the 1970s. Under the leadership of UP President Salvador P. Lopez, UP Diliman was given part of the P150 million grant from the national budget to improve infrastructure.  It funded the construction of the buildings for the College of Business Administration, Zoology, the Institute of Small-Scale Industries, the Transport Training Center and the Coral Laboratory of the Marine Sciences Institute.

The Management Review Committee (MRC) was created by UP President [[Edgardo Angara]] in the 1980s to evaluate and recommend measures for the university's improvement. The report made by the MRC led to the decision of the Board of Regents to further decentralize the UP administration, declaring UP Diliman an autonomous unit and the system's flagship university on March 23, 1983. This also furthered the reorganization of some major units of the university, with the College of Arts and Sciences being split into three colleges: the College of Science, the [[College of Arts and Letters]] and the [[College of Social Sciences and Philosophy]]. UP Diliman was formally established as a constituent university on April 23, 1985 at the 976th Meeting of the U.P. Board of Regents.<ref name="Gen Catalogue 2004-10">{{cite book|title=University of the Philippines Diliman General Catalogue 2004-2010|year=2007|publisher=University of the Philippines Diliman|location=Quezon City|author=Office of the University Registrar}}</ref>

By the turn of the new millennium, UP Diliman led other universities with the installation of a fiber-optic network linking the different colleges in the campus. The Diliman Network, or DilNet, became the university's access point to the internet. Recently and with the help of the Quezon City government, the University of the Philippines entered into contracts with various entities to maximize the use of several leasable land assets in the UP Diliman campus. One example of which is the [[U.P.-Ayala Land TechnoHub]].

[[File:National Science Complex.jpg|thumbnail|upright=2.5|left|A panoramic view of the National Science Complex, with the amphitheater at the center]]
Infrastructure development has been ongoing on campus in the last three years as part of two major programs: the National Science Complex (NSC) and the Engineering Research and Development Technology (ERDT) Consortium.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In a bid to boost initiatives in the sciences and technology, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo established the NSC through Executive Order 583 on December 8, 2006 to be administered and operated by the College of Science. Some ₱2 billion was allocated to the program to increase research and technological capacity in the country. Of that amount, ₱1.7 billion was earmarked for the construction of the NSC; in particular, the completion of the buildings for the National Institute of Physics and the Institute of Mathematics. It also funded the construction of buildings for the Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Biology, the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology and the College of Science Administration buildings.<ref name="Chancellor 2011">{{cite book|title=UPD Chancellor's End of Term Report News Magazine|year=2011|publisher=Office of the Chancellor|location=Quezon City|editor=Defeo, Ruben D.F.}}</ref>

The ERDT, on the other hand, is a 10-year program that seeks, among others, to attain “a critical mass of MS and PhD graduates in engineering; upgrade the qualifications of practicing engineers; provide accessible graduate education; upgrade engineering colleges; and develop a culture of research & development.”<ref name="Chancellor 2011" />

The ERDT is implemented by a consortium of seven (7) universities in the country offering Master's and Doctoral degrees in the various engineering fields. As part of the program, funds have enabled the construction of the following buildings for the units under the U.P.D. College of Engineering, namely: Chemical Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, Institute of Civil Engineering; Mining, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Industrial Engineer/Mechanical Engineering, and Energy and Environmental Engineering.<ref name="Chancellor 2011" />

===The Oblation and Academic Oval===
{{main|Oblation (University of the Philippines)}}
[[File:UPDilimanObationLanternParade.jpg|thumb|right|The Oblation statue being lit up during the campus' Lantern Parade]]
The U.P. Diliman campus is connected to Commonwealth Avenue via the University Avenue. It stretches {{convert|800|m|sp=us}} where traffic enters the campus, or proceeds towards C.P. Garcia St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the [[UP Oblation|Oblation]] Plaza of the Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the facade of Quezon Hall can be seen.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The [[Oblation]] statue ({{lang-tl|Pahinungod/Oblasyon}}) is the most iconic figure of the U.P. System. The statue was originally created by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] [[Guillermo Tolentino|Guillermo E. Tolentino]] in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the U.P. System.<ref name="michael tan"/> During the 40th anniversary of the University of the Philippines in 1949, the Oblation was transferred to Diliman in Quezon City from their original site along Padre Faura St. in Manila as a symbol of transfer of administrative seat.<ref name="Oble3">''Exodus Marker'', Quezon Hall, University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City.

Several replicas of Tolentino's Oblation statue were created during the creation of new U.P. campuses, some were made by the National Artist [[Napoleon Abueva]]. U.P. Diliman's Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino's.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The main and largest road in the university is the '''Academic Oval''', informally known as "Acad Oval." This road is composed of two joining avenues, the [[Manuel Roxas|Roxas]] and [[Sergio Osmeña|Osmeña]] Avenues. Having a total circumference of about {{convert|2.2|km|sp=us}}, the oval connects the rest of the colleges of the university from the main University Avenue. The avenue derives its name from several colleges located around it, namely the College of Mass Communication, College of Music, College of Engineering, College of Law, School of Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy and School of Library and Information Studies. The oval also covers Quezon Hall, the U.P. Theater, National Engineering Center, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, Center for International Studies and Jorge B.

The Alumni Walk was launched in U.P.’s centennial year in 2008. A project of the UPD administration under then Chancellor Sergio S. Cao, the project sought to transform the inner sidewalk of the Academic Oval into a tile-paved footpath with commemorative slabs bearing UPD alumni-donors’ names, and whose donations went to the UPD Faculty Development Fund.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pineda|first=Haidee C.|title=A true academic haven|newspaper=UPdate Diliman|pages=9|date=July–December 2009}}</ref> In March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university.

===Quezon Hall===
[[File:UP Quezon Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Quezon Hall]]
Quezon Hall is the seat of administration of both the UP System and UPD, was designed by [[Juan Nakpil]], who was conferred the first National Artist for Architecture title in 1973. He was one of eight children of the Philippine Revolution veterans Julio Nakpil and Gregoria de Jesús (who married the former after the death of her first husband Andrés Bonifacio).<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Artists of the Philippines |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca/org-awards/architecture/juan_nakpil.php |publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726105103/http://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca/org-awards/architecture/juan_nakpil.php |archivedate=July 26, 2014 }}</ref>

It is the front-most building of the university from the University Avenue. It houses many of the administrative offices for the entire university. It is situated behind the Oblation statue as a gateway or entrance position, with four columns supporting the main hall itself. The building is classified as eclectic architecture. Eclectic Architecture can be described as using the elements of different historical styles and multiple theories in a single structure. It is the combination of variety of influences.

Quezon Hall was among the buildings constructed at the Diliman campus in the early 1950s, following the university's exodus from Padre Faura to Diliman in 1949. An imposing colonial structure at the end of the University Avenue, it was completed in 1950.

A marker from the National Historical Institute (NHI) is located in its front lawn along with the oblation statue.

Due to age and rust, the Carillon ceased to play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of ''U.P. Naming Mahal'' and ''Push On U.P.!'' (U.P. Diliman's athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December's Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18"/> But as late as 2001, students say that they can hear the rhymes of ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]'' and ''Sing a Song of Six Pence'' despite being closed to prevent further mishap.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18"/>

In 2005, through the collective efforts of the U.P. Alumni Association and various private donors, the U.P. Carillon Restoration Project of the U.P. Centennial Commission launched a fund-raising program to collect ₱20 million to restore the Carillon, as a projection of using the tower again in the coming 100th year of the [[University of the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UP Carillon|url=http://www.upcarillon.org/about_project.html|work=The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project|accessdate=August 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903171324/http://www.upcarillon.org/about_project.html|archivedate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> After two years, the Project was able to collect ₱14 million which will be used to clean up and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.<ref name="Restoring the UP Carillon’s history">{{cite news|last=de Guzman Jr.|first=Marcos|title=Restoring the UP Carillon's history|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070609-70321/Restoring_the_UP_Carillon%92s_history|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=June 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130221160027/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070609-70321/Restoring_the_UP_Carillon%92s_history|archivedate=February 21, 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, the Carillon was formally reintroduced to the public after two years of restoration. The original 48 bells were put into archives and are now replaced by 36 bells bought from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Petit & Fritsen|Petit and Fritsen]] for ₱12 million whereas the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% combination of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[phosphorus]]. At the same time, the largest of these bells weighs {{convert|635|kg}} and the smallest weighs {{convert|14|kg}}.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18"/> The original wood claviers were replaced by heavy duty oakwood while all bells are designed to hold refurbished steel pipes.<ref name="Restoring the UP Carillon’s history"/> Another project engineer Eduardo Otacan also said that the new bells will have 3 octaves and they can be programmed using computers attached to the clavier.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18"/>

At the same time, a small amphitheater named Carillon Plaza was constructed at the base of the tower. After about two decades of silence, the U.P. Carillon was heard again during the Lantern Parade of 2007.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18"/>

[[File:Sunken Garden, UP Diliman.jpg|thumb|right|The Sunken Garden during the summer]]
The Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] Parade Grounds, or commonly known as the '''Sunken Garden''', is a {{convert|5|ha|adj=on}} natural depression found on the eastern side of the campus and at the end of the Academic Oval circle. Sunken Garden is enclosed by the UP Diliman Main Library, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy's Department of Psychology, College of Education, Student Activity Center/[[Wenceslao Vinzons|Vinzons]] Hall, College of Business Administration, School of Economics and College of Law. The Grounds was originally a property of the UP Reserved Officers' Training Corps when the campus was founded in 1949.<ref name="luna">{{cite web|title=General Antonio Luna Parade Grounds|url=http://www.uprotc.org/facility/gen-antonio-luna-parade-grounds.html|publisher=UP ROTC|accessdate=August 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712022227/http://www.uprotc.org/facility/gen-antonio-luna-parade-grounds.html|archivedate=July 12, 2010}}</ref>

Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name ''Sunken Garden'' due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to university's height of over hundreds of meters above sea level).<ref name="The truth behind the myth">{{cite web|last=Sarmiento|first=Christine Joy|title=The truth behind the myth|url=http://dilimangenius.webs.com/maharlagmay.htm|work=UP College of Mass Communication|accessdate=August 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814160226/http://dilimangenius.webs.com/maharlagmay.htm|archivedate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> The Sunken Garden is the venue of the annual U.P. Fair as well as for sports tournaments, including [[association football|football]], [[frisbee]] and [[volleyball]]. Sometimes, the Department of Military Science and Tactics hold training in the area.<ref name="luna"/>

According to local lore, the Sunken Garden sinks by about two inches every year. Though this has not been verified in any study, some have posited reasons for the sinking: one is that it is because of underground trenches over the campus' sewer system that connect to the Marikina [[Fault (geology)|Fault Line]], an active geologic structure that runs across the east of [[Metro Manila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geologic Map of Diliman, Quezon City and the Marikina Fault Line|url=http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/images/active/Hazard%20Maps/Active%20Fault%20Maps/Valley_fault_maps/diliman_q.pdf|publisher=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology|accessdate=August 8, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that were prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue.<ref name="The truth behind the myth"/>

The academic arms of the university are called [[college]]s, [[institute]]s, or [[school]]s. A number of colleges and schools offer a variety of undergraduate, graduate, and diploma programs, while some offer programs only within a specific field. Most institutes offer no degrees, but provide research facilities for academic development.

Each college or school is headed by a dean, who is appointed by the U.P. Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the chancellor and the president of the university. The dean acts as the head of the faculty of his college and assumes administrative duties assigned by the Board. The dean has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment. The associate dean, on the other hand, assists the dean in the administration of the unit. The tenure of the associate dean is determined by the Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the chancellor and the dean.<ref name="manual p 10">{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=August 9, 2010|page=10|year=2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614151431/http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

Some of U.P. Diliman's academic arms assume the title of "Institute" (such as the Asian Institute of Tourism, and the Institute of Islamic Studies) and function as their own units, with their own departments. Some institutes are within colleges (such as the Institute of Civil Engineering within the College of Engineering). Some of U.P. Diliman's academic arms also assume the title of "School" (such as the School of Economics), which might function independently and have their own departments or which may operate as a unit within a particular college.

U.P. Diliman's institutes are headed by institute directors, who assume the duties assigned by the chancellor. Each director has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon the reappointment of the chancellor. A director cannot not be an academic head of any department or division under his institute. Each college or school is composed of clusters of institutes or departments.

The university's departments are headed by department chairs, who assume the duties assigned by the dean and the chancellor. Each chair is appointed by the chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment.<ref name="manual p 10"/>

Some units of the university are known as '''National Institutes''', such as the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The status of being an institute is determined by the Board of Regents, but recognition as a national institute is governed by Philippine legislation.<ref name="EO 889">{{cite web|title=Executive Order 889: Establishing a System of National Centers of Excellence in the Basic Sciences|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1983/eo_889_1983.html|accessdate=August 9, 2010|author=[[Ferdinand Marcos]]|date=March 23, 1983|quote=The Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines is hereby authorized to organize the above-mentioned institutes, and such other additional institutes and laboratories in the future it may deem proper to create, from out of the existing staff, physical facilities and programs of the University and its constituent units.}}</ref> The head of a national institute, also the director, is not appointed by the chancellor but by the president of the university.<ref name="manual p 10"/>

===Grading System and Academic Calendar===
Academic performance is rated from 1.00 being excellent to 5.00 as failed. Grades from 1.00 to 3.00 are separated by increments of 0.25, while 3.00 is followed immediately by 4.00 and then 5.00. Some professors use 0.50 as increments instead, and some colleges, particularly the College of Engineering do not give 4.00 grades. A grade of four (4.00) is a conditional grade and a student needs to remove the grade of 4.00 during a prescribed period (usually determined by the college where he/she is enrolled) or else it will become 5.00 once the period has lapsed. A conditional grade can only be removed by a removal exam; if the student passes the exam, he/she will obtain a grade of 3.00, otherwise it is 5.00. An alternative for 4.00 is the rating of "INC", which means ''incomplete'', and is given to students who have unfinished requirements for a particular subject. If a student drops the subject before the "subject dropping period" his/her record for that subject will be replaced by "DRP".<ref>{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=May 15, 2012|page=197|year=2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310092302/http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=May 15, 2012|page=235|year=2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310092302/http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

As part of the [[University of the Philippines System]], U.P. Diliman is also considered as an [[State university and college (Philippines)|SUC]] and the only [[national university]] of the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|title=About UP|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/site/content7a0b.html?r=2&c=2|publisher=University of the Philippines|accessdate=May 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507180512/http://up.edu.ph/site/content7a0b.html?r=2&c=2|archivedate=May 7, 2012}}</ref> The nature of the University of the Philippines put it in a position where it does not need any accreditation by any other local body.<ref>{{cite web|title=Are UP's programs accredited nationally and internationally?|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/site/content1a55.html?r=27&c=90|work=Pamela C.

== Culture, sports and traditions ==

The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as the ''Diliman Republic'' and a "microcosm of the Philippines". It is the only university in [[Metro Manila]] that has its own [[jeepney]] transportation system due to its sheer size. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university only operates [[DZUP 1602]], a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities. On the other hand, ''[[The Philippine Collegian]]'' is the official student publication of the university, and one of only three{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} tertiary-level campus publications in the Philippines released weekly.

U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP) and participates in all events. The [[Fighting Maroons]] have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. One of the most popular athletic teams in the program is the [[UP Pep Squad|U.P. Pep Squad]], a heavyweight in the annual [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]].

Two of the most-awaited events in the campus are the Lantern Parade, held in the last week before the [[Christmas]] break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, the individual colleges as well as groups within U.P.D. create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval, culminating in a lengthy program held in front of the Amphitheater capped off by a massive fireworks display. In recent years the event has become so popular even outside of UP that media outlets and major Manila television networks regularly send crews to broadcast the event live.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morong|first=Joseph|title=Makukulay at naggagandahang floats, bumida sa UP Lantern Parade|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/102701/makukulay-at-naggagandahang-floats-bumida-sa-up-lantern-parade|publisher=GMA Network, Inc.|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>

The U.P. Fair, organized by the [[UP Diliman University Student Council]], is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features evening music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides. Typically falling during the third week of February, students and youth even from outside the U.P. System flock to the nightly concerts.

==Centennial Celebration==
[[File:Oblation Plaza during fireworks display.jpg|thumb|right|View of Quezon Hall from the University Avenue during U.P.D.'s 2011 Lantern Parade]]
On January 8, 2008, the [[University of the Philippines System]], with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. The university has produced 7 of 15 presidents, 12 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, and an estimated 250,000 alumni (15,000 doctors, 8,000 lawyers and 23,000 teachers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view_article.php?article_id=110945|title=Inquirer Opinion - Inquirer Opinion|accessdate=July 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924053338/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view_article.php?article_id=110945|archivedate=September 24, 2009}}</ref> Of the senators serving in the 2010–2013 term, 14 were from UP.<ref name="investvine">{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/up-diliman-a-nation-builder/|title=UP Diliman: A nation builder for the Philippines|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Inside Investor|date=April 21, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>

Fernando Javier, 100, of [[Baguio]], oldest living U.P. [[alumnus]] ([[Civil Engineering]] from the [[University of the Philippines Manila]], 1933), began the 100-torch relay at the U.P. academic oval in Diliman, Quezon City. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the [[University of the Philippines Integrated School]] in U.P. Diliman. Then U.P. president [[Emerlinda R. Roman]], also its first woman president, ignited the centennial [[cauldron]] in front of the U.P. [[Oblation]] plaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080106-110642/UP_passes_torch_100-yr-old_to_6th_grader|title=UP passes torch: 100-yr-old to 6th grader - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|accessdate=July 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307171230/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080106-110642/UP_passes_torch_100-yr-old_to_6th_grader|archivedate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

The cauldron featured three pillars representing the University's core values of Excellence, Leadership, and Service and 7 flowers representing the constituent universities, to wit, U.P. Manila, U.P. Diliman (together with U.P. Pampanga, its extension campus), U.P. Los Baños, U.P. Baguio, U.P. Visayas, U.P. Mindanao, and U.P.

The centennial celebration came with a massive fund-raising campaign for the U.P. System, and generous donations from alumni came pouring in. One of the largest was the GT-Toyota Asian Cultural (ACC) Center, a gleaming 100-million-peso, one-hectare complex envisioned to be a major hub of campus activity as well as the main site of the Asian Center's different collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Regidor|first=Anna Kristine|title=New Asian Center building inaugurated|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/octnovdec08/articles/asiangallery2009B.html|publisher=UP Diliman Information Office|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>
