'''HitQuarters''' was an international music industry publication and contact database founded in 1999. It was noted for its in-depth interviews with industry figures, as well as its A&R and manager contact directory, free artist promo pages and song sale facility, demo reviews and A&R chart,<ref name="laweekly.com">[http://www.laweekly.com/2010-02-11/music/a-r-star-makers-the-vanishing-gatekeepers/ "A&R Star Makers: The Vanishing Gatekeepers"], ''LA Weekly'', 11 February 2010.</ref>{{deadurl|date=October 2020}} and was the sister site to the songwriting tip sheet SongQuarters. The site was sporadically active from May 2017 up until September 20, 2020, and no posts have been made on its Twitter and Facebook accounts since March and May 2015 respectively.

==Focus on aiding unsigned and independent artists==
The website had a strong focus on offering unsigned and independent artists, songwriters and producers with tools to help develop their music careers, whether through attracting the attentions of record label A&R and management, pitching songs and tracks, releasing and marketing music independently, or just learning more about how the music industry works.

To this aim the website featured an extensive contact database known as HitTracker, where users could find contact information for A&R, publishers, managers, producers and songwriters based on their track records, a news bulletin service, free artist promo pages, demo review feature judged by A&Rs, producers and managers, and an archive of several hundred interviews with industry figures that were geared towards offering constructive career advice and industry know-how.<ref name="soundonsound.com">[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov00/articles/faqdemo.htm "Demo Directions"], ''Sound On Sound'', November 2000.</ref>

Members of HitQuarters that had gone on to find success include [[Christelle Avomo|Christelle]], [[The Knife]], [[Dominique Young Unique]], [[Bobby Creekwater]], [[Lesley Roy]] and [[State of Shock (band)|State of Shock]].
