It is owned by the [[Hamburg]]-based company [[Beiersdorf]] Global AG. The company was founded on 28 March 1886, by [[Paul Carl Beiersdorf]]. In 1890, it was sold to [[Oscar Troplowitz]]. Troplowitz worked with Beiersdorf's associate, [[Paul Gerson Unna|Dr Paul Gerson Unna]], and the German chemist Isaac Lifschütz, developed a new skin care cream. In 1900, Lifschütz developed the first stable water-in-oil [[emulsion]], [[Eucerit]].  This was the origin of [[Eucerin]]. ''Nivea'' comes from the [[Latin]] adjective ''niveus, nivea, niveum'', meaning "snow-white".<ref name="latin-meaning">{{cite web|url=http://www.latinwordlist.com/latin-words/niveus-20027733.htm |title=Latin Word Niveus |work=LatinWordList.com |accessdate=2011-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220114138/http://latinwordlist.com/latin-words/niveus-20027733.htm |archive-date=2010-12-20 }}</ref>

During the 1930s, Beiersdorf produced various products such as [[indoor tanning lotion|tanning oil]]s, [[shaving cream]]s, [[shampoos|shampoo]], [[cleanser|facial cleanser]], and [[Toner (skin care)|toners]].  In [[World War II]], the trademark "NIVEA" was expropriated in many countries.  After the war, Beiersdorf bought the rights back.  During the 1980s, the NIVEA brand expanded into a wider global market.

===Timeline ===

====Before World War I ====
1882:   [[Paul Carl Beiersdorf]] established the company on March 28.
NIVEA originated in Germany. The date of the [[patent]] document for the manufacture of medical plasters is taken as the date of the company’s formation.
