Fibromyalgia is classed as a disorder of pain processing due to abnormalities in how pain signals are processed in the central nervous system.<ref name="Clauw-2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clauw DJ, Arnold LM, McCarberg BH | title = The science of fibromyalgia | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 9 | pages = 907–11 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21878603 | pmc = 3258006 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2011.0206 }}</ref> The [[American College of Rheumatology]] classifies fibromyalgia as being a functional somatic syndrome.<ref name="pmid19623319"/> The expert committee of the [[European League Against Rheumatism]] classifies fibromyalgia as a neurobiological disorder and, as a result, exclusively gives pharmacotherapy their highest level of support.<ref name="pmid19623319"/> The [[International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)]] lists fibromyalgia as a diagnosable disease under "Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue," under the code M79-7, and states that fibromyalgia syndrome should be classified as a [[functional somatic syndrome]] rather than a mental disorder. Although mental disorders and some physical disorders are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia – especially anxiety, depression, [[irritable bowel syndrome]], and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] – the ICD states that these should be diagnosed separately.<ref name="pmid19623319"/>

Differences in psychological and autonomic nervous system profiles among affected individuals may indicate the existence of fibromyalgia subtypes.

Other symptoms often attributed to fibromyalgia that may be due to a [[comorbidity|comorbid]] disorder include [[myofascial pain syndrome]], also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, [[Urinary system|genitourinary]] symptoms and [[interstitial cystitis]], [[Dermatology|dermatological]] disorders, headaches, [[Myoclonus|myoclonic twitches]], and symptomatic [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]]. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the [[shoulder]]s, [[neck]], low [[back]], [[hip]]s, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid [[temporomandibular joint dysfunction]]. 20–30% of people with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] may also have fibromyalgia.<ref name="PMID 17602995">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yunus MB | title = Role of central sensitization in symptoms beyond muscle pain, and the evaluation of a patient with widespread pain | journal = Best Practice & Research.

==Cause==
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. However, several hypotheses have been developed including "central sensitization". This theory proposes that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased reactivity of pain-sensitive nerve cells in the spinal cord or brain.<ref name="pmid21303476" /> Neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder often co-occur with fibromyalgia – the reason for this comorbidity appears to be due to shared genetic abnormalities, which leads to impairments in [[monoaminergic]], [[glutamatergic]], [[neurotrophic]], [[opioid]] and [[proinflammatory cytokine]] signaling. In these vulnerable individuals, psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways that regulate mood and pain. Eventually, a sensitization and kindling effect occur in certain [[neuron]]s leading to the establishment of fibromyalgia and sometimes a mood disorder.<ref name="Maletic-2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maletic V, Raison CL | title = Neurobiology of depression, fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 14 | pages = 5291–338 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19482616 | doi = 10.2741/3598 }}</ref> The evidence suggests that the pain in fibromyalgia results primarily from pain-processing pathways functioning abnormally. In simple terms, it can be described as the volume of the neurons being set too high and this hyper-excitability of pain-processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain results in the affected individual experiencing pain. Some neurochemical abnormalities that occur in fibromyalgia also regulate mood, sleep, and energy, thus explaining why mood, sleep, and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia.<ref name="Clauw-2011"/>

===Genetics===

A mode of inheritance is currently unknown, but it is most probably [[polygenic]].<ref name="Buskila-2006"/> Research has also demonstrated that fibromyalgia is potentially associated with polymorphisms of genes in the [[serotoninergic]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen H, Buskila D, Neumann L, Ebstein RP | title = Confirmation of an association between fibromyalgia and serotonin transporter promoter region (5- HTTLPR) polymorphism, and relationship to anxiety-related personality traits | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 845–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11920428 | doi = 10.1002/art.10103 }}</ref> [[dopaminergic]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buskila D, Dan B, Cohen H, Hagit C, Neumann L, Lily N, Ebstein RP | title = An association between fibromyalgia and the dopamine D4 receptor exon III repeat polymorphism and relationship to novelty seeking personality traits | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 730–1 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15052273 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001506 | s2cid = 31226142 }}</ref> and [[catecholaminergic]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zubieta JK, Heitzeg MM, Smith YR, Bueller JA, Xu K, Xu Y, Koeppe RA, Stohler CS, Goldman D | display-authors = 6 | title = COMT val158met genotype affects mu-opioid neurotransmitter responses to a pain stressor | journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5610 | pages = 1240–3 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12595695 | doi = 10.1126/science.1078546 | s2cid = 38705215 }}</ref> However, these polymorphisms are not specific for fibromyalgia and are associated with a variety of allied disorders (e.g. [[chronic fatigue syndrome]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Narita M, Nishigami N, Narita N, Yamaguti K, Okado N, Watanabe Y, Kuratsune H | title = Association between serotonin transporter gene polymorphism and chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 311 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–6 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14592408 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.207 }}</ref> irritable bowel syndrome<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Camilleri M, Atanasova E, Carlson PJ, Ahmad U, Kim HJ, Viramontes BE, McKinzie S, Urrutia R | display-authors = 6 | title = Serotonin-transporter polymorphism pharmacogenetics in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 123 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–32 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12145795 | doi = 10.1053/gast.2002.34780 }}</ref>) and with depression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hudson JI, Mangweth B, Pope HG, De Col C, Hausmann A, Gutweniger S, Laird NM, Biebl W, Tsuang MT | display-authors = 6 | title = Family study of affective spectrum disorder | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12578434 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.60.2.170 }}</ref> Individuals with the [[5-HT2A receptor]] 102T/C [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] have been found to be at increased risk of developing fibromyalgia.<ref name="pmid21120487">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee YH, Choi SJ, Ji JD, Song GG | title = Candidate gene studies of fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Rheumatology International | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 417–26 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21120487 | doi = 10.1007/s00296-010-1678-9 | s2cid = 6239018 }}</ref>

===Neuroendocrine system===
Studies on the neuroendocrine system and [[HPA axis]] in fibromyalgia have been inconsistent. One study found fibromyalgia patients exhibited higher plasma [[cortisol]], more extreme peaks and troughs, and higher rates of [[dexamethasone]] non suppression. However, other studies have only found correlations between a higher [[cortisol awakening response]] and pain, and not any other abnormalities in cortisol.<ref name="bradley"/> Increased baseline [[ACTH]] and increase in response to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] have been observed, hypothesized to be a result of decreased negative feedback.<ref name="bellato"/>

===Autonomic nervous system===
[[Autonomic nervous system]] abnormalities have been observed in fibromyalgia, including decreased vasoconstriction response, increased drop in blood pressure and worsening of symptoms in response to [[tilt table test]], and decreased heart rate variability. Heart rate variabilities observed were different in males and females.<ref name="bradley"/>

===Sleep===
Disrupted sleep, [[insomnia]], and poor-quality sleep occur frequently in FM, and may contribute to pain by decreased release of [[IGF-1]] and [[human growth hormone]], leading to decreased tissue repair. Restorative sleep was correlated with improvement in pain related symptoms.<ref name="bradley"/>

===Neuroimaging===
Neuroimaging studies have observed decreased levels of [[N-Acetylaspartic acid|''N''-acetylaspartic acid]] (NAA) in the hippocampus of people with fibromyalgia, indicating decreased neuron functionality in this region.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Tender points fibromyalgia.svg|thumb|The location of the nine paired tender points that comprise the 1990 [[American College of Rheumatology]] criteria for fibromyalgia]]
There is no single pathological feature, laboratory finding or biomarker that can diagnose fibromyalgia and there is debate over what should be considered diagnostic criteria and whether an objective diagnosis is possible.<ref name=":4" /> In most cases, people with fibromyalgia symptoms may have laboratory test results that appear normal and many of their symptoms may mimic those of other rheumatic conditions such as arthritis or osteoporosis. The most widely accepted set of classification criteria for research purposes was elaborated in 1990 by the Multicenter Criteria Committee of the [[American College of Rheumatology]]. These criteria, which are known informally as "the ACR 1990", define fibromyalgia according to the presence of the following criteria:

* A history of widespread pain lasting more than three months – affecting all four quadrants of the body, i.e., both sides, and above and below the waist.
* Tender points – there are 18 designated possible tender points (although a person with the disorder may feel pain in other areas as well). Diagnosis is no longer based on the number of tender points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Fibromyalgia/default.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408112942/http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Fibromyalgia/default.asp |archive-date=8 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Fibromyalgia/ |title=Fibromyalgia |access-date=2013-05-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617001721/http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Fibromyalgia/ |archive-date=17 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The ACR criteria for the classification of patients were originally established as inclusion criteria for research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have now become the ''de facto'' diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. The number of tender points that may be active at any one time may vary with time and circumstance. A controversial study was done by a legal team looking to prove their client's disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the lead author of the ACR criteria to question now the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe F | title = Stop using the American College of Rheumatology criteria in the clinic | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 1671–2 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12913920 | url = http://www.jrheum.com/subscribers/03/08/1671.html | url-status = live | df = dmy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014114743/http://jrheum.com/subscribers/03/08/1671.html | archive-date = 14 October 2011 }}</ref> Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has fibromyalgia, and to claim the person is malingering; however, no research has been done for the use of control points to diagnose fibromyalgia, and such diagnostic tests have been advised against, and people complaining of pain all over should still have fibromyalgia considered as a diagnosis.<ref name="pmid19623319"/>

* Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, ''and''
* No other diagnosable disorder otherwise explains the pain.<ref name=Wolfe2010 />{{rp|607}}

==Management==
As with many other [[Medically unexplained physical symptoms|medically unexplained syndromes]], there is no universally accepted treatment or cure for fibromyalgia, and treatment typically consists of symptom management. Developments in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to improvements in treatment, which include prescription medication, behavioral intervention, and exercise.

It can take up to three months to derive benefit from the antidepressant amitriptyline and between three and six months to gain the maximal response from duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin.

====Opioids====
The use of opioids is controversial. As of 2015, no opioid is approved for use in this condition by the FDA.<ref name="Mac2015" /> The [[National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases]] (NIAMS) in 2014 stated that there was a lack of evidence for opioids for most people.<ref name="NIH2014Tx" /> The [[Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany]] in 2012 made no recommendation either for or against the use of weak [[opioid]]s because of the limited amount of scientific research addressing their use in the treatment of FM. They strongly advise against using strong opioids.<ref name="German" /> The [[Canadian Pain Society]] in 2012 said that opioids, starting with a weak opioid like tramadol, can be tried but only for people with moderate to severe pain that is not well-controlled by non-opioid painkillers. They discourage the use of strong opioids and only recommend using them while they continue to provide improved pain and functioning. Healthcare providers should monitor people on opioids for ongoing effectiveness, side effects and possible unwanted drug behaviors.<ref name="Canadian" />

The [[European League Against Rheumatism]] in 2008 recommends [[tramadol]] and other weak opioids may be used for pain but not strong opioids.<ref name="EULAR" /> A 2015 review found fair evidence to support tramadol use if other medications do not work.<ref name="Mac2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLean AJ, Schwartz TL | title = Tramadol for the treatment of fibromyalgia | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–75 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25896486 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.2015.1034693 | s2cid = 26613022 }}</ref> A 2018 review found little evidence to support the combination of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and tramadol over a single medication.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thorpe J, Shum B, Moore RA, Wiffen PJ, Gilron I | title = Combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD010585 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29457627 | pmc = 6491103 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010585.pub2 }}</ref> Goldenberg ''et al'' suggest that tramadol works via its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, rather than via its action as a weak opioid receptor agonist.<ref name="Don2016" />

==Prognosis==
Although in itself neither degenerative nor fatal, the chronic pain of fibromyalgia is pervasive and persistent. Most people with fibromyalgia report that their symptoms do not improve over time. An evaluation of 332 consecutive new people with fibromyalgia found that disease-related factors such as pain and psychological factors such as work status, helplessness, education, and coping ability had an independent and significant relationship to FM symptom severity and function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldenberg DL, Mossey CJ, Schmid CH | title = A model to assess severity and impact of fibromyalgia | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 2313–8 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8835568 }}</ref>

Chronic widespread pain had already been described in the literature in the 19th century but the term fibromyalgia was not used until 1976 when Dr P.K.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
People with fibromyalgia generally have higher health-care costs and utilization rates. A study of almost 20,000 [[Humana]] members enrolled in [[Medicare Advantage]] and commercial plans compared costs and medical utilizations and found that people with fibromyalgia used twice as much pain-related medication as those without fibromyalgia. Furthermore, the use of medications and medical necessities increased markedly across many measures once diagnosis was made.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 2010 | title = High health care utilization and costs in patients with fibromyalgia | url = http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1582715 | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | page = 111 | access-date = 14 June 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121029024640/http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1582715 | archive-date = 29 October 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Controversies===
Fibromyalgia was defined relatively recently. It continues to be a disputed diagnosis. Dr. Frederick Wolfe, lead author of the 1990 paper that first defined the diagnostic guidelines for fibromyalgia, stated in 2008 that he believed it "clearly" not to be a disease but instead a physical response to depression and stress.<ref name=Berenson>{{cite news|last=Berenson|title=Drug Approved.

[[Neurologist]]s and pain specialists tend to view fibromyalgia as a pathology due to dysfunction of muscles and connective tissue as well as functional abnormalities in the central nervous system. [[Rheumatologists]] define the syndrome in the context of "central sensitization" – heightened brain response to normal stimuli in the absence of disorders of the muscles, joints, or connective tissues. On the other hand, psychiatrists often view fibromyalgia as a type of [[affective disorder]], whereas specialists in psychosomatic medicine tend to view fibromyalgia as being a [[somatic symptom disorder]]. These controversies do not engage healthcare specialists alone; some patients object to fibromyalgia being described in purely somatic terms. There is extensive research evidence to support the view that the central symptom of fibromyalgia, namely pain, has a [[neurogenic]] origin, though this is consistent in both views.<ref name="pmid19623319"/><ref name="Clauw-2011"/>
