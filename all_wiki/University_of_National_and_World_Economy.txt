During the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist period in Bulgaria]], the university was called the Karl Marx Higher Institute of Economics, but was renamed on April 27, 1990, soon after end of the communist era, due to the perceived failure of communism and, particularly, [[Marxist economics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of UNWE - Sofia |url=https://www.unwe.bg/en/pages/296/history-of-unwe-sofia.html |publisher=University of National and World Economy |accessdate=2019-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bulgaria Changes Name of Marx Institute |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Bulgaria-Changes-Name-of-Marx/90168 |website=The Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=2019-10-28}}</ref>
