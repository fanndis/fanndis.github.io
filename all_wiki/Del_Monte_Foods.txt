==History==
[[File:Del Monte Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|Del Monte Foods' [[Pittsburgh]] headquarters. Del Monte shares the building with [[Root Sports Pittsburgh]] and the headquarters of former Del Monte subsidy [[StarKist Tuna]].]]
In the 1870s and 1880s, California became a major producer of fruits and vegetables.  The [[Hotel Del Monte]] was a famous resort hotel on the [[Monterey Peninsula]] which first built the now [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]].  In the 1880s an [[Oakland, California]] foods distributor used the Del Monte name to market a premium blend of coffee that had been prepared for the hotel.  By 1892, the firm expanded its business and selected Del Monte as the brand name for its new line of canned [[peach]]es. In 1898, the California Fruit Canners Association (CFCA) formed when 18 West Coast canning companies merged.<ref name="history">{{cite web| title=The Corporation| url=http://www.historysanjose.org/cannerylife/canned-topics/corporation.html| publisher=History San Jose| accessdate=2011-11-07| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114153255/http://www.historysanjose.org/cannerylife/canned-topics/corporation.html| archive-date=2011-11-14| url-status=dead}}</ref> The Del Monte brand was one of several brands marketed by the new company. It introduced the Del Monte Shield in 1909.<ref name="shield">{{cite web| title=Our History| url=http://www.delmontefoods.com/company/default.aspx?page=oc_ourhistory| publisher=Del Monte Foods| accessdate=2011-11-07| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413235859/http://www.delmontefoods.com/company/default.aspx?page=oc_ourhistory| archive-date=2013-04-13}}</ref>

Under the leadership of [[George Newell Armsby]], in 1916 CFCA added Alaska Packers Association, Central California Canneries, and Griffin & Skelley, two more canners and a food brokerage house, incorporating itself as [[California Packing Corporation]], or Calpak, and began marketing its products under the Del Monte brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.company-histories.com/Del-Monte-Foods-Company-Company-History.html|title=Del Monte Foods Company|website=company-histories.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vasonabranch.com/packing_houses/index.php?title=California_Packing_Corporation|title=California Packing Corporation - Packing Houses of Santa Clara County|website=vasonabranch.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Del_Monte_Foods|title=Del Monte Foods - FoundSF|website=foundsf.org|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> The new company grew to operate more than 60 canneries in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Utah]] and [[Alaska]]. In 1917, it acquired pineapple farms and a cannery in [[Hawaii]] and, in the 1920s, added canneries in [[Florida]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], as well as in the [[Philippines]]. After WWII, it constructed or purchased more facilities overseas.<ref name="braznell">{{cite book| title=California's finest: The history of the Del Monte Corporation and the Del Monte brand| author=William Braznell| publisher=Del Monte Corp.| year=1982| place=San Francisco}}</ref>  These multinational operations made the name California Packing Corporation obsolete, and in June 1967, the corporation adopted the name of its leading brand to become Del Monte Corporation.<ref name="carlsson">{{cite web| title=Del Monte Foods| url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Del_Monte_Foods| publisher=San Francisco Museum and Historical Society| author=Chris Carlsson| accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>

In 1972, Del Monte became the first major US food processor to voluntarily adopt [[Nutrition labeling|nutritional labeling]] on all its food products, an innovation that made headlines throughout the country and applauded by government officials as a breakthrough in consumer education.

Del Monte became part of [[R.J. Reynolds Industries, Inc.]] (later RJR Nabisco, Inc.) in 1979. After being acquired by [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] in 1988, [[RJR Nabisco]] sold several Del Monte divisions. The [[Fresh Del Monte Produce|fresh fruit business]] was sold to [[Polly Peck]].<ref name="Press">{{Cite news |issn= 0458-3035 |agency= Associated Press |title= British Conglomerate to Buy Part of Del Monte From RJR |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= 2015-02-09 |date= 1989-09-08 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1943_1_del-monte }}</ref> RJR Nabisco retained Del Monte Canada and Venezuela. The remaining food processing divisions, known as Del Monte Foods, were sold to [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Court Square Capital Partners|Citicorp Venture Capitol]], and [[Kikkoman]] in 1989.

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2001, Del Monte obtained a favorable judgment in the case ''[[Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co.]]'' where the court held that Dole Foods had misappropriated Del Monte's trade secret when Dole Foods obtained Del Monte's specially bred pineapple through non-legal means.

In January 2007, Del Monte Foods was accused of opposing efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to apply the [[Minimum wage in the United States|continental minimum wage]] to the lower-paying [[tuna]] packing plants in [[American Samoa]].  On January 16, 2007, Melissa Murphy Brown, spokesperson for Del Monte, stated that the application would "severely cripple the local economy."  She also stated that "For over 50 years, the Federal Department of Labor has provided that wages in U.S. territories, including American Samoa, be set by a federally appointed wage board, following public hearings".<ref name=times>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jan/13/20070113-122725-2957r/| title=Pelosi moves to close Samoa wage loophole| work=The Washington Times| publisher=WashingtonTimes.com| date=13 January 2007| accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>
