She was one of the leaders of the [[United Regions of Serbia]]. 

For having supporting a coalition with [[Boris Tadić]] and his [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] independently of the People's Party, she and other such members were expelled from the URS.

==Political career==
[[Image:Maja Gojković Bogdan Borusewicz National Assembly of Serbia Senate of Poland 02.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Maja Gojković and [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] in [[National Assembly of Serbia]] (2014)]]
Gojković is one of the founders of [[Serbian Radical Party]], first holding the position of secretary general, then vice president of executive council and finally she was vice president of the party. She was [[Vojislav Šešelj]]'s legal adviser before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. However, she left the party in 2006 after disagreement with party leadership.

Maja Gojković has been a representative in the parliament of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] since 1992. From 1996 until 2000 she was a member of [[Vojvodina]] parliament. In 1998 and 1999 she was a [[Minister without portfolio (Serbia)|non-portfolio minister]] in the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian Government]]. Gojković also served as vice chairman of the federal government of FR Yugoslavia in 1999. Before running for mayor of [[Novi Sad]] she held a place in the federal parliament of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. She was the vice president of the [[Serbian Radical Party]] until 2006. In 2008, she formed her own party, "Grupa Građana - Maja Gojković" and ran for seats in the Local elections and resigned from the Serbian Radical Party. She got seven councillor seats in the Parliament of Novi Sad.

In the 2004 Serbian local election she was elected [[Mayor of Novi Sad]], for the first time by [[Direct election|popular vote]], beating then mayor [[Borislav Novaković]]. She thus became the first woman to perform mayoral duties in Novi Sad's history.

On 27 June 2020, Gojković was hospitalized with [[COVID-19]].<ref>https://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/serbia-top-politicians-test-positive-for-coronavirus/1892072</ref>

==Controversies==
On 14 July 1995, during the [[Bosnian War]], Gojković, who served as vice-president of [[Serbian Radical Party]], made a statement on the [[Siege of Srebrenica#Fall of Srebrenica|Fall of Srebrenica]] only a few days after the start of the [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]]: “We salute the rapidly action of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which finally liberated Serbian Srebrenica and put an end to one of the most significant hotspot of Muslim terror.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kontrapress.com/clanak.php?rub=Politika&url=Medijski-mehanizam-genocida|title=Izveštavanje srbijanskih listova u vreme pada Srebrenice i Žepe, Medijski mehanizam genocida|first1=Nebojša|last1=Tasić|first2=Igor|last2=Mesner|date=11 July 2014|publisher=kontrapress.com|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref>

She was elected [[President of the National Assembly of Serbia]] on 23 April 2014. In 2018, [[Freedom House]] reported that Gojković conducted parliamentary proceedings in an extremely partisan way, with a huge number of interruptions and penalties handed to opposition MPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2018/serbia|title=Nations in Transit 2018, Serbia Country Profile |date=14 May 2018|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> In addition, she was criticized for suggesting to MPs from ruling coalition to vote for initiatives and proposals by ringing a bell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a342063/Poslanici-SNS-pogresno-glasali.html|title=Poslanici SNS-a "pogrešno" glasali za predlog opozicije |date=14 November 2017|publisher=N1|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2017&mm=11&dd=15&nav_category=11&nav_id=1325619|title=Skupština: "Zvonce" zbunilo vlast, glasali za predlog DJB |date=15 November 2017|publisher=B92|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freeeuropean.media/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BOOK-Free-European-Media-2018.pdf|title=Who Rings the Bell?
