'''Rafael Edward Cruz''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|uː|z}}; born December 22, 1970<!-- DO NOT add the birth place of Ted Cruz in the lead section other than in the infobox; it violates MOS (see [[MOS:BLPLEAD]]) and consensus is against it. -->) is an American politician and attorney serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] for [[Texas]] since 2013. He was the runner-up for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican presidential nomination]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

Cruz holds degrees in public policy and law from [[Princeton University]] and [[Harvard Law School]], respectively. From 1999 to 2003, he held various government positions, serving as Director of the Office of [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning]] at the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), as an [[Associate Deputy Attorney General]] at the [[United States Department of Justice]], and as a Domestic Policy Advisor to [[George W. Bush]] during Bush's 2000 [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|presidential campaign]]. Cruz served as [[Solicitor|Solicitor General]] of Texas from 2003 to 2008, having been appointed by [[Texas Attorney General]] and later [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Greg Abbott]]. He was the longest-serving solicitor general in Texas history and the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] to serve in that capacity. From 2004 to 2009, Cruz was an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in [[Austin]], where he taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation.

In 2012, Cruz [[2012 United States Senate election in Texas|ran for and won]] the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]]. He is the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. Senator from Texas. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Cruz ran for President of the United States. He was reelected to the Senate in [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|2018]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[Beto O'Rourke]]. {{as of|2020}}, Cruz is one of three current U.S. Senators, along with [[Bob Menendez]] and [[Marco Rubio]], of [[Cuba]]n descent.

Eventually, he linked up with Castro's guerrilla groups and supported their attempts to overthrow Batista. It's a decision he still regrets. His move toward Castro, he explains, was mostly due to his anger with Batista's government, which at one point imprisoned him and tortured him for his work with the revolutionaries. He says he never shared Castro's Communism, but at the time, it was the best way to fight Batista's oppression.

Cruz's 115-page senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, ''Clipping the Wings of Angels: The History and Theory behind the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the United States Constitution,'' was inspired by a passage attributed to [[James Madison]]: "If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary."

In ''[[Medellin v.

Haley], 541 U.S. 386, 389–92 (2004).</ref> Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying "I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors."<ref name="CunninghamDretkeCase2005">{{cite journal |last=Cunningham |first=Larry |year=2005 |title= The Innocent Prisoner and the Appellate Prosecutor Some Thoughts on Post-Conviction Prosecutorial Ethics after Dretke v Haley |ssrn=1152792 |journal=Criminal Justice Ethics |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=13 |doi=10.1080/0731129X.2005.9992185 }}</ref> The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.<ref name="CunninghamDretkeCase2005"/> After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to "time served".<ref name="NRO_dretke_v_haley">{{cite news|last1=French|first1=David|title=David Brooks's Hypocritical Attack on Ted Cruz Reveals an Important Truth|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429777/ted-cruzs-christianity-deep-and-abiding|accessdate=March 24, 2016|work=National Review|date=January 14, 2016}}</ref>

===Comments on President Obama===
In a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being "openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic".<ref name="JesseWeiner">Jesse Weiner, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/ted-cruz-confused-about-cicero/383066/ Ted Cruz: Confused About Cicero: What the Texas Republican misrepresents about treason and politics in the Roman Republic], ''The Atlantic'' (November 21, 2014).</ref> In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]] [[Cicero]] [[Catiline Orations|against Catiline]] to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.<ref name="JesseWeiner"/> Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', said that Cruz's analogy was "deeply disquieting" because "In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric."<ref name="JesseWeiner"/>

Cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran "will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism".<ref name="Collins">Eliza Collins, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-calls-barack-obama-sponsor-terrorism-iran-nuclear-deal-120780 Cruz stands by calling Obama a sponsor of terrorism], ''Politico'' (July 29, 2015).</ref> In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of "outrageous attacks" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: "We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now."<ref name="Collins"/> Former Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]] also criticized Cruz's remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was "way over the line" and "hurts the cause".<ref>David Jackson, [http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/07/30/romney-hits-cruz-over-obamaterrorism-claim/ Romney hits Cruz over Obama/terrorism claim], ''USA Today'' (July 30, 2015).</ref><ref>Alex Griswold, [http://www.mediaite.com/online/mitt-romney-ted-cruz-way-over-the-line-calling-obama-terror-sponsor/ Mitt Romney: Ted Cruz 'Way Over the Line' Calling Obama Terror Sponsor], Mediaite (July 30, 2015).</ref>

Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a "radical anti-Israel agenda".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/marco-rubio-john-kerry-israel-mideast-speech-reaction-233013|title=Rubio, Cruz denounce Kerry's speech on Israel|work=Politico|date=December 28, 2016|first=Yousef|last=Saba}}</ref>

In January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Cruz made comments about the change in Iran policy under President Trump, saying that Obama's policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the Obama administration had given Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/01/08/cruz_missiles_iran_used_to_attack_us_bases_in_iraq_were_paid_for_by_the_obama_administration.html|title=Cruz: Missiles Iran Used To Attack U.S. Bases In Iraq Were "Paid For By...

In a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] of telling "a flat-out lie" over his intentions to reauthorize the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], which Cruz opposes.

Cruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the "nuclear option", "to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees".
