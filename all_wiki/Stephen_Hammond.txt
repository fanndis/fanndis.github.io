=== Summer-born campaign ===
In Parliament, Hammond has been an advocate of giving summer-born and premature children the right to start school a year later, to give them extra time for development. In October 2015 he held an adjournment debate on this issue, arguing that "summer-born children can suffer from long-term development issues and a lag in educational standards". and highlighting the inconsistent treatment of these children by Councils. In response, [[Nick Gibb|Nick Gibb MP]], the Minister of State for Schools, set out plans in a letter to all schools to change the school admissions code to allow summer-born children to start reception class at the age of 5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summer-born-children-nick-gibbs-letter-about-school-admissions|title=Summer-born children: Nick Gibb's letter about school admissions - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>

In October 2016, Hammond held another adjournment debate on this topic, urging the Government to take action more quickly and to provide a timetable for the changes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
