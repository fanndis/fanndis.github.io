'''The Reading Public Library''' ('''RPL''') is the main public library of the [[Reading, Pennsylvania|City of Reading]], Pennsylvania and the district library center (DLC) of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]]. RPL's services and collections serve the City of Reading, its suburbs, greater Berks County, and beyond.

==History==
Founded as an English subscription library in 1763, Reading Public Library is one of the oldest, though not continuously operating, libraries in the United States. It wasn't until 1913 that the Main Library as it currently stands was built through the generosity of Andrew Carnegie. After a major fundraising campaign in 1989, the Main Library was renovated and modernized through a variety of projects during 1990â€“1993. It is the sixth oldest public library in the United States.

==Recognition by IMLS==
In May 2018, Reading Public Library was selected as a recipient of the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]] by the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]]. This award represents institutions that offer "dynamic programming and services that exceed expected levels of service" and that also "bring about change that touches the lives of individuals and helps communities thrive" through outreach to and engagement with the service population.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Branch Libraries==
An increase in the number of users and the changing collection needs over the years have prompted the construction of three Branches.  [http://www.reading.lib.pa.us/locations_southeast.asp Southeast Branch Library] (1974), [http://www.reading.lib.pa.us/locations_northeast.asp Northeast Branch Library] (1974), and  [http://www.reading.lib.pa.us/locations_northwest.asp Northwest Branch Library] (1939). [http://www.reading.lib.pa.us/locations_bookmobile.asp City Bookmobile] services were added in 1951. The Main Library, all three Branches, and the Bookmobile readily share books and other materials to further facilitate complete coverage of the community's needs.
