'''Great Ormond Street Hospital''' (informally '''GOSH''' or '''Great Ormond Street''', formerly the '''Hospital for Sick Children''') is a [[children's hospital]] located in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of the [[London Borough of Camden]], and a part of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust]].

The hospital is the largest centre for child heart surgery in the UK and one of the largest centres for heart transplantation in the world. In 1962 they developed the first heart and lung bypass machine for children. With children's book author [[Roald Dahl]], they developed an improved [[Wade-Dahl-Till valve|shunt valve]] for children with [[hydrocephalus]], and non-invasive (percutaneous) [[heart valve]] replacements. They did the first UK clinical trials of the [[rubella vaccine]], and the first [[bone marrow transplant]] and [[gene therapy]] for [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].<ref name="Breakthroughs">Breakthroughs {{cite web |url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/about-us/our-history/breakthroughs |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127184719/http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/about-us/our-history/breakthroughs |archivedate=27 January 2016 }}</ref><!-- This is not an ideal reference.

It is closely associated with [[University College London]] (UCL) and in partnership with the [[UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health]], which is adjacent to it, is the largest centre for research and postgraduate teaching in children's health in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/britains-best-hospitals-a-patients-guide-798352.html|title=Britain's best hospitals: A patients' guide|access-date=13 October 2016|publisher=The Independent|date=20 March 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008055659/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/britains-best-hospitals-a-patients-guide-798352.html|archivedate=8 October 2016}}</ref>

In 1929, [[J. M. Barrie]] donated the copyright to ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'' to the hospital.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:Great Ormond Street Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 2461166.jpg|thumb|left|Main entrance to Great Ormond Street Hospital]]
The Hospital for Sick Children was founded on 14 February 1852 after a long campaign by Dr. [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]], and was the first hospital in England to provide in-patient beds specifically for [[children]].<ref>Kevin Telfer (2008). ''The remarkable story of Great Ormond Street Hospital''. Simon & Schuster. p11</ref>

Despite opening with just 10 beds, it grew into one of the world's leading children's hospitals through the patronage of [[Queen Victoria]], counting [[Charles Dickens]], a personal friend of the Chief Physician Dr West, as one of its first fundraisers. The Nurses League was formed in February 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosnursesleague.org/aboutus.php|title=www.gosnursesleague.org|access-date=25 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908080749/http://www.gosnursesleague.org/aboutus.php|archivedate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

===Nationalisation===
Great Ormond Street Hospital was nationalised in 1948, becoming part of the National Health Service. During the early years of the NHS, private fundraising for the hospital was heavily restricted, though the hospital was permitted to continue to receiving pre-existing legacies.<ref>[https://www.gosh.org/about-us/our-history Official history] Retrieved 14 February 2019</ref>

[[Audrey Callaghan]], wife of [[James Callaghan]] (prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979), served the hospital as Chairman of the Board of Governors from 1968 to 1972 and then as Chairman of the Special Trustees from 1983 until her final retirement in 1990.<ref>Kevin Telfer (2008). ''The remarkable story of Great Ormond Street Hospital''. Simon & Schuster. p58</ref> [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], served as president of the hospital from 1989 until her death. A plaque at the entrance of the hospital commemorates her services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/video/interior-shots-princess-diana-unveiling-plaque-at-newly-news-footage/646873086|title=Princess Diana unveils plaque at Great Ormond Street Hospital|publisher=Getty Images|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

===1990s===
The Charles West School of Nursing transferred from Great Ormond Street to [[London South Bank University]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/about-us/our-history/complete-history-of-gosh/|title=Complete history of GOSH|access-date=5 January 2012|publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116024221/http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/about-us/our-history/complete-history-of-gosh/|archivedate=16 November 2011}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2002 Great Ormond Street Hospital commenced a redevelopment programme which is budgeted at Â£343 million and the next phase of which was scheduled to be complete by the end of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.org/gen/redevelopment/whats-happening-now/the-buildings/the-new-clinical-building-phase-2b/|title=The New Clinical Building (Phase 2B)|access-date=20 June 2013|publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity}}</ref> In July 2012, Great Ormond Street Hospital was featured in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|the opening ceremony of the London Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World's media lavishes praise on Olympic opening ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/28/world-media-london-olympic-opening-ceremony|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian|access-date=27 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118144658/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/28/world-media-london-olympic-opening-ceremony|archivedate=18 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incredible honour for Great Ormond Street Hospital at London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/news/press-releases/2012-press-release-archive/incredible-honour-great-ormond-street-hospital-london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony|website=Great Ormond Street Hospital|publisher=UK NHS/ UK Government|access-date=27 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213075540/http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/news/press-releases/2012-press-release-archive/incredible-honour-great-ormond-street-hospital-london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony|archivedate=13 February 2018}}</ref>

==St. Christopher's Chapel==
[[File:St Christopher's Chapel, Great Ormond St Hospital, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|St Christopher's Chapel in Great Ormond Street Hospital.]]
{{main|St Christopher's Chapel, Great Ormond Street Hospital}}
St. Christopher's Chapel is a chapel decorated in the Byzantine style and [[Grade II* listed building]] located in the Variety Club Building of the hospital. Designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry]] (son of the architect [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] who designed the Houses of Parliament) and built in 1875, it is dedicated to the memory of Caroline Barry, wife of William Henry Barry (eldest son of Sir Charles Barry) who provided the Â£40,000 required to build the chapel and a stipend for the chaplain.<ref name=IanVisits>{{cite web|title=Ian Visits GOSH|url=http://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2011/12/11/gasp-at-the-splendour-of-st-christophers-chapel-inside-gosh/|website=Ian Visits|access-date=5 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220224116/http://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2011/12/11/gasp-at-the-splendour-of-st-christophers-chapel-inside-gosh/|archivedate=20 December 2014}}</ref> It was built in "elaborate Franco-Italianate style". As the chapel exists to provide pastoral care to ill children and their families, many of its details refer to childhood. The stained glass depicts the Nativity, the childhood of Christ and biblical scenes related to children. The dome depicts a pelican pecking at her breast in order to feed her young with drops of her own blood, a traditional symbol of Christ's sacrifice for humanity.<ref name="listed">{{English Heritage List entry |num= 1113211 |desc= Great Ormond Street Hospital Chapel in Central Block |grade= |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>

When the old hospital was being demolished in the late 1980s, the chapel was moved to its present location via a 'concrete raft' to prevent any damage en route. The stained glass and furniture were temporarily removed for restoration and repair. It was reopened along with the new Variety Club Building on 14 February 1994 by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], then president of the hospital.<ref name="history pdf">{{cite web|last1=Lunnon|first1=Raymond J.|title=The Chapel of St. Christopher|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/file/720/download?token=H5GcApmc|website=Great Ormond Street Hospital|publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust|access-date=16 June 2017|format=pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213075540/http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/file/720/download?token=H5GcApmc|archivedate=13 February 2018}}</ref>

==''Peter Pan''==
[[File:Peter Pan statue by Diarmuid Byron O'Connor.JPG|thumb|left|Peter Pan statue at Great Ormond Street Hospital by [[Diarmuid Byron O'Connor]]]]
In April 1929 [[J.M. Barrie]] gave the [[copyright]] to his [[Peter and Wendy|''Peter Pan'' works]] to the hospital, with the request that the income from this source not be disclosed. This gave the institution control of the rights to these works, and entitled it to royalties from any performance or publication of the play and derivative works. Innumerable performances of the play and its various adaptations have been staged, several theatrical and television adaptations have been produced, and numerous editions of the novel have been published, all under licence from the hospital.<ref>Tatar, Maria (ed).

After the copyright first expired in the UK at the end of 1987 â 50 years after Barrie's death â the UK government's [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988]]<ref name=1988act>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/301/data.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113123016/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/301|url-status=dead|title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 |archivedate=13 November 2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> granted the hospital a perpetual right to collect royalties for public performances and commercial publication of the work within the UK. This did not grant GOSH full copyright control over the work, however. When UK copyright terms were later extended to the author's life plus ''70'' years by a [[Directive harmonizing the term of copyright protection|European Union directive in 1996]], GOSH revived its full copyright claim on the work. After the copyright expired again in 2007, the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act again applied.<ref name=1988act/>

At various times, GOSH has been in legal disputes in the United States, where the copyright term is based on date of publication, putting the 1911 novel in the public domain since the 1960s. The hospital asserts that the 1928 version of the play is still under copyright in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.org/peterpan/copyright/publishing/|title=Copyright|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703053649/http://www.gosh.org/peterpan/copyright/publishing/|archivedate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

==Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity==
The hospital has relied on charitable support since it first opened.
One of the main sources for this support is Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity. Whilst the NHS meets the day-to-day running costs of the hospital, the fundraising income allows Great Ormond Street Hospital to remain at the forefront of child healthcare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.org/about_us/index.html |title=GOSH.org |access-date=25 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720130347/http://www.gosh.org/about_us/index.html |archivedate=20 July 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The charity aims to raise over Â£50 million every year to complete the next two phases of redevelopment, as well as provide substantially more fundraising directly for research. The charity also purchases up-to-date equipment, and provides accommodation for families and staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.org/gen/redevelopment/whats-happening-now/|title=What's happening now|access-date=24 June 2013|publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813072910/http://www.gosh.org/gen/redevelopment/whats-happening-now/|archivedate=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosh.org/gen/why-we-need-your-help/|title=Why we need your help|access-date=24 June 2013|publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708172233/http://www.gosh.org/gen/why-we-need-your-help/|archivedate=8 July 2013}}</ref>

Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity was one of the charities that benefited from the national [[Jeans for Genes]] campaign, which encourages people across the UK to wear their jeans and make a donation to help children affected by genetic disorders. All Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity's proceeds from the campaign went to its research partner, the UCL Institute of Child Health.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fundraising.co.uk/2006/05/23/jeans-genes-set-independent-charity/#.WtHsY4jwYdU|title=Jeans for Genes to set up as independent charity|publisher=UK Fundraising|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

On 6 August 2009, [[Arsenal F.C.]] confirmed that Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity was to be their 'charity of the season' for the 2009â10 season. They raised over Â£800,000 for a new lung function unit at the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/community/charity|title=Arsenal.com|access-date=30 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510220914/http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/community/charity|archivedate=10 May 2012}}</ref>

Two charity singles have been released in aid of the hospital. In 1987, "[[The Wishing Well (song)|The Wishing Well]]", recorded by an ensemble line-up including [[Boy George]], [[Peter Cox (musician)|Peter Cox]] and [[Dollar (band)|Dollar]] amongst others became a top 30 hit.<ref name=occ>{{cite web|title=G.O.S.H. â Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24588/g-o-s-h-/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215144617/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24588/g-o-s-h-/|archivedate=15 February 2016}}</ref> In 2009, ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' finalists covered [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[You Are Not Alone]]" in aid of the charity, reaching No.1 in the UK Charts.<ref name=occx>{{cite web|title=X Factor Finalists 2009 â Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5921/x-factor-finalists-2009/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215144628/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5921/x-factor-finalists-2009/|archivedate=15 February 2016}}</ref>

On 30 March 2010, Channel 4 staged the first ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'' at the O2 Arena in London, in aid of the charity. The event has been repeated every year since, raising money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity each time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/channel-4s-comedy-gala-1|title=Channel 4's Comedy Gala|publisher=The O2|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

In 2011, [[Daniel Boys]] recorded a charity single called 'The World Is Something You Can Imagine'. It was also released as with proceeds going to the Disney Appeal at Great Ormond Street Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gosh.org/our-charity/the-world-is-something-you-imagine-single-in-aid-of-great-ormond-street-hospital/|date=23 May 2011|title="The World Is Something You Imagine" for our Disney Appeal|publisher=gosh.org|access-date=24 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003007/http://blog.gosh.org/our-charity/the-world-is-something-you-imagine-single-in-aid-of-great-ormond-street-hospital/|archivedate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
