'''Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.''' (born February 20, 1942) is an American politician currently serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader|Senate majority leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.

McConnell was first elected to the Senate [[1984 United States Senate election in Kentucky|in 1984]]. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader|minority leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate majority leader. In the [[2020 United States Senate elections]], McConnell was elected to his seventh term in the Senate against challenger [[Amy McGrath]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Fandos|first1=Nicholas|last2=Cochrane|first2=Emily|date=November 11, 2020|title=Republicans Back Trump's Refusal to Concede, Declining to Recognize Biden|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html|url-status=live|access-date=November 12, 2020|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112003108/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html}}</ref>

McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell is often referred to as an [[Obstructionism|obstructionist]],<ref name="Obstructionism" /> having worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the [[Obama administration]], and having made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of President [[Barack Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.

In October 2010, McConnell said that "the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."

====Use of the filibuster====

One of McConnell's most common tactics to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments has been the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]]. A filibuster is an attempt to “talk a bill to death”, forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage. In the United States Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke [[cloture]], or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as "[[constitutional hardball]]", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.<ref name="amnesia" /><ref name=":12" /><ref name=":22">{{cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562246/how-democracies-die-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/9781524762933/|title=How Democracies Die|last1=Levitsky|first1=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|date=2018|publisher=Penguin Randomhouse|access-date=March 14, 2019|archive-date=December 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211150321/https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562246/how-democracies-die-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/9781524762933/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/11/wisconsins-and-michigans-legislatures-are-trying-to-weaken-incoming-governors-should-you-be-worried/|title=Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan want to weaken incoming Democratic governors.

Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell's filibusters, "Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been 'defeated,' journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress."<ref name="amnesia" />

In 2012, McConnell proposed a measure allowing President Obama to raise the debt ceiling, hoping that some Democratic senators would oppose the measure, thus demonstrating disunity among Democrats. However, all Democratic senators supported the proposal, which led McConnell to filibuster his own proposal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-12-07/mitch-mcconnell-filibusters-himself-after-dems-call-bluff|title=Mitch McConnell filibusters himself after Dems call bluff|author=Funaro, Kaitlin|work=Public Radio International|date=December 7, 2012|access-date=October 6, 2018|archive-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007040146/https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-12-07/mitch-mcconnell-filibusters-himself-after-dems-call-bluff|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; McConnell used his newly heightened power to start what was considered "a near blockade of Obama's judicial appointments". According to ''The New York Times'', Obama's final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President [[Harry S. Truman]]. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of [[George W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Ronald Reagan]] had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed.<ref name=McRemake/> According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', McConnell brought about an "extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations", detailing 22 confirmations of Obama's judicial nominees, the lowest since President Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies more than doubled comparing the figure near the end of Obama's term to the figure at the end of George W. Bush's term.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Savage |first1=David |title=This Congress filled the fewest judgeships since 1952.

In October 2018, McConnell said that if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur during Trump's 2020 re-election year, he would not follow his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He noted that in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president's – and argued that for that reason, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when the presidency and Senate were both controlled by Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-signals-he-would-push-to-fill-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-2020-despite-2016-example/2018/10/08/75ee6fce-cb2a-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html|title=McConnell signals he would push to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020 despite 2016 example|website=Washington Post|author=Viebeck, Elise|language=en|date=October 9, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018|archive-date=October 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012094421/https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-signals-he-would-push-to-fill-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-2020-despite-2016-example/2018/10/08/75ee6fce-cb2a-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2020, following the death of [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], he announced the Senate would vote on Trump's nominated replacement.<ref>{{Cite web|work=CNN|first1=Clare|last1=Foran|first2=Manu|last2=Raju|first3=Ted|last3=Barrett|title=McConnell vows Trump's nominee to replace Ginsburg will get Senate vote, setting up historic fight|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/congress-fight-rgb-seat/index.html|date=September 19, 2020|access-date=2020-09-19|archive-date=September 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919012142/https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/congress-fight-rgb-seat/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On October 23, 2020, McConnell set in place the Senate debate for the confirmation of [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to fill Ginsburg's seat.

===Government shutdowns===
The United States federal government shut down between October{{nbsp}}1 and 17, 2013, following a failure to enact legislation to fund the government. McConnell later vowed that Republicans would not force the US to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stop-gap funding measures were set to expire. McConnell also stated at the time he wouldn't allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget making process.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/mitch-mcconnell-government-shutdown-098943|title=McConnell: No more shutdowns|author=Palmer, Anna|date=October 28, 2013|work=Politico|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=October 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201012190403/https://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/mitch-mcconnell-government-shutdown-098943|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2018, McConnell stated that funding for the [[Mexico–United States border]] wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. President Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/30/politics/mitch-mcconnell-shutdown-president-trump/index.html|title=McConnell said wall funding would 'probably' have to wait until after midterms.

====Shutdown of 2018–2019====
From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019|federal government was shut down]] when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a [[Trump border wall|U.S.–Mexico border wall]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/422600-mcconnell-knocks-dems-for-rejecting-trumps-reasonable-request-on-border|title=McConnell knocks Dems for rejecting Trump's 'reasonable request' on border|author=Carney, Jordain|date=December 22, 2018|newspaper=The Hill|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804015536/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/422600-mcconnell-knocks-dems-for-rejecting-trumps-reasonable-request-on-border|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2018, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican-controlled]] [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and Trump. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some [[Alternative media (U.S. political right)|right-wing media outlets]] and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to [[Build the Wall|"build the wall"]], he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/423590-mcconnell-suggests-shutdown-could-last-for-weeks|title=McConnell suggests shutdown could last for weeks|author=Carney, Jordain|date=January 2, 2019|newspaper=The Hill|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922153149/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/423590-mcconnell-suggests-shutdown-could-last-for-weeks|url-status=live}}</ref>

By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8.

===Relationship with Trump administration===
McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator [[Rand Paul]] during the 2016 presidential campaign. Following Paul's withdrawal from the race in February 2016, McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on February 4, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/politics/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-republican-nominee/index.html|title=McConnell 'committed to supporting' Trump|first=Eric|last=Bradner|website=CNN|date=May 5, 2016|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=August 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820073222/https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/politics/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-republican-nominee/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> However, McConnell disagreed with Trump on multiple subsequent occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge [[Gonzalo P. Curiel]] was biased against Trump because of his [[Mexican-American|Mexican heritage]], McConnell responded, "I don't agree with what he (Trump) had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else." In July 2016, after Trump had criticized the parents of Capt. [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]], a [[Islam in the United States|Muslim-American]] soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell stated, "All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services." On October 7, 2016, following the [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy|Donald Trump ''Access Hollywood'' controversy]], McConnell stated: "As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/08/us/politics/how-paul-ryan-and-mitch-mcconnell-have-disavowed-trumps-words-but-not-their-support.html|title=Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell Reject Donald Trump's Words, Over and Over, but Not His Candidacy|last1=Parlapiano|first1=Larry Buchanan, Alicia|date=October 8, 2016|last2=Yourish|first2=Karen|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 8, 2016|archive-date=October 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008101619/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/08/us/politics/how-paul-ryan-and-mitch-mcconnell-have-disavowed-trumps-words-but-not-their-support.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief|title=How Mitch McConnell Became Trump's Enabler-In-Chief|work=The New Yorker|author=Mayer, Jane|date=April 12, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919035353/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief|url-status=live}}</ref> and "abhors" his behavior.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/736047999/you-may-need-the-money-more-than-i-do-mcconnell-once-returned-trump-s-donation|title='You May Need The Money More Than I Do': McConnell Once Returned Trump's Donation|first1=Eric|last1=Mennel|first2=Kelly|last2=McEvers|first3=Tom|last3=Dreisbach|work=npr.org|date=July 11, 2019|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823222825/https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/736047999/you-may-need-the-money-more-than-i-do-mcconnell-once-returned-trump-s-donation|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2017, White House chief strategist [[Stephen Bannon]] and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration's legislation.

On November 5, 2019, as the [[House of Representatives]] began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell stated "I will say I'm pretty sure how <nowiki>[an impeachment trial is]</nowiki> likely to end. ... If it were today, I don't think there's any question―it would not lead to" the removal of President Trump from office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/05/mcconell-senate-acquit-trump-066103|title=McConnell says Senate would acquit Trump if trial held today|work=[[Politico]]|author=Levine, Marianne|date=November 5, 2019|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=October 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030221116/https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/05/mcconell-senate-acquit-trump-066103|url-status=live}}</ref>

On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel [[Pat Cipollone]] and White House legislative affairs director [[Eric Ueland]]. Later that day, McConnell declared that for Trump's impeachment trial, he would be in "total coordination with the White House counsel's office" and Trump's representatives.<ref name="dictatetrial">{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=McConnell indicates he'll let Trump's lawyers dictate Trump's impeachment trial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/mcconnell-says-hell-let-trumps-white-house-dictate-trumps-impeachment-trial/ |access-date=December 20, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 14, 2019 |archive-date=December 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219124528/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/mcconnell-says-hell-let-trumps-white-house-dictate-trumps-impeachment-trial/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/474399-mcconnell-says-hell-be-in-total-coordination-with-white-house-on-impeachment|title=McConnell says he'll be in 'total coordination' with White House on impeachment trial strategy|first=Jordain|last=Carney|date=December 12, 2019|access-date=December 20, 2019|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120195811/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/474399-mcconnell-says-hell-be-in-total-coordination-with-white-house-on-impeachment|url-status=live}}</ref> He also declared that there was "no chance" that the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Egan |first1=Lauren |title=McConnell: 'There's no chance' Trump is removed from office |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286 |access-date=December 16, 2019 |date=December 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215202600/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286 |archive-date=December 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump's impeachment trial, because according to McConnell, the Senate's role was to "act as judge and jury", not investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: "I'm not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it."<ref>{{cite news |title=Trump impeachment debate |url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2678381001 |access-date=December 20, 2019 |author=Coogan, Steve |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 17, 2019 |archive-date=December 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220140322/https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2678381001 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=David |last2=Cornwell |first2=Susan |title=On eve of expected impeachment, Trump lashes out at Pelosi, Democrats |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/top-senate-republican-opposes-demand-for-witnesses-in-trump-impeachment-trial-idUSKBN1YL15V?il=0 |access-date=December 20, 2019 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=December 17, 2019 |archive-date=November 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120195825/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/top-senate-republican-opposes-demand-for-witnesses-in-trump-impeachment-trial-idUSKBN1YL15V?il=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After Trump's acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump's acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process.

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]], McConnell initially opposed the [[Families First Coronavirus Response Act]], calling it a Democratic "ideological wish list".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487235-mcconnell-house-coronavirus-bill-an-ideological-wish-list|title=McConnell: House coronavirus bill an 'ideological wish list'|author=Carney, Jordain|work=The Hill|date=March 12, 2020|access-date=March 14, 2020|archive-date=March 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314203349/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487235-mcconnell-house-coronavirus-bill-an-ideological-wish-list|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The twisted politics of Washington's coronavirus response|publisher=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/twisted-politics-washington-s-coronavirus-response-n1156856|author=Allen, Jonathan|date=March 12, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=April 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402114359/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/twisted-politics-washington-s-coronavirus-response-n1156856|url-status=live}}</ref> He subsequently reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package.<ref name="fox">{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-holds-presser-on-round-3-of-coronavirus-legislation|title=McConnell tells GOP to pass House coronavirus bill: 'Gag and vote for it anyway'|author=Schultz, Marisa|work=Fox News|date=March 17, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804170935/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-holds-presser-on-round-3-of-coronavirus-legislation|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8.

McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other coronavirus response packages: the [[Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020]], and the [[CARES Act]]. The CARES Act was the largest [[economic stimulus]] package in U.S. history,<ref>Wire, Sarah D.

Speaking on the [[Hugh Hewitt]] radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional coronavirus aid funds – funds which he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds, instead of coronavirus relief as intended. His comments were met with sharp criticism from various state and local officials. States currently cannot declare bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news|title=McConnell Says He Favors Letting States Declare Bankruptcy|first1=Steven T.|last1=Dennis|first2=William|last2=Selway|work=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/mcconnell-says-he-favors-allowing-states-to-declare-bankruptcy|date=April 22, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929040047/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/mcconnell-says-he-favors-allowing-states-to-declare-bankruptcy|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the passage of the CARES Act, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional coronavirus relief measures in the Senate, saying in May that "I don't think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately," and stating that Congress should "<nowiki>[hit]</nowiki> pause" to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-republicans-blowback-aid.html|title=With Go-Slow Approach, Republicans Risk Political Blowback on Pandemic Aid|author=Hulse, Carl|work=The New York Times|date=May 15, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918091015/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-republicans-blowback-aid.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package, McConnell was absent from the talks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/mcconnell-stimulus-talks-coronavirus.html|title=In Stimulus Talks, McConnell Is Outside the Room and in a Tight Spot|author=Hulse, Carl|work=The New York Times|date=August 5, 2020|access-date=August 13, 2020|archive-date=August 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812124023/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/mcconnell-stimulus-talks-coronavirus.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/511554-mcconnell-time-to-restart-coronavirus-talks-amid-stalemate-on-deal|title=McConnell: Time to restart coronavirus talks|author=Carney, Jordain|work=The Hill|date=August 11, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922221616/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/511554-mcconnell-time-to-restart-coronavirus-talks-amid-stalemate-on-deal|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/510801-mcconnell-goes-hands-off-on-bill|author=Bolton, Alexander|work=The Hill|title=McConnell goes hands-off on coronavirus relief bill|date=August 6, 2020|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=September 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915150848/https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/510801-mcconnell-goes-hands-off-on-bill|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Political positions==
{{main|Political positions of Mitch McConnell}}

McConnell has taken conservative stances for at least the last two decades.
