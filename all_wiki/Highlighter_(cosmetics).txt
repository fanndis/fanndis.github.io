Highlighters became a significant tool among theater and film actors shooting or performing indoors, where natural light was not available to provide definition of facial features like cheekbones, nose, and jawline.<ref name="McIntyre 2017" /> Highlighter also offered the possibility of heightening or diminishing a given feature to suit the character portrayed, as well as aesthetic trends.<ref name="McIntyre 2017" />

[[MAC Cosmetics]]'s Strobing Cream is credited as the first highlighter product to be made available to commercial consumers.<ref name="McIntyre 2017" />
