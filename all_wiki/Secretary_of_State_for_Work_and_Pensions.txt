The '''Secretary of State for Work and Pensions''', also referred to as the '''Work and Pensions Secretary''', is a senior [[Minister of the Crown]] within the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], and head of the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP). The office forms part of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]]. 

The current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is [[Thérèse Coffey]], [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] since her appointment by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in September 2019.

==Responsibilities==
Corresponding to what is generally known as a [[Minister of Labour|labour minister]] in many other countries, the Work and Pensions Secretary's remit includes:

* Support people of [[Working age|working age]]
* Oversight of employers and [[pensions]]
* Providing support for [[disabilities|disability]]
* Support for families and children<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions</ref>

==History==
It was created on 8 June 2001 by the merger of the Employment division of the [[Department for Education and Employment]] and the [[Department of Social Security]].<ref name="DWP Century">{{cite web |last1=Department for Work and Pensions |title=A century of support: Department for Work and Pensions turns 100 years old |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-century-of-support-department-for-work-and-pensions-turns-100-years-old |website=Department for Work and Pensions |accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref>

The [[Ministry of Pensions]] was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. In 1944 a separate [[Ministry of National Insurance]] (titled the Ministry of Social Insurance until 17 November 1944) was formed; the two merged in 1953 as the [[Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]].<ref name="DWP Century" /> In 1966 the Ministry was renamed the [[Ministry of Social Security (UK)|Ministry of Social Security]], but this was short-lived, as the Ministry merged with the [[Ministry of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] in 1968 to form the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. Confusingly, the Secretary of State responsible for this Department was titled the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]]. The Department was de-merged in 1988, creating the separate [[Department of Health]] and Department of Social Security.
