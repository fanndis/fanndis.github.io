The word '''AMGen''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the company's original name, '''A'''pplied '''M'''olecular '''Gen'''etics, which became the official name of the company in 1983 (three years after incorporation and coincident with its [[initial public offering]]). The company's first [[chief executive officer]], from 1980, was co-founder [[George Rathmann|George B. Rathmann]], followed by [[Gordon Binder|Gordon M.

==Timeline==
*1980. William Bowes from Cetus Corporation recruits Winston Salser from UCLA to start Amgen with a scientific advisory board consisting of [[Norman Davidson (biologist)|Norman Davidson]], [[Leroy Hood]], [[Arnold Berk]], [[John Carbon]], [[Robert Schimke]], [[Arno Motulsky]], [[Marvin H.

*1989. Amgen received approval for the first recombinant human erythropoetin product, Epogen, for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney failure. Epogen (also marketed by Johnson and Johnson under the tradename Procrit) would later be approved for anemia due to cancer chemotherapy, anemia due to treatment with certain [[HIV drug resistance|HIV drugs]], and for the reduction of the need for transfusions associated with surgery.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=103795&DrugName=ENBREL&ActiveIngred=ETANERCEPT&SponsorApplicant=IMMUNEX&ProductMktStatus=1&goto=Search.DrugDetails |title=Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products }}</ref>

* 1998. In November 1998, Immunex, a future acquisition of Amgen, received approval for Enbrel (etanercept), the first rheumatoid arthritis drug targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).<ref name="auto"/> A 2006 assessment by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom concluded that etanercept and related rheumatoid arthritis drugs later introduced by competitors "are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints."<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YF, Jobanputra P, Barton P |title=A systematic review of the effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults and an economic evaluation of their cost-effectiveness |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=10 |issue=42 |pages=iii–iv, xi–xiii, 1–229 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17049139 |doi= 10.3310/hta10420|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref> A more recent study demonstrated that compared to traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, treatment with etanercept improved survival, reduced cardiovascular events and reduced the incidence of hematological cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Morgan CL, Emery P, Porter D |title=Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with etanercept with reference to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs: long-term safety and survival using prospective, observational data |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=186–94 |date=January 2014 |pmid=24140761 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/ket333 |display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on December 18, 2012 that Amgen pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalty and $612 million to resolve 11 related [[whistleblower]] complaints.
