'''Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge''' (Mary Adelaide Wilhelmina Elizabeth; 27 November 1833 &ndash; 27 October 1897) was a member of the [[British royal family]], a granddaughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], grandmother of [[Edward VIII]] and [[George VI]] and great-grandmother of [[Elizabeth II]]. She held the title of [[Duke of Teck|Duchess of Teck]] through marriage.

Mary Adelaide is remembered as the mother of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], the wife of [[George V]]. She was one of the first royals to patronise a wide range of charities.

Mary Adelaide was born on 27 November 1833 in [[Hanover]], [[German Confederation]]. Her father was [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]], the youngest surviving son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].<ref name=hello13>{{cite news|title=The other Princess of Cambridge|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2013071113438/kate-middleton-baby-princess-cambridge/|accessdate=20 July 2013|newspaper=Hello!|date=11 July 2013}}</ref> Her mother was [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel]], the daughter of [[Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel|Prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel]].<ref name=hello13/> As a male-line granddaughter of a British monarch, she was styled as a British princess with the prefix of ''[[Royal Highness]]''.

The young princess was baptized on 9 January 1834 at Cambridge House, [[Hanover]], by Rev John Ryle Wood, Chaplain to the Duke of Cambridge. Her godmother and paternal aunt [[Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth, Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg]], was the only godparent who was present. The others were [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] and [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] (her paternal uncle and aunt), [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh]] (her paternal aunt), [[Princess Marie of Hesse-Cassel]] (her maternal aunt) and [[Princess Marie Luise Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel]] (her maternal first cousin). She was named Mary Adelaide Wilhelmina Elizabeth for her aunts and uncle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings |title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings |access-date=2009-07-08 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Fn0l7vK?url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings |archive-date=2011-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=19126|page=227|date=7 February 1834}}</ref>

Mary Adelaide spent the early years of her life in Hanover, where her father acted as viceroy, in place of her uncles [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and later [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].<ref name=hello13/>

After the death of William IV, Mary Adelaide's first cousin, [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria of Kent]] ascended the throne in 1837.<ref name=bulletin53>{{cite news|title=A Queen of great courage|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P0I-AAAAIBAJ&pg=6412,6010771&dq=mary+adelaide+of+cambridge&hl=en|accessdate=20 July 2013|newspaper=The Bulletin|date=20 March 1953}}</ref> However, [[Salic law]] prevented Victoria from ascending the throne of Hanover, which instead passed to [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]]. Thus, the [[personal union]] which had existed for over a century between Britain and Hanover came to an end along with the arrangement of Hanover's ruler living in England as the British monarch and using a viceroy to represent him in Hanover. The Duke of Cumberland moved to Hanover as King and Mary Adelaide's father, no longer needed in Hanover, returned to [[London]] with his family, setting up residence in [[Kensington Palace]].

==Marriage==

By the age of 30, Mary Adelaide was still unmarried. Her large girth (earning her the disparaging epithet of "Fat Mary"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=A.N.|title=Victoria: a Life|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Press HC|location=New York|isbn=978-1594205996|page=CXCV|edition=First US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Adelaide, Princess|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=40730&back=|website=Oxford DNB|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Ridley|first1=Jane|title=The Heir Apparent: a Life of Edward VII, the Playboy Prince|date=2014|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0812972634|edition=Digital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g24Bza22uSIC&q=The+Heir+Apparent+Jane+Ridley|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref>) and lack of income were contributing factors, as was her advanced age. However, her royal rank prevented her from marrying someone not of royal blood. Her cousin, [[Queen Victoria]], took pity on her and attempted to arrange pairings.

Eventually a suitable candidate was found in [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]], [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Prince Francis of Teck]]. The Prince was of lower rank than Mary Adelaide, was the product of a [[morganatic marriage]] and had no succession rights to the throne of Württemberg, but was at least of princely title and of royal blood. With no other options available, Mary Adelaide decided to marry him. The couple were married on 12 June 1866 at [[St. Anne's Church, Kew]], [[Surrey]].

The Duke and Duchess of Teck chose to reside in [[London]] rather than abroad, mainly because Mary Adelaide received £5,000 per annum as a Parliamentary annuity and carried out royal duties. Her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, also provided her with supplementary income. Requests to Queen Victoria for extra funds were generally refused; however, the queen did provide the Tecks with apartments at [[Kensington Palace]]<ref name=smh1936jan>{{cite news|title=Queen Mary. Devotion to duty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GuBUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922,3040739&dq=mary+adelaide+of+cambridge&hl=en|accessdate=21 July 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 January 1936}}</ref> and [[White Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]] as a country house.

Mary Adelaide requested that her new husband be granted the style ''[[Royal Highness]]'', but this was refused by Queen Victoria. The queen did, however, promote Francis to the rank of ''[[Highness]]'' in 1887 in celebration of her [[Golden Jubilee]].

==Issue==
The Tecks had one daughter and three sons:<ref>‘Teck’, ''[[Who Was Who]]'', [[A & C Black]], 1920–2008; online edn, [[Oxford University Press]], Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U191492, accessed 4 Jan 2012]{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Life abroad==
[[File:Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck by Alexander Bassano.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Adelaide in c.1880]]
Despite their modest income, Mary Adelaide had expensive tastes and lived an extravagant life of parties, expensive food and clothes and holidays abroad. In 1883 they were forced to live more cheaply abroad to reduce their debts. They travelled to [[Florence]], [[Italy]], and also stayed with relatives in Germany and Austria. Initially, they travelled under the names of the Count and Countess von Hohenstein. However, Mary Adelaide wished to travel in more style and reverted to her royal style, which commanded significantly more attention and better service.

==Later life and death==
The Tecks returned from their self-imposed exile in 1885 and continued to live at Kensington Palace and White Lodge in Richmond Park.<ref name=smh1936jan/> Mary Adelaide began devoting her life to charity, serving as patron to [[Barnardo's]] and other children's charities.

In 1891, Mary Adelaide was keen for her daughter, [[Mary of Teck|Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]] (known as "May") to marry one of the sons of the Prince of Wales, the future [[Edward VII]].  At the same time, Queen Victoria wanted a British-born bride for the future king, though of course one of royal rank and ancestry, and Mary Adelaide's daughter fulfilled the rank criteria. After Queen Victoria's approval, May became engaged to [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], second in line to the British throne.<ref name=smh1936jan/> He died suddenly six weeks later. Queen Victoria was fond of Princess Mary and persuaded the Duke of Clarence's brother and next in the line of succession, [[George V|Prince George, Duke of York]], to marry her instead. They married in the [[Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace]], on 6 July 1893.<ref name=smh1936jan/>

Mary Adelaide never lived to see her daughter become Princess of Wales or Queen, as she died on 27 October 1897 at White Lodge, following an emergency operation.<ref name=emonarchs>{{cite web|title=Mary of Teck|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor_31.html|publisher=English Monarchs|accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref> She was buried in the royal vault at [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St. George's Chapel]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].<ref name=emonarchs/>

Mary Adelaide Close, on the edge of Richmond Park, is named after her.
