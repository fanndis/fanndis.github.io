The '''International Federation of the Phonographic Industry''' ('''IFPI''') is the organisation that represents the interests of the [[recording industry]] worldwide. It is a non-profit members' organisation registered in Switzerland and founded in Italy in 1933. It operates a [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] based in London, with regional offices in [[Brussels]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Miami]] and [[Nairobi]].

==Function==
IFPI's mission is to promote the value of recorded music, campaign for record producer rights, and expand the commercial uses of recorded music.<ref name="IFPI-About"/> Its services to members include a legal policy programme, litigation, content protection, sales reporting for the recorded music market, insight and analysis and work in the areas of performance rights, technology and trade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifpi.org/what-we-do.php|title=What We Do — IFPI — Representing the recording industry worldwide|website=www.ifpi.org|access-date=2019-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711083715/https://ifpi.org/what-we-do.php|archive-date=11 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
Members of the international phonographic industry formed IFPI at the industry's first international congress in Rome, Italy, held from 10–14 November 1933.<ref>{{cite book |title=Archiv für Urheber-, Film- und Theaterrecht |contribution=Der Schutz der Schallplatte nach italienischen Verordnung vom 18. February 1937. |last=Thalheim |first=Dr. R. |volume=11 |page=39 |year=1938 |publisher=Julius Springer |location=Berlin}}</ref> IFPI described its mission as representing "the interests of the recording industry worldwide in all fora"<ref>{{cite book |last=Drahos |first=Peter |last2=Braithwaite |first2=John |title=Information Feudalism: Who Owns The Knowledge Economy? |pages=181–182 |isbn=1-85383-917-5 |year=2002 |publisher=Earthscan |quote=The key actor in coordinating the industry's piracy strategy became its international trade association, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

===Phonogram copyrights established===
The IFPI lobbied at the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations]] of 1961, which established an international standard for the protection of sound recordings, live performances and broadcasts. This Convention was opposed by trade groups representing authors and composers, who were concerned that establishing such "[[related rights|neighbouring rights]]" would undermine their own control over how their works were used and would result in prohibitively expensive licensing.<ref>Drahos & Braithwaite (2002), p. 181: "Authors and composers became increasingly worried by copyright's technological turn. They saw it as compromising the artistic purity of copyright. At a more practical level, authors were worried that the recognition of a 'neighbouring right' in the form of a sound recording would undermine their control over the use of works as well as add to users' costs. Users would now have to pay additional licence fees to producers of sound recordings. It was the resistance of key author associations that helps to explain why it took more than 30 years for an international standard for the protection of sound recordings to emerge in the form of the Rome Convention of 1961."</ref> Pressure from United States-based broadcasters who didn't want to license the records they broadcast, among other factors, kept the United States from signing the Convention; the United States would not recognise a separate sound recording copyright until 1971.<ref>Drahos & Braithwaite (2002), p. 181: "The US did not join the Rome Convention. Aside from some constitutional issues, powerful broadcasting organisations in the US did not want to endanger a status quo in which they received records from the recording industry for free or at a discount. Domestically, the US did not recognise a separate copyright in sound recordings until 1971."</ref>

===Phonogram copy protection efforts===
In an effort to combat copyright violation, in 1971, the IFPI advocated for the [[Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms]] (the Geneva Phonograms Convention), which 72 countries signed.<ref>Drahos & Braithwaite (2002), p. 181: "After its major lobbying effort on the Rome Convention [of 1961], IFPI began a campaign against piracy. It pushed for and obtained in 1971 the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorised Duplication of their Phonograms."</ref>

In 1986, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] established the [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) standard, ISO 3901. In 1989, the IFPI was designated the registration authority for ISRC codes. ISRC codes "enable the use of copyright protected recordings and works to be controlled; facilitate the distribution and collection of royalties (performances, private copying); and assist in the fight against piracy".<ref>''ISRC Practical Guide'', 3rd edition, 1998, International ISRC Agency, London.</ref>

To further combat infringement of recorded works, the IFPI and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced Source Identification (SID) codes in 1994. The SID codes are markings on optical discs such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) that identify the manufacturer, equipment, and master discs used to create each disc. There are two codes: the SID mastering code and the SID mould code. The SID mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced. The SID mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded (replicated). Since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities have the ability to both produce master discs and replicate discs, the SID mastering code and SID mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility.<ref name="IFPI-SID">{{cite web |url=http://ifpi.org/content/library/sid-code-implementation-guide.pdf |title=SID Code Implementation Guide |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |work=IFPI |publisher=International Federation of the Phonographic Industry |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202134742/http://ifpi.org/content/library/sid-code-implementation-guide.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|3,4}}

SID codes follow a standard format consisting of the letters "IFPI" followed by four or five hexadecimal digits. A number prefaced with "L" is a "mastering code", a serial number taken from a pool assigned by [[Philips]] to the manufacturer. The mastering code identifies the Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or a glass master disc from which moulds are produced. Non-"L" numbers are "mould codes", which identify the manufacturer that replicated the disc. Phillips assigns the first 2 or 3 digits of the mould code and the remaining digits are a serial number assigned by that plant to its moulds.<ref name="IFPI-SID" />{{rp|4,7}}

===The Pirate Bay incidents===
In mid-October 2007, after IFPI let the ifpi.com domain registration lapse, ownership of the ifpi.com domain was transferred to [[The Pirate Bay]], a group which claimed it received the domain from an anonymous donor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/ifpi-now-owned-by-the-piratebay-071012/|title=Anti-Piracy Organization Domain IFPI.com Now Owned by The Pirate Bay|publisher=TorrentFreak|author=Ernesto|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=2008-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023203531/http://torrentfreak.com/ifpi-now-owned-by-the-piratebay-071012/|archive-date=23 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The group set up a Website under the domain titled "International Federation of Pirates Interests", a [[Backronym#Replacement|replacement backronym]] for IFPI. Ownership of the domain was returned to IFPI in late November, when a [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] arbitration panel concluded that "the Disputed Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark in which the [IFPI] has rights" and that the Pirate Bay's representative "registered and [was] using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith" and failed to adequately rebut IFPI's contention that he "has no rights or a legitimate interest in the Disputed Domain Name".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-1328.html|title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center Administrative Panel Decision: IFPI Secretariat, IFPI International Federation of the Phonographic Industry v.
