'''''Women's Tales''''' is an ongoing short film series created by fashion brand [[Miu Miu]]. Aside from the stipulation that the films use Miu Miu clothing the all female directors are given carte blanche to create their films. Miu Miu has commissioned two films a year since 2011, one for their summer collection and one for the winter collection.

Since 2012, all of the winter collection films have had their world premiere at the ''Venice Days'' section of the [[Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=It's Getting Late|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=71&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=Le donne della Vucciria|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=240&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=#8 Somebody per festval|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=434&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=Les 3 boutons|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=549&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=That One Day - Women's Tales #12|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=707&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Venice Days|title=#14 (The [End) of History Illusion]|url=http://www.venice-days.com/film.asp?id=14&id_dettaglio=884&lang=eng|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> The summer collection films, which typically premiere during the [[New York Fashion Week]] in February, are shown there as well.
