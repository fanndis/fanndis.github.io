'''Jamesetta Hawkins''' (January 25, 1938 – January 20, 2012), known professionally as '''Etta James''', was an American singer who performed in various genres, including [[blues]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. Starting her career in 1954, she gained fame with hits such as "[[The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)|The Wallflower]]", "[[At Last]]", "[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]", "[[Something's Got a Hold on Me]]", and "[[I'd Rather Go Blind]]".<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame |url-access= registration |title=Rage to Survive: The Etta James Story |author1=James, Etta |author2=Ritz, David |page=[https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame/page/173 173]|publisher=Da Capo Press|date= 2003 |access-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> She faced a number of personal problems, including [[Opioid use disorder|heroin addiction]], severe physical abuse, and [[Imprisonment|incarceration]], before making a musical comeback in the late 1980s with the album ''[[Seven Year Itch (Etta James album)|Seven Year Itch]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Yf2741A_BkYC&q=Seven+Year+Itch+etta+james&pg=PA116 |title=A to Z of American Women in the Performing Arts |author=Sonneborn, Liz|page=116|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year= 2002 |isbn=9781438107905 |access-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

James's powerful, deep, earthy voice bridged the gap between [[rhythm and blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. She won six [[Grammy Awards]] and 17 [[Blues Music Award]]s. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993, the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999 and the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref name="Downbeat">[http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news&subsect=news_detail&nid=814 "Etta James Hospitalized, Tour Suspended"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113212847/http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news&subsect=news_detail&nid=814 |date=January 13, 2009 }}.

==Life and career==

===1938–1959: Childhood and career beginnings===
Hawkins was born on January 25, 1938, in [[Los Angeles, California]], to Dorothy Hawkins, who was 14 at the time. Although her father has never been identified,<ref name=Icon>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R-DpxKQ67IkC&q=Dorothy+Hawkins&pg=PA149 |title=Icons of R&B and Soul |author=Bob Gulla|page=149|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year= 2008|isbn=9780313340451 |access-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> James speculated that she was the daughter of pool player [[Rudolf Wanderone|Rudolf "Minnesota Fats" Wanderone]], whom she met briefly in 1987.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/19/mjazz.02.etta.james/index.html|title=A Life Singing the Blues|author=Quan, Denise|publisher=CNN|date=September 25, 2002|access-date=May 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123054025/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/19/mjazz.02.etta.james/index.html|archive-date=January 23, 2012}}</ref> Her mother was frequently absent from their apartment in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], conducting relationships with various men, and James lived with a series of foster parents, most notably "Sarge" and "Mama" Lu. James referred to her mother as "the Mystery Lady".<ref name=Icon/>

James received her first professional vocal training at the age of five from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at the St. Paul Baptist Church, in [[South Los Angeles|South-Central Los Angeles]]. Under his tutelage, she suffered physical abuse during her formative years, with her instructor often punching her in the chest while she sang to force her voice to come from her gut. As a consequence, she developed an unusually strong voice for a child her age.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=Spencer|title=Etta James: Acclaimed Soul Singer Who Fought to Overcome Her Personal Demons|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/etta-james-acclaimed-soul-singer-who-fought-to-overcome-her-personal-demons-6292566.html|access-date=December 8, 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

Sarge, like the [[Music director|musical director]] for the [[choir]], was also abusive. During drunken poker games at home, he would awaken James in the early morning hours and force her with beatings to sing for his friends. The trauma of her foster father forcing her to sing under these humiliating circumstances caused her to have difficulties with singing on demand throughout her career.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame |url-access= registration |quote= creolettes etta james. |title=Rage to Survive |author1=James, Etta |author2=Ritz, David |page=[https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame/page/20 20]|date=2003 |access-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref>

In 1950, Mama Lu died, and James's biological mother took her to the [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore district]] of San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame |url-access= registration |quote= your mother has passed etta james. |title=Rage to Survive |author1=James, Etta |author2=Ritz, David |page=[https://archive.org/details/ragetosurviveett00jame/page/31 31]|date=2003 |access-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Within a couple of years, she began listening to [[doo-wop]] and was inspired to form a [[girl group]], the Creolettes (so named for the members' light-skinned complexions).

At the age of 14, she met musician [[Johnny Otis]]. Stories on how they met vary. In Otis's version, she came to his hotel after one of his performances in the city and persuaded him to audition her. Another story was that Otis spotted the Creolettes performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his "[[answer song]]" to [[Hank Ballard]]'s "[[Work with Me, Annie]]". Otis took the group under his wing, helping them sign to [[Modern Records]] and changing their name from the Creolettes to the Peaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/etta-james-mn0000806542/biography|title=Etta James {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref> He also gave the singer her stage name, transposing Jamesetta into Etta James. James recorded the version, for which she was given credit as co-author, in 1954, and the record was released in early 1955 as "[[The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)|Dance with Me, Henry]]". The original title of the song was "Roll with Me, Henry", but it was changed to avoid censorship due to the off-color title (''roll'' implying sexual activity). In February of that year, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Tracks]] chart.<ref name="rockhall.com"/> Its success gave the group an opening spot on [[Little Richard]]'s national tour.<ref name="whitepp68,78">White, Charles (2003). ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' Omnibus Press. pp. 68, 78.</ref>

While James was on tour with Richard, pop singer [[Georgia Gibbs]] recorded a version of James's song, which was released under the title "The Wallflower" and became a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], which angered James. After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&B hit with "Good Rockin' Daddy" but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up for renewal in 1960, she signed a contract with [[Chess Records]] instead. Shortly afterward she was involved in a relationship with the singer [[Harvey Fuqua]], the founder of the doo-wop group the [[The Moonglows|Moonglows]].

Musician [[Bobby Murray (musician)|Bobby Murray]] toured with James for over 20 years. He wrote that James had her first hit single when she was 15 years old and went steady with [[B.B. King]] when she was 16. James believed that King's hit single "Sweet Sixteen" was about her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120126071506/http://www.noquarterusa.net/blog/870/taters-and-other-fascinating-people/ "Taters and Other Fascinating People"]. Noquarterusa.net. Retrieved January 20, 2012.</ref> In early 1955, she and an aspiring singer, the 19-year-old [[Elvis Presley]], then recording for [[Sun Studio]]s and an avid fan of King's, shared a bill in a large club just outside Memphis. In her autobiography, she noted how impressed she was with the young singer's manners. She also recalled how happy he made her many years later when she found out that it was Presley who had moved her close friend [[Jackie Wilson]] from a substandard convalescent home to a more appropriate facility and, as she put it, paid all the expenses. Presley died a year later. Wilson went on to live for another ten years in the care center Presley found for him.

=== 1960–1978: Chess and Warner Brothers years ===
Dueting with [[Harvey Fuqua]], James recorded for [[Argo Records]] (later renamed [[Cadet Records]]), a label established by Chess. Her first hit singles with Fuqua were "If I Can't Have You" and "[[Spoonful]]". Her first solo hit was the doo-wop–styled rhythm-and-blues song "[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]", which was a number two R&B hit.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p387|pure_url=yes}}|title=Etta James: Biography|last=Dahl|first=Bill|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> Chess Records co-founder [[Leonard Chess]] envisioned James as a classic ballad stylist who had potential to cross over to the pop charts and soon surrounded the singer with violins and other string instruments.<ref name="allmusic"/> The first string-laden ballad James recorded was "My Dearest Darling" in May 1960, which peaked in the top five of the R&B chart. James sang background vocals for her labelmate [[Chuck Berry]] on his "[[Back in the U.S.A.]]"<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ettajames/biography|title=Etta James: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=December 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012234/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ettajames/biography|archive-date=December 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://members.home.nl/henk.gorter/Itc6005.html In the Can, May 1960.]</ref>

Her debut album, ''[[At Last!]]'', was released in late 1960 and was noted for its varied selection of music, from [[jazz|jazz standards]] to [[blues]] to doo-wop and [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B).<ref name="atlast">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88822|pure_url=yes}}|title=Etta Hames, ''At Last!'': Review|last=Cook|first=Stephen|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> The album included the future classic "[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]" and "[[A Sunday Kind of Love]]". In early 1961, James released what was to become her signature song, "[[At Last]]", which reached number two on the R&B chart and number 47 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Though the record was not as successful as expected, her rendition has become the best-known version of the song.<ref name="rollingstone"/> James followed that with "Trust in Me", which also included string instruments.<ref name="allmusic"/> Later that same year, James released a second studio album, ''[[The Second Time Around (Etta James album)|The Second Time Around]]''. The album took the same direction as her first, covering jazz and pop standards and with strings on many of the songs. It produced two hit singles, "Fool That I Am" and "Don't Cry Baby".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88818|pure_url=yes}}|title=Etta James, ''The Second Time Around'': Review|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref>

James started adding gospel elements in her music the following year, releasing "Something's Got a Hold on Me", which peaked at number four on the R&B chart and was a Top 40 pop hit.<ref name="musicianguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004513/Etta-James.html|title=Etta James Biography|authors=Taylor, B. Kimberley; Paulson, Linda Dailey |publisher=Musician Guide |access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> That success was quickly followed by "Stop the Wedding", which reached number six on the R&B chart and also had gospel elements.<ref name="rollingstone"/> In 1963, she had another major hit with "Pushover" and released the live album ''[[Etta James Rocks the House]]'', recorded at the New Era Club in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="allmusic"/> After a couple of years of minor hits, James's career started to suffer after 1965. After a period of isolation, she returned to recording in 1967 and reemerged with more gutsy R&B numbers thanks to her recording at the legendary FAME Studios in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]. These sessions yielded her comeback hit "[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]", co-written by [[Clarence Carter]], which reached number ten R&B and number twenty-three pop. An album of the same name was also released that year and included her take on [[Otis Redding]]'s "[[Security (Otis Redding song)|Security]]".<ref name="oldies">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Etta-James.html|title=''Etta James Biography'' | last=Larkin | first=Collin | publisher=oldies.com | access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> The [[B-side]] of "Tell Mama" was "[[I'd Rather Go Blind]]", which became a blues classic and has been recorded by many other artists. In her autobiography, ''Rage to Survive'', she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington "Fugi" Jordan when she visited him in prison.<ref>James, Etta; Ritz, David (1995). ''Rage to Survive''. {{ISBN|0-306-80812-9}}.</ref> According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan, but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, Billy Foster.

Following this success, James became an in-demand concert performer though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. Her records continued to chart in the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] Top 40 in the early 1970s, with singles such as "Losers Weepers" (1970) and "I Found a Love" (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of [[Leonard Chess]] in 1969. James ventured into rock and [[funk]] with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer [[Gabriel Mekler]], who had worked with [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Janis Joplin]], who had admired James and had covered "Tell Mama" in concert. The album, known for its mixture of musical styles, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name="oldies"/> The album did not produce any major hits; neither did the follow-up, ''Come a Little Closer'', in 1974, though, like ''Etta James'' before it, the album was also critically acclaimed. James continued to record for Chess (now owned by [[All Platinum Records]]), releasing one more album in 1976, ''Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!'' Her 1978 album ''Deep in the Night'', produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire.<ref name="allmusic"/> That same year, James was the opening act for the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Following this brief success, however, she left Chess Records and did not record for another ten years as she struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism.

=== 1982–2012: Later career ===
James continued to perform on occasion in the early 1980s, including two guest appearances at [[Grateful Dead]] concerts in December 1982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Birthday Etta James: Grateful Dead Sit-In On New Year's 1982 |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/happy-birthday-etta-james-grateful-dead-sit-in-on-new-years-1982 |website=JamBase |access-date=July 1, 2020 |date=January 25, 2016}}</ref> and was a guest on John Mayal's [[Blues Breakers]] 1982 reunion show in NJ . In 1984 she contacted [[David Wolper]] and asked to perform in the opening ceremony of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], at which she sang "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glAu9xxlMJ8&list=PLiFG--hp3gpW60VYhtj8L7nkAe8FjPqH7 |title=Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Opening Ceremony Complete |publisher=YouTube |date=September 6, 2014 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> In 1987, she performed "[[Rock & Roll Music]]" with [[Chuck Berry]] in the documentary film ''[[Hail!

In 1989, she signed with [[Island Records]] and released the albums ''Seven Year Itch'' and ''Stickin' to My Guns'', both of which were produced by [[Barry Beckett]] and recorded at FAME Studios.<ref name="oldies"/> Also in 1989 James was filmed in a concert at the [[Wiltern Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]] with [[Joe Walsh]] and [[Albert Collins]] for the film ''[[Jazzvisions]]: Jump the Blues Away''. Many of the backing musicians were top-flight players from Los Angeles: [[Rick Rosas]] (bass), [[Michael Huey]] (drums), Ed Sanford (Hammond B3 organ), Kip Noble (piano) and Josh Sklair, her longtime guitar player.

James participated with the rap singer [[Def Jef]] on the song "Droppin' Rhymes on Drums", which mixed James's jazz vocals with hip-hop. In 1992, she recorded the album ''[[The Right Time (Etta James album)|The Right Time]]'', produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] for [[Elektra Records]]. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.<ref name="rockhall.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=128|title=Etta James&nbsp;– inductee|publisher=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=December 5, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123045627/http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=128|archive-date = November 23, 2006}}</ref>

James signed with [[Private Music Records]] in 1993 and recorded a [[Billie Holiday]] tribute album, ''Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday''.<ref name="musicianguide"/> The album set a trend of incorporating more jazz elements in James's music.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album won James her first Grammy Award, for [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female|Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female]], in 1994. In 1995, her autobiography, ''A Rage to Survive'', co-written with David Ritz, was published. Also in 1995, she recorded the album ''Time After Time''. A Christmas album, ''Etta James Christmas'', was released in 1998.<ref name="allmusic"/>

By the mid-1990s, James's earlier classic music was being used in commercials, including "[[I Just Wanna Make Love to You]]". After an excerpt of the song was featured in a Diet Coke advertising campaign in the UK, it reached the top ten on the UK charts in 1996.<ref name="rockhall.com"/>

By 1998, with the release of ''[[Life, Love & the Blues]]'', she had added as backing musicians her sons, Donto and Sametto, on drums and bass, respectively.<ref name="All Music Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/life-love-the-blues-mw0000599469/credits|title=''Life, Love & the Blues'', Etta James|website=All Music Guide|access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref> They continued as part of her touring band. She went on recording for Private Music, which released the blues album ''Matriarch of the Blues'' in 2000, on which she returned to her R&B roots; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hailed it as a "solid return to roots", further stating that with this album she was "reclaiming her throne—and defying anyone to knock her off it".<ref name="musicianguide"/> In 2001, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]], the latter for her contributions to the developments of both rock and roll and [[rockabilly]]. In 2003, she received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. On her 2004 release, ''Blue Gardenia'', she returned to a jazz style. Her final album for Private Music, ''[[Let's Roll (album)|Let's Roll]]'', released in 2005, won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=etta%20james&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Etta James Awards|publisher=Grammy.com|access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref>

She also often performed at free summer arts festivals throughout the United States.

In 2008, James was portrayed by [[Beyoncé Knowles]] in the film ''[[Cadillac Records]]'', a fictional account of Chess Records, James's label for 18 years, and how label founder and producer Leonard Chess helped the careers of James and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1581909/beyonce-to-portray-legendary-blues-singer-etta-james-in-cadillac-records/|title=Beyonce to Portray Legendary Blues Singer Etta James in 'Cadillac Records'|publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]]|access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> The film portrayed her pop hit "At Last".

In April 2009, at the age of 71, James made her final television appearance, performing "At Last" on the program ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. In May 2009, she received the Soul/Blues Female Artist of the Year award from the [[Blues Foundation]], the ninth time she won the award. She carried on touring but by 2010 had to cancel concert dates because of her gradually failing health, after it was revealed that she was suffering from [[dementia]] and [[leukemia]]. In November 2011, James released her final album, ''[[The Dreamer (Etta James album)|The Dreamer]]'', which was critically acclaimed upon its release. She announced that this would be her final album. Her continuing relevance was affirmed in 2011 when the late Swedish DJ [[Avicii]] achieved substantial chart success with the song "[[Levels (Avicii song)|Levels]]", which samples her 1962 song "[[Etta James Top Ten|Something's Got a Hold on Me]]". The same sample was used by the east coast rapper [[Flo Rida]] in his 2011 hit single "[[Good Feeling (song)|Good Feeling]]".

At the beginning of her recording career, in the mid-1950s, James was marketed as an R&B and [[doo-wop]] singer.<ref name="allmusic"/> After signing with Chess Records in 1960, James broke through as a [[traditional pop]]-styled singer, covering jazz and pop music standards on her debut album, ''At Last!''<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88823|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Tell Mama'' album review|last=Dahl|first=Bill|website=allmusic|access-date=December 8, 2008}}</ref> James's voice deepened and coarsened, moving her musical style in her later years into the genres of soul and jazz.<ref name="allmusic"/>

James was once considered one of the most overlooked blues and R&B musicians in the [[music history of the United States]]. It was not until the early 1990s, when she began receiving major industry awards from the Grammys and the Blues Foundation, that she received wide recognition. In recent years,{{When|date=April 2020}} she was seen as bridging the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll.

=== Legal difficulties and drug addiction ===
By the mid-1960s, James was addicted to [[heroin]]. She bounced checks, forged prescriptions and stole from her friends to finance her addiction.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Remembering Etta James, Stunning Singer|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/20/123125338/remembering-etta-james-stunning-singer|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|date=January 20, 2012|website=NPR|language=en}}</ref> James was arrested in 1966 for writing bad checks.

James encountered a string of legal problems during the early 1970s due to her heroin addiction. She was continuously in and out of rehabilitation centers, including the Tarzana Treatment Centers, in Los Angeles, California. Her husband Artis Mills accepted responsibility when they were both arrested for heroin possession and served a 10-year prison sentence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20061790,00.html|title=How Etta Got Her Groove Back|work=People|access-date=February 6, 2009}}</ref> He was released from prison in 1981.<ref name="musicianguide" />

During this period, she became addicted to methadone and would mix her doses with heroin.<ref name=":0" /> She was in the Tarzana Psychiatric Hospital for 17 months, at the age of 36, and went through a great struggle at the start of treatment. In her autobiography, she said that the time she spent in the hospital changed her life. After leaving treatment, however, her substance abuse continued after she developed a relationship with a man who was also using drugs. 

In 1988, at the age of 50, James entered the [[Betty Ford Center]], in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], for treatment.<ref name="musicianguide" /> In 2010, James received treatment for a dependency on [[Analgesic|painkillers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-02-11-etta-james_N.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | title=Son says singer Etta James changes hospitals | date=February 11, 2010 | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
