'''Aging out''' is American [[popular culture]] [[vernacular]] used to describe anytime a [[youth]] leaves a formal system of care designed to provide services below a certain age level.

There are a variety of applications of the phrase throughout the [[youth development]] field.<ref>Pittman, K.

==Usage==
Often used to highlight the problems traditional foster care approaches face, aging out affects foster youth in a variety of ways. An estimated 30,000 adolescents age out of the foster care system each year in the United States.<ref>Brackett, E. (2005) [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/youth/jan-june05/foster_care_5-19.html Aging Out of Foster Care], ''Newshour'' television show, PBS. May 19, 2005. Retrieved 5/8/07.</ref>

Aging Out is also used in reference to Drum Corps International's rules which state that drum corps' members above the age of 18-to-21 are denied the ability to compete in World Class.

== Former Foster Youth in Education ==
Children who grow up in foster care have lower rates of high school and post-secondary education completion. Using the PRISMA methodology (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), Gypen et al. (2017) systematically gathered published research articles from  electronic databases such as PsychINFO, Springer, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Their comprehensive review included articles under the terms “Foster care” or “ Foster alumni” or “foster children” and “long-term perspectives” or “long-term results.”<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Gypen|first1=Laura|last2=Vanderfaeillie|first2=Johan|last3=De Maeyer|first3=Skrallan|last4=Belenger|first4=Laurence|last5=Van Holen|first5=Frank|date=May 2017|title=Outcomes of children who grew up in foster care: Systematic-review|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=76|pages=74–83|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.02.035|issn=0190-7409}}</ref> The studies included participants aged 17 years and older (no age cap) gathering data from family service systems and child protective systems.

==Responses==
In 1970, [[Title X]] of the [[Public Health Service Act]] started providing for the federal [[family planning]] program, designed to provide resources for health services and [[counseling]] to [[low-income]] or [[Insurance|uninsured individuals]] who may otherwise lack access to [[health care]], including young people aging out of foster care. The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s Family Unification Program, or FUP, provides [[Section 8 (housing)|Housing Choice Vouchers]] to young people aging out of the foster care system.

The Administration for Children's Services, or ACS, and the federal Office of Housing Policy and Development, in cooperation with the [[New York City Housing Authority]], has a [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Priority Code for young people aging out of the foster care system.<ref name="cwla.org"/>

In 1999, President Clinton signed the [[Foster Care Independence Act]], which doubled federal funding for [[independent living]] programs and provides funding for [[drug abuse prevention]] and [[health insurance]] for former foster care youth until age 21.<ref>Rhodes, L. (2006) "[http://www.connectforkids.org/node/4298 Young writers finding a powerful voice.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502180715/http://www.connectforkids.org/node/4298 |date=2007-05-02 }}" Retrieved 5/8/07.</ref>

Now programs and laws such as the CFCIP—the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program—are starting to make headway into ways to compensate foster children who have become adults. $140 million is to be funded for this program including states matching 20%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Content/ContentGroups/Issue_Briefs/IB-YouthAgingoutofFoster-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105230045/http://www.naco.org/Content/ContentGroups/Issue_Briefs/IB-YouthAgingoutofFoster-2008.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-05 }}</ref>
