{{Politics of Serbia}}
The current '''Constitution of the Republic of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|{{lang|sr-Cyrl|Устав Републике Србије}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Ustav Republike Srbije}}}}), also known as '''Mitrovdan Constitution''' ({{lang-sr|{{lang|sr-Cyrl|Митровдански устав}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Mitrovdanski ustav}}}}) was adopted in 2006, replacing the previous [[constitution]] dating from 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6097558.stm|title=Rare unity over Serb constitution|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=30 October 2006}}</ref> The adoption of new constitution became necessary in 2006 when Serbia became independent after [[Montenegro]]'s secession and the dissolution of [[Serbia and Montenegro]].

The proposed text of the constitution was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] on 30 September 2006 and put on [[2006 Serbian constitutional referendum|referendum]] which was held on 28–29 October 2006. After 53.04% of the electorate supported the proposed constitution, it was officially adopted on 8 November 2006.

The Constitution contains a [[preamble]], 206 articles, 11 parts, and no [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]]s.

==Main provisions==
Among the constitution's two hundred other articles are guarantees of [[Human rights|human]] and [[minority rights]], abolishment of [[capital punishment]], and banning of [[human cloning]]. It assigns the [[Serbian Cyrillic]] alphabet as the official script, while making provisions for the use of minority languages at local levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/dokumenti/index.php?nav_id=213697|title=Šta donosi predlog novog ustava Srbije|publisher=[[B92]]|language=Serbian|date=30 September 2006}}</ref> Among the differences between the current and previous constitution are:

*Only private, corporate and public property is acknowledged; ''social assets'' shall cease to exist.
*Foreign citizens are permitted to own property.
*Full independence is granted to the [[National Bank of Serbia]].
*As part of a process of [[decentralization]], the granting of municipal properties' ownership rights to local municipalities.
*The province of [[Vojvodina]] is granted limited financial autonomy.
*The constitution mentions "European values and standards" for the first time.
* The constitution assigns the [[Serbian language]] and the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] as the official language and [[alphabet]] in use, respectively.
*The adoption of the national anthem, ''[[Bože pravde]]'' (God of Justice).
*Special protection<!--any more details?--> for the rights of consumers, mothers, children and minorities.
*Greater freedom of information.<!--Previously phrased: Every citizen has the right to get information of public importance-->
*Marriage is defined as the "union between a man and a woman"

===Constitutional status of Kosovo===
The current constitution defines the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]] as an integral part of [[Serbia]], but with "substantial autonomy". Under the opinion of the [[Venice Commission]] in respect to ''substantial autonomy'' of Kosovo, an examination of The Constitution makes it clear that this fundamental autonomy is not at all guaranteed at the constitutional level, as the constitution delegates almost every important aspect of this autonomy to the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://venice.dctnet.coe.int/docs/2007/CDL-AD(2007)004-e.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213201133/http://venice.dctnet.coe.int/docs/2007/CDL-AD(2007)004-e.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 13, 2009|title=Opinion on the Constitution of Serbia|publisher=[[Venice Commission]]|date=17/18 March 2007|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>
