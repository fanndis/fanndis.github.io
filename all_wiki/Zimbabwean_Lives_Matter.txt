'''Zimbabwean Lives Matter''' is a [[Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean]] [[Protest|protest movement]] modeled after the American [[Black Lives Matter]] campaign. The protest movement is directed towards the Zimbabwean government of incumbent [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]] who took over through a 2017 bloodless coup from [[Robert Mugabe]].

Several celebrities have at least shown some interest in the protest movement with notable non-Zimbabwean celebrities like Former Botswana President [[Ian Khama]] <ref>{{cite news|last1=K|first1=1|date=7 August 2020|title=Former Botswana President Ian Khama stands in solidarity with Zimbabweans|work=|publisher=Gambakwe Media|agency=Gambakwe Media|url=https://gambakwe.com/2020/08/07/former-botswana-president-ian-khama-stands-in-solidarity-with-zimbabweans/|url-status=live|accessdate=23 August 2020}}</ref>, [[Ice Cube]], AKA and [[Lecrae]] and actresses [[Thandie Newton]] and [[Pearl Thusi]] joining in<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harding |first1=Andrew |title=Rappers and actors push Zimbabwe hashtag viral |url=https://www.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53665900 |accessdate=23 August 2020 |agency=BBC |publisher=BBC |date=4 August 2020}}</ref>.

Like the Black Lives Matter protest movement, the Zimbabwean Lives Matter protest movement does not have a central organiser as most of the activists have been protesting through their microblogging Twitter accounts. A [https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/ repository]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zimbabwean Lives Matter Archives|url=https://zimbabwean-lives-matter.org/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=zimbabwean-lives-matter.org|language=en-US}}</ref> of Zimbabwean Lives Matter materials has been created.
