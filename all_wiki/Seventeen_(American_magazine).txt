The magazine's reader-base is 13-to-19-year-old females and is published by [[New York City]]-based [[Hearst (media)|Hearst Corporation]]. Since its debut in [[New York City]] in August 1944.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seventeenmediakit.com/r5/showkiosk.asp?listing_id=2986072&category_code=read&category_id=31773 |title=''Seventeen'' Delivers Almost Twice The Audience of Teen Vogue|work=Seventeen Actionista |publisher=[[Hearst (media)|Hearst Magazines]]|access-date=7 January 2011}}</ref> It began as a publication geared toward inspiring teen girls to become model workers and citizens.<ref name="Fashioning Teenagers: A Cultural History of Seventeen Magazine">{{cite book|title=History|isbn = 9781598745047|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lX6rkBphF44C&q=Fashioning+Teenagers%3A+A+Cultural+History+of+Seventeen+Magazine|last1 = Massoni|first1 = Kelley|date = 15 June 2010}}</ref> Soon after its debut, ''Seventeen'' took a more fashion- and romance-oriented approach in presenting its material while promoting self-confidence in young women. It was first published based in [[New York City]] on September 1944<ref>{{cite web|title=Tweens, Teens, and Magazines|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tweens-teens-and-magazines-fact-sheet.pdf|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=19 August 2015|date=January 2013}}</ref> by [[Walter Annenberg]]'s [[Triangle Publications]] and The Atlantic Monthly Company in 1944 to 1946.

==''Seventeen'''s history==
The first published in [[New York City]] of ''Seventeen'', [[Helen Valentine]], provided teenaged girls with working-woman role models and information about their personality development and overall growth. ''Seventeen'' enhanced the role of teenagers as consumers of popular culture. The concept of "[[Adolescence|teenager]]" as a distinct demographic originated in that era. In July 1944, [[King Features Syndicate]] began running the comic strip ''[[Teena]]'', created by cartoonist [[Hilda Terry]], in which  a typical teenager's life was examined. ''Teena'' ran internationally in newspapers for 20 years.

After ''Seventeen'' was launched in [[New York City]] on September 1944,<ref>{{cite web|title=Magazines in Alphabetical Order|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_womens_magazines|work=Radcliffe Institute|access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref> Estelle Ellis Rubenstein, the magazine's promotion director, introduced advertisers to the life of teenaged girls through ''Teena'', selling advertising in ''Seventeen'' at the same time. From 1945 to 1946, the magazine surveyed teen girls  to better understand the magazine's audience. The magazine became an important source of information to manufacturers seeking guidance on how to satisfy consumer demand among teenagers. Today, the magazine entertains and promotes self-confidence in young women.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Massoni|first=Kelley|title='Teena Goes to Market': ''Seventeen Magazine'' and the Early Construction of the Teen Girl (As) Consumer|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=March 2006|volume=29, Number 1|issue=Theme Issue|url=http://web.wwcc.edu/jenniferboyden/files/2011/01/Teena-goes-to-Market.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904192358/http://web.wwcc.edu/jenniferboyden/files/2011/01/Teena-goes-to-Market.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-04}}</ref>

[[Sylvia Plath]] submitted nearly 50 pieces to ''Seventeen'' before her first short story, "And Summer Will Not Come Again", was accepted and published in the August 1950 issue.<ref>Ames Lois. A Biographical Note. ''The Bell Jar''. by Sylvia Plath. New York: HarperCollins, 1998</ref>

Joyce Walker became the first black model to be featured on the cover of ''Seventeen'' in July 1971. In 1981, [[Whitney Houston]] was also featured on the cover of the magazine.

[[New York City]]-based [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] bought Triangle in 1988 and sold ''Seventeen'' to [[Primedia|K-III Communications]] (later Primedia) in 1991. In 1999 Linda Platzner was named Publisher and then President of the Seventeen magazine group.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bounds|first=Wendy|date=May 6, 1999|title=Teen Magazines Spotlight|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB925952429773091865}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite news|last=Fass|first=Allison|date=September 10, 2001|title=Executive Changes at Media Firms|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/business/media/executive-changes-at-media-firms.html}}</ref> Primedia sold the magazine to [[New York City]]-based [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] in a process led by Platzner in 2003. ''Seventeen'' remains popular on newsstands today despite greater competition.

In 2010, writer [[Jamie Keiles]] conducted "The Seventeen Magazine Project", an experiment in which she followed the advice of ''Seventeen'' magazine for 30 days. In 2012, in response to reader protests against the magazine's airbrushing its models' photos, ''Seventeen'' ended its practice of using [[Photo manipulation|digital photo manipulation]] to enhance published photographs.

In August 2016, Michelle Tan was fired from her position as editor in chief while she was on maternity leave.<ref>https://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/seventeen-eic-michelle-tan-fired-maternity-leave.html</ref> It was announced shortly thereafter that Michele Promaulayko, who was appointed editor in chief of ''Cosmopolitan'', would also serve as ''Seventeen's ''editorial director.<ref>http://wwd.com/business-news/media/michele-promaulayko-editor-of-cosmopolitan-10521851/</ref> Starting with their Dec/Jan 2017 issue, the magazine was to start publishing only six issues a year instead of 10, to focus on their online presence to appeal to the [[Generation Z]] market. In October 2018, it was announced that Jessica Pels would take over from Promaulayko as editor in chief of ''Cosmopolitan'', and that Kristin Koch was appointed ''Seventeen's'' new executive director, overseeing all its content.<ref>https://wwd.com/business-news/media/jessica-pels-new-editor-in-chief-of-cosmopolitan-magazine-1202875842/</ref> In November 2018, it was announced that ''Seventeen's'' print editions would be reduced to special stand-alone issues.<ref>https://wwd.com/business-news/media/seventeen-magazine-cutting-print-issues-down-to-special-issues-1202906026/</ref>

==''Seventeen'' in other media==
''Seventeen'' has also published books for teens, addressing such topics as beauty, style, college, and health and fitness.

===''America's Next Top Model''===
''Seventeen'' was a sponsor of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''. The winners of ''America's Next Top Model'' from seasons seven through 14 have each appeared on a cover of ''Seventeen'' magazine, including [[CariDee English]], [[Jaslene Gonzalez]], [[Sal Stowers]], [[Whitney Thompson]], [[McKey Sullivan]], Teyona Anderson, [[Nicole Fox]], and [[Krista White]]. Originally, the magazine only planned on sponsoring the show from cycles seven through 10; however, with such a high success rate and a great opportunity the magazine provided for these women, it sponsored the cycles until the show decided to move the winners to ''[[Vogue Italia]]''.

===''Cyberbu//y''===
In 2011, ''Seventeen'' worked with [[Freeform (TV channel)#Sale to Disney and rebranding as ABC Family (2001–2006)|ABC Family]] to make a film about a girl who gets bullied online called ''[[Cyberbully (2011 film)|Cyberbu//y]]''. The point was to raise awareness of cyber bullying and to "delete digital drama". The film premiered July 17, 2011, on ABC Family.

===Controversy===
In April 2012, 14-year-old Julia Bluhm from [[Waterville, Maine]], created a petition on [[Change.org]] titled "Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images of Real Girls!' advocating for the magazine publication to vow to print at least one unaltered and Photoshop-FREE monthly photo spread".<ref>{{Citation|last=Cowles|first=C.|title=Seventeen Magazine Makes 'Body Peace Treaty'|url=https://nymag.com/thecut/2012/07/seventeen-magazine-makes-body-peace-treaty.html|access-date=23 Feb 2015}}</ref> As a self-proclaimed "SPARK Summit Activist", Bluhm petitioned for an end to digital photo manipulation.<ref>http://www.sparksummit.com/tag/julia-bluhm/</ref>

In May 2012 Bluhm, her mother, and a group of fellow "SPARK Summit" members were invited to the New York headquarters of ''Seventeen'' by editor-in-chief [[Ann Shoket]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Bazilian|first=E.|title=Teen's Petition Leads to 'Seventeen' Body Image Pledge|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/teens-petition-leads-seventeen-body-image-pledge-141493|access-date=23 Feb 2015}}</ref>

On 3 July 2012, Bluhm announced that her petition had "won" after receiving almost 85,000 signatures online, resulting in ''Seventeen''&apos;s editorial staff pledging to always feature one photo spread per month without the use of digital photo manipulation. Furthermore, ''Seventeen''&apos;s editor-in-chief Shoket published an editorial praising The Body Peace Treaty in the August 2012 ''Seventeen'' issue, offering the push against digital photo manipulation as an extension of the magazine's ongoing Body Peace Project.<ref>{{Citation|title=Julia Bluhm, 14, Leads Successful Petition For Seventeen Magazine To Portray Girls Truthfully|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/julia-bluhm-seventeen-mag_n_1650938.html|access-date=23 Feb 2015}}</ref>

===''Project Runway: Threads'' and ''Project Runway: Junior''===
''Seventeen'' was a sponsor of ''[[Project Runway: Threads]]'', now a sponsor of ''[[Project Runway: Junior]]''. The winners of ''Project Runway: Junior'' from seasons one and two have had their designs feature in a fashion spread of ''Seventeen'', including Maya and Chelsea.
