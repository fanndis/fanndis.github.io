==History==
''Clash'' was founded by John O'Rourke, Simon Harper, Iain Carnegie and Jon-Paul Kitching.<ref name="scottishmusiccentre.com"/>  It emerged from long-running free listings magazine ''Vibe'' based in Dundee, Scotland. Re-launching as ''Clash Magazine'' in 2004,<ref name="scottishmusiccentre.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishmusiccentre.com/news/1055/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230926/http://www.scottishmusiccentre.com/news/1055/ |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> it won Best New Magazine award at the PPA Magazine Awards and Music Magazine of the Year – Record of the Day Awards 2005 and 2011.<ref name="musicweek.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/clash-magazine-wins-scotlands-ppa-awards/033610|title=Clash magazine wins Scotland's PPA awards - News - Music Week|website=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-date=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234221/http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/clash-magazine-wins-scotlands-ppa-awards/033610|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the turn of 2011, Clash took on an entirely new look, ditching the previous glossy feel and music led design, for an altogether more artistically-led approach. In 2013 Clash launched a Smartphone channel which went on to win 'Best Music Magazine' at the Digital Magazine Awards for their iOS Apple Magazine app. In February 2014 it expanded onto Android handsets.

In November 2014, the magazine published its 99th edition, but then withdrew from print publication in favour of moving to an online-first operation. The Web-based service continued throughout the magazine's absence from the news-stands. In late 2015 it was announced that Clash would return to print as a bimonthly magazine from February 2016, beginning the revived run with a 100th issue special.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/clash-magazine-to-return-to-print/063656|title=Clash magazine to return to print - News - Music Week|website=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-date=21 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621142430/http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/clash-magazine-to-return-to-print/063656|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Positioning==
The publication draws on the larger Clash brand, which extends to live events around the country and festival partnerships/parties (such as [[RockNess]], [[Snowbombing]], [[South by Southwest|SXSW]]), and the website, ClashMusic.com. 2011 saw Clash partner Levi's and [[Spotify]] to bring [[Primal Scream]] to London's [[The Fridge (nightclub)|Electric Brixton]] for one of their final shows with the former [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]] member, [[Mani (musician)|Mani]].

The Clash Live brand's London activity used to incorporate a once-monthly club night at [[The Lexington]], part of their tastemaking Ones To Watch section, which has played host to acts including Swimming, [[Three Trapped Tigers]], Alpines and Wild Palms. More recently this activity re-branded to be called 'Next Wave' in order to reflect internal changes in the magazine and now enjoys a residency at Hackney's new Oslo venue.

==ClashMusic.com==
ClashMusic.com launched in early 2008. The website often encompasses a wider variety of genres than its parent magazine, with pieces on left field acts like [[Gonjasufi]] and [[Perfume Genius]], as well as emerging artists, appearing alongside content that ties in with magazine-featured artists. The website features numerous ongoing features such as "DJ Disasters", "Rapture & Verse" and "A Letter From...". It runs a Track of the Day feature from Monday to Friday.

The website underwent a redesign in October 2012, bringing it in line with the look of the print magazine.

===Clash ''Essential 50''===
On 30 March 2009, ClashMusic began publishing the ''Essential 50''—fifty albums which the website considered "the 50 greatest, most significant, downright brilliant albums of ''Clash''{{'}}s lifetime".<ref name="Clash50 50">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-50-47|title=Clash Essential 50 &ndash; 50-47|website=ClashMusic.com|date=30 March 2009|accessdate=25 April 2009|author=Diver, Mike|archive-date=5 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405172804/http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-50-47|url-status=live}}</ref> Made up entirely of albums released in the past five years,<ref name="Clash50 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-number-1|title=Clash Essential 50 &ndash; Number 1|website=ClashMusic.com|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=25 April 2009|last=Diver|first=Mike|archive-date=26 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426234843/http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-number-1|url-status=live}}</ref> the list was published in sections of three, with the top ten being released individually between 15–24 April 2009.<ref name="Clash50 1"/><ref name="Clash50 10">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-number-10|title=Clash Essential 50 &ndash; Number 10|website=ClashMusic.com|date=15 April 2009|accessdate=25 April 2009|last=Diver|first=Mike|archive-date=19 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419221249/http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/clash-essential-50-number-10|url-status=live}}</ref>
