The '''1939 royal tour of Canada''' by [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] was undertaken in the build-up to World War II as a way to emphasise the independence of the Dominion from Britain. The royal tour lasted from 17 May to 15 June, covering every [[Canadian province]], the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]], and a few days in the United States. There had been previous [[royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal tours in Canada]], but this was unprecedented in its scope. The tour was an enormous event, attracting huge crowds at each new city.

The king and queen arrived by ship in Quebec City and travelled west by rail, accompanied throughout their journey by Canadian Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]]. The party visited most of the major cities, finally arriving in Vancouver. Then they travelled through the United States. The tour ended with a visit to the Maritimes and Newfoundland, departing from Halifax.

It was the first visit by a reigning monarch of Canada and also the first time a Canadian monarch had set foot in the United States. This tour marked the first time that the [[Victoria Day|sovereign's official Canadian birthday]] was marked with the monarch himself present in the country; the occasion was marked on [[Parliament Hill]] with a celebration and a [[Trooping the Colour|Trooping of the Colour]].

In 1985, during another tour of Canada, Queen Elizabeth, by then the Queen Mother, stated in a speech: "It is now some 46 years since I first came to this country with the King, in those anxious days shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. I shall always look back upon that visit with feelings of affection and happiness. I think I lost my heart to Canada and Canadians, and my feelings have not changed with the passage of time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactive/royalvisits/52.html |title=CBC: Royal Visits to Canada |publisher=Cbc.ca |access-date=2010-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009003839/http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactive/royalvisits/52.html |archive-date=9 October 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background and planning==
[[File:King George VI and Rt. Hon. W.L. Mackenzie King at Buckingham Palace during the Imperial Conference.jpg|thumb|upright|George VI and [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] in London, May 1937. While in London, Mackenzie King brought up the monarch taking a [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal tour of Canada]].]]
[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[John Buchan|Lord Tweedsmuir]], in an effort to foster [[Canadian identity]], conceived of a royal tour by the country's monarchs; the [[Library and Archives Canada#Former National Archivists and Dominion Archivists|Dominion Archivist]] (i.e., official historian) [[Gustave Lanctot]] wrote that this "probably grew out of the knowledge that at his coming Coronation, George VI was to assume the additional title of King of Canada." Tweedsmuir's desire was to demonstrate with living example the fact of Canada's status as an independent kingdom, having Canadians "see their King performing royal functions, supported by his Canadian ministers." Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]], while in London for [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|the coronation in May 1937]], formally consulted with the King on the matter. According to biographer [[Janet Adam Smith]], the task for Tweedsmuir, and the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], was "how to translate the Statute of Westminster into the actualities of a tour... since this was the first visit of a reigning monarch to a Dominion, and precedents were being made."<ref name="Parl">{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205052132/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820 |url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Galbraith, William; ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'': "Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit"; Vol. 12, No. 3, 1989 |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date=1997-09-24 |access-date=2010-09-18 }}</ref> The tour was also designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support for Britain in the event of war, and to affirm Canada's status as an independent kingdom, sharing with Britain the same person as monarch.<ref>{{citation|last=Galbraith|first=William|title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|volume=12|issue=3|pages=7–8|publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association|location=Ottawa|year=1989|url=http://www.revparl.ca/12/3/12n3_89e.pdf |access-date=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Bousfield|first1=Arthur|last2=Toffoli|first2=Garry|title=Royal Spring: The Royal Tour of 1939 and the Queen Mother in Canada|publisher=Dundurn Press|year=1989|location=Toronto|pages=65–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Go5p_CN8UQC|isbn=1-55002-065-X}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Lanctot|first=Gustave|author-link=Gustave Lanctot|title=Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939|publisher=E.

Elizabeth's mother had died in 1938, and so [[Norman Hartnell]] designed an all-white wardrobe for her delayed [[state visit]] to France that year. In Canada in 1939 she wore elements of this [[Mourning#White mourning|white mourning]], which forms a distinctive feature of the black and white photographs of the tour.

==First portion of the tour (17 May–7 June)==
The first portion of the royal tour occurred from 17 May 1939, when the royal couple arrived in [[Quebec City]], to 7 June 1939, when George VI and Mackenzie King departed Canada to conduct a state visit to the United States. The first portion of the Canadian royal tour, saw the royal couple visit every province in Canada, excluding the provinces in [[Atlantic Canada]], which was toured following George VI and Mackenzie King's return from the United States on 12 June.

===Arrival in Quebec===

The arrangements were made, and on 17 May 1939, the royal couple arrived in Quebec City for their tour of Canada on board the [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific]] [[Ocean liner|liner]] [[RMS Empress of Australia (1919)|RMS ''Empress of Australia'']]; the reception at Quebec City, [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]], and [[Montreal]] were positive beyond expectations,<ref>Hubbard; p. 191</ref><ref name="Douglas 1995 11">{{Cite book| last1=Douglas| first1=W.A.B.|last2=Greenhous |first2=Brereton| title=Out of the Shadows: Canada in the Second World War| publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.| year=1995| location=Toronto| page=[https://archive.org/details/outofshadowscana0000doug_u2z6/page/11 11]| url=https://archive.org/details/outofshadowscana0000doug_u2z6| url-access=registration| isbn=1-55002-151-6| access-date= 8 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> and the King impressed Quebeckers when he responded to the welcoming remarks in French.<ref name="Douglas 1995 11"/><ref name=Douglas17>{{Harvnb|Douglas|Greenhous|1995| p=17}}</ref>

Their Majesties took up residence at [[La Citadelle]], where the King performed his first official tasks, amongst which was the acceptance of the credentials of [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]] as the American [[Diplomacy|envoy]] to Canada.

There, the King personally granted [[Royal Assent]] to nine bills in the traditional manner which was still being used in Canada at the time - in the United Kingdom, Royal Assent has not been granted by the Sovereign in person since 1854. Following the ceremony, His Majesty stated: "No ceremony could more completely symbolize the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth."

On [[Parliament Hill]], the [[Victoria Day|King's official Canadian birthday (known today as Victoria Day)]] was marked for the first time with a traditional [[Trooping the Colour|Trooping of the Colour]].<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/48535768/</ref> Because he attended this parade instead of the annual trooping on [[Horse Guards Parade]], the one in [[London]] was presided by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]].

After two days in Ottawa, the royal couple began travelling westward.<ref name=Douglas19>{{Harvnb|Douglas|Greenhous|1995| p=19}}</ref> The couple travelled to [[Toronto]] on 22 May, where they attended the [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]] horse race and dedicated [[Coronation Park (Toronto)|Coronation Park]]. The couple dedicated the soon-to-be completed [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], and unveiled a monument at the site to mark the occasion. They also inaugurated the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (which was named for George's royal consort) as well as various monuments along the route, including a set of decorative stone pillars on the eastern approach to the Henley Bridge in [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]], each consisting of a regal lion bearing a unique shield, and the [[Queen Elizabeth Way Monument]], which had inscribed on its base words prophetically referring to the [[World War II|hostilities that would break out later that year]]:
:The Queen Elizabeth Way was opened by the King and Queen in June, 1939, marking the first visit of a reigning sovereign to a sister Dominion of the Empire. The courage and resolution of Their Majesties in undertaking the royal visit in face of imminent war have inspired the people of this province to complete this work in the Empire's darkest hour, in full confidence of victory and a feeling of lasting peace.

===Westward leg===
[[File:Crowds of Winnipeggers wave at His Majesty King George VI and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|George VI and Elizabeth in [[Winnipeg]]. Their arrival to Winnipeg coincided with the [[Victoria Day|King's official birthday in Canada]]]]
The Royal Train was operated by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] on the western leg of the tour and the couple continued to be greeted by throngs of Canadians, even in the immigrant-rich but [[Great Depression in Canada#Prairie Provinces|Depression-battered Prairies]].

The couple visited [[Winnipeg]] and [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] on 24 May. Upon their arrival in Winnipeg, on [[Victoria Day|the King's official birthday]], the royal couple was greeted by an estimated 100,000 people (including several thousand Americans), and, to allow them all a view of himself and the Queen, His Majesty requested that the convertible roof of their limousine be opened, despite a record rainfall that day.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/the-monarchy/their-majesties-in-canada-the-1939-royal-tour/1939-royal-tour-rolls-through-winnipeg.html| title=On This Day > May 24, 1939| publisher=CBC| access-date=2 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=LAC>{{Citation|last=King |first=William L.M. |author-link=William Lyon Mackenzie King |date=24 May 1939 |contribution=Diary |editor-last=Hoogenraad |editor-first=Maureen |title=Biography and People > A Real Companion and Friend > Politics, Themes, and Events from King's Life > The Royal Tour of 1939 |location=Ottawa |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html |access-date=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030064730/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html |archive-date=30 October 2009 }}</ref> While staying at Government House in Winnipeg, the King made his longest-ever radio broadcast to the [[British Empire]];<ref name=CBC>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/the-monarchy/their-majesties-in-canada-the-1939-royal-tour/quebec-city-rolls-out-the-red-carpet.html| title=Society > The Monarchy > Presenting 'Chief Sitting Albino'| publisher=CBC| access-date=2 July 2009}}</ref> the table at which he sat remains in the Aides Room of the royal residence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lg.gov.mb.ca/history/house/main/aides.html |last=Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba |title=History > Government House > Aides Room |publisher=Queen's Printer for Manitoba |access-date=2 July 2009 |archive-date=13 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213160530/http://lg.gov.mb.ca/history/house/main/aides.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Then, Prime Minister Mackenzie King described the arrival of the royal train at Brandon: "Wonderful cheering. A long bridge overhead crowded with people. The hour: 11 at night... the finest scene on the entire trip."<ref name=LAC /><ref name=CBC /> The Queen herself said the reception was "the biggest thrill of the tour."<ref name=CBC />

Continuing westward across the Prairies, the Royal Train arrived in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] on 25 May, followed by [[Calgary]] on 26 May and [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] on 27 May. A minor gaffe occurred at Calgary, as described by one of the military officers on parade with the Guard of Honour:<ref>Williams, Jeffery. Far From Home: A Memoir of a 20th Century Soldier. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, AB, 2003. {{ISBN|1-55238-129-3}} pp.116-117</ref>

:After some conventional compliments on the turnout of the escort, the King had said that he had not expected either such crowds or a ceremonial military welcome. When he had asked Mackenzie King what to expect in Calgary, the Prime Minister has said it was only a small place of little consequence and that there would not be much there. When he saw the guard of honour waiting on the platform, he realized that he should have been in uniform and went back inside the train. But it was, of course, too late to change. (Major) Bradbrooke got the impression that the King was not at all pleased with his Canadian Prime Minister's advice that day.

The King and the Queen stopped in [[Vancouver]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and a number of other smaller communities in British Columbia. Mackenzie King was enthused, stating in his diary on 29 May 1939, "the day in Vancouver was one of the finest on the entire tour," and, the following day: "Without question, Victoria has left the most pleasing of all impressions.

The royal train arrived in the town of [[Melville, Saskatchewan|Melville]] at 10:00&nbsp;pm on 3 June, attracting over 60,000 people to the town of 3,000. The stop was only meant to last ten minutes, after which the train would stay overnight for servicing. But, with the throngs of people who arrived, the royal party decided to extend the visit to a half-hour, after which the train pulled away, returning a few hours later, once the crowds had dispersed;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/phase2/mod2e.shtml| last=Museum of Civilization| title=Exhibitions > Online Exhibitions > 2.

The itinerary included visits to Mount Vernon on 9 June, the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] on 10 June, and dinner at FDR's [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|estate at Hyde Park]] on 11 June, at which President Roosevelt served hotdogs, smoked turkey, and strawberry shortcake to their Majesties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/aboutfdr/pdfs/royal_itinerary.pdf |title=Itinerary of the Royal Visit June 7 to June 12, 1939 |publisher=Franklin D.

==Resumption of the tour (12–15 June)==

On 12 June the royal couple returned to Canada to continue their royal tour of the country, visiting the [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]]. The King and the Queen stopped in [[Doaktown, New Brunswick]], to take tea in a local teahouse, where, upon finishing, they proceeded to the kitchen and took the proprietors by surprise.{{#tag:ref|The wife, Addie Gilks, said of the event: "They talked with us about fishing.... My husband was so taken aback with their appearance that he was unable to retain his presence of mind enough to answer all the questions put to him."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/society/monarchy/clips/13931/| title=Society > The Monarchy > A word from the Queen| publisher=CBC| access-date=7 July 2009}}</ref>|group=n|name=G&E}}

Accompanied by the [[List of lieutenant governors of Newfoundland and Labrador#Commission Governors (1934-1949)|Governor of Newfoundland]], Sir [[Humphrey Walwyn]], the King and Queen were driven to St. John's to attend various official events, causing the city's population of 50,000 to double as visitors came in to see the royal couple. For the departure of the monarch, the residents of St. John's built a large [[bonfire]] on [[Signal Hill, Newfoundland and Labrador|Signal Hill]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/the-monarchy/their-majesties-in-canada-the-1939-royal-tour/quebec-city-rolls-out-the-red-carpet.html| title=Society > The Monarchy > A fond farewell| date=15 June 1939| publisher=CBC| access-date=12 July 2009}}</ref>

After a visit to [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]], the royal couple ended their tour at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 15 June, where a farewell luncheon was held, and the King and Queen each delivered a speech of thanks. That evening, the royal couple boarded the [[RMS Empress of Britain (1931)|RMS ''Empress of Britain'']] to return to the United Kingdom; of their departure, Mackenzie King wrote in his diary: "The ''Empress of Britain'' ran past one end of the harbour where she was towed around, then came back the opposite way to pull out to sea. She was accompanied by British warships and our own destroyers. The ''[[Bluenose]]'' and other vessels also in the harbour as a sort of escort.... The King and Queen were at the very top of the ship and kept waving.... No farewell could have been finer...."<ref name="LAC"/>
