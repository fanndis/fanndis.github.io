American songwriter and producer [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A."

The singers performed the song live on the "Stand Up to Cancer" special, which aired simultaneously on US TV networks [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] on September 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1593043/20080819/carey_mariah.jhtml|title=Mariah Carey, Beyonce,  Fergie, Miley Cyrus, More Collaborate On Cancer Benefit Single|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=2008-08-19|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20220273,00.html|title=Mariah Carey, Beyoncé Unite For Charity Record|last=Jessen|first=Monique|date=2008-08-20|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>
