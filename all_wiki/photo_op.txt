A '''photo op''' (sometimes written as '''photo opp'''), short for '''photograph opportunity''' (or '''photo opportunity'''), is an arranged opportunity to take a photograph of a politician, a celebrity, or a notable event.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/hungarian/specials/177_buzzwords/page39.shtml "Photo Op"], [[BBC]]</ref>

The term was coined by the administration of US President [[Richard Nixon]]. [[William Safire]] credited its coinage to Bruce Whelihan, an aide to Nixon [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]] [[Ron Ziegler]]. Ziegler would say ''Get 'em in for a picture'', and Whelihan would dutifully announce to the White House press room, ''There will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.''<ref>[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/magazine/on-language-in-nine-little-words.html?pagewanted=all On Language; In Nine Little Words]", [[The New York Times]], 26 March 1989. Accessed 2 February 2018.</ref>

The term has acquired a negative connotation, referring to a carefully planned [[pseudo-event]], often masqueraded as news.<ref>[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=339464 "Commentary (The Photo Opportunity)"], from [[CBS Evening News]] for Saturday, 27 July 1991; at the Vanderbilt Television News Archive</ref> It is associated with politicians who perform tasks such as planting trees, picking up litter, and visiting senior citizens, often during election cycles, with the intent of photographers catching the events, generating positive publicity. 

Among nearly ritual photo ops are those when participants of a [[summit (meeting)|summit]] get out of their cars, shake hands or kiss, or sign a document.<ref name=bbc/> Formal, planned photography sessions in the [[White House]] date back to the 1930s, when [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[press secretary]] advised photographers to avoid taking photos of the President in a [[wheelchair]].<ref>[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6774/ "Photo Op"]</ref>
