'''Fresno''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|z|n|oʊ}} {{Respell|FREZ|noh}}; {{langnf||Spanish|"[[ash tree]]"}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It covers about {{convert|112|sqmi|km2}}<ref name="US-Gazetteer">{{Cite US Gazetteer|2010|places|CA}}</ref> in the center of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], the southern portion of [[Central Valley (California)|California's Central Valley]].

Named for the abundant ash trees lining the [[San Joaquin River]], Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] before it was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1885. The city has since become an economic hub of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley, with much of the surrounding areas in the [[Metropolitan Fresno]] region predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural production.

The population of Fresno grew from 134,000 in 1960 to 428,000 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 TO 1990 |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725010358/https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |archive-date=July 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> With a census-estimated 2020 population of 542,012,<ref name="CA-DOF-2020E1">State of California.

Fresno is near the geographical center of California. It lies approximately {{convert|220|mi|-1}} north of [[Los Angeles]], {{convert|170|mi|-1}} south of the state capital, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and {{convert|185|mi|-1}} southeast of [[San Francisco]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Fresno, California}}
The original inhabitants of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] region were the [[Yokuts people]] and [[Miwok people]], who engaged in trading with other Californian tribes of Native Americans including coastal peoples such as the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of the Central California coast, with whom they are thought to have traded plant and animal products.

The first European to enter the San Joaquin Valley was [[Pedro Fages]] in 1772.<ref>Capace, Nancy (1999). ''Encyclopedia of California''. North American Book Dist LLC. Page 410. {{ISBN|9780403093182}}.</ref> The county of Fresno was formed in 1856 after the [[California Gold Rush]]. It was named for the abundant ash trees (Spanish: fresno) lining the [[San Joaquin River]].

[[Millerton, Madera County, California|Millerton]], then on the banks of the free-flowing San Joaquin River and close to [[Fort Miller, California|Fort Miller]], became the county seat after becoming a focal point for settlers. Other early county settlements included [[Firebaugh, California|Firebaugh's Ferry]], [[Centerville, Fresno County, California|Scottsburg]] and Elkhorn Springs.

The San Joaquin River flooded on December 24, 1867, inundating Millerton. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. Flooding also destroyed the town of Scottsburg on the nearby [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] that winter. Rebuilt on higher ground, Scottsburg was renamed Centerville.<ref name="CGN14">{{California's Geographic Names|1014-1015}}</ref>

In 1867, Anthony "McQueen" Easterby purchased land bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues, that today is called the [[Sunnyside, Fresno County, California|Sunnyside district]]. Unable to grow wheat for lack of water, he hired sheep man Moses J. Church in 1871 to create an irrigation system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Building new canals and purchasing existing ditches, Church then formed the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, a predecessor of the Fresno Irrigation District.

In 1872, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] established a station near Easterby's—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its new [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] line. Soon there was a store around the station and the store grew into the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. By 1931 the [[Fresno Traction Company]] operated 47 [[streetcar]]s over 49 miles of track.<ref name="hwd">{{cite book | author=Demoro, Harre W.| title=California's Electric Railways| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|location=Glendale, California| year=1986| page=201| isbn=978-0-916374-74-7}}</ref>

In 1865, [[William Helm]] brought his sheep to Fresno county, which was then a vast space of open land.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guinn |first=J. M.|date= 1905|title= History of the State of California with Biographical Record|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstateofca00guin/page/668/mode/2up/search/William+Helm|location= Chicago|publisher=The Chapman Publishing Co.|pages=669–670}}</ref> By 1877, Helm made Fresno his home with a five-acre tract of land at the corner of Fresno and R streets. Helm was the largest individual [[Sheep husbandry|sheep grower]] in Fresno County. In carrying his [[wool]] to market at [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], he used three wagons, each drawn by ten [[mule]]s, and spent twelve days in making the round trip.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vandor |first=Paul E.|date= 1919|title= History of Fresno County California with Biographical Sketches|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffresnoc02vand/page/n5/mode/2up/search/William+Helm|location= Los Angeles, California|publisher=Historic Record Company |pages=220–221}}</ref>

[[File:K Street HS, Fresno CA 1897.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|An 1897 photo of K Street High School, which was replaced by [[Fresno High School]] in 1896. The school later became Emerson Elementary School and was demolished ca. 1930.]]
Two years after the station was established, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. When the [[Friant Dam]] was completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters of [[Millerton Lake]]. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed.

In the nineteenth century, with so much wooden construction and in the absence of sophisticated firefighting resources, fires often ravaged American frontier towns. The greatest of Fresno's early-day fires, in 1882, destroyed an entire block of the city. Another devastating blaze struck in 1883.

[[File:Fresno Water Tower.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|One of the earliest buildings in Fresno, the [[Old Fresno Water Tower|Fresno Water Tower]], was built in 1894.]]

In 1909, Fresno's first and oldest [[synagogue]], [[Temple Beth Israel (Fresno, California)|Temple Beth Israel]], was founded.

Fresno entered the ranks of the 100 most populous cities in the United States in 1960 with a population of 134,000. Thirty years later, in the 1990 census, it moved up to 47th place with 354,000, and in the census of 2000, it achieved 37th place with 428,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |title=U.S. Census Bureau, Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 TO 1990 |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725010358/https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |archive-date=July 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Fresno Sanitary Landfill|Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill]] was the first modern [[landfill]] in the United States, and incorporated several important innovations to waste disposal, including trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of trash with dirt. It was opened in 1937 and closed in 1987. It is a [[National Historic Landmark]] as well as a [[Superfund]] site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://historicfresno.org/nrhp/landfill.htm | title=Fresno Sanitary Landfill (1937) | publisher=HistoricFresno.org | author1=Kevin Enns-Rempel | author2=John Edward Powell | accessdate=2007-04-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321214528/http://historicfresno.org/nrhp/landfill.htm | archive-date=March 21, 2005 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown. In 1940, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian.<ref name="census"/> Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today Japanese-American businesses still remain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/derailed/high-speed-rail-debate-persists-california|title=The High-Speed Rail Debate Persists In California|last1=Bowden|first1=Bridgit|last2=Johnson|first2=Shawn|date=2019-09-18|work=Wisconsin Public Radio|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105083718/https://www.wpr.org/derailed/high-speed-rail-debate-persists-california|archive-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref> During 1942, [[Pinedale, California|Pinedale]], in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the [[Pinedale, California|Pinedale Assembly Center]], an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area [[Japanese Americans]] to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/anthropology74/ce16e.htm | title=Pinedale Assembly Center, California | publisher=U.S. National Park Service | accessdate=2007-04-23 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407163302/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/anthropology74/ce16e.htm | archivedate=April 7, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[Fresno Fairgrounds]] were also utilized as an assembly center.

Row crops and orchards gave way to urban development particularly in the period after World War II; this transition was particularly vividly demonstrated in locations such as the [[Blackstone Avenue]] corridor.

In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched a new product called [[Visa Inc.#History|BankAmericard]] in Fresno. After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful [[credit card]]. This financial instrument was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as [[Visa Inc.]]

The dance style commonly known as [[popping (dance)|popping]] evolved in Fresno in the 1970s.<ref name="holman">{{cite book | last=Holman | first=Michael | title=Breaking and the New York City Breakers | chapter=History | chapterurl=http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/styles/pop.html | date=October 1984 | publisher=Freundlich Books | isbn=978-0-88191-016-2 | accessdate=2007-05-15 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019042047/http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/styles/pop.html | archivedate=October 19, 2007 | df=mdy-all | url=http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/styles/pop.html }}</ref>

In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, "Walking Into Fresno", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by [[Bob Gallion]] of the "[[WWVA Jamboree]]" radio and television show in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. Aken, adopted by [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] movie actress [[Cinema of Mexico#Lupe Mayorga (aka Lillian Molieri)|Lupe Mayorga]], grew up in the neighboring town of [[Madera, California|Madera]] and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.

Fictional residents of the town were portrayed in a 1986 comedic [[miniseries]] titled "[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]", featuring [[Carol Burnett]], [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Teri Garr]] and [[Charles Grodin]], along with numerous other celebrities. The mini series was presented as a parody of the prime time soap operas popular in the 1980s.

In 1995, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[Operation Rezone]] sting resulted in several prominent Fresno and [[Clovis, California|Clovis]] politicians being charged in connection with taking bribes in return for [[zoning|rezoning]] farmland for housing developments. Before the sting brought a halt to it, housing developers could buy farmland cheaply, pay off council members to have it rezoned, and make a large profit building and selling inexpensive housing.

Fresno is at {{Coord|36|44|52|N|119|46|21|W}}.<ref name="GNIS 277606">{{Cite GNIS|id=277606|name=Fresno|accessdate=}}</ref> having a total area of {{convert|112.3|sqmi|km2}} with 99.69% land covering {{convert|112.0|sqmi|km2}}, and 0.31% water, {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}.

Fresno's location, very near the geographical center of California, places the city a comfortable distance from several of the major recreation areas and urban centers in the state. Just {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Yosemite National Park]], it is the nearest major city to the park. Likewise, [[Sierra National Forest]] is {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}}, [[Kings Canyon National Park]] is {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} and [[Sequoia National Park]] is {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The city is located near several [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes including [[Bass Lake, California|Bass Lake]], [[Shaver Lake]], and [[Huntington Lake]]. Fresno is also only two and a half hours from [[Monterey]], [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], [[Big Sur]] and the central coast.

Because Fresno sits at the junction of Highways [[California State Route 41|41]] and [[California State Route 99|99]] (SR 41 is Yosemite National Park's southern access road, and SR 99 bypasses [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] to serve the urban centers of the San Joaquin Valley), the city is a major gateway for Yosemite visitors coming from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The city also serves as an entrance into Sierra National Forest via Highway [[California State Route 168|168]], and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks via Highway [[California State Route 180|180]].

Fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest. [[Woodward Park (Fresno)|Woodward Park]], which features the [[Shinzen Young|Shinzen]] [[Japanese Garden]]s, boasts numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails. It is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the [[San Joaquin River Parkway]]. [[Roeding Park]], near Downtown Fresno, is home to the [[Fresno Chaffee Zoo]], and [[Rotary Storyland and Playland]]. Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.<ref>{{cite news

In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, [[Trust for Public Land|The Trust for Public Land]], a national land conservation organization, reported that Fresno had the worst park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.<ref>[http://parkscore.tpl.org/city.php?city=Fresno "City Profiles: Fresno"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201220500/http://parkscore.tpl.org/city.php?city=Fresno |date=February 1, 2014 }}. "The Trust for Public Land". Retrieved on July 10, 2013.</ref> The survey measures median park size, park acres as percent of city area, residents' access to parks, spending on parks per resident, and playgrounds per 10,000 residents. Fresno faces serious challenges to creating a well-developed park system due to the lack of any natural bodies of water in the city boundaries. There are no natural lakes or rivers; only manmade waterways.

===Neighborhoods===

====Downtown====
[[File:Chuckchansiparkview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Downtown Fresno looking east from [[Chukchansi Park|Chuckchansi Park]]]]

Fresno was born with the establishment of the then Central Pacific Railroad Depot in 1872. In 1889, the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired Central Pacific, constructed a new depot on the original depot site. The brick Queen Anne style depot was a jewel for the city and is currently one of Fresno's oldest standing buildings. In 1971, 99 years after it first opened for business on its current site, the Depot closed its rail operations due to the decline in business.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://historicfresno.org/nrhp/sprr.htm |title=Southern Pacific Railroad Depot (Fresno, California) |access-date=September 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927183532/http://historicfresno.org/nrhp/sprr.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric streetcars,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2010/05/fresno-street-cars/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927124728/http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2010/05/fresno-street-cars/ |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and contained a number of "lavish" and "opulent" buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2009/06/mariposa-street/ |title=Mariposa Street |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927111203/http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2009/06/mariposa-street/ |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Among them, the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), the Fresno Water Tower, the Bank of Italy Building, the [[Pacific Southwest Building]], the [[San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation Building|San Joaquin Light and Power Building]] (currently known as the Grand 1401), and the Hughes Hotel (burned down), to name a few.

Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's first [[Pedestrian malls in the United States|pedestrian malls]] in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2009/11/before-fulton-mall/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927114242/http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2009/11/before-fulton-mall/ |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Renamed the [[Fulton Mall (Fresno)|Fulton Mall]], the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno. While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including a casting of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]'s bronze "The Washer Woman", reportedly the only one of the six castings that one can walk up to and touch. In October 2017, the City of Fresno finished and opened Fulton Mall to traffic, becoming Fulton Street. This change was celebrated with a large public parade featuring current Mayor Lee Brand and former Mayor Ashley Swearengin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article180249076.html|title=It's a downtown dream as Fresno celebrates Fulton Street's grand reopening|website=fresnobee|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223133055/https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article180249076.html|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district.<ref>http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/news/government-and-politics/17972-fulton-mall-project-to-shift-into-gear-next-month{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

====Tower District====
[[File:The Tower Theater, Fresno, CA.JPG|thumb|The [[Tower Theatre (Fresno, California)|Tower Theatre]]]]

The historic [[Tower Theatre (Fresno, California)|Tower Theatre]], which is included on the National Register of Historic Places,<ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> is the center of the Tower District. The theater was built in 1939 at the corner of Olive and Wishon Avenues. (The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area). The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tower2000.com/history/index.html |title=Fresno's Historic Tower Theatre |website=Tower2000.com |accessdate=2010-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528112034/http://www.tower2000.com/history/index.html |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School (later renamed [[California State University, Fresno|California State University at Fresno]]). In 1916, the college moved to what is now the site of [[Fresno City College]] one-half mile north<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oabalegacyrenewed.com/history.html |title=The Old Administration Building at Fresno City College: A Legacy Renewed |website=Oabalegacyrenewed.com |accessdate=2010-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820021132/http://www.oabalegacyrenewed.com/history.html |archivedate=August 20, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> of the Tower District.

This vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second- and third-run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerrockas.com/good-company-players/|title=Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater|access-date=2016-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808070522/http://rogerrockas.com/good-company-players/|archive-date=August 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native [[Audra McDonald]] performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City and a [[Tony Award|Tony award]]-winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.

The Tower District is a hub for community events such as Jamaica My Weekend, Mardi Gras in February, [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]], car shows, A Taste of The Tower, Halloween in the Tower, and the [[Farmers' market|Farmer's Market]] opened on the northwest Corner of Olive and Van Ness.

The neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores, currently operating on or near Olive Avenue, and all within a few hundred feet of each other. Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses. Today, the Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's [[LGBT]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] communities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://collegian.csufresno.edu/2007/04/24/remembering-the-life-of-a-corporate-sellout/ |title=The Collegian » Remembering the life of a 'corporate sellout'<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=January 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325140750/http://collegian.csufresno.edu/2007/04/24/remembering-the-life-of-a-corporate-sellout/ |archive-date=March 25, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Additionally, Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's local [[Punk rock|punk]]/[[Gothic rock|goth]]/[[deathrock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] community as well as the [[synthpop]]/[[Electronic dance music]] community.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades. The area includes many [[California Bungalow]] and [[American Craftsman]] style homes, [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture]], [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]], [[Mission Revival Style architecture]], and many [[Storybook house]]s designed by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor & Wheeler. The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes [[urban sprawl]] in north and east areas of Fresno.

====Woodward Park====
[[File:Woodward Park Nima1.JPG|thumb|[[Woodward Park (Fresno)|Woodward Park]]]]

In the north eastern part of Fresno, [[Woodward Park (Fresno)|Woodward Park]] was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial {{convert|235|acre|km2}}, combined with additional acres acquired later by the city, brings the park to a sizable {{convert|300|acre|km2}}.<ref name=CityFresno>{{cite web|title=Woodward Park|url=http://www.fresno.gov/government/departmentdirectory/parksandrecreation/parksandfacilities/regional+parks/woodwardpark.htm|website=City of Fresno|accessdate=September 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903054237/http://www.fresno.gov/Government/DepartmentDirectory/ParksandRecreation/ParksandFacilities/Regional+Parks/WoodwardPark.htm|archive-date=September 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use [[amphitheatre]] that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3&nbsp;km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8&nbsp;km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover {{convert|22|mi|km}} between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphitheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as [[Deftones]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Sevendust]] as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm.  Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF ([[California Interscholastic Federation]]) State Championship [[cross country running|cross country]] meet, which takes place in late November. It is also the home of the [[Woodward Shakespeare Festival]] which began performances in the park in 2005.<ref name=FresBee>{{cite news|last1=Munro |first1=Donald |title=Woodward Shakespeare Festival turns 10; its revels play on |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/06/19/3986188/woodward-shakespeare-festival.html |accessdate=September 9, 2014 |newspaper=The Fresno Bee |date=June 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001858/http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/06/19/3986188/woodward-shakespeare-festival.html |archivedate=September 11, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

[[File:California5thDistrictCourttaken3.1.08.JPG|thumb|right|The California Fifth Appellate District Fresno courthouse.]]Fresno is the county seat of Fresno County. It maintains the main county courthouse on Van Ness in the Fresno County Plaza for criminal and some civil court cases.

The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California|United States District Court, Eastern District of California]], has one of its six divisions based in the [[Robert E.

Fresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to an [[Interstate highway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=U.S. Census website |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |df=mdy }}</ref> When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99.<ref>[http://www.cahighways.org/001-008.html#005|California Highways-Routes 1-8] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120105136/http://cahighways.org/001-008.html#005%7CCalifornia |date=November 20, 2010 }}. California Highways. Accessed 2011-01-01</ref> Due to rapidly rising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as [[List of future Interstate Highways#Interstate 7 or 9|Interstate 7 or 9]]. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.
