'''Minnesota''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Minnesota.ogg|ˌ|m|ɪ|n|ᵻ|ˈ|s|oʊ|t|ə}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Upper Midwest]], [[Great Lakes Region|Great Lakes]], and [[Northern United States|northern region]] of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the [[Minnesota Territory]]. The state is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is {{lang|fr|L'Étoile du Nord}}, French for "The Star of the North").

Minnesota is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|12th largest in area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|22nd most populous]] of the U.S. states. Nearly 55% of its residents live in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"),<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Estimates: Latest annual estimates of Minnesota and its Economic Development Regions' population and households, 2017 |url=https://mn.gov/admin/demography/data-by-topic/population-data/our-estimates/ |website=Population Data |publisher=Minnesota State Demographic Center |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513130752/https://mn.gov/admin/demography/data-by-topic/population-data/our-estimates/ |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> the state's main hub of transportation, business, industry, education, arts, and government.

Before Europeans arrived, Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples going back to the archaic hunter-gatherers of the [[Woodland period]]. During the [[ Middle Woodland Period]] two areas of [[Hopewell tradition]] existed in Minnesota. The Laural Complex covered part of the north while the Tremplau Hopewell was in the Mississippi river Valley ([[BCE]] 100-500 [[CE]]). After that was the [[Upper Mississippian]] culture, which in Minnesota was the [[Oneota]] people. It is believed the [[Siouan]] languages derive from them. French voyageurs, explorers, and [[missionaries]]  entered the region in the 17th century, encountering the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Ojibwe]]/[[Anishinaabe]] tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota was part of the [[Louisiana Territory|vast French holding of Louisiana]], which [[Louisiana Purchase|the United States purchased]] in 1803. After the territorial reorganizations of [[Missouri Territory|Missouri]], [[Michigan Territory|Michigan]], [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]], [[Wisconsin Territory|Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota Territory|Minnesota]], the state was admitted to the Union in 1858. Minnesota's growth was centered on timber, agriculture and railroads.

During the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, European immigrants began settling Minnesota. Many of them came from Scandinavia, Germany, and Central Europe (such as [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]]). Minnesota remains a center of [[Scandinavian American]], [[German American]], and [[Czech American]]<ref name="Czech Pioneers in Colonial America">{{cite web |last1=Rechcigl, Jr. |first1=Miloslav |title=Czech Pioneers in Colonial America |url=https://www.svu2000.org/cs-america/cz-colonial-america/ |publisher=Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. |accessdate=May 15, 2020}}</ref> culture.

While Minnesota's population is still mostly Scandinavian- and German-American, domestic migration and immigration from Asia, the [[Horn of Africa]], the Middle East, and Latin America have broadened its demographics.

The state's iron-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] and the [[Mesabi Range]] in the 1880s, and in the [[Cuyuna Range]] in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by rail to [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]], then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="Lass" />

[[File:Mexican boy water carrier in beet field near East Grand Forks, Minnesota.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mexican American]] boy in [[East Grand Forks]], 1937]]

Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]], resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. [[New Deal]] programs provided some economic turnaround. The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This gave Natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and [[native language]]s were no longer suppressed.<ref name="Gilman" />

After [[World War II]], industrial development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, and farm machinery such as [[tractor]]s and [[combine harvester|combines]] became the norm. [[University of Minnesota]] professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to these developments as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name="Gilman" /> [[Suburb]]an development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility in turn enabled more specialized jobs.<ref name="Gilman" />

Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's [[iron ore]] for more than a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, [[taconite]] mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2016 the state produced 60 percent of the country's usable iron ore.<ref name="resources" /> The mining boom created the port of Duluth, which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and [[biomedical]] firms, in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor [[shopping mall]] was [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina's]] [[Southdale Center]], and its largest is Bloomington's [[Mall of America]].

Minnesota is one of 45 U.S. states with its own [[lottery]]; its games include [[Powerball]], [[Mega Millions]], [[Lotto America]] (all three [[Multi-State Lottery Association|multi-state]]), Northstar Cash, and [[Gopher 5]].

=== Literature ===

The rigors and rewards of pioneer life on the [[prairie]] are the subject of [[Giants in the Earth (novel)|''Giants in the Earth'']] by [[Ole Rolvaag]] and the [[Little House on the Prairie|''Little House'']] series of children's books by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by [[Sinclair Lewis]] in the novel [[Main Street (novel)|''Main Street'']], and more gently and affectionately by [[Garrison Keillor]] in his tales of [[Lake Wobegon]]. St. Paul native [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] writes of the social insecurities and aspirations of the young city in stories such as ''[[Winter Dreams]]'' and ''The Ice Palace'' (published in ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]''). [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s epic poem ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' was inspired by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman ([[Bob Dylan]]) won the 2016 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Science fiction writer [[Marissa Lingen]] lives here.

=== Judiciary ===

Minnesota's court system has three levels. Most cases start in the [[Minnesota District Courts|district courts]], which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the [[Minnesota Court of Appeals]], consisting of 19 judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] hears all appeals from the tax court, the [[Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals|workers' compensation court of appeals]], first-degree murder convictions, and [[Certiorari#State courts|discretionary appeals]] from the court of appeals; it also has [[original jurisdiction]] over election disputes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Supreme Court |publisher=Court Information Office, State of Minnesota |url=http://www.courts.state.mn.us/documents/CIO/otherResources/SupremeCourt.doc |format=doc |accessdate=October 19, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101095530/https://www.courts.state.mn.us/documents/CIO/otherResources/SupremeCourt.doc |archive-date=November 1, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Two specialized courts within administrative agencies have been established: the workers' compensation court of appeals, and the tax court, which deals with non-criminal tax cases.

=== Regional ===

In addition to the city and county levels of government found in the United States, Minnesota has other entities that provide governmental oversight and planning. [[Regional Development Commissions|Regional development commissions]] (RDCs) provide technical assistance to local governments in broad multi-county area of the state. Along with this [[Metropolitan Planning Organizations]] (MPOs), such as the [[Metropolitan Council]], provide planning and oversight of land use actions in metropolitan areas. Many lakes and rivers are overseen by [[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed districts]] and [[soil and water conservation district]]s.

=== Federal ===

Minnesota's [[United States senator]]s are Democrat [[Amy Klobuchar]] and Democrat [[Tina Smith]]. The state has eight [[Minnesota Congressional Districts|congressional districts]]; they are represented by [[Jim Hagedorn]] ([[Minnesota's 1st congressional district|1st district]]; R), [[Angie Craig]] ([[Minnesota's 2nd congressional district|2nd]]; DFL), [[Dean Phillips]] ([[Minnesota's 3rd congressional district|3rd]]; DFL), [[Betty McCollum]] ([[Minnesota's 4th congressional district|4th]]; DFL), [[Ilhan Omar]] ([[Minnesota's 5th congressional district|5th]]; DFL), [[Tom Emmer]] ([[Minnesota's 6th congressional district|6th]]; R), [[Collin Peterson]] ([[Minnesota's 7th congressional district|7th]]; DFL), and [[Pete Stauber]] ([[Minnesota's 8th congressional district|8th]]; R).

Federal court cases are heard in the [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]], in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and [[Fergus Falls]]. Appeals are heard by the [[Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and St. Paul.

=== Tribal ===

The State of Minnesota was created by the United States federal government in the traditional and cultural range of lands occupied by the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Anishinaabe]] peoples as well as other Native American groups. After many years of unequal treaties and forced resettlement by the state and federal government, the tribes re-organized into sovereign tribal governments. Today, the tribal governments are divided into 11 semi-autonomous [[Indian reservation|reservations]] that negotiate with the U.S. and the state on a bilateral basis:

Four Dakota [[Mdewakanton]] communities:
* [[Prairie Island Indian Community]]
* [[Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community]]
* [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation]]
* [[Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota|Upper Sioux Community{{snd}}Pejuhutazizi Oyate]]

Seven Anishinaabe reservations:
* [[Bois Forte Band of Chippewa]]
* [[Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa]]
* [[Grand Portage Band of Chippewa]]
* [[Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[White Earth Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[Red Lake Band of Chippewa]]

The first six of the Anishinaabe bands compose the [[Minnesota Chippewa Tribe]], the collective federally recognized tribal government of the Bois Forte, Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, Leech Lake, Mille Lacs, and White Earth reservations.

[[Hubert Humphrey]] brought national attention to the state with his address at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for [[Ronald Reagan]] in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican [[Richard Nixon]].

Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level Democratic party has a different name, officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party|Farmer-Labor]] parties.

The state has had active third-party movements. The [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]], now the [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]], was able to elect former mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]] and [[professional wrestler]] [[Jesse Ventura]] to the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|governorship in 1998]]. The [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] has received enough support to keep major-party status. The [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]], while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government,<ref name="GrnOffHldrs">{{cite web | title = Office Holders | publisher = Green Party of Minnesota | url = http://www.mngreens.org/officeholders.php | accessdate = April 18, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070107163820/http://www.mngreens.org/officeholders.php |archive-date = January 7, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., governor, secretary of state, U.S. president).

The state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats have generally been split since the early 1990s, and in the [[108th United States Congress|108th]] and [[109th United States Congress|109th]] Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices, except governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans [[Tim Pawlenty]] and [[Carol Molnau]] narrowly won re-election. The DFL posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first [[African American]] U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first [[Muslim]] elected to Congress nationwide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Minnesota Democrat becomes first Muslim to win seat in Congress |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |agency=Associated Press |date=November 7, 2006 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/08/america/NA_POL_US_Election_Muslim.php |accessdate=December 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128232133/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/08/america/NA_POL_US_Election_Muslim.php |archive-date=November 28, 2006 }}</ref> In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host [[Al Franken]] defeated incumbent Republican [[Norm Coleman]] in the U.S. Senate race by 312 votes out of three million cast.

In the 2010 election, Republicans took control of both chambers of the Minnesota legislature for the first time in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office for the first time in 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House,<ref>Pugmire, Tim, [http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/11/04/mn-house-election ''Minn.

== Sports, recreation and tourism ==

Minnesota has an active program of organized amateur and professional sports. Tourism has become an important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber has largely been transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and [[environmentalism]], added to traditional interests in [[hunting]] and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.<ref>Aaron Shapiro, ''The Lure of the North Woods: Cultivating Tourism in the Upper Midwest'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2015).</ref>
