'''Robert Clinton Smith''' (born March 30, 1941) is an American politician who served as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] from 1985 to 1990 and the state of [[New Hampshire]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1990 to 2003.

First elected to the House of Representatives as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1984, he was re-elected twice before running for the Senate [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1990|in 1990]], winning the open seat and assuming it early when incumbent [[Gordon J. Humphrey]] resigned. He was re-elected [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1996|in 1996]] and then entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|Republican primary]] for the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. After failing to gain traction, he withdrew before the primaries began and joined the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Taxpayers' Party]], seeking their nomination instead. He then changed parties again, becoming an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] before dropping out of the presidential race altogether. He then re-joined the Republican Party after the Chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] became open, which he then assumed.

Smith ran for re-election [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2002|in 2002]] but lost the Republican primary to Congressman [[John E. Sununu]], who won the general election. After his defeat he moved to Florida and briefly ran for the Senate from there [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2004|in 2004]] and [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|in 2010]], but dropped out early on in both cases after faring poorly in polls of the Republican primary. He subsequently returned to New Hampshire, where he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2014|2014 Senate election]], but was defeated in the Republican primary by former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]].

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Margaret (née Eldridge) and Donald Smith.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newhampshirenota00brer|url-access=registration|title=New Hampshire Notables: Presenting Biographical Sketches of Men and Women who Have Helped Shape the Character of the Granite State|last=Brereton|first=Charles|date=1986|publisher=New Hampshire Historical Society|isbn=9780914339113|language=en}}</ref> He obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Lafayette College]] in 1965 and did graduate work at [[California State University, Long Beach]]. He served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] from 1962 to 1965 as an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]], and was on active duty from 1965 to 1967, including a year in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He remained in the Navy Reserve until 1969. Smith settled in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire]], where he taught history and English. He also served on his local school board and got into the real estate business as owner and operator of the Yankee Pedlar brokerage.

==Political career==

===U.S. House of Representatives===
[[File:Bob Smith with Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|right|Smith with President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
Smith ran for [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the [[1982 United States House of Representatives elections#New Hampshire|1982 elections]]. With [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|the recession]] and [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s unpopularity aiding Democratic candidates, Smith lost to incumbent [[Norman D'Amours]] by 55% to 45%. D'Amours did not seek re-election in [[1984 United States House of Representatives elections#New Hampshire|1984]], unsuccessfully running for the U.S. Senate instead and Smith was elected in his place, riding Reagan's coattails to beat Democrat [[Dudley Dudley (politician)|Dudley Dudley]] by 59% to 40%. A member of NH's Executive Council, her campaign slogan was "Dudley Dudley, Worth Repeating". Smith responded "Dudley Dudley, Liberal Liberal".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/08/cq_2094.html|title=Dudley Not Redundant for Shea-Porter|date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=July 24, 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Rachel|last=Kapochunas}}</ref> Smith was re-elected [[1986 United States House of Representatives elections|in 1986]] and [[1988 United States House of Representatives elections|1988]] by wide margins, first beating Democrat James M. Demers 56% to 44%, then beating Democrat Joseph F. Keefe by 60% to 40%.

===U.S. Senate===
Smith did not run for re-election in 1990, instead running for [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1990|the U.S. Senate seat]] that was being vacated by retiring Republican [[Gordon J. Humphrey]], who was retiring after pledging not to serve more than two terms. His opponent was Democrat [[John A. Durkin]], who had previously served in the Senate from 1975 to 1980. Smith beat him in a landslide, taking 65% of the vote to Durkin's 31%. Humphrey resigned in December after being elected to the [[New Hampshire Senate]] and Smith was appointed to replace him for the final two months of his term.

The [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], concerning the fate of possible missing or captured Americans in Vietnam, became Smith's major issue in Congress in 1985, partly spurred on by his growing up without knowing how his own father died in [[World War II]]. Smith helped create, and served as vice-chairman of, the 1991–1993 [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]]. Smith ran for re-election [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1996|in 1996]] and only narrowly defeated Democratic former U.S. Representative [[Richard Swett]], taking 49% of the vote to Swett's 46%. Smith had established himself as the most conservative Senator from the Northeast, and [[Bill Clinton]]'s coattails nearly caused his defeat. On the night of the election many American media networks incorrectly projected that Swett had won.<ref name=Crabtree_1996>{{cite news  |date=December 2, 1996  |authorlink=Susan Crabtree |first=Susan |last=Crabtree  |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n45_v12/ai_18917399/  |accessdate=April 29, 2012  |title=1996 Ad  |newspaper=[[Insight on the News]]  |quote=An incorrect exit poll by [[Voter News Service]], or VNS, resulted in an early and ultimately incorrect projection of victory in New Hampshire for Democratic Senate candidate Dick Swett over Republican incumbent Sen. Robert C. Smith. "Every election night, you know, its cardiac-arrest time in some state, in some race – sometimes in several races," [[CBS News|CBS]]' [[Dan Rather]] explained at 9:40&nbsp;pm. EST. "This race is as hot and tight as a too-small bathing suit on a too-long car ride back from the beach." But the network "oops" came too late for a number of newspapers that featured Swett's exit-poll victory in their early editions.}}</ref>

During his tenure in the Senate, Smith was a strident opponent of [[gay rights]]. In 1994, Smith and fellow Republican senator [[Jesse Helms]] of [[North Carolina]] introduced an amendment denying federal funding to schools which promoted homosexuality in their curricula.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-04/news/mn-23437_1_gay-rights|title=Gay Activists Downplay Senate School Bill|last=BOXALL|first=BETTINA|date=August 4, 1994|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=October 15, 2018|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The amendment passed by a vote of 63–36.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/senate-backs-cuts-for-schools-that-endorse-homosexuality.html|title=Senate Backs Cuts for Schools That Endorse Homosexuality|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref> In October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] nominated openly gay diplomat [[James Hormel]] to be [[United States Ambassador to Luxembourg]], the first time an openly LGBT person had been nominated for an ambassadorship.

[[File:Wetlands-conservation-act.jpg|thumb|left|Smith, second from right, watches as President [[George W. Bush]] signs a bill in 2002.]]
In February 1999, at [[Kingswood Regional High School]] in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire|Wolfeboro]], Smith announced that he was a candidate for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|Republican nomination]] for President of the United States (at the time the front-runner was [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/19/us/native-son-says-he-s-running-and-few-are-happy-about-it.html|title=Native Son Says He's Running, And Few Are Happy About It|date=February 19, 1999|accessdate=July 24, 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Richard L.|last=Berke}}</ref> In July, after failing to gain any ground in the presidential race and before any primaries or caucuses had taken place, Smith announced he was leaving the Republican Party and would seek the nomination of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Taxpayers' Party]]. One month later, Smith left the Taxpayers Party after claiming that ideologues within the party resisted his candidacy due to his [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and announced as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He withdrew completely from the race in October and endorsed Bush.
[[File:Bobsmith2000.gif|thumb|right|Logo from Smith's 2000 Presidential campaign]]
In the meantime, Republican Senator [[John Chafee]] of [[Rhode Island]] had died and thus the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] had re-opened. Smith recanted his repudiation of the Republican party, claiming it had been "a mistake" and claiming that since he had never officially changed his voting registration that he had never left the party. Smith was then elected as Chafee's successor to the chairmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/03/us/prodigal-smith-named-chairman-of-senate-environment-panel.html|title=Prodigal Smith Named Chairman of Senate Environment Panel|date=November 3, 1999|accessdate=July 24, 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Lizette|last=Alvarez}}</ref>

Some New Hampshire voters were uncomfortable with Smith's passionate way of expressing his views on certain issues. In one case, he used a pair of scissors to stab a plastic doll on the Senate floor to illustrate his anti-abortion stance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Belluck|first1=Pam|title=Senator Smith Ousted in Republican Primary in New Hampshire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/11/us/senator-smith-ousted-in-republican-primary-in-new-hampshire.html|accessdate=October 9, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=September 11, 2002}}</ref>

In 2000, Smith attempted to assist the Miami-based family of [[Elián González]] after Elián was returned to his [[Elian Gonzales#Elián returned to father's custody|father's custody]] by accompanying them to the entrance of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], where Elián was being held; they were turned away.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Raid and Reunion: 'What's happening?' |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=May 1, 2000}}</ref>

Smith ran for re-election to a third term [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2002|in 2002]], but was defeated in the Republican primary by Congressman [[John E. Sununu]], winning 45% of the vote to Sununu's 53%.<ref>"[http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2002/senate.htm Federal Elections 2002 U.S. Senate Results]". ''Federal Election Commission''. 2002.</ref> After his defeat, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that many Republicans were "relieved" that he had lost, having never forgiven him for leaving the party in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/12/us/campaign-season-gop-is-relieved-at-republican-s-loss.html|title=Campaign Season; G.O.P.

The group was re-activated in 2010 during the [[court-martial of Terry Lakin]], a [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], who refused to deploy to [[Afghanistan]] because of his [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|concerns over President Obama's alleged constitutional ineligibility to be president]]. The APF supported Lakin and released a video where he explained his intent to disobey what he believed to be "illegal orders". Asked whether he supported the group's work for Lakin, Smith said: "...my personal belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't have a problem with that being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it."<ref name="salon20100405">{{cite journal|last1=Koppelman |first1=Alex |date=April 5, 2010 |title=New soldier joins Birthers' anti-Obama crusade |journal=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]  |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/04/05/birther_soldier_terrence_lakin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121070737/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/04/05/birther_soldier_terrence_lakin |archivedate=January 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Smith was running in the 2004 primary for Florida's [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2004|U.S. Senate seat]] against [[Mel Martinez]], but dropped out after raising little money<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/florida/2004-04-15-smith-florida_x.htm |date=April 15, 2004 |agency=Associated Press |title=Former New Hampshire senator ends bid for Florida seat }}</ref> and receiving less than 1% support in Republican polls.

Less than a month before the November 2004 U.S. Senate election in New Hampshire, Smith wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' in which he denounced the lack of Republican outrage over [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal|that party's phone jamming]] on Election Day 2002, when Republican operatives had flooded phone banks with incoming calls to hamper them from being used by Democratic party workers to contact Shaheen supporters to get them to the polls. Smith implied that this action may have made the difference in then-Governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]]'s narrow loss to Sununu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041019/REPOSITORY/410190316/1037/NEWS04 |title=Phone-jamming was an outrage; Republicans should speak out in anger |work=Concord Monitor |author=Bob Smith |date=October 18, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417064111/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041019%2FREPOSITORY%2F410190316%2F1037%2FNEWS04 |archivedate=April 17, 2008 }}</ref>

On December 21, 2007, Smith endorsed Congressman [[Duncan L. Hunter|Duncan Hunter Sr.]] of California for the Republican presidential nomination. In a letter to New Hampshire Republicans ahead of the first-in-nation New Hampshire Primary, Smith cited Hunter as the best candidate to carry the "Reagan Torch" and the most qualified candidate to protect conservative values.<ref name="smith">{{cite news|title=Former New Hampshire Sen.Bob Smith Endorses Duncan Hunter for President|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20071221154639tsop.nb/topstory.html|work=News Blaze|date=December 21, 2007|accessdate=December 21, 2007}}</ref>

In January 2008, Smith began writing editorials on the web page of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] (formerly called the U.S. Taxpayers' Party), which fueled speculation that Smith intended to seek that party's presidential nomination. Its nomination went to [[Chuck Baldwin]], a Baptist pastor.

In February 2009, with Martinez having announced that he would retire from the Senate in January 2011, Smith was again considering [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|running for the seat]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/former-sen.-bob-smith-weighs-a-run--in-florida-2009-01-29.html |title=Former Sen.
