===Controversy===
Following the performance, Beyoncé was criticized for performing her new single "Formation", a song that they considered to be "anti-police", during the halftime show and for appearing to align herself with the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Former [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] accused the performance of being anti-police and also criticized Beyoncé's use of [[Black Power]] and [[Black Panther Party]] symbolism in her dance routine. "This is [[American football|football]], not [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive," he said.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cutler|first=Jacqueline|title=Beyoncé's 'black power' salute during Super Bowl 50 halftime show slammed by Rudy Giuliani as 'attack' on police|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/beyonce-halftime-show-draws-ire-praise-article-1.2524039|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|location=New York|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> The controversy caused a "#BoycottBeyonce" hashtag on [[Twitter]] and protesters announced plans for an "anti-Beyoncé" rally on the morning of February 16 outside of the NFL's headquarters in New York City, but no one showed up for such a rally.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bonesteel|first=Matt|title=No one showed up to the anti-Beyonce rally at NFL headquarters|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/16/no-one-showed-up-to-the-anti-beyonce-rally-at-nfl-headquarters/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref> [[CNN]] political commentator Sally Kohn stated that "too many police continue to show themselves to be far more interested in reactionary defensiveness and preserving the abusive status quo."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/15/opinions/beyonce-protest-misses-point-kohn/index.html|title=Beyonce a political superhero with rhythm (Opinion)|last=Commentator|first=Sally Kohn, CNN Political|website=CNN|access-date=2017-02-07}}</ref> Black Lives Matter activist and professor [[Melina Abdullah]] praised Beyoncé and other artists who "are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice."<ref>{{cite web|last=Respers France|first=Lisa|title=Protests planned against and for Beyonce|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/09/entertainment/beyonce-boycott-super-bowl-feat/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anger: Anti-Beyonce Rally Planned For Next Week At NFL Headquarters|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/09/beyonce-super-bowl-controversy/|work=[[WCBS-TV|CBSNewYork.com]]|publisher=CBS Radio|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref> In attempt to address her own controversy, Beyoncé explained, "I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe.
