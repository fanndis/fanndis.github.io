'''Big data''' is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with [[data set]]s that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional [[data processing|data-processing]] [[application software]]. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater [[statistical power]], while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher [[false discovery rate]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breur|first=Tom|date=July 2016|title=Statistical Power Analysis and the contemporary "crisis" in social sciences|journal=Journal of Marketing Analytics|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=61–65|doi=10.1057/s41270-016-0001-3|issn=2050-3318|doi-access=free}}</ref> Big data challenges include [[Automatic identification and data capture|capturing data]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]], [[data analysis]], search, [[Data sharing|sharing]], [[Data transmission|transfer]], [[Data visualization|visualization]], [[Query language|querying]], updating, [[information privacy]] and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: ''volume'', ''variety'', and ''velocity''. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and ''value.''

Current usage of the term ''big data'' tends to refer to the use of [[predictive analytics]], [[user behavior analytics]], or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract [[Data valuation|value]] from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=boyd |first1=dana |last2=Crawford |first2=Kate |title=Six Provocations for Big Data |journal=Social Science Research Network: A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society |date=21 September 2011 |doi= 10.2139/ssrn.1926431|s2cid=148610111 |url=http://osf.io/nrjhn/ }}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[File: Big Data.png|thumb|Shows the growth of big data's primary characteristics of volume, velocity, and variety]]
Big data can be described by the following characteristics:

; Volume: The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sagiroglu |first1=Seref |title=Big data: A review |journal=2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS) |date=2013 |page=42-47 |doi=10.1109/CTS.2013.6567202|isbn=978-1-4673-6404-1 |s2cid=5724608 }}</ref>

; Variety: The type and nature of the data. The earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. The Big Data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed(velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later, these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, and sensors, etc. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through [[data fusion]].

; Velocity: The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to [[small data]], big data is produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitchin |first1=Rob |last2=McArdle |first2=Gavin |title=What makes Big Data, Big Data?

;Veracity:It is the extended definition for big data, which refers to the data quality and the data value.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Onay|first1=Ceylan|last2=Öztürk|first2=Elif|date=2018|title=A review of credit scoring research in the age of Big Data|journal=Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance|volume=26|issue=3|pages=382–405|doi=10.1108/JFRC-06-2017-0054}}</ref> The [[data quality]] of captured data can vary greatly, affecting the accurate analysis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180731105912/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/big-datas-fourth-v Big Data's Fourth V]</ref>

Other important characteristics of Big Data are:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|last2=McArdle|first2=Gavin|date=5 January 2016|title=What makes Big Data, Big Data?

;Exhaustive:Whether the entire system (i.e.,  <math display="inline">n</math>=all) is captured or recorded or not.

; Fine-grained and uniquely lexical: Respectively, the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified.

; Relational: If the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining, or meta-analysis, of different data sets.

; Extensional: If new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily.

; Scalability: If the size of the data can expand rapidly.

; Value: The utility that can be extracted from the data.

; Variability: It refers to data whose value or other characteristics are shifting in relation to the context in which they are being generated.

==Architecture==
Big data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need.  Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s.  For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/database/survey-biggest-databases-approach-30-terabytes|title=Survey: Biggest Databases Approach 30 Terabytes|website=Eweek.com|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>{{promotional source|date=December 2018}}

[[Teradata]] Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing [[DBC 1012]] system. Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5&nbsp;GB in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves according to [[Mark Kryder#Kryder's law projection|Kryder's Law]]. Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007. {{as of|2017}}, there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB. Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data.  Since then, Teradata has added unstructured data types including [[XML]], [[JSON]], and Avro.

In 2000, Seisint Inc. (now [[LexisNexis Risk Solutions]]) developed a [[C++]]-based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the [[HPCC Systems]] platform. This system automatically partitions, distributes, stores and delivers structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers.  Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL. Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand, reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution. In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50577-2004Jul14.html|title=LexisNexis To Buy Seisint For $775 Million|work=Washington Post|access-date=15 July 2004}}</ref> and their high-speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc. when they acquired that company in 2008.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022100809.html</ref> In 2011, the HPCC systems platform was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License.

[[CERN]] and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades, usually analyzed via [[high-throughput computing]] rather than the map-reduce architectures usually meant by the current "big data" movement.

In 2004, [[Google]] published a paper on a process called [[MapReduce]] that uses a similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model, and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data.  With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the Map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the Reduce step). The framework was very successful,<ref>Bertolucci, Jeff [http://www.informationweek.com/software/hadoop-from-experiment-to-leading-big-data-platform/d/d-id/1110491? "Hadoop: From Experiment To Leading Big Data Platform"], "Information Week", 2013. Retrieved on 14 November 2013.</ref> so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an [[implementation]] of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open-source project named [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].<ref>Webster, John. [http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf "MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters"], "Search Storage", 2004. Retrieved on 25 March 2013.</ref> [[Apache Spark]] was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm, as it adds the ability to set up many operations (not just map followed by reducing).

[[MIKE2.0 Methodology|MIKE2.0]] is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled "Big Data Solution Offering".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Big_Data_Solution_Offering| title=Big Data Solution Offering|publisher=MIKE2.0|access-date=8 December 2013}}</ref> The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful [[permutation]]s of data sources, [[complexity]] in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Big_Data_Definition|title=Big Data Definition|publisher=MIKE2.0|access-date=9 March 2013}}</ref>

2012 studies showed that a multiple-layer architecture is one option to address the issues that big data presents. A [[List of file systems#Distributed parallel file systems|distributed parallel]] architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end-user by using a front-end application server.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boja|first=C|author2=Pocovnicu, A |author3=Bătăgan, L. |title=Distributed Parallel Architecture for Big Data|journal=Informatica Economica|year=2012 |volume=16|issue=2| pages=116–127}}</ref>

The [[data lake]] allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management. This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/solving_key_businesschallenges_with_big_data_lake_0.pdf|title=SOLVING KEY BUSINESS CHALLENGES WITH A BIG DATA LAKE|date=August 2014| website=Hcltech.com|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web| url= https://secplab.ppgia.pucpr.br/files/papers/2015-0.pdf | title= Method for testing the fault tolerance of MapReduce frameworks | publisher=Computer Networks | year=2015}}</ref>

The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage,<ref>{{cite web |title=Storage area networks need not apply |author=CNET News |date=1 April 2011 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-21546_3-20049693-10253464.html}}</ref> preferring direct-attached storage ([[Direct-attached storage|DAS]]) in its various forms from solid state drive ([[SSD]]) to high capacity [[Serial ATA|SATA]] disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures—[[Storage area network]] (SAN) and [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS) —is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.

Real or near-real-time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in direct-attached memory or disk is good—data on memory or disk at the other end of a [[Fiber connector|FC]] [[Storage area network|SAN]] connection is not. The cost of a [[Storage area network|SAN]] at the scale needed for analytics applications is very much higher than other storage techniques.

Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that [[Software AG]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Dell]] have spent more than $15&nbsp;billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100&nbsp;billion and was growing at almost 10&nbsp;percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a whole.{{r|Economist}}

Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6&nbsp;billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1&nbsp;billion and 2&nbsp;billion people accessing the internet.{{r|Economist}} Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1&nbsp;billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 [[petabytes]] in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 [[exabytes]] in 2007<ref name="martinhilbert.net"/> and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.{{r|Economist}} According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,<ref name="HilbertContent">{{cite journal|title= What is the Content of the World's Technologically Mediated Information and Communication Capacity: How Much Text, Image, Audio, and Video?| doi= 10.1080/01972243.2013.873748 | volume=30| issue=2 |journal=The Information Society|pages=127–143|year = 2014|last1 = Hilbert|first1 = Martin| s2cid= 45759014 | url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/87w5f6wb }}</ref> which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).

While many vendors offer off-the-shelf solutions for big data, experts recommend the development of in-house solutions custom-tailored to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/07/interview-amy-gershkoff-ebay-in-house-BI-tools.html |title=Interview: Amy Gershkoff, Director of Customer Analytics & Insights, eBay on How to Design Custom In-House BI Tools |last1=Rajpurohit |first1=Anmol |date=11 July 2014 |website= KDnuggets|access-date=14 July 2014|quote=Dr. Amy Gershkoff: "Generally, I find that off-the-shelf business intelligence tools do not meet the needs of clients who want to derive custom insights from their data. Therefore, for medium-to-large organizations with access to strong technical talent, I usually recommend building custom, in-house solutions."}}</ref>

===Government===
The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url =http://www.computerworld.com/article/2472667/government-it/the-government-and-big-data--use--problems-and-potential.html |title=The Government and big data: Use, problems and potential |date=21 March 2012 |magazine=Computerworld |access-date=12 September 2016}}</ref> but does not come without its flaws. Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome.

product development, branding) that all use different types of data. Because one-size-fits-all analytical solutions are not desirable, business schools should prepare marketing managers to have wide knowledge on all the different techniques used in these sub domains to get a big picture and work effectively with analysts.

===Media===
To understand how the media uses big data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that [[wikt:practitioner|practitioners]] in Media and Advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations.  The ultimate aim is to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various [[data-mining]] activities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Couldry|first1=Nick|last2=Turow|first2=Joseph|title=Advertising, Big Data, and the Clearance of the Public Realm: Marketers' New Approaches to the Content Subsidy| journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2014|volume=8|pages=1710–1726}}</ref>

===Insurance===
Health insurance providers are collecting data on social "determinants of health" such as food and [[Television consumption|TV consumption]], marital status, clothing size and purchasing habits, from which they make predictions on health costs, in order to spot health issues in their clients.

===Internet of Things (IoT)===
{{Main|Internet of Things}}
{{See|Edge computing}}
Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device inter-connectivity. Such mappings have been used by the media industry, companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency. IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data, and this sensory data has been used in medical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170109006500/en/QuiO-Named-Innovation-Champion-Accenture-HealthTech-Innovation|title=QuiO Named Innovation Champion of the Accenture HealthTech Innovation Challenge|website=Businesswire.com|access-date=8 October 2017| date=10 January 2017}}</ref> manufacturing<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.predix.com/sites/default/files/IDC_OT_Final_whitepaper_249120.pdf |title=A Software Platform for Operational Technology Innovation|website=Predix.com|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> and transportation<ref name="BigDataIoT16">{{cite web|url =http://www.wiomax.com/big-data-driven-smart-transportation-the-underlying-big-story-of-smart-iot-transformed-mobility/| title=Big Data Driven Smart Transportation: the Underlying Story of IoT Transformed Mobility| author=Z.

[[Kevin Ashton]], digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986|title=That Internet Of Things Thing.}}</ref> defines the Internet of Things in this quote: “If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any help from us—we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss, and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.”

===Information technology===
Especially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within [[business operations]] as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of [[information technology]] (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called [[IT operations analytics]] (ITOA).<ref name="ITOA1">{{cite web|last1=Solnik|first1=Ray |title=The Time Has Come: Analytics Delivers for IT Operations |url =http://www.datacenterjournal.com/time-analytics-delivers-operations/|website=Data Center Journal| access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> By applying big data principles into the concepts of [[machine intelligence]] and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide solutions before the problems even happen.<ref name="ITOA1" /> In this time, ITOA businesses were also beginning to play a major role in [[systems management]] by offering platforms that brought individual [[data silos]] together and generated insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.

Big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist. Hence, there is a need to fundamentally change the processing ways.<ref>E. Sejdić, "Adapt current tools for use with big data," ''Nature,'' vol. 507, no. 7492, pp. 306, Mar. 2014.</ref>

[http://web.stanford.edu/group/mmds/ "MMDS. Workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets"].
</ref> Regarding big data, one needs to keep in mind that such concepts of magnitude are relative.  As it is stated "If the past is of any guidance, then today’s big data most likely will not be considered as such in the near future."<ref name=CAD7challenges/>

===Sampling big data===
An important research question that can be asked about big data sets is whether you need to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or is a sample good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data. But [[Sampling (statistics)]] enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. For example, there are about 600 million tweets produced every day. Is it necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day? Is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics? In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient.  Big Data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and transactional data.  With large sets of data points, marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting.

There has been some work done in Sampling algorithms for big data. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed.<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Deepan Palguna |author2= Vikas Joshi |author3=Venkatesan Chakravarthy |author4=Ravi Kothari |author5=L.

==Critique==
Critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors: those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/joe.21642 | title = Big Data and Business Intelligence: Debunking the Myths | journal = Global Business and Organizational Excellence| volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | year = 2015 | last1 = Kimble | first1 = C. | last2 = Milolidakis | first2 = G. | arxiv = 1511.03085 | bibcode = 2015arXiv151103085K | s2cid = 21113389 }}</ref> One approach to this criticism is the field of [[critical data studies]].

===Critiques of the big data paradigm===
"A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data".<ref name="Editorial" /> In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and [[Ulf-Dietrich Reips|Reips]] point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]]'s assertion that big data will spell the end of theory:<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory|title=The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete|author=Chris Anderson|date=23 June 2008|journal=WIRED}}</ref> focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social, economic, and political contexts.<ref>{{cite news |author=Graham M. |title=Big data and the end of theory? |newspaper=The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory |location=London |date=9 March 2012}}</ref> Even as companies invest eight- and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, big data, no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, must be complemented by "big judgment," according to an article in the Harvard Business Review.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Data Won't Guarantee Good Decisions. Harvard Business Review|url=http://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions/ar/1|work=Shah, Shvetank; Horne, Andrew; Capellá, Jaime;|publisher=HBR.org|access-date=8 September 2012|date=April 2012}}</ref>

Much in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably "informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is".<ref name="HilbertBigData2013">{{cite journal|ssrn=2205145|title=Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies|date=15 January 2013|last1=Hilbert|first1=Martin}}</ref> Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past.<ref name="HilbertTEDx">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXef6yfJZAI Big Data requires Big Visions for Big Change.], Hilbert, M. (2014). London: TEDx UCL, x=independently organized TED talks</ref> If the system's dynamics of the future change (if it is not a [[stationary process]]), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory.<ref name="HilbertTEDx"/> As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use "abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers' digital traces and make new theories emerge".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alemany Oliver|first=Mathieu |author2=Vayre, Jean-Sebastien |s2cid=111360835 |title= Big Data and the Future of Knowledge Production in Marketing Research: Ethics, Digital Traces, and Abductive Reasoning|journal=Journal of Marketing Analytics |year=2015|volume=3|issue=1|doi= 10.1057/jma.2015.1|pages=5–13}}</ref>
Additionally, it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as [[agent-based model]]s<ref name="HilbertBigData2013" /> and [[complex systems]]. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/| title=Seeing Around Corners|author=Jonathan Rauch|date=1 April 2002|work=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>Epstein, J.

===Critiques of the 'V' model===
The 'V' model of Big Data is concerting as it centres around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information. This led to the framework of [[cognitive big data]], which characterizes Big Data application according to:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lugmayr|first1=Artur|last2=Stockleben|first2=Bjoern|last3=Scheib|first3=Christoph|last4=Mailaparampil|first4=Mathew|last5=Mesia|first5=Noora|last6=Ranta|first6=Hannu|last7=Lab|first7=Emmi|date=1 June 2016|title=A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY ON BIG-DATA RESEARCH AND ITS IMPLICATIONS – WHAT IS REALLY 'NEW' IN BIG DATA? – IT'S COGNITIVE BIG DATA! |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304784955}}</ref>
* Data completeness: understanding of the non-obvious from data;
* Data correlation, causation, and predictability: causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability;
* Explainability and interpretability: humans desire to understand and accept what they understand, where algorithms don't cope with this;
* Level of automated decision making: algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic self-learning;

===Critiques of novelty===
Large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century, including the US census analytics performed by [[IBM]]'s punch-card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent.   In more recent decades, science experiments such as [[CERN]] have produced data on similar scales to current commercial "big data".  However, science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom-built [[high-performance computing]] (super-computing) clusters and grids, rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave, implying a difference in both culture and technology stack.

Big data is a [[buzzword]] and a "vague term",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|title="Big Data" is an over used buzzword and this Twitter bot proves it|url= http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/26/big-data-is-an-over-used-buzzword-and-this-twitter-bot-proves-it/ |website=siliconangle.com|publisher=SiliconANGLE|access-date=4 November 2015|date=26 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="ft-harford">{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html |title=Big data: are we making a big mistake? |last1=Harford |first1=Tim |date=28 March 2014 |website=[[Financial Times]] |access-date=7 April 2014}}</ref> but at the same time an "obsession"<ref name="ft-harford" /> with entrepreneurs, consultants, scientists and the media. Big data showcases such as [[Google Flu Trends]] failed to deliver good predictions in recent years, overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two. Similarly, [[Academy awards]] and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target.
Big data often poses the same challenges as small data; adding more data does not solve problems of bias, but may emphasize other problems. In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population, and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions. [[Google Translate]]—which is based on big data statistical analysis of text—does a good job at translating web pages. However, results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed.
On the other hand, big data may also introduce new problems, such as the [[multiple comparisons problem]]: simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant.
Ioannidis argued that "most published research findings are false"<ref name="Ioannidis">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ioannidis JP | title = Why most published research findings are false | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = e124 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16060722 | pmc = 1182327 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 | author-link1 = John P. A. Ioannidis }}</ref> due to essentially the same effect: when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments (i.e. process a big amount of scientific data; although not with big data technology), the likelihood of a "significant" result being false grows fast – even more so, when only positive results are published.
<!-- sorry, this started overlapping with above section more and more... merging is welcome; I already dropped the intended subheadline "Hype cycle and inflated expectations". -->
Furthermore, big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated.  In an example, big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html|title=How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election |last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|date=10 November 2016|last2=Singer|first2=Natasha|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref> with varying degrees of success.

=== Critiques of big data policing and surveillance ===
Big Data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement]] and [[Corporate surveillance|corporations]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/06/04/how-data-driven-policing-threatens-human-freedom|title=How data-driven policing threatens human freedom|date=4 June 2018|work=The Economist|access-date=27 October 2019|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> Due to the less visible nature of data-based surveillance as compared to traditional method of policing, objections to big data policing are less likely to arise. According to Sarah Brayne's ''Big Data Surveillance: The Case of Policing'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brayne|first=Sarah|s2cid=3609838|date=29 August 2017|title=Big Data Surveillance: The Case of Policing|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=82|issue=5|pages=977–1008|language=en|doi=10.1177/0003122417725865}}</ref> big data policing can reproduce existing [[Social inequality|societal inequalities]] in three ways:

* Placing suspected criminals under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm;
* Increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing [[Race in the United States criminal justice system#Racial inequality in incarceration|racial overrepresentation]] in the criminal justice system;
* Encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace, thus creating obstacles to social inclusion.

If these potential problems are not corrected or regulating, the effects of big data policing continue to shape societal hierarchies. Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases, Brayne also notes.

==In popular culture==
===Books===
*[[Moneyball]] is a non-fiction book that explores how the Oakland Athletics used statistical analysis to outperform teams with larger budgets. In 2011 a [[Moneyball (film)|film adaptation]] starring [[Brad Pitt]] was released.
*[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]] is a dystopian novel by [[George Orwell]]. In 1984 the government collects information on citizens and uses the information to maintain an totalitarian rule.
===Film===
*In [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]] H.Y.D.R.A (disguised as [[S.H.I.E.L.D]]) develops helicarriers that use data to determine and eliminate threats over the globe.
*In [[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]], [[Batman]] uses a sonar device that can spy on all of [[Gotham City]]. The data is gathered from the mobile phones of people within the city.
