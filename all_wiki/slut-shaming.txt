The action of slut-shaming can be considered to be a form of social punishment and is an aspect of [[sexism]], as well as [[Female_intrasexual_competition#Slut-shaming|female intrasexual competition]]. The social movement falls into the category of [[feminism]]. This raises controversy because [[gender role]]s do have a significant role in the social movement. The topic of slut-shaming sheds light on the social issues that are associated with the double standard. This is because slut-shaming is usually toward girls and women, and boys and men usually do not get slut-shamed. Slut-shaming is common in America because it is such a [[High-context and low-context cultures|high-context culture]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lik|first=Sam|date=2016|title=A Comparison of U.S. and Chinese Profiles on Jack'd, a Mobile Dating App for Men Who Have Sex With Men|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2070/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&sid=deab3d6e-3730-40a9-9b44-e0ca8bfd6023%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=19328036|pages=106040–6059}}</ref> Being in a high-context culture, it is easier to be victim blamed.

== Society and culture ==
=== History ===
There is no documented date of origin for the term ''slut-shaming''; nor the act of it. Rather, although the act of slut-shaming has existed for centuries, discussion of it has grown out of social and cultural relations and the trespassing of boundaries of what is considered normative and acceptable behavior. [[Second wave of feminism]] contributed significantly to the definition and act of slut-shaming. Tracing back to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the second [[World War]], men's gender roles were that of the breadwinner. Men made up a majority of the labor force while women were socialized and taught to embrace the cult of domesticity and homemaking.<ref name="Poole">Poole, E. (2014) Hey girls, did you know? Slut-shaming on the internet needs to stop. University of San Francisco Law Review, 1, pp. 221-260</ref> Author Emily Poole argues that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s increased the rate of both [[birth control]] use, as well as rates of [[premarital sex]].<ref name="Poole" />

=== Modern society ===
Slut-shaming is prevalent on [[social media]] platforms, including the most commonly used: [[YouTube]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. Slut-shaming has occurred on Facebook in controversial exchanges between users that have resulted in convictions to menace, harass and cause offense.<ref>{{Cite web|title = This Woman Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Tinder|url = http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|website = Mic|access-date = 2015-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/30/how-facebook-troll-came-undone|author = Elle Hunt|date = 30 July 2016|access-date = 30 July 2016|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|title = 'What law am I breaking?' How a Facebook troll came undone}}</ref>

It has been reported by [[The Pew Research Center]] that the most common targets of harassment on the Internet are often young women. Citing that 50% of young female respondents have been called offensive names and or shamed online. In particular, those who were 18 to 24 years of age experienced varying amounts of severe harassment at astoundingly high rates. Women who have been stalked online were at 26%, while the targets of online sexual harassment were at 25%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/|title=Online Harassment|date=2014-10-22|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}</ref>

In the ''Women Studies International Forum'', researcher Jessica Megarry argues that harassment conveyed in a case study of #mencallmethings hashtag found that it was a form of online sexual assault, on specifically Twitter. In this hashtag, women would collectively tweet examples of harassment they have received from men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Megarry|first=Jessica|date=2014|title=Online inclnivity or sexual harassment?

The Slut Walk movement has embraced the slut-shame label and has engaged in an act of resignification. Ringrose et al. call the Slut Walk a "collective movement" where the focus goes back to the perpetrator and no longer rests on the victim.<ref>Ringrose, J. & Renold, E (2011).

Krystal Ball characterized the comments of [[Rush Limbaugh]] during the [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy]] as follows: "If you are a woman who stands up for your rights, you are a slut and your parents should be ashamed of you and we should all have the right to view your sex tapes online. This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line [sic], they are demeaned and degraded into silence.

Slut-shaming has been used as a form of bullying on social media, with some people using [[revenge porn]]ography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent.

She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/slut-shaming-teen-girls_n_4178812.html|title = Teen Girls Take A Stand Against Slut Shaming: What It Is, And Why You Should Care|series = Huff Post Teen|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Menza|first = Kaitlin|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

== Activism ==
Activism against slut-shaming takes place worldwide. Participants have covered their bodies in messages reading "Don't Tell Me How to Dress" and "I am not a slut but I like having consensual sex" and march under a giant banner with the word slut on it.

After the gang rape of an unconscious 16-year-old girl in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], August 2012, football players spread videos of the assault to other classmates whom some of which posted the videos to Twitter and Instagram. The pictures and video were later removed by authorities, however that did not stop people from hash-tagging "Whore status" or "I have no sympathy for whores" in their tweets. Members of the collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] reported names of the rapists and classmates who spread the footage to local authorities. They took to the streets and Internet requesting help from the community to bring justice to the [[Jane Doe]] who was raped.<ref>{{cite book |journal=Hate Crimes in Cyberspace |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hatecri_cit_2014_00_5746/page/95 95–119] |jstor=j.ctt7zsws7.7 |chapter=Civil Rights Movements, Past and Present |last1=Citron |first1=Danielle Keats |title=Hate Crimes in Cyberspace |year=2014 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/hatecri_cit_2014_00_5746/page/95 }}</ref>

Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, ''[[Slut: The Play]]'', in which they address the damaging impact of slut-shaming and slut culture.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hersh/nyc-girls-challenge-weiner_b_3691859.html |title=NYC Girls Challenge Weiner Campaign: Stop Slut-Shaming |first=Lauren |last=Hersh |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date= 2 August 2013 |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="sluttheplay.com">{{cite web |url=http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |title=Why Slut — Slut |publisher=Sluttheplay.com |access-date=11 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326180510/http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |archive-date=26 March 2014 }}</ref> The creators note that their play "is a call to action – a reminder" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere.<ref name="sluttheplay.com" /> ''Slut'' is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.<ref name="sluttheplay.com" /> The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.<ref name="sluttheplay.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/love-sex/teenage-peta-pinup-speaks-out-205112851.html |title=Meet the Teen Star of PETA's Latest Controversy.

In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of ''Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation'', [[Leora Tanenbaum]] writes:
{{quote|A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by [[Katie Cappiello]] vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen.<ref name="sluttheplay.com" />}}

After experiencing slut-shaming firsthand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won’t Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT |title=A Woman Was Slut-Shamed and Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Her Tinder Profile |publisher=[[Mic.com]]}}</ref>

== Among gay and bisexual men ==
Gay and bisexual men are also victimized for slut-shaming because of their sexual activity. There has been research supporting that [[LGBT]] students were more likely to be bullied and called sluts than heterosexual students. Researchers discussed how these negative experiences of victimization by peers, friends and strangers can lead to "physical harm, social shaming, and loss of friendships."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Unlike heterosexual people, LGBT people are more likely to learn about [[safe sex]] practices from friends.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The group most highly at risk of [[HIV]] infection is young gay and bisexual men.{{Citation needed |date=July 2018}} Most of the education that young gay and bisexual men receive about safe sex practices is learned from friends, the Internet, hearsay or trial and error.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crothers|first1=Laura|last2=Levinson|first2=E.M.|date=2004-09-01|title=Assessment of bullying: A review of methods and instruments|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280786511|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=82|issue=4|pages=496–503|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2004.tb00338.x}}</ref>{{verification failed|date=July 2018}}

Criticism of [[non-heterosexual]] men's sexual activity can either be said in a humorous context or not. Judgementalism happens when someone mentions gay men's sexual risk behavior or that they have [[multiple sex partners]]. This implies that their behavior is "slutty" and dirty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McDavitt|first1=Bryce|last2=Mutchler|first2=Matt G.|date=April 2014|title="Dude, You're Such a Slut!"

Street harassment includes [[cat-calling]], victim blaming, and slut shaming. Judgmentalism is not a pejorative word compared to women, and slut-shaming may have a positive connotation with men depending on context and relationship.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://monash.rl.talis.com/items/E364B37E-5E83-D602-A4F9-25CDDED28245.html|title=Street Harassment: Current and Promising Avenues for Researchers and Activists {{!}} Monash University|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=3|pages=196–211|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12|doi=10.1111/soc4.12248|year=2015|last1=Logan|first1=Laura S.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/10/she_called_me_a_manwhore/|title=She called me a "manwhore"|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|date=9 February 2012|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref>
