'''Parliamentary votes on Brexit''', sometimes referred to as "'''meaningful votes'''", are the parliamentary votes under the terms of Section 13 of the United Kingdom's [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018]], which requires the [[government of the United Kingdom]] to bring forward an [[Amend (motion)|amendable]] parliamentary [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] at the end of the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union#Article 50 process|Article 50 negotiations]] between the government and the [[European Union]] in order to ratify the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]].<ref name="CBP_8345">{{cite book |last=Maer |first=Lucinda |chapter=2.

When the bill returned to the Commons the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] offered concessions and the Lords' proposed amendment was defeated. The bill was then passed into law on 26 June 2018.<ref name="BBC_Voteresult">{{cite news |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Ministers win key Brexit bill vote after concession |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44456035 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref>

At the end of March 2019, the government had not won any of the meaningful votes. This led to a series of non-binding "'''indicative votes'''" on potential options for Brexit, and the delay of the departure date.

=== Background ===
Following the [[Brexit|UK's decision to leave the European Union]], the result of [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|a referendum on 23 June 2016]], the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] invoked [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union]]. The UK was thus due to leave the EU at 11{{nbsp}}pm on 29 March 2019 [[UTC]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Brexit preparedness |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en|publisher=European Commission |access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref>

[[Gina Miller]], a British businesswoman, took the government to court to challenge its authority to invoke Article 50 without reference to Parliament. On 3 November 2016, the [[High Court of Justice]] ruled in favour of Miller in the case ''[[R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live | title=High court says parliament must vote on triggering article 50 – as it happened | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=3 November 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155011/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live | archive-date=4 November 2016 | df=dmy-all | access-date = 14 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last1 = Faulconbridge | first1 = Guy | last2 = Holden | first2 = Michael | title = A woman suing the British government over Brexit is receiving a flood of sexist and racist threats | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170204061153/http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-in-a-battle-over-brexit-court-challenger-fears-britains-demons-have-been-unleashed-2016-11 | archive-date = 4 February 2017 | url = http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-in-a-battle-over-brexit-court-challenger-fears-britains-demons-have-been-unleashed-2016-11 | work = [[Business Insider|Business Insider UK]] | date = 30 November 2016|access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref>

In July 2017 [[David Jones (Clwyd West MP)|David Jones]], [[Department for Exiting the European Union|Minister of State for Exiting the European Union]], told the Commons he expected the parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal with the EU to happen "before the European Parliament debates and votes on the final agreement."

=== Alteration of Clause 9 ===
In December 2017 pressure grew on the government to amend clause 9 so that parliament would have approval of the final terms of the withdrawal deal between the UK and the EU prior to 29 March 2019, the date set for the UK's departure from the EU. Conservative MP [[Dominic Grieve]] advised the government to amend the clause themselves or he would table his own amendment to the bill.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Asthana | first1 = Anushka | last2 = Mason | first2 = Rowena | author-link1 = Anushka Asthana |title=Tory rebels confident of securing 'meaningful vote' on Brexit deal | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/tory-rebels-confident-of-securing-meaningful-vote-on-brexit-deal | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 13 December 2017 | access-date = 25 August 2018}}</ref> Grieve duly tabled his amendment to the bill (Amendment 7) requiring any Brexit deal to be enacted by statute, rather than implemented by government order.<ref name="Independent_Austin">{{cite news | last = Austin | first = Henry | title = Brexit vote: The 11 Tory rebel MPs who defeated the Government | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-tory-mps-rebel-theresa-may-government-defeat-who-were-they-list-a8108776.html | work = The Independent | date = 13 December 2017 | access-date = 7 August 2018}}</ref>

Clause 9 was then introduced to the house as follows (Grieve's additions, amendment 7, in italics):
:'''9{{spaces|2|em}}Implementing the withdrawal agreement'''
::(1){{spaces|2|em}}A Minister of the Crown may by regulations make such provision as the Minister considers appropriate for the purposes of implementing the withdrawal agreement if the Minister considers that such provision should be in force on or before exit day, ''subject to the prior enactment of a statute by Parliament approving the final terms of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.''

At the weekend prior to the [[House of Commons|Commons]] vote on the amendment, the leaders of the [[all-party parliamentary group]] on EU relations signed a statement saying, "Members of all parties have already provided valuable scrutiny to the EU (Withdrawal) bill, and we have forced the government into some concessions. But little of that will matter unless we can have a truly meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement the government negotiates with the European Union."<ref>{{cite news | last = Savage | first = Michael |title= Theresa May faces first Brexit bill defeat, say Commons rebels | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/09/theresa-may-faces-first-brexit-defeat-parliament-rebels | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 9 December 2017 | access-date = 25 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer |title= Brexit: MPs call for 'meaningful' Commons vote | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42297430 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 10 December 2017 | access-date = 19 June 2018}}</ref>

On the morning of 13 December 2017 Davis issued a written statement saying, "In the UK, the Government has committed to hold a vote on the final deal in Parliament as soon as possible after the negotiations have concluded.

==== Alternative amendment by Dominic Grieve ====
The night before the bill was due back before the Commons, 11 June 2018, [[Dominic Grieve]] tabled a last-minute alternative amendment. The Lords amendment would prevent a 'no deal' scenario, and MPs and Lords could tell May to go back to the negotiating table and get something better, for example. Grieve's amendment also tackled the 'no deal' scenario but it set dates for May to come back to parliament and set out the government's intentions in the event of a 'no deal', and gain parliamentary approval for those plans.<ref name="BI_nodeal">{{cite news | last = Payne | first = Adam | title = Everything you need to know about Theresa May's Brexit bill showdown | url = http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-eu-withdrawal-bill-amendments-2018-6 | work = [[Business Insider|Business Insider UK]] | date = 12 June 2018 | access-date = 14 June 2018}}</ref>

Grieve's amendment:

==== Commons rejection of Grieve's amendment ====
On the morning of the vote, 12 June 2018, the government rejected the alternative amendment by Grieve. This set the scene for disagreement during the Commons debate about whether or not parliament should have a say in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.<ref name="BI_nodeal" /><ref name="Guardian_nodeal">{{cite news | last = Elgot | first = Jessica | title = Brexit: No 10 rules out backing compromise amendment to EU withdrawal bill | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/brexit-compromise-amendment-to-eu-withdrawal-bill-tabled-at-last-minute | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 12 June 2018 | access-date = 14 June 2018}}</ref> The morning also saw [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee]]'s surprise resignation as a junior Tory minister saying, "If, in the future, I am to look my children in the eye and honestly say that I did my best for them I cannot, in all good conscience, support how our country’s current exit from the EU looks set to be delivered."<ref name="Independent_PhillipLee">{{cite news | last = Watts | first = Joe | title = Tory minister Phillip Lee resigns over Brexit on day of crucial EU withdrawal votes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-philip-lee-resign-justice-minister-conservative-tory-eu-withdrawal-vote-a8394676.html | work = The Independent | date = 12 June 2018 | access-date = 14 June 2018}}</ref>

As the debate went on, the government gave assurances to potential Tory rebels that they would address their concerns in a new amendment for the Lords to consider. The concession offered by ministers was believed to include offering a new parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal was voted down by MPs and peers,<ref name="BBC_Voteresult" /> which would open the door to MPs taking control of the negotiations if ministers failed to strike a deal in Brussels.<ref name="Ind_concession">{{cite news | last1 = Kentish | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Cowburn | first2 = Ashley | last3 = Buchan | first3 = Lizzy | title = Brexit vote - as it happened: Theresa May caves in to Tory rebels in major negotiations climbdown | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-politics-live-updates-brexit-votes-mp-theresa-may-labour-tory-conservatives-a8394611.html | work = The Independent | date = 12 June 2018 | access-date = 14 June 2018}}</ref> The concession meant that the government won 324 votes to 298, a majority of 26.<ref name="BBC_Voteresult" /><ref>{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-06-12/debates/3AC9EE4B-A84C-47D1-9519-80CEA3653807/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Bill#contribution-ED9FF27A-9AC7-4846-850C-918D46B3167B |date=12 June 2018 |title= European Union (Withdrawal) Bill: Division 171 |column_start= 810 |column_end= 814}}</ref>

Speaking the day after the vote, in the Commons at [[Prime Minister's Questions]], May said, "We have seen concerns raised about the role of Parliament in relation to the Brexit process. What I agreed yesterday is that, as the Bill goes back to the Lords, we will have further discussions with colleagues over those concerns. This morning, I have agreed with the Brexit Secretary that we will bring forward an amendment in the Lords, and there are a number of things that will guide our approach in doing so...

{{As of|2018|06|15}}, rebel Tory MPs were reportedly still unhappy with the amendment as it only allows the Commons "a motion in neutral terms" (5C)(b)(i). Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action, and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Leading Tory rebel Dominic Grieve rejects May's Brexit compromise | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44482652 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 14 June 2018 | access-date = 15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Theresa May set for Brexit clash as rebels brand compromise 'unacceptable' | url = http://www.itv.com/news/2018-06-14/theresa-may-set-for-brexit-clash-as-rebels-brand-compromise-unacceptable/ | work = [[ITV News]] | date = 14 June 2018 | access-date = 15 June 2018}}</ref>

In the immediate aftermath, [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] called for a [[2019 motion of no confidence in the May ministry|vote of no confidence in the government]], which was held on 16 January 2019. The government won the vote by 325 to 306, a majority of 19.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Staff writer |title=May's government survives no-confidence vote |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46899466|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2019|access-date=23 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Vote on "motion in neutral terms" (29 January 2019)===
Section 13 of the 2018 Act required that the government put down a motion, in neutral terms, in response to the written statements made by the prime minister on 21 and 24 January, in which she set out her "Plan B". In accordance with Dominic Grieve's "three day amendment" to the parliamentary timetable, this motion was tabled on 21 January (three sitting days after the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by MPs), and it was put to a vote on 29 January 2019. It took the form of a resolution to the effect that the House of Commons had "considered" the Prime Minister's statements. This neutral motion was subject to amendment, and prior to voting on the main motion, the Commons voted on seven amendments, proposed by MPs and selected by the Speaker.<ref>[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-news-latest-commons-showdown-looms-for-theresa-may-as-mps-bid-to-change-course-of-eu-exit-a4051271.html "Brexit amendments: The key amendments to Theresa May's deal that MPs voted on tonight"], ''Evening Standard'', 29 January 2019</ref>

Two amendments were passed. The Brady amendment called on the Government to re-negotiate over the [[Northern Ireland backstop]]. It passed by 16 votes, supported by the Conservatives and DUP over other parties in the Commons, but with 7 Labour MPs supporting it and 8 Conservative MPs voting against it. The Spelman-Dromey amendment declared the desire of the Commons to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It passed by 8 votes, supported by all the parties other than the Conservatives and DUP, but with the support of 17 Conservative MPs. An amendment seeking to pave the way for a binding legislation that would prevent no deal, the Cooper-Boles amendment, failed by 23 votes. Three other amendments also failed.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer |title= Brexit amendments: What did MPs vote on and what were the results? |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46959545| work = [[BBC News]] |date=29 January 2019 |access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Lovegrove | first = Simon |title= United Kingdom (and EU regulation): MPs reject all but two amendments to Theresa May's Brexit plan | website = regulationtomorrow.com/eu | publisher = Financial services: Regulation tomorrow |url= https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/eu/mps-reject-all-but-two-amendments-to-theresa-mays-brexit-plan/ |date=29 January 2019 |access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref> The main motion (as amended) was then passed without a division.

May stated that a further "meaningful vote" would be held "as soon as we possibly can", but that if it did not take place by 13 February then she would present a statement, to be followed by a debate on an amendable motion on 14 February.<ref>{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-29/debates/BB8A5769-12B4-4D0E-9B4E-158F89F9FCDE/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act2018#contribution-297C69CC-2919-4BE6-88E4-A2AA3721682D |date=29 January 2019 |title= European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 |column= 671 |speaker=[[Theresa May]] |position=[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]|quote=First of all, as I have said, we will bring a revised deal back to this House for a second meaningful vote as soon as we possibly can.

===Vote on amendable motion (14 February 2019)===
On 12 February 2019, Theresa May made a statement to the House of Commons on the government's progress in securing a withdrawal agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-brexit-12-february-2019|title=PM's statement to the House of Commons on Brexit: 12 February 2019|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> This was followed, on 14 February, by a vote on an amendable motion in the following terms: "That this House welcomes the Prime Minister’s statement of 12 February 2019; reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on 29 January 2019 and notes that discussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing."'

All proposed amendments to the motion were defeated. The motion itself was then defeated, by a margin of 303-259, due in part to abstentions by the European Research Group faction of Conservative MPs, who objected that the motion appeared to rule out leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer |title= Brexit amendments: What did MPs vote on and what were the results? |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47243407| work = [[BBC News]] |date=14 February 2019 |access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref>

In her statement on 12 February, the prime minister reiterated her goal of having a second "meaningful vote" on a withdrawal agreement. She indicated that if this was not achieved by 26 February the government would make another statement to the House on the government's progress, and table an amendable motion relating to that statement, which would be put to a vote on 27 February.

===Vote on amendable motion (27 February 2019)===
On 27 February 2019, the House of Commons voted on an amendable motion in the following terms: "That this House notes the Prime Minister’s statement on Leaving the European Union of 26 February 2019; and further notes that discussions between the UK and the EU are ongoing."

Two amendments were passed.  An amendment to seek a joint UK-EU commitment to citizens' rights was passed without a division.  An amendment to specify the timeframe for further meaningful votes in March 2019 was passed by a margin of 502–20.  The main motion (as amended) was then passed without a division.<ref name="Hansard_27Feb2019">{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-02-27/debates/78B98FAF-F95B-42F6-848F-5047AEAC46A8/UK%E2%80%99SWithdrawalFromTheEU |date=27 February 2019 |title= UK's Withdrawal from the EU }}</ref>

[[File:Westminster & Brexit (33495857668).jpg|thumb|upright|Protesters outside the [[Palace of Westminster]], shortly before the vote on "no deal" on 13 March 2019]]
Under the terms of the 27 February motion, the defeat of the second meaningful vote means that the Government must promptly bring forward a motion regarding leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement. The motion, which blocked a no-deal Brexit, was presented on 13 March.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f6ef290-458b-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb|title=Theresa May plans to vote to block no-deal Brexit|author=Laura Hughes|work=Financial Times|date=13 March 2019|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/Calendar/Commons/MainChamber/2019/03/13/events.html|title=Parliamentary business for 13 March|website=services.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref> Two amendments to the motion were voted upon: the first, tabled by [[Caroline Spelman]] and categorically rejecting no-deal in any circumstances, passed 312–308; the second, the "[[Kit Malthouse|Malthouse]] compromise" supporting a so-called "managed no-deal Brexit", failed 164–374.

Three ministers resigned from the government to support the amendment: [[Richard Harrington (politician)|Richard Harrington]] (business minister), [[Alistair Burt]] (foreign office), and [[Steve Brine]] (health). The Beckett amendment, tabled by [[Margaret Beckett]], was defeated 314–311. It would have required Parliament to vote favourably for a "no deal" Brexit or request an extension to Article 50 if the government was within seven days of leaving the European Union without a deal.  The amended main motion (Letwin but not Beckett) passed 327–300.

=== First Round of Indicative Votes (27 March 2019) ===
As a result of the first Letwin amendment's success, indicative votes on Parliament's preferred Brexit options were held on 27 March.  Eight propositions were voted upon, of which all eight failed.

In a departure from Westminster parliamentary convention, all eight votes took place simultaneously, using ballot papers, rather than having MPs walk through lobbies to signify their vote.

=== Third "meaningful vote" (29 March 2019) ===
As parliament had agreed to an extension of Article 50 to 30 June the possibility of a third meaningful vote was raised<ref name="BBC_47564793" /> and the Speaker ruled that "the same proposition or substantially the same proposition" could not be brought back in the same parliamentary session.<ref>{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-03-18/debates/AB031E78-C906-4833-9ACF-291998FAC0E1/Speaker%E2%80%99SStatement#debate-3728111 |date=18 March 2019 |title= Speaker’s Statement |volume= 656 |speaker=[[John Bercow]] |position=[[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Elgot|first=Jessica |title=Brexit: John Bercow rules out third meaningful vote on same deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/18/brexit-john-bercow-rules-out-third-meaningful-vote-on-same-deal | work=The Guardian|date=18 March 2019 |access-date=12 April 2019}}</ref> The Political Declaration was then removed from the ballot in order to make it a different proposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Mark |title=Meaningful Vote 3: The legal implications of separating the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration|url=https://publiclawforeveryone.com/2019/03/28/meaningful-vote-3-the-legal-implications-of-separating-the-withdrawal-agreement-and-the-political-declaration/ |website=publiclawforeveryone.com|publisher=Public Law for Everyone |date=28 March 2019 |access-date=12 April 2019}}</ref>

Once again, in a departure from parliamentary convention, rather than having MPs walk through lobbies to indicate their vote choice, all four votes took place simultaneously using ballot papers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Odell |first1=Mark |title=Speaker calls on MPs to vote |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3e128714-2db8-3286-8b30-f0ffa6661e26#post-24335 |website=Financial Times |access-date=2 April 2019 |date=1 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Cooper–Letwin Bill (3 April 2019) ===
{{main|European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019}}
Since none of the tabled propositions in the second round of indicative votes could command a majority in the House of Commons, a third round of indicative votes was planned to be held on 3 April.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.politico.eu/article/house-of-commons-rejects-all-brexit-options-again/ |title = House of Commons Rejects All Brexit Options - Again |date = 1 April 2019 |publisher = Politico Europe |access-date = 2 April 2019}}</ref> On the day of 3 April 2019, the House of Commons focused instead on debating the "European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 5) Bill". This bill was otherwise known as the Cooper–Letwin Bill, after its chief sponsors [[Yvette Cooper]] (Labour) and [[Oliver Letwin]] (Conservative). The bill places an obligation on the Government to seek consent for any or no extensions to the date of withdrawal from the EU. To do so, the House of Commons first debated a business of the House motion to allow the Bill to be brought in for debate on that day. There was one proposed amendment to the Business of the House motion, which would have sought to schedule more indicative votes for 8 April 2019; this failed in the first tied vote since [[Maastricht Rebels|1993]].<ref name="APAvert">{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/e6521ffd590e4b69bf023bbe3025e2a5|title=The Latest: UK lawmakers vote to avert 'no-deal' Brexit|website=APNews.com|publisher=Associated Press|date=3 April 2019|access-date=11 April 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

|}

The tie was broken by the Speaker in favour of "No" (in accordance with [[Speaker Denison's rule]]), meaning the motion was rejected. The lack of passage of this motion meant that no further indicative votes would be scheduled by the House of Commons to be held on 8 April 2019.<ref name="03-04ExtendIndicative">{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-votes/british-parliament-rejects-plan-to-hold-more-brexit-indicative-votes-on-monday-idUKKCN1RF26X|title=British parliament rejects plan to hold more Brexit indicative votes on Monday|last1=James|first1=William|last2=MacLellan|first2=Kylie|last3=MacAskill|first3=Andrew|website=[[Reuters.com]]|date=3 April 2019|access-date=3 April 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Prorogation of parliament===
{{main|2019 British prorogation controversy}}
[[Boris Johnson]], [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected Conservative Party leader]] in July, and invited by the Queen to become Prime Minister, announced on 28 August that he had requested the Queen to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] Parliament from between 9 September and 12 September until the beginning of a new session on 14 October. On the advice of the (minimally [[quorum|quorate]]) [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and in accordance with constitutional convention, the Queen granted this request the same day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/28/spending-review-set-for-next-week-fuels-election-speculation-live?page=with%3Ablock-5d668a668f08ea59f447a9f1|title=Suspension of parliament: MPs react with fury and Davidson set to quit after Johnson move – as it happened|last1=Perraudin|first1=Frances|date=2019-08-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-03|last2=Otte (later)|first2=Ben Quinn (earlier); Jedidajah|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Proctor|first3=Kate|last4=Weaver|first4=Matthew|last5=Carrell|first5=Severin}}</ref>

===Benn Bill (4 September 2019)===
{{main|European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019}}

Once Parliament reconvened from summer recess, Labour MP [[Hilary Benn]] presented a [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill 2019|bill]] that would rule out a unilateral no-deal Brexit by forcing the Government to reach an Agreement, get parliamentary approval for no-deal Brexit, or, if neither condition is fulfilled by 19 October, then extend the deadline until 31 January 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/09/02/world/europe/ap-eu-brexit-parliament.html|title=No-Deal?

On 3 September, [[Oliver Letwin]] submitted a motion for an emergency debate on this bill, in accordance with Standing Order No. 24. This motion, to allow the debate for the following day, passed, 328 to 301.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-02/what-is-the-so24-process-standing-order-24-emergency-debates/|title=Explained: The SO24 process which MPs could use to try to thwart Boris Johnson|website=ITV News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/02/what-is-standing-order-24-euronews-answers|title=What is Standing Order 24?|last=Crowcroft|first=Orlando|date=2019-09-02|website=euronews|language=en|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref> 21 Conservative MPs voted for the motion and were then removed from the Conservative whip and deselected for future elections, as Johnson had threatened to do in advance. The 21 MPs were [[Guto Bebb]], [[Richard Benyon]], [[Steve Brine]], [[Alistair Burt|Alastair Burt]], [[Greg Clark]], [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]], [[David Gauke]], [[Justine Greening]], [[Dominic Grieve]], [[Sam Gyimah]], [[Philip Hammond|Phillip Hammond]], [[Stephen Hammond]], [[Richard Harrington (politician)|Richard Harrington]], [[Margot James]], Letwin, [[Anne Milton]], [[Caroline Nokes]], [[Antoinette Sandbach]], [[Nicholas Soames]], [[Rory Stewart]] and [[Ed Vaizey]]. This, combined with [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee]]’s defection to the Liberal Democrats earlier that day, gave the Opposition a 43-seat majority over the Government.

On 20 December 2019, immediately after the state opening of Parliament following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]] (in which the Conservative Party secured a large majority of 80 seats), the Government presented another Bill to ratify its draft withdrawal agreement.
