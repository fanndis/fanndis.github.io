==Etymology==
[[File:Virginia Megaprojects Map.jpg|thumb|right|Northern Virginia [[megaproject]]s]]
The region is often spelled "northern Virginia", although according to the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] Correspondence Handbook the 'n' in Northern Virginia should be capitalized since it is a place name rather than a direction or general area; e.g. [[Eastern United States]] vs. [[western Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/431-2-h/chap5.html USGS Correspondence Handbook]</ref>

{{Quotation|
This monument, at the headspring of the Potomac River, marks one of the historic spots of America. Its name is derived from Thomas Lord Fairfax who owned all the land lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. The first Fairfax Stone, marked "FX", was set in 1746 by Thomas Lewis, a surveyor employed by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]]. This is the base point for the western dividing line between [[Maryland]] and [[West Virginia]].|Fairfax Stone inscription<ref name="johnston"/>}}

Early development of the northern portion of Virginia was in the easternmost area of that early land grant, which encompasses the modern counties of [[Lancaster County, Virginia|Lancaster]], [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland]], [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland]]. At some point, these eastern counties came to be called separately simply "the Northern Neck", and, for the remaining area west of them, the term was no longer used. (By some definitions, [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]] is also included in the [[Northern Neck]], which is now considered a separate region from Northern Virginia.<ref name=autogenerated1>The Official Guide of Virginia's Northern Neck (2007), Northern Neck Tourism Council</ref>)

One of the most prominent early mentions of "Northern Virginia" (sans the word ''Neck'') as a title was the naming of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

===Definition===
[[File:Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia CSA, 2005.png|thumb|right| A map of the former [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore-Washington-Northern Virginia]], DC-MD-VA-WV [[Combined Statistical Area]]]]
The most common definition of Northern Virginia includes the independent cities and counties on the Virginia side of the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area]] as defined by the [[Office of Management and Budget|U.S. Office of Management and Budget]]<ref name=":0" /> within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]].

Most narrowly defined, Northern Virginia consists of the counties of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William]], and [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford]] as well as the independent cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], and [[Manassas Park, Virginia|Manassas Park]].

Businesses, governments and non-profit agencies may define the area considered "Northern Virginia" differently for various purposes. Many communities beyond the areas closest to Washington, DC also have close economic ties, as well as important functional ones, to Northern Virginia, especially regarding roads, railroads, airports, and other transportation.

==History==

===Colonial period===
[[File:Northern Neck Proprietary map.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] land grant c. 1737]]
Historically, in the British [[Colony of Virginia]] first permanently settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607, the area now generally regarded as "Northern Virginia" was within a larger area defined by a land grant from King [[Charles II of England]] on September 18, 1649, while the monarch was in exile in France during the [[English Civil War]]. Eight of his loyal supporters were named, among them Thomas Culpeper.<ref name="fortedwards.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.fortedwards.org/fairfax.htm|title=Thomas, Lord Fairfax|publisher=The Fort Edwards WebPage|access-date=April 18, 2010}}</ref>

On February 25, 1673, a new charter was given to [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper|Thomas Lord Culpeper]] and [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Henry Earl of Arlington]]. Lord Culpeper was named the Royal Governor of Virginia from 1677 to 1683. [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper County]] was later named for him when it was formed in 1749; however, history does not seem to record him as one of the better of Virginia's colonial governors. Although he became governor of Virginia in July 1677,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_dEJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=colepepper+spencer+governors+virginia&source=web&ots=GJiCfGZPrc&sig=oA0YfZA_6kTyeP5lVmGMrCX5u50&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Grant of the Office of Lieutenant and Governor-General], June 21, 1675, Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, Great Britain Public Record Office, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1896</ref> he did not come to Virginia until 1679, and even then seemed more interested in maintaining his land in the "Northern Neck of Virginia" than governing. He soon returned to England.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_dEJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=%22nicholas+spencer%22+governor+colepepper&source=web&ots=GJiCfGQRt9&sig=nDyujqI3ZZKiFciaHHg5BoEtaNs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PRA2-PA689,M1 Letter from Nicholas Spencer to Secretary Thomas Coventry], August 20, 1680, reporting news of Culpeper's departure from Virginia, Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, Great Britain Public Record Office, Whitehall, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1890</ref> In 1682 rioting in the colony forced him to return, but by the time he arrived, the riots were already quelled. After apparently misappropriating £9,500 from the treasury of the colony, he returned to England and the King was forced to dismiss him. During this tumultuous time, Culpeper's erratic behavior meant that he had to rely increasingly on his cousin and Virginia agent, Col. [[Nicholas Spencer]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/historycolonyan00campgoog/page/n330 <!-- pg=336 quote=colpepper nicholas spencer virginia. --> History of the Colony and Ancient Dominion of Virginia, Charles Campbell, J.

Legal claim to the land was finally established by Lord Culpeper's grandson, [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who became well known in the colony as "Lord Fairfax", in a survey authorized by Governor [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]] in 1736.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The lands of Lord Fairfax (and Northern Virginia) were defined as that between the [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] and [[Potomac River|Potomac]] rivers, and were officially called the "Northern Neck".<ref>{{cite web

According to documents held by the Handley Regional Library of the [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]&ndash;[[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] Historical Society, the grants contained {{convert|5282000|acre|km2}}. They included the 22 modern counties of Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Stafford, King George, Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun, Fauquier, Rappahannock, Culpeper, Madison, Clarke, Warren, Page, Shenandoah, and Frederick counties in Virginia, and Hardy, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson counties in West Virginia.<ref name="records">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrl.lib.state.va.us/handley/archives/Fairfax%20Land%20Records%20pathfinder.htm|title=Lord Fairfax Land Records|publisher=Winchester-Frederick County Historical Society|access-date=April 18, 2010|location=Handley Regional Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001054056/http://www.hrl.lib.state.va.us/handley/archives/Fairfax%20Land%20Records%20pathfinder.htm|archive-date=October 1, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Lord Fairfax was a lifelong bachelor, and became one of the more well-known persons of the late colonial era. In 1742 the new county formed from [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]] was named [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] in his honor, one of numerous place names in Northern Virginia and West Virginia's [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]] which were named after him.<ref name="jdr library">{{cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/published/cw/viwc00324.document|title=A Guide to the Lord Thomas Fairfax land grant to Robert Carter|year=2008|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's John D.

Not long thereafter, he built a hunting lodge near the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] he named "Greenway Court",<ref name="fortedwards.org"/> which was located near [[White Post, Virginia|White Post]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]], and moved there. Around 1748 Lord Fairfax met a youth of 16 named [[George Washington]], and, impressed with his energy and talents, employed him to survey his lands lying west of the Blue Ridge.<ref name="fortedwards.org"/>

Lord Fairfax stayed neutral during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Just a few weeks after the surrender of British troops under [[General Cornwallis]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], he died at his home at Greenway Court on December 9, 1781, at the age of 90. He was entombed on the east side of Christ Church in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].<ref name="virginiaplaces.org"/> While his plans for a large house at Greenway Court never materialized, and his stone lodge is now gone, a small limestone structure he had built still exists on the site.<ref name="fortedwards.org"/>

===Statehood, Civil War===
[[File:MountVernonOctober2006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Vernon]], the plantation home of [[George Washington]]]]
Following the American Revolutionary War, when the [[thirteen colonies]] formed the United States of America, war hero and Virginian [[George Washington]] was the choice to become its first president. Washington had been a surveyor and developer of [[canal]]s for transportation earlier in the 18th century. He was also a great proponent of the bustling port city of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], which was located on the Potomac River below the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], not far from his plantation at [[Mount Vernon]] in Fairfax County.

With his guidance, a new federal city (now known as the [[District of Columbia]]) was laid out straddling the Potomac River upon a square of territory which was ceded to the federal government by the new states of Maryland and Virginia. Alexandria was located at the eastern edge south of the river. On the outskirts on the northern side of the river, another port city, [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], was located.

However, as the federal city grew, land in the portion contributed by Maryland proved best suited and adequate for early development, and the impracticality of being on both sides of the Potomac River became clearer. Not really part of the functioning federal city, many citizens of Alexandria were frustrated by the laws of the District government and lack of voting input. [[Slavery]] also arose as an issue. To mitigate these issues, and as part of a "deal" regarding abolishment of slave trading in the District, in 1846, the U.S. Congress passed a bill [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceding to Virginia]] the area south of the Potomac River, which was known as [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]]. That area now forms all of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] (which was renamed from Alexandria County in 1922) and a portion of the [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]].

Slavery, [[states' rights]], and economic issues increasingly divided the northern and southern states during the first half of the 19th century, eventually leading to the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. Although Maryland was a [[slave state]], it remained with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], while Virginia seceded and joined the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]], with its new capital established at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never issued a firm opinion on whether the retrocession of the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia was constitutional. In the 1875 case of ''[[Phillips v. Payne]]'', the Supreme Court held that Virginia had ''de facto'' jurisdiction over the area returned by Congress in 1847, and dismissed the tax case brought by the plaintiff. The court, however, did not rule on the core constitutional matter of the retrocession. Writing the majority opinion, [[Noah Haynes Swayne|Justice Noah Swayne]] stated only that:
<blockquote>The plaintiff in error is estopped from raising the point which he seeks to have decided. He cannot, under the circumstances, vicariously raise a question, nor force upon the parties to the compact an issue which neither of them desires to make.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/92/130.html |title=Phillips v. Payne, 92 U.S. 130 |year=1875 |publisher=FindLaw |access-date=March 7, 2017 }}</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Arlington House front view.JPG|thumb|[[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], a mansion commissioned by a step-grandson of George Washington, last used as a residence by [[Robert E. Lee]]]]
With barely {{convert|100|mi|km}} separating the two capital cities, Northern Virginia found itself in the center of much of the conflict. The area was the site of many battles and saw great destruction and bloodshed. The [[Army of Northern Virginia]] was the primary army for the [[Confederate States of America]] in the east. Owing to the region's proximity to Washington, D.C., and the Potomac River, the armies of both sides frequently occupied and traversed Northern Virginia. As a result, [[List of American Civil War battles in Northern Virginia|several battles were fought in the area]].

In addition, Northern Virginia was the operating area of the famed Confederate partisan, [[John S. Mosby|John Singleton Mosby]], and several small skirmishes were fought throughout the region between his Rangers and Federal forces occupying Northern Virginia.

Well after the war, the conflict remained popular among the region's residents, and many area schools, roads, and parks were named for Confederate generals and statesmen, for example [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] and [[Washington-Lee High School]].

Virginia split during the American Civil War, as was foreshadowed by the April 17, 1861, [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|Virginia Secession Convention]]. Fifty counties in the western, mountainous, portion of the state, who were, for the most part, against secession in 1861, would break away from the Confederacy in 1863 and enter the Union as a new state, [[West Virginia]]. Unlike the eastern part of the state, West Virginia did not have fertile lands tilled by slaves and was geographically separated from the state government in Richmond by the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  During this process, a provisional government of Virginia was headquartered in Alexandria, which was under Union control during the war.<ref>citation needed</ref> Notably, Arlington, Clarke, Fairfax, Frederick, Loudoun, Shenandoah, and Warren Counties voted in favor of Virginia remaining in the Union in 1861 but did not eventually break away from the state.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://collections.richmond.edu/secession/visualizations/vote-maps.html# | title=Virginia Convention of 1861 - Civil War Collections - University of Richmond}}</ref>

As a result of the formation of West Virginia, part of Lord Fairfax's colonial land grant which defined Northern Virginia was ceded in the establishment of that state in 1863. Now known as the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia]], the area includes [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]] and [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]].

NVRC's chief roles and functions have focused on providing information, performing professional and technical services for its members, and serving as a mechanism for regional coordination regarding the environment, transportation, affordable housing, community planning, military, and human services. Programs and projects address a wide array of local government interests.

According to Virginia's Regional Cooperation Act, NVRC is a political subdivision (a government agency) within the Commonwealth.  The region is technically referred to as Virginia's planning district #8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vapdc.org/|title=About VAPDC|website=Vapdc 080318|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> The commission was established pursuant to Articles 1 and 2, Chapter 34, of the Acts of the Virginia General Assembly of 1968, subsequently revised and re-enacted as the Regional Cooperation Act under Title 15.2, Chapter 42 of the Code of Virginia, hereinafter called the "Act", and by resolutions of the governing bodies of its constituent member governmental subdivision.  Any incorporated county, city or town in Northern Virginia may become a member of NVRC, provided the jurisdiction has a population of more than 3,500 and adopts and executes NVRC's Charter Agreement.

===Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments===

Northern Virginia constitutes a considerable portion of the population and number of jurisdictions that comprise the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (MWCOG). Founded in 1957, MWCOG is a regional organization of 22 Washington-area local governments, as well as area members of the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland]] and [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia]] state legislatures, the [[U.S. Senate]], and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. MWCOG provides a forum for discussion and the development of regional responses to issues regarding the environment, transportation, public safety, homeland security, affordable housing, community planning, and economic development.<ref>[http://www.mwcog.org/about/ MWCOG.org – About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, a component of MWCOG, is the federally designated [[metropolitan planning organization]] for the metropolitan Washington area, including Northern Virginia.<ref>[http://www.mwcog.org/transportation/tpb/ MWCOG.org – Transportation – TPB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

These population counts include all counties within Virginia that are part of the [[Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]] or the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area]] as defined by the [[Office of Management and Budget|U.S. Office of Management and Budget]]<ref name=":0">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/omb-bulletins.html | OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, Revised Delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and Guidance on Uses of the Delineations of These Areas</ref> within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]].

Of the 3,159,639 people in Northern Virginia in the 2019 estimates, 2,748,978 lived in "central" counties, or those counties and equivalent entities as delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as forming part of the urban core of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. These counties include [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier]], [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William]], [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford]] and the [[independent city (United States)|independent cities]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], and [[Manassas Park, Virginia|Manassas Park]].

An additional 410,661 people lived in counties of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area or the Baltimore-Washington Combined Statistical Area not considered "central." These counties, largely considered exurban or undergoing suburban change, include [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke]], [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper]], [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], [[Madison County, Virginia|Madison]], [[Rappahannock County, Virginia|Rappahannock]], [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania]], [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren]], and the independent cities of [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] and [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].

In addition, there are counties outside of the Washington Metropolitan Area that under more broad definitions are referred to as being part of Northern Virginia. The [[University of Virginia]] Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service categorizes [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]] as part of Northern Virginia, though the county was removed from the Washington Metropolitan Area in 2003.<ref>https://demographics.coopercenter.org/virginia-regions | University of Virginia, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service</ref> King George County and [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] also include areas, such as [[Lake of the Woods, Virginia|Lake of the Woods]], where the cross-commuting interchange with the Washington Metropolitan Area is high enough to merit inclusion in the Metropolitan Area,<ref>http://statchatva.org/files/2015/11/Commuting-1024x1024.jpg</ref> although more far-flung parts of these counties still cause the county-wide commuter interchange to fall below the threshold for inclusion in the Washington Metropolitan Area or Washington-Baltimore Combined Statistical Area. The demographic figures above do not include population counts for these two counties.

===Racial and ethnic composition===
The 2010 U.S. Census shows that the racial and ethnic makeup of the 2,230,623 people that reside in the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William as well as the cities of Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax, Manassas, and Manassas Park are as follows:

* 55.41% White

==Politics==

===Background===
From the mid-1880s until the mid-1960s Virginia politics were dominated by [[Conservative Democrat]]s. After World War I, under the leadership of [[Harry Flood Byrd]], who became [[Governor of Virginia]] and later a [[U.S. senator]], this group became known as the [[Byrd Organization]]. With a power base in a network of the constitutional officers of most of Virginia's counties, they controlled Virginia's state government. The Byrd Organization largely followed conservative and anti-debt principles espoused by Byrd, who had grown up in a rural setting during the fiscally stressed era following [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Although a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and an initial supporter of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Senator Byrd became a bitter opponent of the [[New Deal]] and related national policies, particularly those involving fiscal and social issues. He became Virginia's senior senator after the death of Senator [[Carter Glass]] of [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] in 1946.
[[File:2017.10.27.120606 King Street Alexandria Virginia USA.jpg|thumb|[[Alexandria, Virginia]], George Washington's adopted hometown.]]
The period following World War II saw substantial growth of Virginia's suburban areas, notably in the regions of Northern Virginia, Richmond, and [[Hampton Roads]]. The population became more diverse. People of the emerging middle class were increasingly less willing to accept the rural focus of the General Assembly, nor Byrd's extreme positions on public debt and social issues. The latter was nowhere more graphically illustrated than with Byrd's violent opposition to [[racial integration]] of the state's [[state school|public schools]]. His leadership in the failed policy of [[Massive Resistance]] to racial desegregation of the public schools and efforts to circumvent related rulings of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ultimately caused closure of some public schools in the state and alienated many middle class voters. The Byrd Organization had never been strong in Virginia's independent cities, and beginning in the 1960s, city and suburban factions increasingly supported efforts to make broad changes in Virginia. In this climate, the [[Republican Party of Virginia]] began making inroads.

Rulings by both state and federal courts that "Massive Resistance" was unconstitutional and a move to compliance with the court orders in early 1959 by Governor [[James Lindsay Almond Jr.]], and the General Assembly could be described as marking the Byrd Organization's "last stand", although the remnants of the Organization continued to wield power for a few years longer.<ref name="Glarud">{{cite journal |last=Glasrud |first=Bruce |date=May 1977  |title=The Crisis of Conservative Virginia: The Byrd Organization and the Politics of Massive Resistance (book review) |journal=The Journal of Southern History |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=324–325 |doi=10.2307/2207385 |publisher=The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 43, No. 2 |last2=Ely |first2=James W. |jstor=2207385}}</ref>

When Senator Byrd resigned in 1965 he was replaced by his son [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] in the [[U.S. Senate]]. However, the heyday of the Byrd Organization was clearly in the past, ending 80 years of domination of Virginia politics by the Conservative Democrats with the election of a Republican governor, [[Linwood Holton]], in 1969 for the first time in the 20th century, succeeding a longtime member of the Byrd Organization, Democrat [[Mills E. Godwin]]. To the amazement of many observers, Godwin changed parties and was elected again as governor in 1973, but as a Republican.

During the last quarter of the 20th century, Virginia's Republicans gained ground against the Democrats. Republican [[John Warner]] from Northern Virginia gained one of the seats in the U.S. Senate in 1978. After longtime state senator [[Douglas Wilder|L. Douglas Wilder]] became governor in 1989, the first African American to become a governor in the United States, Republicans subsequently gained control of the Governor's mansion after the 1993 election. Republicans finally gained control of the General Assembly in the 1999 elections.

For a number of years, the recurring Republican theme was to reduce waste in state government and taxes. However, this seemed to reach a peak during the administration of [[Jim Gilmore]], with a move to repeal an unpopular car tax accompanied by a failure to provide promised replacement funds to the counties, cities and towns. Subsequently, two Democrats were elected consecutively as governor, and control in the General Assembly shifted back to a more bipartisan balance of power. As governor, both [[Mark Warner]] and [[Tim Kaine]] were confronted with stabilizing state economics and dealing with a deteriorating transportation funding situation partially caused by the state's failure to index state fuel taxes to inflation, with a "cents per gallon" tax rate unchanged since the administration of Democratic Governor [[Gerald Baliles]] in 1986.

===21st-century politics===
[[File:Jim Webb, leaning against pillar, 2007.jpg|thumb|120px|Former Senator from Virginia Jim Webb]]
[[File:VA-districts-108.JPG|right|thumb|[[Virginia's congressional districts]] as of 2003.]]
[[File:Virginia Governor Election Results by County, 2005.svg|thumbnail|300px|Counties and cities in blue voted for Kaine while counties and cities in red supported Kilgore.]]
[[File:Virginia Governor Election Results by County, 2009.svg|thumbnail|300px|Counties and cities in red voted for McDonnell while counties and cities in blue supported Deeds. The counties of [[Fairfax county, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William]] (located in the northeastern part of the state), which, even though they have been trending Democratic in Presidential, U.S. Senatorial, U.S. House, and gubernatorial elections recently, voted for McDonnell (R). However Democrat Dave Marsden would win in a 2010 special state senate election to the seat previously held by former state Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] (R).]]
In the 21st century, Northern Virginia is becoming increasingly known for favoring candidates of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] at both the state and national level. Fairfax County supported [[John Kerry]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], and also voted heavily for [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], the first time a Democratic candidate for president carried the Commonwealth of Virginia since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. The area also voted for Democrats [[Jim Webb]] in 2006 for U.S. Senate, [[Tim Kaine]] in 2005 for governor, and [[Mark Warner]] in 2001 for governor. In these three races for statewide office, the margins tallied in Northern Virginia provided the Democratic candidate with a winning margin of victory.

Democrat Jim Webb defeated incumbent Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] by the slim margin of 49.6 to 49.2 percent in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sbe.virginiainteractive.org/nov2006/l_02.htm |title=General Election- November 7, 2006<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=November 16, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121122311/http://sbe.virginiainteractive.org/nov2006/l_02.htm |archive-date=November 21, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, that margin increased to 58.1 to 40.7 percent in favor of the Democratic challenger in the counties and cities of Northern Virginia, whereas Webb ran behind Allen somewhat, 46.1 to 52.7 percent, in the remainder of the commonwealth. Webb carried [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], as well as the more urban areas of [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]]. Allen's sole wins in Northern Virginia were the cities of [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] and [[Manassas Park, Virginia|Manassas Park]], winning the latter two only by the narrow margins of 3.54 and 2.38 percent, respectively.

In the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], 53 percent of Northern Virginia voters voted for [[John Kerry]], the Democratic candidate and 46 percent voted for [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate. This contrasted with the rest of Virginia, which gave 43 percent to Kerry and 56 percent to Bush. Kerry also carried [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], the most populous county in Virginia, and [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]], the first time those jurisdictions had voted Democratic since [[1964 United States presidential election|Johnson's national landslide in 1964]]. The strongest support in the area for the Democrats lies inside [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|the Beltway]], in Arlington, [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and parts of Fairfax County. The more distant areas (i.e., [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] and [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]) historically have been more conservative; however, as they have increased in population, they have become more liberal. Both Mark Warner in 2001 and John Kerry in 2004 lost Loudoun and Prince William counties. Tim Kaine won [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] counties in 2005. Tim Kaine won [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County in 2018]].<ref>https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/election-results-in-fredericksburg-region-reflect-suburban-rural-divide/article_e15de970-eb88-56b2-8d7f-1a93fe20ee06.html</ref> In 2006 despite not polling as strongly as Mark Warner statewide, Democratic senate candidate Jim Webb won both Loudoun and Prince William counties. In 2005, 65 percent of the voters of Northern Virginia voted for Democrat [[Tim Kaine]] for governor over [[Jerry Kilgore (politician)|Jerry Kilgore]], who received only 32 percent of the vote, easily 14 points lower than George W. Bush's showing only a year earlier.

The Democrats in Virginia also have made considerable gains in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] which helped turn both chambers of the state legislature to the Democrats. Since 2015 Democrats have flipped districts in the suburbs of Washington D.C in counties such as [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]]. These flips have shown the changing demographics, and voting bloc in these counties and the expansion of suburbanization and Northern Virginia. For example, the 28th district a seat held by Republicans since 1984 in Stafford County and parts of Fredericksburg and seat of former Republican Virginia Speaker of the House [[William J. Howell]]. 10 years ago Republicans won the Virginia House of Delegates election with 74% of the vote in the district. In the 2019 election [[Joshua G. Cole]], a fierce Democrat and supporter of the Green New Deal, flipped the district by 4 points. Another district the 2nd district that encompasses Prince William County and Stafford County was once a swing district held by both Republicans and Democrats. In 2017, Democrats flipped the district with 64% of the vote and was re-elected with 60% of the vote with [[Jennifer Caroll Foy]] a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment which she passed this year with the new Democratic trifecta in the state.

The [[Virginia's 1st congressional district|1st]], [[Virginia's 8th congressional district|8th]], the [[Virginia's 10th congressional district|10th]], and the [[Virginia's 11th congressional district|11th]] [[Virginia's congressional districts|congressional districts]] lie within Northern Virginia. The current congressman from the 1st district is [[Rob Wittman]] (R), from the 8th district is [[Don Beyer]] (D), the current congresswoman from the 10th district is [[Jennifer Wexton]] (D), and the current congressman from the 11th district is [[Gerry Connolly]] (D). Three of four districts voted for Jim Webb in the 2006 Senate election.

In the 2005 gubernatorial election, the entire region continued to move away from the Republicans. Fairfax County, Arlington County, the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax City, and Falls Church, and for the first time,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Loudoun County and Prince William County, went to Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate. The area continued to be more Democratic the closer it was to Washington, D.C., but Richmond resident Kaine was able to accomplish what Northern Virginian Mark Warner had been unable to do just four years earlier in 2001: carry Loudoun County and Prince William County (as well as win over 60 percent of the vote in Fairfax County).

In 2006 Democrat [[Mark Herring]] swept every precinct in the 33rd state Senate District on January 31, en route to beating Republican Loudoun County Supervisor Mick Staton by a margin of 62 to 38 percent, providing evidence for the claim that Loudoun is transforming into a liberal county.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The district sits primarily in Loudoun County but also includes nine precincts in western Fairfax County: Floris, Fox Mill, Frying Pan, McNair, Franklin, Kinross, Navy, Lees Corner East, and Lees Corner West.

In 2008 economist [[Nancy Pfotenhauer]], a spokesperson and adviser for the [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|John McCain presidential campaign]], created controversy by referring to the areas of Virginia not included in Northern Virginia as "real Virginia", picking up on a Republican [[talking point]] that [[Sarah Palin]] promoted; namely that red states are the "real America" and more "pro-America".<ref>{{Cite web

In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], the majority of Northern Virginia voters voted for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Over 70 percent of registered voters in Arlington, Alexandria and Falls Church voted for Obama.<ref name="cnn.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/county/#VAP00map | work=CNN | title=County Results - Election Center 2008 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com | access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Manassas and Prince William County also went to Obama, with Obama receiving 60 percent of the vote in Fairfax County compared to Republican candidate John McCain's 39 percent.<ref name="cnn.com"/> Obama's win in Fairfax County, the most populous county in the state, marks the second time a Democrat has carried that county since [[Solid South#Democratic factionalization over the Civil Rights Movement|the 1964 breakdown of Democratic predominance in the South]] (the other being the 2004 presidential elections when the county went to John Kerry). Obama's victory in Northern Virginia continues the trend of Northern Virginia favoring Democrats over Republicans.

In the [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009|2009 gubernatorial election]], though Arlington, Alexandria, and Falls Church would back Democratic [[Senate of Virginia|state Senator]] [[Creigh Deeds]] in his unsuccessful run for governor, Republican former state Attorney General, and future Governor, [[Bob McDonnell]], who overwhelmingly defeated Deeds 59 to 41 percent across the state as a whole, won Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Stafford County, Manassas, and Prince William County. However, a January 2010 special state senate election in the Fairfax county-based 37th State Senatorial district, which was held following [[Ken Cuccinelli]]'s (R) resignation from the [[Senate of Virginia]] upon his election as state attorney general two months earlier, was won by then-[[Virginia House of Delegates|Delegate]] [[David W. Marsden]] (D). Marsden's victory would suggest that despite McDonnell's performance in northern Virginia during the 2009 gubernatorial election, the Democratic trend in the region has not been reversed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/in_the_right/2010/01/virginia-special-election-send.html|title=Virginia Special Election Sends a Message to GOP|access-date=2010-02-13|publisher=The Economist Group|date=January 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116103718/http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/in_the_right/2010/01/virginia-special-election-send.html|archive-date=January 16, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Arlington, Clarke, Culpeper, Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, Loudoun, Prince William, Rappahannock, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Warren counties, as well as Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Winchester cities, form Northern Virginia's contribution to the Washington metropolitan area; [[Hillary Clinton]] received 849,758 votes compared to [[Donald Trump]]'s 503,120 votes in the twelve-county and seven-city region, a 63–37 percent split in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. Despite the 26 percent margin of victory for Clinton, seven counties voted for Trump.

==Culture==
Due to the proximity to the capital, many Northern Virginians go to Washington, D.C., for cultural outings and nightlife. The [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington is a popular place for performances, as is [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] near [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]]. [[Jiffy Lube Live]] (near [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]]), [[EagleBank Arena]] at [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], and [[Capital One Arena]] in Washington serve as popular concert venues, and Capital One Arena also serves as the home of sporting events. [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] museums also serve as local cultural institutions with easy proximity to Northern Virginia, and the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center|Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Chantilly is popular as well.

[[Tysons, Virginia|Tysons]] itself is the 12th largest business district in the United States.<ref>Tysons Regional Chamber of Commerce, [http://www.tysonschamber.org/our-community/, "Our Community"]</ref>{{better source|date=September 2014}}  Other malls include [[Springfield Mall (Virginia)|Springfield Mall]], [[Fair Oaks Mall]], Manassas Mall, [[Spotsylvania Towne Centre]] which has a mall and a mixed-use retail and commercial area, and [[The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City]]. [[Dulles Town Center]] is the region's newest mall, serving the eastern [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]] area. [[Reston Town Center]] is a high-density mixed-use retail, commercial, and residential development located just off the 267 Toll Road in [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]]. [[Potomac Mills (shopping mall)|Potomac Mills]], located in Prince William County, is the largest [[outlet mall]] in the region. The town of [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] in Loudoun County contains the Leesburg Corner Premium Outlets outlet mall.

Since the mid-1990s, Loudoun County and has been known as America's fastest-growing county, having grown by almost 50 percent from 2000 though 2005. Stafford County is also one of the fastest-growing counties in the country. Stafford County according to a Census Bureau report was the sixth highest-income county.<ref>[[Stafford County, Virginia]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2020}} Since the 2000 census, both Loudoun and Fairfax counties are the [[Highest-income counties in the United States|top large U.S. counties]] by median household income. Loudoun County has branches of at least five higher education institutions.

===Recreation===
Northern Virginia is home to many activities for families and individuals, including biking/walking trails, sports leagues, recreation facilities, museums, historic homes, and parks.

It is home to the [[Northern Virginia Swim League]], which comprises 102 community pools, and NVSL-Dive, which is composed of 47 teams in Fairfax and Arlington counties. The swim and dive teams compete over the course of 5–6 weeks from the end of June through the first weekend in August.

The National Capital Area Council operates in the D.C Area. It serves localities in the Washington D.C Metropolitan Area. In Northern Virginia, it has chapters and divisions that serve, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Stafford County, Arlington County, the City of Alexandria, and the City of Fairfax. It also serves Caroline County, the City of Fredericksburg, and Spotsylvania County. 


The National Capital Soccer League serves soccer leagues and associations in the Washington D.C Metropolitan Area. It includes Northern Virginia soccer associations in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Stafford County, Arlington County, the City of Fredericksburg, the City of Alexandria, the City of Fairfax, and one soccer association in Culpeper County, Winchester, and Warrenton.

===Secession===

Former Republican delegate [[Jeannemarie Devolites Davis]] expressed a common sentiment when she said "The formula for funding school construction in Northern Virginia requires that we pay 500 percent more than the actual cost of a project. We have to pay 500 percent because we give 400 percent away to the rest of the state." The state government's funding level for transportation projects in Northern Virginia is a perennial issue that often causes consternation from the region's politicians and citizens.<ref name="washingtonian">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/9947.html|title=Will Northern Virginia Become the 51st State?|last=Lindsay|first=Drew|date=November 1, 2008|magazine=The Washingtonian|access-date=April 18, 2010}}</ref>

Many people consider the idea of secession a rhetorical one used to express frustration with the treatment of Northern Virginia by the state government as well as the opposing political sentiments between it and the rest of Virginia. Critics often point out that all states include regions of varying income and political discrepancies within their borders. Nevertheless, the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., are often seen as an extension of the more urbanized Mid-Atlantic, north-east, and the Boston-Washington corridor, even though Virginia as a whole is considered a Southern state. This perception is especially fueled by the region's closeness to Washington, D.C., large numbers of Northern transplants, and the prevalence of both new immigrant communities and growing ethnic diversity.

A tongue in cheek editorial in a [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] weekly paper suggested the rest of Virginia would like to separate Northern Virginia from the remainder of the commonwealth.<ref name="fredericksburg.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2002/032002/03032002/536977/index_html| title=A solution to Northern Virginia's many problems: Forced secession| last=Johnson| first=Jonnie| date=March 3, 2002| publisher=Fredericksburg.com| access-date=April 18, 2010}}</ref> Nevertheless, there is no serious secessionist movement.<ref name="Virginia Places">{{cite news| url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/regions/index.html| title=Why Isn't There An East Virginia| last=Wiencek |first=Drew| date=June 3, 2003| publisher=Virginia Places| access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

The area has two major airports, [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. While flights from the older National Airport (a hub for [[American Airlines]]) are restricted for distance, frequency, and flight paths due to the proximity to federal facilities, Dulles is the region's second busiest airport<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/bwi-reagan-national-airports-set-records-for-passenger-traffic/2017/04/01/276d5d0c-1572-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803054752/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/bwi-reagan-national-airports-set-records-for-passenger-traffic/2017/04/01/276d5d0c-1572-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html |archive-date=August 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in both passenger loadings and aircraft movements, and the sixteenth-busiest airport<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/busiest_airports/index.cfm?airportType%3DAll%26year%3D2007 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605061605/http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/busiest_airports/index.cfm?airportType=All&year=2007 |archive-date=June 5, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> in the United States by takeoffs and landings in 2007. Dulles is the region's primary international gateway, serves as a hub for [[United Airlines]], and has recently improved its low-cost carrier offerings with the addition of multiple flights by [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[JetBlue]].

Commuters are served by the [[Washington Metro]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] and the [[Virginia Railway Express]], a [[commuter railroad]].

Major limited- or partially limited-access highways include Interstates 495 (the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]), [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|95]], [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia–Virginia)|395]], and [[Interstate 66|66]], the [[Fairfax County Parkway]] and adjoining [[Franconia–Springfield Parkway]], the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and the [[Virginia State Route 267|Dulles Toll Road]]. [[High-occupancy vehicle]] (HOV) lanes are used for commuters and buses on I-66, I-95/395, and the Dulles Toll Road. A study done by INRIX Roadway Analytics ranked Southbond I-95 from Washington D.C to the southern tip of Stafford County the worst single traffic hotspot in the nation. It also ranked Northbond I-95 from Spotsylvania County to the northern tip of Stafford County the seventh worst traffic hotspot in the nation.<ref>https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/transportation/d-c--to-stafford-stretch-of-i-95-tabbed-worst-traffic-hotspot-in-u/article_b094fa03-527a-5826-bba5-de7e24810b69.html</ref> Northern Virginia is also home to the Express Lanes. These express lanes are where a car has a transbonder and is charged for riding a distance on the express lanes. They are currently being built on I-66, and are currently available on I-395, I-495 from the Springfield Interchange to Tysons Corner but are being extended to the Maryland-Virginia border, and I-95 from the end of I-395(Springfield Interchange) to central Stafford County and are being extended to Fredericksburg.

Two major regional bottlenecks, the [[Springfield Interchange]] and [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]], were massively reconstructed with completion in 2007 and 2008. Generally, Potomac River crossings remain major choke points; proposals to add crossings (such as near [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] or [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]] as part of a long-proposed [[Washington Outer Beltway|Outer Beltway]]) are opposed by Virginia communities near the suggested bridge sites, and by Marylanders who fear that new bridges would bring new housing development to green space in that state such as [[Poolesville]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Because of Northern Virginia's high housing costs, tens of thousands of employees there choose more affordable housing far away in outer Virginia exurban counties, or in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Southern Maryland]], thus creating tremendous traffic congestion on the Potomac bridges. This situation is much like metropolitan areas of California. Furthermore, Fairfax County localities such as [[Great Falls, Virginia|Great Falls]], [[Dranesville, Virginia|Dranesville]], and [[Clifton, Virginia|Clifton]] impose low-density, large-acreage residential zoning, which forces developers to leapfrog into Loudoun and Prince William counties to build housing, thus increasing commuters' driving distances. In recent years, developers have continued to develop in Loudoun County but have filled Prince William County. Therefore, many developers have been moving south to Stafford County where local government has been more reluctant to developments.

==Education==
[[File:GMU fall.JPG|thumb|right|[[George Mason University]], the largest university in the state by student population.]]
[[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]'s [[Fairfax County Public Schools|public school system]] includes the [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]], an award-winning [[magnet school]]. Nineteen of the region's schools appear in the top 200 of ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'}}s 'America's Top Public High Schools', and Thomas Jefferson is ranked number one.<ref name="americatop">[http://www.newsweek.com/topic/high-schools America's Top Public High Schools]</ref> In comparison, Washington, D.C., Maryland, and the rest of Virginia have 10 schools between them in the top 200.<ref name="americatop"/>

Although Northern Virginia contains a large portion of the commonwealth's population, there are only a handful of colleges and universities in the region. The largest and most well-known is [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], the largest public university in Virginia.

Other higher education institutions include [[Northern Virginia Community College]] (colloquially known as NOVA) in [[Annandale, Virginia|Annandale]] (with several branch campuses throughout Northern Virginia), the [[University of Mary Washington]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], [[Patrick Henry College]] in [[Purcellville, Virginia|western Loudoun County]], and [[Marymount University]] in north Arlington. In addition, the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Virginia Tech]] maintain a Center in Falls Church, and [[George Washington University]] has a campus in Loudoun County. [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] Health Systems has a satellite campus in Fairfax at the INOVA healthcare system.
