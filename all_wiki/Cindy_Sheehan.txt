'''Cindy Lee Miller Sheehan''' (born July 10, 1957) is an American anti-war activist, whose son, [[U.S. Army]] [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Casey Sheehan, was [[killed in action|killed by enemy action]] during the [[Iraq War]]. She attracted national and international media attention in August 2005 for her extended antiwar protest at a [[Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas|makeshift camp]] outside President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Prairie Chapel Ranch|Texas ranch]]—a stand that drew both passionate support and criticism. Sheehan ran unsuccessfully for [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2008. She was a vocal critic of President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|foreign policy]]. Her memoir, ''Peace Mom: A Mother's Journey Through Heartache to Activism'', was published in 2006. In an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' in 2017, Sheehan continued to hold her critical views towards George W. Bush, while also criticizing the militarism of [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Matt |title=Cindy Sheehan: 'Bush Was No Better' Than Donald Trump |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/cindy-sheehan-bush-was-no-better-than-donald-trump |access-date=8 January 2019 |work=The Daily Beast |date=24 October 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

==Casey Sheehan==
[[File:Casey Sheehan.jpg|thumb|Casey Sheehan]]
Casey Austin Sheehan (May 29, 1979 – April 4, 2004) was a [[specialist (rank)|specialist]] in the [[United States Army]] who was killed during combat action while serving in the Iraq War. He was the son of Patrick Sheehan, a sales representative, and Cindy Sheehan.

===Military service===
In May 2000, Casey Sheehan enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, [[List of United States Army MOS#CMF 63 - Mechanical Maintenance|MOS 63B]]. It has been reported that he may have considered enlisting as a chaplain assistant
[[List of United States Army MOS#Chaplain Branch|MOS 56M]]. <!-- citation overlinked --> (Sheehan had acted as an [[altar server]] during the [[Palm Sunday]] mass on the morning of his death).<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42498-2005Feb21.html For Some, a Loss in Iraq Turns Into Antiwar Activism: Gold Star Families Band Together to 'Make People Care'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 22, 2005</ref>

Near the end of his active service, the U.S. invasion of [[Iraq]] began. Sheehan reenlisted, knowing that his unit would be sent there.<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=1860 Cindy Sheehan Has an Agenda], ''American Chronicle''</ref> Sheehan's division, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry Division]], was sent to Iraq. On March 19, 2004, Sheehan's Battery C, 1st Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery Regiment]], arrived at [[Forward Operating Base|FOB]] [[Camp War Eagle]] in [[Sadr City]]. On April 4, 2004, Sheehan was killed in action after volunteering to be part of a [[Quick Reaction Force]] to rescue American troops in the "Black Sunday" incident that began the [[Siege of Sadr City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/inside-ambush-black-sunday/story?id=50962302|title=Inside the ambush known as Black Sunday|website=ABC News}}</ref>

===Burial===
Casey Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in [[Vacaville, California]]. In May 2006, the tombstone that Casey's family had been designing and commissioned was finally ready and placed at Casey's grave. Cindy Sheehan paid for the tombstone herself, which is normally the case, stating, "It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one.... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with." Cindy Sheehan maintains that the U.S. government "should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death." The Sheehan family did not want the furnished monument that the government provides because it didn't reflect Casey's entire life or personality.

===Legacy===
Casey Sheehan was awarded the [[Purple Heart]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with V for Valor posthumously for his actions April 4, 2004.<ref name=Black5>[http://www.blackfive.net/main/2005/08/army_specialist.html Army Specialist Casey Sheehan - Someone You Should (Have) Know(n)], ''[[Blackfive]] blog''</ref>  The chapel at [[Fort Hood]] started a new [[Knights of Columbus]] chapter that was named the Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan Council.<ref>[http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/081305B.shtml Mother's Vigil Recalls Quiet, Dedicated Son] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519215203/http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/081305B.shtml |date=May 19, 2008 }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', August 13, 2005</ref>  His mother, Cindy Sheehan, became a prominent antiwar activist after his death.

==Antiwar campaign==
Cindy Sheehan said that she initially questioned the urgency of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] but did not become active in the antiwar effort until after her son's death.<ref name=buzzflash410>{{cite web| url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/10/int04050.html| publisher=BuzzFlash| work=BuzzFlash Interviews| title=Cindy Sheehan Is Working To Bring Our Troops Home: "Mr. President.

Bush]] in June 2004 at [[Fort Lewis]], near [[Tacoma, Washington]], about three months after her son's death. In a June 24, 2004, interview with the [[The (Vacaville) Reporter|Vacaville ''Reporter'']], published soon after the meeting, she stated, "We haven't been happy with the way the war has been handled. The president has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached." She also stated that President Bush was "sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis. I know [he] feels pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of God."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Henson | first = David | title = Bush, Sheehans share moments | newspaper = [[The Reporter (Vacaville)|The Reporter]] | location = Vacaville, CA | date = 2004-06-24 }}</ref>

Sheehan gave another interview on October 4, 2004, stating that she did not understand the reasons for the Iraq invasion and never thought that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States. She further stated that her son's death had compelled her to speak out against the war.<ref name=buzzflash410 />

For the [[Second inauguration of George W. Bush|presidential inauguration in January 2005]], Sheehan traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak at the opening of "Eyes Wide Open: the Human Cost of War," a traveling exhibition created by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] that displays pairs of combat boots to represent U.S. military casualties.<ref name="Buzzflash02-05">{{cite web| url=http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/05/02/con05067.html| first=Cindy| last=Sheehan| publisher=BuzzFlash| work=BuzzFlash Reader Contribution| title=1492 Empty Pairs of Boots| date=2005-02-28| access-date=2007-04-08| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329131333/http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/05/02/con05067.html| archive-date=2007-03-29| url-status=dead}}</ref> She also traveled with the exhibition to other locations and donated her son Casey's boots, stating, "Behind these boots is one broken-hearted family."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2107 |title=Anti-war memorial stirring passions among parents |publisher=Catholicpeacefellowship.org |date=2005-03-10 |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/03/26/BAGTBBV26U1.DTL| first=Joe| last=Garofoli| publisher=San Francisco Chronicle| title = Empty boots are silent testament to war's toll| date=2005-03-26| access-date=2007-04-08}}</ref>

Sheehan was one of the nine founding members of [[Gold Star Families for Peace]], an organization she created in January 2005 with other families she met at the inauguration. It seeks to end [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|U.S. presence in Iraq]], and provides support for families of soldiers killed in Iraq.<ref name="Buzzflash02-05"/><ref>Joshua Frank, [http://www.counterpunch.org/frank10032005.html An Interview with Cindy Sheehan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907150803/http://www.counterpunch.org/frank10032005.html |date=2009-09-07 }}, [[CounterPunch]], October 3, 2005.</ref>

Sheehan gained international attention in early August 2005, when she traveled to President Bush's [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]], just outside [[Crawford, Texas]], demanding a second meeting with the President.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/06/AR2005080601337.html| work=The Washington Post |title= Mother of Fallen Soldier Protests at Bush Ranch| date=2005-08-07| access-date=2011-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.veteransforpeace.org/convention05/sheehan_transcript.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101054305/http://www.veteransforpeace.org/convention05/sheehan_transcript.htm| archive-date=2006-11-01| title= Cindy Sheehan Address Veterans For Peace Convention, August 5, 2005| access-date=August 22, 2011}}</ref> She told members of [[Veterans for Peace]], "I'm gonna say, 'And you tell me, what the noble cause is that my son died for.' And if he even starts to say freedom and democracy, I'm gonna say, bullshit. You tell me the truth. You tell me that my son died for oil. You tell me that my son died to make your friends rich.... You tell me that, you don't tell me my son died for freedom and democracy." She also vowed not to pay her federal income tax for 2004 because that was the year her son was killed.

===Tax position===
In 2012, Sheehan was sued by the federal government for failure to pay back taxes. "I feel like I gave my son to this country in an illegal and immoral war. I'll never get him back," Sheehan said. "And, so, if they can give me my son back, then I'll pay my taxes. And that's not going to happen."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/22/us/california-sheehan-taxes/index.html |title=Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan won't pay back taxes |date= 2012-02-22|access-date=2012-02-22 |work=CNN}}</ref>

===Camp Casey===
{{Main|Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas}}
On August 6, 2005, Sheehan arrived at the [[Crawford Peace House]] on a bus full of combat veterans, including Desert Storm Veteran Dennis Kyne and [[Camilo Mejía]]. They marched along a dirt road in the direction of The Bush Ranch. Stalled by law enforcement from walking all the way to the front door because the group refused to march as ordered in the Barr ditch, she created a makeshift camp that would be remembered as the “ditch.”  Three miles (5&nbsp;km) from President Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas, Sheehan announced her intention to stay (sleeping in a [[Shelter-half|pup tent]] at night) until she was granted a face-to-face meeting with the president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=1&nid=7708|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624205253/http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=1&nid=7708|url-status=dead|title=Mom of soldier killed in Iraq stages protest near Bush's ranch|archive-date=June 24, 2007}}</ref> Sheehan started her protest the day the president started a planned five-week vacation. The encampment was publicized widely on behalf of Gold Star Families for Peace and [[Military Families Speak Out]]. A few days later, the media began referring to Sheehan's camp as "[[Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas|Camp Casey]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.khou.com/news/state/stories/khou050808_gj_outwornwelcome.54eae939.html |title=Grieving mom may have worn out welcome outside Bush's ranch |access-date=2010-04-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080324012123/http://www.khou.com/news/state/stories/khou050808_gj_outwornwelcome.54eae939.html |archive-date = March 24, 2008}}</ref> [[Image:CindySheehanSupportRally08-17-05.JPG|right|thumb|Members of White House vigil on August 17, 2005 in support of Cindy Sheehan's protest at President Bush's Crawford ranch]]

Sheehan spent most of the next four weeks in Crawford. On some days as many as 1,500 supporters visited Camp Casey,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050813/APN/508130949&cachetime=3&template=dateline |title=Tuscaloosa News |publisher=Tuscaloosa News |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref> including members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], as well as several notable actors, singers, and [[civil rights]] activists.

Gold Star Families for Peace, of which Sheehan is a founding member, released a TV commercial featuring Sheehan, broadcast on Crawford and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] cable channels near Bush's ranch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/archive/2005/08/gold-star-families-for-pe_5552.html |title=Gold Star Families For Peace Launches New Ad Supporting Cindy Sheehan |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2005-08-12 |access-date=2010-04-10 |first=Alex |last=MacCallum}}</ref> The group conducted a walk to a police station just outside Bush's ranch and delivered a bundle of oversized letters written by them to First Lady [[Laura Bush]], appealing to her as a mother to support their movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&biid=2005082014748 |title=Please Convince the President, First Lady Laura Bush |publisher=English.donga.com |date=2005-08-20 |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref>

On August 16, Sheehan moved her camp closer to the Bush ranch after being offered the use of a piece of land owned by a supporter, Fred Mattlage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Angela |title=Neighbor Allows War Protesters to Camp on his Land |work=Common Dreams.org / AP |date=2005-08-17 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0817-06.htm |access-date=2011-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617011936/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0817-06.htm |archive-date=2013-06-17 }}</ref>

In late August, Sheehan stated that she would continue to campaign against the Iraq war even if granted a meeting with Bush. She also announced the [[Bring Them Home Now Tour]], to depart on September 1 and arrive in Washington, D.C., on September 24 for three days of demonstrations. The tour, which covered 42 cities in 26 states, was publicized by the Mintwood Media Collective, and garnered international media coverage. On the third day, Sheehan and about 370 other antiwar activists were arrested for demonstrating on the White House sidewalk.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092600143.html "White House Sidewalk Protest Leads to Arrest of About 370"], Washington Post, September 27, 2005</ref>

Sheehan's actions led supporters such as [[Lennox Yearwood|Rev. Lennox Yearwood]], CEO of the [[Hip Hop Caucus]], to describe her as "the [[Rosa Parks]] of the antiwar movement."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bloggernews.net/showstory.asp?page=blognews/stories/UP0000471.txt| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509222713/http://www.bloggernews.net/showstory.asp?page=blognews%2Fstories%2FUP0000471.txt| archive-date=2006-05-09| title=Cindy Sheehan's Iraq War Protest: A Woman Scorned| access-date=2011-08-22| url-status=dead}}</ref> Sheehan also gained the label of "Peace Mom" from the mainstream media.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/08/18/crawford.protest/| first=Bash, Dana| last=Meucci, Jason| publisher=CNN| title=Sheehan leaves antiwar camp| date=2005-08-19| access-date=2007-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Sean Alfano |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/22/politics/main789375.shtml |title=Joan Baez Joins Peace Mom's Cause |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2005-08-22 |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-24-peacemom-returns_x.htm?csp=34 |title='Peace Mom' returns to Texas to continue anti-war protest |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-08-24 |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref>

On July 5, Sheehan appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' to discuss the war and her upcoming hunger strike.

However, on July 3, 2007, in response to President Bush's [[clemency|commutation]] of [[Scooter Libby]]'s sentence, she announced her return to activism.<ref>U.S. Conflicts in the 21st Century: Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and the War on Terror [3 volumes]: Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and the War on Terror, Spencer C.

In August 2009, Sheehan protested at [[Martha's Vineyard]] during President [[Barack Obama]]'s stay there. According to [[ABC News]]: "Sheehan invoked Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]'s passing as part of her message, noting that he was firmly antiwar and how he said his proudest vote as a senator was his 2002 vote against the Iraq war."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/cindy-sheehan-brings-antiwar-antiobama-message-to-marthas-vineyard.html |title=Cindy Sheehan Brings Anti-War, Anti-Obama Message to Martha's Vineyard - Political Punch |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-08-27 |access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref> On October 5, 2009, Sheehan was arrested with 60 others at the White House protesting President Obama's continuation of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On March 20, 2010, Sheehan was again arrested in front of the White House, along with seven others, after they refused to listen to orders by officers of the [[United States Park Police]] to clear the sidewalk on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]].<ref name="march2010">{{cite news|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/03/ap_iraq_war_protests_032010/|title=Thousands rally on anniversary of Iraq invasion|last=Barakat|first=Matthew|date=21 March 2010|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Marine Corps Times]]|access-date=22 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714034338/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/03/ap_iraq_war_protests_032010/|archive-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> On July 12, Sheehan and four other activists were on trial in the Superior Court of the [[District of Columbia]] stemming from the arrests. The government decided not to try three others arrested that day, and had their cases dismissed.

In October 2011, Sheehan was arrested in Sacramento as part of an [[Occupy movement in the United States|anti–Wall Street movement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/anti-war-activist-cindy-sheehan-18-other-wall-street-protesters-arrested-in-sacramento/2011/10/16/gIQAkm1KpL_story.html|title=Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, 18 other Wall Street protesters arrested in Sacramento|work=The Washington Post|access-date=20 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209122812/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/anti-war-activist-cindy-sheehan-18-other-wall-street-protesters-arrested-in-sacramento/2011/10/16/gIQAkm1KpL_story.html|archive-date=9 December 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Although Sheehan agreed to stand as the vice presidential nominee of the [[Socialist Party USA]] for the 2012 elections, the party's national convention voted on October 15, 2011, to block her candidacy, on the official grounds that she was not a member of the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialist-tea.com/2011/10/19/how-the-spusa-2012-ticket-came-to-be|title=How the SPUSA 2012 Ticket came to be|publisher=www.socialist-tea.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308150628/http://www.socialist-tea.com/2011/10/19/how-the-spusa-2012-ticket-came-to-be|archive-date=March 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The nomination went to [[Alejandro Mendoza]], of Texas.

In 2017, when President [[Donald Trump]] was expected to announce the sending of thousands of additional troops, Sheehan fears that more opposition to the war will be only because of who occupies the presidency, stating, "If Trump announces that there will be a continued U.S. military presence or an increased presence, I am afraid any opposition from the 'left' will only be anti-Trump, because, of course, Obama escalated in Afghanistan and maintained that illegal war for the entire eight years of his presidency with not a peep from those same pro-DNC forces." Additionally, she believes "nothing but total withdrawal to give the people of Afghanistan autonomy over their own country will be acceptable" but said that she's concerned about the sincerity of possible protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/antiwar-activists-seek-boost-from-trumps-afghanistan-announcement|title=Antiwar activists seek boost from Trump's Afghanistan announcement|date=21 August 2017|website=Washington Examiner}}</ref>

In the summer of 2012, television personality [[Roseanne Barr]] named Sheehan as her [[running mate]] for the presidential nomination of the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]].

==2014 California gubernatorial candidacy and campaign==

On March 12, 2013 [[Marsha Feinland]], state chair of California's [[Peace and Freedom Party]], made the announcement that the central committee of the party had unanimously endorsed Cindy Sheehan for [[Governor of California]] in the [[2014 California gubernatorial election|2014 election]], should Sheehan choose to run.

Cindy Sheehan formally announced her campaign for Governor of California at a news conference Tuesday, August 27, 2013 at the State Capitol in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

Sheehan said she planned to unseat incumbent Gov. [[Jerry Brown]], and to bring California "peace, economic equality and environmental sustainability," and reforms through an EPIC (End Poverty in California) program.  Her EPIC campaign harkened to the [[End Poverty in California movement]] campaign of the [[1934 California gubernatorial candidate]] [[Upton Sinclair]]. Sinclair garnered 879,537 votes in that race.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Democratic Primary, 1934|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=103765|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>
