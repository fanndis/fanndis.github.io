<!-- [[Name of Hong Kong]] redirects here -->
The name of the territory, first romanised as "He-Ong-Kong" in 1780,<ref>{{harvnb|Empson|1992|p=94}}.</ref> originally referred to a small [[inlet]] located between [[Ap Lei Chau|Aberdeen Island]] and the southern coast of Hong Kong Island. [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]] was an initial point of contact between British sailors and local fishermen.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|Roberts|1997|p=218}}.</ref> Although the source of the romanised name is unknown, it is generally believed to be an early phonetic rendering of the [[Cantonese]] pronunciation ''hēung góng''. The name translates as "fragrant harbour" or "incense harbour".<ref name="HerbariumName" /><ref name="CarrollHKName" /><ref name="etym">{{harvnb|Room|2005|p=168}}.</ref> "Fragrant" may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour's freshwater influx from the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] or to the odour from incense factories lining the coast of northern [[Kowloon]]. The incense was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before Victoria Harbour developed.<ref name="etym" /> [[John Francis Davis|Sir John Davis]] (the second colonial governor) offered an alternative origin; Davis said that the name derived from "Hoong-keang" ("red torrent"), reflecting the colour of soil over which a waterfall on the island flowed.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1841|p=6}}.</ref>

The simplified name ''Hong Kong'' was frequently used by 1810.<ref>{{harvnb|Empson|1992|p=96}}.</ref> The name was also commonly written as the single word ''Hongkong'' until 1926, when the government officially adopted the two-word name.<ref>{{harvnb|Hong Kong Government Gazette|1926}}, No. 479.</ref> Some corporations founded during the early colonial era still keep this name, including [[Hongkong Land]], [[Hongkong Electric Company]], [[Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels]] and [[the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC).<ref>{{harvnb|HSH Annual Report|2017|p=6}}.</ref><ref name="HSBC">{{harvnb|HSBC Annual Report|2011|p=2}}.</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Hong Kong|History of China}}

Earliest known human traces in Hong Kong are dated by some to 35,000 and 39,000 years ago during the [[Paleolithic]] period. The claim is based on an archaeological investigation in [[Wong Tei Tung]], [[Sai Kung Peninsula|Sai Kung]] in 2003. The archaeological works revealed [[knapped]] [[stone tools]] from deposits with an optical [[luminescence dating]] between 35,000 and 39,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Macau Inter University Institute, China|last2=Davis|first2=Vin|last3=Ixer|first3=Rob|date=2009|title=The Petrology of the Wong Tei Tung Stone Tool Manufacturing Site, Sham Chung, Hong Kong Sar, China|url=http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue26/davisixer_index.html|journal=Internet Archaeology|issue=26|doi=10.11141/ia.26.8}}</ref>

During the [[Middle Neolithic]] period, about 6,000 years ago, the region had been widely occupied by humans.<ref name="Meacham2">{{harvnb|Meacham|1999|p=2}}.</ref> Neolithic to Bronze Age Hong Kong settlers were semi-coastal people. Early inhabitants are believed to be [[Austronesians]] in the [[Middle Neolithic]] period and later the [[Yueh]]{{dn|date=December 2020}} people.<ref name="Meacham2" /> As hinted by the archaeological works in [[Sha Ha]], Sai Kung, rice cultivation had been introduced since [[Late Neolithic]] period.<ref name="Li38">{{harvnb|Li|2012|p=38}}.</ref> Bronze Age Hong Kong was featured with [[coarse pottery]], [[hard pottery]], quartz and stone jewelry, as well as small bronze implements.<ref name="Meacham2" />

The [[Qin dynasty]] incorporated the Hong Kong area into China for the first time in 214 BCE, after [[Qin campaign against the Yue tribes|conquering the indigenous Baiyue]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ban|Ban|Ban|111}}.</ref> The region was consolidated under the [[Nanyue]] kingdom (a predecessor state of Vietnam) after the Qin collapse<ref name="KeatGinOoi">{{harvnb|Keat|2004|p=932}}.</ref> and recaptured by China after the [[Han conquest of Nanyue|Han conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=9}}.</ref> During the [[Mongol conquest of Song China|Mongol conquest of China]] in the 13th century, the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song]] court was briefly located in modern-day [[Kowloon City]] (the [[Sung Wong Toi]] site) before its final defeat in the 1279 [[Battle of Yamen]].<ref name="Barber">{{harvnb|Barber|2004|p=48}}.</ref> By the end of the [[Yuan dynasty]], seven large families had settled in the region and owned most of the land. Settlers from nearby provinces migrated to Kowloon throughout the [[Ming dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=10}}.</ref>

The earliest European visitor was [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Jorge Álvares]], who arrived in 1513.<ref>{{harvnb|Porter|1996|p=63}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Edmonds|2002|p=1}}.</ref> Portuguese merchants established a trading post called [[Tamão]] in Hong Kong waters and began regular trade with southern China. Although the traders were expelled after [[Battle of Tunmen|military clashes]] in the 1520s,<ref>{{harvnb|von Glahn|1996|p=116}}.</ref> Portuguese-Chinese trade relations were [[Luso-Chinese agreement (1554)|re-established by 1549]]. Portugal acquired a permanent lease for [[Macau]] in 1557.<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|1998|pp=342–344}}.</ref>

After the [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Qing conquest]], maritime trade was banned under the ''[[Haijin]]'' policies. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] lifted the prohibition, allowing foreigners to enter Chinese ports in 1684.<ref>{{harvnb|Zhihong|2006|pp=8–9}}.</ref> Qing authorities established the [[Canton System]] in 1757 to regulate trade more strictly, restricting non-Russian ships to the port of [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Schottenhammer|2007|p=33}}.</ref> Although European demand for Chinese commodities like tea, silk, and porcelain was high, Chinese interest in European manufactured goods was insignificant, so that Chinese goods could only be bought with precious metals. To reduce the trade imbalance, the British sold large amounts of Indian [[opium]] to China. Faced with a drug crisis, Qing officials pursued ever more aggressive actions to halt the opium trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Chen|2011}}.</ref>

In 1839, the [[Daoguang Emperor]] rejected proposals to legalise and tax opium and ordered imperial commissioner [[Lin Zexu]] to eradicate the opium trade. The commissioner destroyed opium stockpiles and halted all foreign trade,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoe|Roebuck|1999|pp=82, 87}}.</ref> triggering a British military response and the First Opium War.

Administrative infrastructure was quickly built by early 1842, but piracy, disease, and hostile Qing policies initially prevented the government from attracting commerce. Conditions on the island improved during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] in the 1850s, when many Chinese refugees, including wealthy merchants, fled mainland turbulence and settled in the colony.<ref name="CarrollEarlyHistory" /> Further tensions between the British and Qing over the opium trade escalated into the Second Opium War. The Qing were again defeated and forced to give up [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and [[Stonecutters Island]] in the [[Convention of Peking]].<ref name="SecondOpiumWar"/> By the end of this war, Hong Kong had evolved from a transient colonial outpost into a major [[entrepôt]]. Rapid economic improvement during the 1850s attracted foreign investment, as potential stakeholders became more confident in Hong Kong's future.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=30}}.</ref>

The Chief Executive is the [[head of government]] and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms. The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (led by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of China]]) appoints the Chief Executive after nomination by the [[Election Committee]], which is composed of 1,200 business, community, and government leaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|Cullen|2010|pp=13–16}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law Chapter IV}} Article 45.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Amendment to the Basic Law Annex I}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Hong Kong}}

Hong Kong is characterised as a hybrid of [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western culture|West]]. Traditional Chinese values emphasising family and education blend with Western ideals, including economic liberty and the rule of law.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=169}}.</ref> Although the vast majority of the population is ethnically Chinese, Hong Kong has developed a distinct identity. The territory diverged from the mainland due to its long period of colonial administration and a different pace of economic, social, and cultural development. Mainstream culture is derived from immigrants originating from various parts of China. This was influenced by British-style education, a separate political system, and the territory's rapid development during the late 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|pp=167–172}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|He|2013}}.</ref> Most migrants of that era fled poverty and war, reflected in the prevailing attitude toward wealth; Hongkongers tend to link self-image and decision-making to material benefits.<ref>{{harvnb|Tam|2017}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lam|2015}}.</ref> Residents' sense of local identity has markedly increased post-handover: 53 per cent of the population identify as "Hongkongers", while 11 per cent describe themselves as "Chinese".

Food in Hong Kong is primarily based on [[Cantonese cuisine]], despite the territory's exposure to foreign influences and its residents' varied origins. Rice is the staple food, and is usually served plain with other dishes.<ref name="LongHKFood">{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=271}}.</ref> Freshness of ingredients is emphasised.

[[File:Hong kong bruce lee statue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Statue of Bruce Lee in a fighting pose|Statue of Bruce Lee on the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]], a tribute to the city's film industry]]

Hong Kong developed into a filmmaking hub during the late 1940s as a wave of Shanghai filmmakers migrated to the territory, and these movie veterans helped rebuild the colony's entertainment industry over the next decade.<ref>{{harvnb|Fu|2008|pp=381, 388–389}}.</ref> By the 1960s, the city was well known to overseas audiences through films such as ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=148}}.</ref> When [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' was released in 1972, local productions became popular outside Hong Kong. During the 1980s, films such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', and ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]'' expanded global interest beyond [[martial arts film]]s; locally made gangster films, romantic dramas, and supernatural fantasies became popular.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=168}}.</ref> Hong Kong cinema continued to be internationally successful over the following decade with critically acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', and ''[[Chungking Express]]''. The city's martial arts film roots are evident in the roles of the most prolific Hong Kong actors. [[Jackie Chan]], [[Donnie Yen]], [[Jet Li]], [[Chow Yun-fat]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]] frequently play action-oriented roles in foreign films. At the height of the local movie industry in the early 1990s, over 400 films were produced each year; since then, industry momentum shifted to mainland China. The number of films produced annually has declined to about 60 in 2017.<ref>{{harvnb|Ge|2017}}.</ref>

[[Cantopop]] is a genre of Cantonese popular music which emerged in Hong Kong during the 1970s. Evolving from Shanghai-style ''[[shidaiqu]]'', it is also influenced by [[Cantonese opera]] and Western pop.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=1–9, 24–25}}.</ref> Local media featured songs by artists such as [[Sam Hui]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Leslie Cheung]], and [[Alan Tam]]; during the 1980s, exported films and shows exposed Cantopop to a global audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=77–85}}.</ref> The genre's popularity peaked in the 1990s, when the [[Four Heavenly Kings (Hong Kong)|Four Heavenly Kings]] dominated Asian record charts.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=107–116}}.</ref> Despite a general decline since late in the decade,<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=9–10}}.</ref> Cantopop remains dominant in Hong Kong; contemporary artists such as [[Eason Chan]], [[Joey Yung]], and [[Twins (group)|Twins]] are popular in and beyond the territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=159–164}}.</ref>

Western classical music has historically had a strong presence in Hong Kong, and remains a large part of local musical education.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Moir|Brennan|Rambarran|2017|p=101}}</ref> The publicly funded [[Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra]], the territory's oldest professional symphony orchestra, frequently host musicians and conductors from overseas.

[[Dragon boat]] races originated as a religious ceremony conducted during the annual [[Dragon Boat Festival|Tuen Ng Festival]]. The race was revived as a modern sport as part of the [[Hong Kong Tourism Board|Tourism Board]]'s efforts to promote Hong Kong's image abroad. The first modern competition was organised in 1976, and overseas teams began competing in the first international race in 1993.<ref>{{harvnb|Sofield|Sivan|2003}}.</ref>

Comprehensive schools fall under three categories: public schools, which are government-run; subsidised schools, including government aid-and-grant schools; and private schools, often those run by religious organisations and that base admissions on academic merit. These schools are subject to the curriculum guidelines as provided by the Education Bureau. Private schools subsidised under the [[Direct Subsidy Scheme]] and international schools fall outside of this system and may elect to use differing curricula and teach using other languages.<ref name="HKEduLi"/>
