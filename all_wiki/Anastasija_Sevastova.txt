'''Anastasija Sevastova''' (born April 1990) is a professional [[tennis]] player from [[Latvia]]. She reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 11 in October 2018, after reaching her first Premier Mandatory final at the [[2018 China Open (tennis)|China Open]]. She has won four singles titles on the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA Tour]], as well as 13 singles and four doubles titles on the [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF Circuit]].

Somewhat like [[Kim Clijsters]], Sevastova is best known for her success at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], particularly in recent years. In [[2016 US Open (tennis)|2016]], she defeated the reigning French Open champion and world No. 3, [[Garbiñe Muguruza]], as well as Australian Open semifinalist [[Johanna Konta]], en route to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. In [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018]], she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal, defeating defending champion and world No. 3, [[Sloane Stephens]], in the quarterfinals, whom she had lost to at that same stage in [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017]], before losing to [[Serena Williams]].

== Early life and background ==
Anastasija Sevastova was born on 13 April 1990 in [[Liepāja]], Latvia.<ref name=":4" /> She was raised by her mother, Diana Golovanova that is English teacher. Sevastova’s grandmother was interested in channeling Sevastova’s energy into sports. She introduced her to the tennis at age 6. With her natural [[Athletics (physical culture)|athleticism]], she could have gravitated to [[basketball]] or [[Association football|soccer]], but it was tennis because her grandmother had some friends who played and because the only club of significance in Liepāja was near Sevastova’s home, tucked into the dunes near the [[Baltic Sea]] to avoid the worst of the wind.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=September 5, 2018|title=‘A Girl From the Middle of Nowhere’ Finds Her Place at the U.S. Open|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/sports/tennis/us-open-anastasija-sevastova-serena-williams.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=The New York Times}}</ref> 

{{quote|“Pure chance. It was tennis, because it was summer, close to the water and close to our house. So you just enroll your kid.” — Diana Golovanova, on her daugther's desition<ref name=":5" />}}

The colder months would prove more complicated. There were no indoor tennis-dedicated facilities in Liepaja — only school gymnasiums with varnished wooden floors, where the multicolored lines used for various sports intersect like a [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] painting. Due to that, Sevastova played most of her winter tennis in the gymnasium in a secondary school where her mother was a teacher. It is also the same school where [[Jeļena Ostapenko]]’s mother and primary coach, Jelena Jakovleva, attended school as a youngster.<ref name=":5" />

{{quote|“Until age 14, I practiced in the school gyms on the wood. [[Riga]] has some good facilities with indoor clay and hard courts, but I was always in Liepāja. Indoors on wood is a different style of play because it was so fast, and there were lots of bad bounces. Initially, the cost of playing the game was inexpensive. Like 10 euros per month. And they assigned you a coach with 10 other people.” — Sevastova stated<ref name=":5" />|author=|title=|source=}}

But it soon became clear that Sevastova would need to leave home to progress. [[Ernests Gulbis]], who was from an affluent family in Riga, was boarding at [[Nikola Pilić|Niki Pilic]]’s tennis academy in [[Munich]], where a teenage [[Novak Djokovic]] was also training. Sevastova eventually followed the same path at age 14, returning regularly to Latvia to complete her schooling.<ref name=":5" /> At the same age, she won Latvian under-18 championships.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2019|title=Exclusive interview with 2018 US Open semi-finalist Anastasija Sevastova: “At that time I was done with tennis”|url=https://tennishead.net/exclusive-interview-with-2018-us-open-semi-finalist-anastasija-sevastova-at-that-time-i-was-done-with-tennis/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=tennis head}}</ref>
