{{Main|American Horror Story: Murder House}} 
Set in 2011, the season follows the Harmons, consisting of wife and mother Vivien ([[Connie Britton]]), her psychiatrist husband Ben ([[Dylan McDermott]]), and their teenage daughter Violet ([[Taissa Farmiga]]), as they move from [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles]] to make a fresh start after Vivien has a miscarriage. Soon after the miscarriage and before the move, Ben has an affair with one of his students, which almost tears the family apart. They move into a restored mansion and soon encounter the residence's housekeeper, Moira O'Hara ([[Frances Conroy]] and [[Alexandra Breckenridge]]), as well as their neighbors—the eccentric Langdon family, consisting of Constance ([[Jessica Lange]]) and her daughter Adelaide ([[Jamie Brewer]]). The Harmons' lives are troubled by the meddling Langdons, the incompetent realtor Marcy ([[Christine Estabrook]]), as well as the disfigured Larry Harvey ([[Denis O'Hare]]), a former resident of the mansion who is secretly in love with Constance, and the scorned Hayden McClaine ([[Kate Mara]]), Ben's former student who follows him to Los Angeles. Ben and Vivien try to rekindle their relationship while Violet, suffering from depression, finds comfort in Tate ([[Evan Peters]]), one of Ben's patients. The family soon discovers that the home is [[haunted house|haunted]] by the [[ghost]]s of anyone who has ever died on the property, including its creators Charles ([[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]]) and Nora Montgomery ([[Lily Rabe]]); and their deformed son Thaddeus ([[Ben Woolf]]) who is sometimes referred to as the 'Infantata'. Flashbacks depict the mansion's previous homeowners throughout the last century, dating back to its construction in the 1920s.

{{Main|American Horror Story: Asylum}}
Set in 1964, the season follows the patients and staff members of the church-owned Briarcliff Manor, located in [[Massachusetts]], which was founded to treat and house the criminally insane. Kit Walker ([[Evan Peters]]), accused of being a prolific serial killer named "Bloody Face" after the disappearance of his wife Alma ([[Britne Oldford]])—though he claims she was abducted by aliens—is incarcerated at Briarcliff. This piques the interest of ambitious lesbian journalist Lana Winters ([[Sarah Paulson]]), who is yearning to find a story for her big break. At Briarcliff, Kit meets the other patients, many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized, including [[microcephalic]] Pepper ([[Naomi Grossman]]), [[nymphomania]]c Shelley ([[Chloe Sevigny]]), whose cheating husband hypocritically committed her after finding her in bed with two guys; and the unassuming Grace Bertrand ([[Lizzie Brocheré]]) from [[France]]. Believed to be a violent serial killer, Kit becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Oliver Thredson ([[Zachary Quinto]]) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden ([[James Cromwell]]), the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients. The institution is run under the watchful eye of the stern Sister Jude ([[Jessica Lange]]), as well as her second-in-command, the naïve Sister Mary Eunice ([[Lily Rabe]]), and the founder of the institution, Monsignor Timothy Howard ([[Joseph Fiennes]]). Briarcliff's inhabitants are routinely subject to supernatural and scientific influences, including demonic possession and extraterrestrial abduction.

===''Coven'' (2013–14)===
{{Main|American Horror Story: Coven}}
Set in 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the [[Salem witch trials]] and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Those who share this genetic affliction are being subjected to violent attacks from outside forces, such as voodoo practitioners. Zoe Benson ([[Taissa Farmiga]]), a young teenager completely unaware of the existence of witches, discovers her identity as a Salem descendant after a violent accident that causes the death of her boyfriend. She is sent to an all-girls boarding school in [[New Orleans]] which aims to protect and house young women who carry this unique bloodline, and keep them from the dangers of the outside world. There, she meets the other students, narcissistic movie star Madison Montgomery ([[Emma Roberts]]), outspoken human voodoo doll Queenie ([[Gabourey Sidibe]]), and enigmatic mind-reading Nan ([[Jamie Brewer]]), and gets romantically entangled with Kyle Spencer ([[Evan Peters]]), a non-witch and good-natured college student. The school is run by headmistress Cordelia Foxx ([[Sarah Paulson]]), head of the Witches Council, eccentric fashionista Myrtle Snow ([[Frances Conroy]]), and the mute butler Spalding ([[Denis O'Hare]]). Cordelia's mother, Fiona Goode ([[Jessica Lange]]), is the Supreme and most powerful witch of her generation, though she regularly avoids her responsibilities, much to the chagrin of Cordelia and her long-time rival Myrtle. After a mob of townspeople discover and burn a young witch living in the swamps named Misty Day ([[Lily Rabe]]), Fiona returns to the school to ensure the safety of the other young witches, but also to fulfill her own hidden agenda. Events reveal a long-held rivalry between the witches of Salem and the voodoo practitioners of [[New Orleans]], as well as a historic grudge between Voodoo Queen [[Marie Laveau]] ([[Angela Bassett]]) and socialite serial killer [[Delphine LaLaurie]] ([[Kathy Bates]]), who tortured and murdered her slaves in the 1830s. In addition to this, the coven is also being targeted by an organization of witch hunters.

===''Freak Show'' (2014–15)===
{{Main|American Horror Story: Freak Show}}
Set in 1952, the season follows a struggling [[freak show]] led by Elsa Mars ([[Jessica Lange]]) in the sleepy town of [[Jupiter, Florida]]. Decades have passed since the public has looked upon freak shows as a form of entertainment, but Elsa dreams of finding a home for her "monsters," as well as for her own fame and fortune. Other members of her troupe include "Lobster Boy" Jimmy Darling ([[Evan Peters]]), who dreams of living a normal life, and his mother Ethel ([[Kathy Bates]]), a [[bearded lady]] who acts as Elsa's second-in-command by maintaining law and order under the tent. A strongman from Ethel's past and Jimmy's biological father Dell Toledo ([[Michael Chiklis]]), and his three-breasted wife Desiree Dupree ([[Angela Bassett]]), arrive to join the freak show. To drum up business and save her troupe once and for all, Elsa also recruits conjoined twin sisters Bette and Dot Tattler ([[Sarah Paulson]]) to perform for her show. In a time when the era of television is beginning to reign high above sideshow acts, these individuals must overcome those who persecute them based on their looks. However, as the season unfolds, it is revealed that multiple dark entities have taken up residence in Jupiter, with all of their eyes being set on the freaks. A conman named Stanley ([[Denis O'Hare]]), posing as a Hollywood executive, arrives with his young protégé Maggie Esmerelda ([[Emma Roberts]]), who becomes involved with Jimmy. The wealthy and spoiled Dandy Mott ([[Finn Wittrock]]), enabled by his doting mother Gloria ([[Frances Conroy]]), develops an unhealthy obsession with the freaks, particularly Bette and Dot. Perhaps the most dangerous of them all is a mysterious, deformed killer clown, known only as Twisty ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), who wreaks havoc on Jupiter and appears to be targeting freaks and townspeople alike.

===''Hotel'' (2015–16)===
{{main|American Horror Story: Hotel}}
Set in 2015, the season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], initially built as a secret torture chamber to fulfill the violent desires of founder James Patrick March ([[Evan Peters]]). Detective John Lowe ([[Wes Bentley]]) arrives at the hotel, based on intel from an anonymous tip, to investigate a grisly string of murders, each of which exemplify a sin in violation of one of the Ten Commandments. He has become estranged from his wife Alex ([[Chloe Sevigny]]), who suffers from depression, and his daughter Scarlett (Shree Crooks), after the disappearance of their son Holden (Lennon Henry) five years earlier. The hotel is led by March's fashionista widow Elizabeth Johnson ([[Lady Gaga]]), also known as the [[Elizabeth Báthory|Countess]]—who was mutated into a [[vampire]]s by her former lovers, actor [[Rudolph Valentino]] ([[Finn Wittrock]]) and his wife [[Natacha Rambova]] ([[Alexandra Daddario]])—and her current lover Donovan ([[Matt Bomer]]). Throughout his investigation, John also becomes entangled with the spirits of a heroin junkie named Sally ([[Sarah Paulson]]), hotel maid Hazel Evers ([[Mare Winningham]]), and James Patrick March, who is looking for a protégé to continue the violent acts he started when he was alive. The hotel's tireless staff includes the surly front desk manager Iris ([[Kathy Bates]]), Donovan's mother, and her best friend, the transgender bartender Liz Taylor ([[Denis O'Hare]]), both of whom hesitantly cater to Elizabeth and her vampiric children, one out of a desire to remain close to her son and the other out of a sense of loyalty. Elizabeth's relationship with Donovan becomes troubled with the arrival of male model and [[cocaine]] addict Tristan Duffy (Finn Wittrock), New York fashion designer Will Drake ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]), and her scorned ex-lover Ramona Royale ([[Angela Bassett]]), all of whom become entangled in her violent life.

===''Roanoke'' (2016)===
{{main|American Horror Story: Roanoke}}
Set in 2014–2016, the season follows the supernatural events that occur in a renovated farmhouse in [[North Carolina]], which is situated on the land where the [[Roanoke Colony]] moved after their infamous 1580s disappearance. In 2015, Shelby Miller ([[Lily Rabe]]), her husband Matt ([[André Holland]]), along with Matt's sister Lee Harris ([[Adina Porter]]) recount their harrowing experience living in the farmhouse a year prior in a popular documentary series titled ''My Roanoke Nightmare'', including their encounters with the violent and vengeful ghosts of the house's previous residents and the Roanoke Colony, the cannibalistic Polk family who live nearby, and the beautiful, yet terrifying Celtic witch, [[Scáthach]] ([[Lady Gaga]]). The documentary becomes a huge success, featuring dramatic reenactments of the Millers' story starring Audrey Tindall ([[Sarah Paulson]]) as Shelby, Dominic Banks ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) as Matt, Monet Tumusiime ([[Angela Bassett]]) as Lee, Agnes Mary Winstead ([[Kathy Bates]]) as Thomasin White—also known as The Butcher, leader of the ghost colony, Audrey's husband Rory Monahan ([[Evan Peters]]) as Edward Philipe Mott, the creator and first owner of the house, William van Henderson ([[Denis O'Hare]]) as Dr. Elias Cunningham, a professor who becomes entranced with the paranormal happenings of the area, and Dylan ([[Wes Bentley]]) as Ambrose White, Thomasin's son and accomplice. In 2016, the success of the documentary leads to a sequel titled ''Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell'', spearheaded by the producer of the original series, Sidney Aaron James ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]), who invites the Millers, as well as many of the reenactment actors, to return to the farmhouse for three days during the blood moon, where all their actions will be captured by hidden cameras. Although the Millers are aware of the entities that reside in the house, all three agree to return, each with their own agenda. The production eventually descends into a chaotic, yet tragic disaster, however, as cast and crew alike are quickly targeted when the violent entities begin to surface.

Also in the midst of the chaos is Jack Samuels ([[Colton Haynes]]), a detective who investigates the crimes and is initially doubtful about Ally's claims, and Gary K. Longstreet ([[Chaz Bono]]), a supermarket owner who has an amputated arm and is a passionate Trump supporter.

Creators Murphy and Falchuk began working on ''American Horror Story'' before their Fox series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' began production. Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: "I went from ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' to ''Glee'', so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/05/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-exclusive|title='American Horror Story' co-creator Ryan Murphy talks premiere, his favorite scene, and identity of Rubber Man – EXCLUSIVE|last=Stack|first=Tim|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 5, 2011|access-date=November 10, 2015|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224818/https://ew.com/article/2011/10/05/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-exclusive/|url-status=live}}</ref> Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. "You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards," he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/ryan-murphy-and-brad-falchuk-talk-american-horror-story-blood-infidelity-and-zachary-quinto/10/2011/|title=Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk Talk "American Horror Story": Blood, Infidelity, and Zachary Quinto |last=Juergens|first=Brian|publisher=NewNowNext|date=October 3, 2011|access-date=November 12, 2015}}</ref>

In February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. [[Dante Di Loreto]] was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/fx-orders-american-horror-story-from-glee-pair/|title=FX orders 'American Horror Story' from 'Glee' pair|last=Fienberg|first=Daniel|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=February 17, 2011|access-date=February 17, 2011|archive-date=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701041504/http://www.hitfix.com/articles/fx-orders-american-horror-story-from-glee-pair/|url-status=live}}</ref> In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been picked up to become a full series.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/07/18/fx-orders-american-horror-story-to-series-702212/20110718fx01/|title=FX Orders "American Horror Story" to Series|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|access-date=November 10, 2015|date=July 18, 2011|archive-date=September 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925123347/http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/07/18/fx-orders-american-horror-story-to-series-702212/20110718fx01/|url-status=live}}</ref>

From the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story.<ref name="Mullins">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/282480/american-horror-story-season-two-scoop-new-house-and-mostly-new-faces|access-date=November 12, 2015|title=American Horror Story Season Two Scoop: New House and (Mostly) New Faces|last=Mullins|first=Jenna|work=[[E!

"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters," he announced.<ref name="Mullins"/> In November 2012, FX chief executive, [[John Landgraf]], described the unique format of the series stating: "[T]he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast—has proven groundbreaking, wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting."<ref name=3pick>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/fx-picks-up-third-season-of-american-horror-story/2012/11/15/1431d834-2f54-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html|title=FX picks up third season of 'American Horror Story'|first=Lisa|last=de Moraes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 15, 2012|access-date=November 15, 2012|archive-date=October 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023111810/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/fx-picks-up-third-season-of-american-horror-story/2012/11/15/1431d834-2f54-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the 2013 [[PaleyFest]], Falchuk compared the series to [[horror film]]s: "It does demand a little bit of compassion at the end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie," he said. "If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of get away with that, but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them."<ref name=Paleyfest2013>{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/19/american-horror-story-creators-cast-tease-season-3-at-paleyfest/|title=American Horror Story Creators, Cast Tease Season 3|last=Luna|first=Keri|date=March 19, 2013|publisher=Spinoff.ComicBookResources.com|access-date=April 21, 2013}}</ref>

Murphy then explained the process of planning a series' season takes about a year. "We come up with story first and then we come up with the characters," he said. "It is a repertory company, so we'll move people around and sometimes there won't yet be a role for somebody. Like when we started [the second season], I really had no idea that Dylan [McDermott] would be the person to play Sarah's son, but the deeper we got, I thought, that would work great."<ref name=Paleyfest2013/>

In an August 2015 article for ''Entertainment Weekly'', Murphy revealed that the show is producing two seasons a year, the first being broadcast late in the year and the second early in the next year. He explained, "We're doing something that we've never done before on the show where we're doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing we're crafting up is very, very different than [''Hotel'']. Not smaller. But just not opulent. More rogue and more dark."<ref name="EW815">{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/27/american-horror-story-two-seasons-2016|title=There could be TWO seasons of American Horror Story in 2016|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=August 27, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=August 27, 2015|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224734/https://ew.com/article/2015/08/27/american-horror-story-two-seasons-2016/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Title sequences===
''American Horror Story''{{'s}} title screens offer vague hints to important plot elements and events that compose each season. For ''Murder House'', Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated that: "By the time you see the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained," establishing the purpose of the title sequence for future seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screenrant.com/american-horror-story-opening-credits-mcrid-133840/|title='American Horror Story' Opening Credits Are Totally Creepy [Updated]|last=Crider|first=Michael|publisher=Screen Rant|date=August 3, 2011|access-date=September 29, 2011|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224849/https://screenrant.com/american-horror-story-opening-credits/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The opening title sequence was created by [[Kyle Cooper]] and his company [[Prologue (creative agency)|Prologue]]. He also created the title sequence for the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician [[Charlie Clouser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/09/28/american-horror-story-opening-credits|title='American Horror Story': Watch the terrifying opening credits sequence – EXCLUSIVE VIDEO|first=Tim|last=Stack|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 28, 2011|access-date=November 10, 2015|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224849/https://ew.com/article/2011/09/28/american-horror-story-opening-credits/|url-status=live}}</ref> The cinematography was done by Juan Ruiz Anchía and the editing by Gabriel J. Diaz.

For ''Murder House'', the sequence is set in the Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, fetuses in jars, skulls, a christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. A photo of alleged axe murderer [[Lizzie Borden]] is also shown. Texts in the sequence are white, superimposed on black background and have a film burning effect.

''Asylum''{{'}}s opening sequence is done by the same creative team. "We are shooting a new title sequence with the same team that did last year's," series creator Ryan Murphy said. "The song may stay... not sure."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/american-horror-story-season2-spoilers-1051750/|title=The New Rubber Man, Lange's Character and More American Horror Story: Asylum Spoilers|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=August 7, 2012|work=TV Guide|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=August 17, 2012|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224833/https://www.tvguide.com/news/american-horror-story-season2-spoilers-1051750/|url-status=live}}</ref> The music was kept, and the new title sequence was set around the Asylum, using shots of inmates raving and surgeons operating on patients with bandages obscuring their faces. Elements include a young girl walking backwards on her hands and feet up a staircase and a shot of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s smile changing from one of benevolence to one of spite. Texts in the sequence are yellow, superimposed on a black grainy background.

''Coven''{{'}}s opening sequence keeps the same music, and this sequence is the first one to be filmed primarily outside and not in an enclosed location. Shots include figures wearing black robes and [[capirote]]s, a skeletal creature with wings and shots of dead [[goat]]s, the [[Minotaur]] from the season also appears. For the first time, there are actual backgrounds that appear with the actor names instead of an all-black background, some of these images include witches hanging and [[Santa Muerte]]. Other elements include a black man with piercing eyes and a disturbing smile as well as voodoo dolls burning. The final shot continues after the figures in black capirotes seize one of their own who is later seen burning at a stake where young, dress-clad witches dance around.

''Freak Show''{{'}}s opening sequence changed things up, the series' theme music remains intact albeit with an added carnival-like soundscape. The sequence is composed of both CGI and [[stop-motion]] animation and features strange characters such as a skeletal [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] of a human being and an elephant riding a bicycle, a skeleton of what appears to be a single head but two bodies, a devilish-looking man, a boy in a wheelchair with deformed legs, a character with severe [[syndactyly]] of the hands and feet, a clown who can twist his head around, a woman with a third leg where her genitalia should be, and a demonic [[cymbal-banging monkey toy]]. There are also shots of side show attractions like the [[Human Blockhead]], [[knife throwing]] and sword swallowing. The main recurring element features a [[Balloon modelling|balloon twister]] popping balloons with a knife. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal.

''Hotel''{{'}}s opening sequence also was very different from previous seasons, taking more of a biblical approach. The font, while remaining the same as the first four seasons, glows in red against a hotel wallpaper. The Ten Commandments are also shown throughout the sequence. The intro returns to live-action like the first three seasons. Visuals include many people scrubbing blood all over the walls and the floor, strange things shown through peepholes, people being victims to the hotel, little kids running around the hotel, a woman screaming as she smears lipstick all over her face, as well as many different creatures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch: 'American Horror Story: Hotel' Opening Sequence Gets Biblical|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/watch-american-horror-story-hotel-opening-sequence-gets-biblical-1201607498/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 1, 2015|first=Jacob|last=Bryant|access-date=November 12, 2015|archive-date=October 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002142723/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/watch-american-horror-story-hotel-opening-sequence-gets-biblical-1201607498/|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Roanoke'' featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card from the first season, ''Murder House'', while the series' theme music plays over the end credits. At the end of the finale's credits, the title of the season "''American Horror Story: Roanoke''" was revealed.

In the development of ''Cult'', Murphy confirmed that the opening sequence would return. ''Cult''{{'}}s opening sequence features the series' theme music played by a marching band. The sequence is live action. Visuals include: a gang of clowns rising from a casket, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks, a [[George Washington]] statue, a dead dog killed by toxic gas, a [[Merry-Go-Round]], bloody hands that cannot be washed, a beehive, toxic smoke released from a grenade, holes in several forms, a bloody [[US flag]] with the sound of a xylophone playing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", a blood-covered couple having sex, a magician pulling guts out of a hat and a handcuffed [[pinky promise]]. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal. The texts interact with the graphic behind them, sometimes also bloody. For the first time, the title is abbreviated as ''AHS'' instead of ''American Horror Story''.

''Apocalypse''{{'}}s opening sequence features the original theme music from the first three seasons. The sequence includes images of nuclear disaster and sketches of demons fusing together. Other visuals include burning candles, snakes, both human and goat skulls, a scorpion, a blooming flower, and photos of nuclear-testing documents. Visuals from the title sequences of both season one and season three are also included with slight alterations, including the skeletal winged creature in the forest (''Coven''), the nurse's blouse (''Murder House''), a picture of a baby that has been set on fire (''Murder House''), and the goat skulls (''Coven''). All text appeared to be glowing in pale yellow and red.

''1984''{{'}}s opening sequence is inspired by a fan-made concept that strongly impressed Ryan Murphy. Corey Vega, the creator of the fan-made title sequence, was invited to work with ''American Horror Story'' veteran title-sequence designer [[Kyle Cooper]] to create the official sequence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2UddI7pAvT/|last=Murphy|first=Ryan|number=B2UddI7pAvT|title=I am so excited to share with you the new AMERICAN HORROR STORY title sequence by our longtime collaborator Kyle Cooper and our new friend Corey Vega, who ignited this concept with an original "fan" cut he posted on Twitter after the 1984 season was announced.

For the first time, a new slasher-style font is used for the text with the exception of vowels "O" and "A" staying with the original series' logo font. Visuals include: five [[Jazzercise]] instructors warming up before blood stains the screen, peaceful camping activities, bloody sharp objects (knives, cleavers, and an axe), a hidden killer in black, moonwalking, footage of the [[1984 United States presidential election]], [[cassette tape]]s, a smashed blood-filled wine glass, vehicles gearing up, and a campfire exploding. It ends with a self-destructed cassette. Names of the cast are superimposed on colorful neon graphics. The title is abbreviated as ''AHS'' instead of ''American Horror Story'' for the second time, after ''Cult''. And for the second time, the last name mentioned is not given an "and" credit, also after ''Cult''.

The title sequence for seasons 1 to 8 of the show use a variation of the [[Willow (typeface)|Willow typeface]] that very closely resembles a style for which Scottish designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was known.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Shawn|title=Why Is The 'American Horror Story' Font So Creepy?|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1246305/why-is-the-american-horror-story-font-so-creepy/|website=The Inquisitr News|access-date=March 30, 2017|date=May 10, 2014|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224849/https://www.inquisitr.com/1246305/why-is-the-american-horror-story-font-so-creepy/|url-status=live}}</ref> The font is still used in season 9 but is mixed with another font from a fan's choice.

In August 2012, the first promo for the second season was released on the ''American Horror Story'' [[Facebook]] page entitled "Special Delivery", in which a nun carries a couple of buckets filled with body parts through a field.

Overall, premises and characters for each season are typically kept under wraps until soon before premiers and are alluded to with brief and vague teaser trailers.

===Universal's Halloween Horror Nights===
On August 16, 2016, FX announced a deal had been struck to feature an ''American Horror Story'' [[haunted attraction (simulated)|maze]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Orlando]] for their [[Halloween Horror Nights]] events. The maze featured sets and themes from ''Murder House'', ''Freak Show'', and ''Hotel''. [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] said of the experience, "Twisted scenes from ''Murder House'' will unleash the evil spirits that possess the Harmon estate, spiraling guests through decades of the tortured dead who previously resided there. In ''Freak Show'', guests joined a troupe of biological misfits in a sinister sideshow where they were stalked by the murderous and deformed Twisty the Clown. Finally, guests succumbed to the warped desires of the Countess after checking into the haunted Hotel Cortez, conceived from the beginning as a torture chamber for its customers."<ref name="UniversalHalloween">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-american-horror-story-maze-universal-20160816-snap-story.html|title='American Horror Story' will come alive at Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights|last=Woerner|first=Meredith|date=August 16, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=August 16, 2016|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224927/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-american-horror-story-maze-universal-20160816-snap-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, the show returned as haunted attractions to both parks, with Universal Orlando having an attraction based on ''Asylum'', ''Coven'', and ''Roanoke'', and Universal Studios Hollywood basing their attraction solely on ''Roanoke''. 

In December 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced it would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|purchase 21st Century Fox which included the 20th Century Fox film and TV assets]]. The deal was completely finalized on March 20, 2019, making 20th Century Fox officially part of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]]. As Disney and Universal are bitter rivals in the [[theme park]] business (especially for their [[Central Florida]] properties), this would likely end the franchise's presence in Halloween Horror Nights at Universal parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orlando-rising.com/why-the-disney-fox-deal-doesnt-mean-much-for-disney-world/|title=Why the Disney-Fox deal doesn't mean much for Disney World|last=Gregory|first=John|date=March 25, 2019|publisher=Orlando Rising|access-date=August 13, 2019|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114224908/https://www.themeparktribune.com/why-the-disney-fox-deal-doesnt-mean-much-for-disney-world/|url-status=live}}</ref>
