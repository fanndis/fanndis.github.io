In 1998, Routledge became a subdivision and imprint of its former rival, [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor & Francis Group]] (T&F), as a result of a £90-million acquisition deal from [[Cinven]], a venture capital group which had purchased it two years previously for £25 million.<ref name=independent>{{cite web

==History==
The firm originated in 1836, when the London bookseller [[George Routledge]] published an unsuccessful guidebook, ''The Beauties of Gilsland'', with his brother-in-law W. H. (William Henry) Warne as assistant. In 1848, the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German [[Tauchnitz]] family, which became known as the "Railway Library".<ref name=railwaylibrary>{{cite web
|title= Yellowbacks: III – Routledge's Railway Library
|url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/yellow/yellow3.html
|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Railway Library history"/>

The venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne's brother [[Frederick Warne]], to found the company, '''George Routledge & Co.''' in 1851.<ref name=UCL>{{cite web
|title= UCL Library Services: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd Archives – 1850–1984 |url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo==%27ROUTLEDGE%27&dsqDb=Catalog
|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>	
The following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', (in the [[public domain]] in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] £20,000 for a 10-year [[lease]] allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works<ref name=railwaylibrary/><ref>Sutherland (2009:527,553).</ref> including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their "Railway Library" series.<ref name=oxford>{{cite ODNB|id=24184|title=Routledge, George|year=2004|last=Barnes|first=James J.|last2=Barnes|first2=Patience P.}}</ref>
[[File:Routledge stand at Senate House History Day 2018.jpg|thumb|Routledge stand at Senate House History Day 2018]]
The company was restyled in 1858 as '''Routledge, Warne & Routledge''' when George Routledge's son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W. H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37).<ref name=censusrecord>{{cite web

By 1899, the company was running close to [[bankruptcy]]. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist [[Sir William Crookes]], banker [[Arthur Ellis Franklin]], [[William Swan Sonnenschein]] as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912, the company took over the management of '''Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co.''', the descendant of companies founded by [[Charles Kegan Paul]], Alexander Chenevix Trench, [[Nicholas Trübner]], and George Redway.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lucile Project,"PUBLISHER: Kegan Paul, Trench & Company; Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Company, London" |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/lucile/publishers/kegan/kegan.htm |website=University of Iowa|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>

These early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward,  the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint "Kegan Paul Trench Trubner", as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] had been quietly dropped in the [[World War I|First World War]]) under the name of '''Routledge & Kegan Paul'''.<ref>Franklin (1987),</ref> Using [[C. K. Ogden]] and later [[Karl Mannheim]] as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and the [[social sciences]].

In 1985, Routledge & Kegan Paul joined with [[Associated Book Publishers]] (ABP),<ref>Whipp (1992:47)</ref> which was later acquired by [[International Thomson]] in 1987. Under Thomson's ownership, Routledge's name and operations were retained, and, in 1996, a [[management buyout]] financed by the European [[private equity]] firm [[Cinven]] saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. Just two years later, Cinven and Routledge's directors accepted a deal for Routledge's acquisition by [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor & Francis Group]] (T&F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.<ref>Clark & Phillips (2008:xvi); Cope (1998)</ref>

In 2004, T&F became a division within [[Informa plc]] after a merger. Routledge continues as a primary publishing unit and imprint within Informa's 'academic publishing' division, publishing academic [[humanities]] and [[social science]] books, journals, reference
works and digital products. Routledge has grown considerably as a result of [[organic growth]] and acquisitions of other publishing companies and other publishers' titles by its parent company.<ref name="T&F">[http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/taylorfrancis.htm ''Academic Publishing Industry: A Story of Merger and Acquisition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618175801/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/TaylorFrancis.htm |date=18 June 2012 }} - Taylor & Francis.</ref><ref name="Taylor & Francis">[[Taylor & Francis]]</ref><ref name="informa2015">{{cite web |title= Results for 12 months to 31st December 2015|url= http://www.informa.com/Documents/Investor%20Relations/2016/FY2015/20160210%20FY%20Results%20Statement%20-%20Final.pdf}}</ref> Humanities and social sciences titles acquired by T&F from other publishers are [[Rebranding|rebranded]] under the Routledge [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].<ref name="Taylor & Francis"/>

Routledge has been criticised for a pricing structure which "will limit readership to the privileged few", as opposed to options for "[[open access]] without tears" offered by [[DOAJ]], [[Unpaywall]], and [[DOAB]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-04-25|title=The Writing on the Unpaywall |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/writing-unpaywall|website=[[ Inside Higher Ed]]|author=Barbara Fister}}</ref>
