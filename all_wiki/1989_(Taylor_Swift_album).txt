'''''1989''''' is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], released on October 27, 2014, through [[Big Machine Records]]. Following the release of her cross-genre fourth studio album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), noted for [[pop music|pop]] hooks and [[electronic music|electronic]] production, the media questioned the validity of Swift's status as a [[country music|country]] artist. Inspired by 1980s [[synth-pop]] to create a record that shifted her sound and image from country-oriented to mainstream pop, Swift enlisted [[Max Martin]] as co-executive producer, and named her fifth album after her birth year.

The album's synth-pop sound is characterized by heavy [[synthesizers]], programmed [[drum machine|drums]], and processed backing vocals. Swift's songs were inspired primarily by her personal relationships, which had been a trademark of her songwriting. The songs on ''1989'' express lighthearted perspectives towards failed romance, departing from her previous antagonistic attitude. To bolster sales, Swift and Big Machine marketed the album extensively through product endorsements, television and radio appearances, and social media engagement. They pulled ''1989'' from free streaming services such as [[Spotify]], prompting an industry discourse on the impact of streaming on music sales.{{NoteTag|''1989'' has been re-added and available on [[Spotify]] since June 2017.<ref name="bbc"/>}}

After the album's release, Swift embarked on [[the 1989 World Tour]], which was the highest-grossing tour of 2015. The album was supported by seven [[singles (music)|singles]], including three US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number ones: "[[Shake It Off]]", "[[Blank Space]]", and "[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]". Contemporary critics praised Swift's songwriting for offering emotional engagement that they found uncommon in the mainstream pop scene. Meanwhile, the synth-pop production raised questions regarding Swift's authenticity as a lyricist. The album appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2010s and featured in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} 2020 revision of their [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. At the [[58th Grammy Awards]] in 2016, ''1989'' won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], making Swift the first female solo artist to win Album of the Year twice.

''1989'' was a huge commercial success. In the US, Swift became the first artist to have three albums each sell over one million copies within their first week of release. The album spent 11 weeks atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received a [[RIAA certification#Records|ninefold platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It also earned [[List of music recording certifications|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia, Canada and the UK, and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

Swift began songwriting for her fifth studio album in mid-2013 while touring to support ''Red''.<ref name="Talbott">{{cite news|last=Talbott|first=Chris|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/taylor-swift-talks-next-album-cmas-and-ed-sheeran|title=Taylor Swift talks next album, CMAs and Ed Sheeran|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026093555/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/taylor-swift-talks-next-album-cmas-and-ed-sheeran|archivedate=October 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> For ''Red''{{'}}s follow-up, she sought to create a "blatant pop" record, departing from her country/pop experimentation. She believed that "if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both".<ref name="rolling-stone"/> Greatly inspired by 1980s [[synth-pop]],<ref name="Medium"/> she viewed the 1980s as an experimental period that embraced "endless possibilities" when artists abandoned the generic "drums-guitar-bass-whatever" song structure and experimented with stripped-down [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum pad]]s, and overlapped vocals.<ref name="ootw"/> She took inspiration from the music of artists from the period, such as [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Annie Lennox]], to make a synth-pop record that would convey her thoughts unobscured by heavy instrumentation.{{NoteTag|Swift admired Lennox's "way she conveys a thought, there's something really intense about it". Commenting on Gabriel's music, Swift said, "What he was doing in the '80s was so ahead of its time, because he was playing with a lot of synth-pop sounds, but kind of creating sort of an atmosphere behind what he was singing, rather than a produced track."<ref name="NPROct2014"/>}}

To ensure a smooth transition to pop, Swift recruited Max Martin and Shellback as major collaborators, in part because of their reputation as the biggest mainstream pop hitmakers at the time.{{sfn|McNutt|2020|p=78}} Speaking to the [[Associated Press]] in October 2013, Swift described them as "absolute dream collaborators" because they took her ideas in a different direction, which challenged her as a songwriter.<ref name="Talbott"/> [[Scott Borchetta]], president of Swift's then-label Big Machine, was initially skeptical of Swift's decision.<ref name="BB1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|title=Billboard Woman of the Year Taylor Swift on Writing Her Own Rules, Not Becoming a Cliche and the Hurdle of Going Pop|first=Alan|last=Light|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 5, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226012450/https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|archivedate=December 26, 2014}}</ref> He failed to persuade Swift to record "three country songs",<ref name="BB1"/> and ultimately accepted that Big Machine would not promote the new songs to country radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idolator.com/7522256/taylor-swift-max-martin-new-album-2014?chrome=1|title=Max Martin Produced 'Most Of' Taylor Swift's Next Album|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|first=Christina|last=Lee|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227082221/http://www.idolator.com/7522256/taylor-swift-max-martin-new-album-2014?chrome=1|archivedate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> Martin and Shellback produced seven of the thirteen tracks on the album's standard edition.<ref name="auto"/> Swift credited Martin as co-executive producer because he also recorded and produced her vocals on tracks on which he was uncredited.

<blockquote>In the past, I've written mostly about heartbreak or pain that was caused by someone else and felt by me. On this album, I'm writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50-50. ... I used to think that you find "the one". And it's happily ever after, and it's never a struggle after that. You have a few experiences with love and relationships, and you learn that that's not the case at all. Lots of things are gray areas and complicated situations, and even if you find the right situation relationship-wise, it's always going to be a daily struggle to make it work.<ref name="NPROct2014"/></blockquote>

The album's 1980s synth-pop production divided critics.
