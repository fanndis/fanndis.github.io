At the federal level, the CSU forms a common faction in the [[Bundestag]] with the CDU which is frequently referred to as the Union Faction (''die Unionsfraktion'') or simply [[CDU/CSU]]. The CSU has had 46 seats in the Bundestag since the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]],<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/2017/ergebnisse.html|title=Results - The Federal Returning Officer|publisher=The Federal Returning Officer|website=bundeswahlleiter.de}}</ref> making currently it the smallest of the seven parties represented. The CSU is a member of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].

The CSU currently has three ministers in the [[cabinet of Germany]] of the federal government in Berlin, including former party leader [[Horst Seehofer]] who is [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|Federal Minister of the Interior]] while party leader [[Markus Söder]] serves as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]], a position that CSU representatives have held from 1946 to 1954 and again since 1957.

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F049272-0002, München, CSU-Bundestagswahlkampf, Strauß.jpg|thumb|Chairman [[Franz Josef Strauß]] in 1976]]

[[Franz Josef Strauß]] (1915–1988) had left behind the strongest legacy as a leader of the party, having led the party from 1961 until his death in 1988. His political career in the federal cabinet was unique in that he had served four ministerial posts in the years between 1953 and 1969. From 1978 until his death in 1988, Strauß served as the Minister-President of Bavaria. Strauß was the first leader of the CSU to be a candidate for the German chancellery in 1980. In the [[1980 German federal election|1980 federal election]], Strauß ran against the incumbent [[Helmut Schmidt]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), but lost thereafter as the SPD and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) managed to secure an absolute majority together, forming a [[social-liberal coalition]].

The CSU has led the Bavarian state government since it came into existence in 1946, save from 1954 to 1957 when the SPD formed a state government in coalition with the [[Bavaria Party]] and the state branches of the [[GB/BHE]] and FDP. 

Initially, the separatist [[Bavaria Party]] (BP) successfully competed for the same electorate as the CSU, as both parties saw and presented themselves as successors to the BVP. The CSU was ultimately able to win this power struggle for itself. Among other things, the BP was involved in the [[1958_Bavarian_state_election#Casino_Affair |“casino affair”]] under dubious circumstances by the CSU at the end of the 1950s and lost considerable prestige and votes. In the 1966 state election, the BP finally left the state parliament.

Before the 2008 elections in Bavaria, the CSU perennially achieved absolute majorities at the state level by itself. This level of dominance is unique among Germany's 16 states. [[Edmund Stoiber]] took over the CSU leadership in 1999. He ran for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]] in 2002, but his preferred [[CDU/CSU]]–FDP coalition lost against the SPD candidate [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s [[Red–green alliance|SPD–Green alliance]].

In the [[2003 Bavaria state election|2003 Bavarian state election]], the CSU won 60.7% of the vote and 124 of 180 seats in the state parliament. This was the first time any party had won a two thirds majority in a German state parliament.<ref>Clayton Clemens. [http://www.aicgs.org/analysis/wahlen/clemens.aspx "Stoiber – Dominant But Not Omnipotent"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003113436/http://www.aicgs.org/analysis/wahlen/clemens.aspx|date=3 October 2008}} American Institute for Contemporary German Studies. Retrieved 7 June 2008.</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' later suggested that this exceptional result was due to a backlash against Schröder's government in Berlin.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/11895193 "The Economist: Old soldiers march into the unknown"].</ref> The CSU's popularity declined in subsequent years. Stoiber stepped down from the posts of Minister-President and CSU chairman in September 2007. A year later, the CSU lost its majority in the [[2008 Bavarian state election]], with its vote share dropping from 60.7% to 43.4%. The CSU remained in power by forming a coalition with the FDP. In the [[2009 German federal election|2009 general election]], the CSU received only 42.5% of the vote in Bavaria in the 2009 election, which constitutes its weakest showing in the party's history.

The CSU made gains in the [[2013 Bavarian state election]] and the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], which were held a week apart in September 2013. The CSU regained their majority in the Bavarian Landtag and remained in government in Berlin. They have three ministers in [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|Angela Merkel's current cabinet]], namely [[Horst Seehofer]] (Minister of the Interior, Building and Community), [[Andreas Scheuer]] (Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure) and [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]] (Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development).

After the [[2018 Bavarian state election]] on October 14, 2018, the CSU formed a new government with partner [[Free Voters of Bavaria]].

== Relationship with the CDU ==
The CSU is the sister party of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).<ref name=spiegelquickguide>{{cite news|title=A Quick Guide to Germany's Political Parties|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/where-do-they-stand-a-quick-guide-to-germany-s-political-parties-a-651388.html|accessdate=1 December 2012|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 September 2009}}</ref> Together, they are called The Union.<ref name=spiegelquickguide/> The CSU operates only within Bavaria and the CDU operates in all other states, but not Bavaria. While virtually independent,<ref>{{cite book|title=Political Europe|last1=The Economist|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-27793-8|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC}}</ref> at the federal level the parties form a common [[CDU/CSU]] faction. No [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] has ever come from the CSU, although Strauß and [[Edmund Stoiber]] were CDU/CSU candidates for Chancellor in the [[1980 West German federal election|1980 federal election]] and the [[2002 German federal election|2002 federal election]], respectively, which were both won by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Below the federal level, the parties are entirely independent.<ref>{{cite book|title=Germany: A Country Study|last1=Solsten|first1=Eric|year=1999|publisher=DANE Publishing|location=Quezon|isbn=978-0-521-27793-8|page=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC}}</ref>

Since its formation, the CSU has been more [[conservatism|conservative]] than the CDU.<ref name="Robertson 296"/>{{example needed |date=October 2018}} The CSU and the state of Bavaria decided not to sign the ''[[Grundgesetz]]'' of the Federal Republic of Germany as they could not agree with the [[division of Germany]] into two states after [[World War II]]. Although Bavaria like all German states has a separate police and justice system (distinctive and non-federal), the CSU has actively participated in all political affairs of the German Parliament, the German government, the German Bundesrat, the parliamentary elections of the German President, the European Parliament and meetings with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Russia.

Like the CDU, the CSU is [[pro-European]], although some [[Eurosceptic]] tendencies were shown in the past.<ref name="CSU zur EU">{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article185909652/Kloster-Seeon-2019-Warum-sich-die-CSU-ploetzlich-so-EU-freundlich-gibt.html|title=Plötzlich entdeckt die CSU ihre Zuneigung zur EU wieder|website=WELT|date=21 December 2018|accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>
