'''ARRAY,''' also known as '''ARRAY Now,''' is an independent distribution company launched by film maker and former publicist [[Ava DuVernay]] in 2010 under the name African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement (AFFRM). In 2015 the company rebranded itself as ARRAY.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Todd|title=Ava DuVernay’s AFFRM Rebrands as ARRAY, Acquires 2 Films|url=https://www.thewrap.com/ava-duvernays-affrm-rebrands-as-array-acquires-2-films/|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>

==History==
[[Ava DuVernay|DuVernay]] launched the company in 2010 after her debut feature film ''[[I Will Follow (film)|I Will Follow]]'' failed to acquire distribution.

In May 2015 [[Ava DuVernay|DuVernay]] held a 12-hour Rebel-a-thon on Twitter to raise funds for the company. For 12 hours black directors like [[Ryan Coogler]], [[John Singleton]], [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]], [[Tina Mabry]], [[Julie Dash]] and more answered questions from the general public in order to raise awareness for ARRAY and encourage people to donate funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|title=Ava DuVernay Wants You to Be a Rebel and Join the Movement for Diverse Films|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/ava-duvernay-wants-you-to-be-a-rebel-and-join-the-movement-for-diverse-films-20150527|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Ashley|title=Ava DuVernay's Rebel-a-Thon offers symposium for black film-makers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/28/ava-duvernay-rebel-a-thon-black-film-makers-symposium|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Actors [[Thandie Newton]], [[Kerry Washington]] and [[Jessica Chastain]] were among those who made substantial donations to the company.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whipp|first1=Glenn|title=Aiming to diversify storytelling, Ava DuVernay expands scope of film distribution collective|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ava-duvernay-20150908-story.html|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>

In 2016 ARRAY inked a deal partnering with [[Netflix]] to distribute their films online.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Santos |first1=Nix |title=Ava Duvernay’s Array Releasing Partners With Netflix to Unleash ‘Ashes and Embers’ |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/ava-duvernays-array-releasing-partners-with-netflix-to-unleash-ashes-and-embers-63767/ |accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> Since 2016 all ARRAY films have appeared exclusively on [[Netflix]].

In 2019 the company created the Amanda cinema, named after founder [[Ava DuVernay]]'s aunt, that was exclusively dedicated to showing films by people of color.
