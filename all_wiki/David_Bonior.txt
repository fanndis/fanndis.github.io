'''David Edward Bonior''' (born June 6, 1945) is an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the US state of [[Michigan]]. First elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1976, Bonior served as [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic whip]] in the House from 1991 to 2002, during which time Democrats were in both the majority (1991–1995) and minority (1995–2002), making Bonior the third and second highest-ranking Democrat in the House, respectively. 

During his tenure in office, Bonior was the public face of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA),<ref>Akers, Mary Ann.

==Early life==
Bonior was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Irene (Gavreluk) and Edward Bonior.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLiQ3FEHEfUC&pg=PA126&dq=Irene%20Gavreluk%20Bonior|title=Walking to Mackinac|first=David E.|last=Bonior|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472087975|accessdate=October 24, 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref> He traces his family history from [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]].<ref name=macomb>{{dead link|date=October 2016}}{{cite web|title=A Family Journey into Industrial America|url=http://www.macomb.edu/Calendar/2012-09-21+Family+Journey.htm|publisher=Macomb Community College|accessdate=7 September 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=ukrweek>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499111.shtml GREETINGS, CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (8 December 1991)</ref> He graduated from [[Notre Dame High School (Harper Woods, Michigan)|Notre Dame High School]] in [[Harper Woods, Michigan]], in 1963, where he excelled in sports. He received a B.A. from the [[University of Iowa]], where he also played football and became a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, in 1967. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Chapman University|Chapman College]] in [[Orange, California]], in 1972. 

He served in the [[United States Air Force]] during the peak of the [[Vietnam War]] from 1968 to 1972, though not in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He was a founder of the Vietnam Era Veterans Caucus on Capitol Hill and was a strong supporter of the Vietnam veterans' movement.

==Political career==
Bonior was a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] member of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]] from 1973 to 1976. In 1976, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|Michigan's 12th District]] (based in [[Macomb County]]) for the [[95th United States Congress|95th]] and to the twelve succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1977 to January 3, 2003. His district was renumbered as the 10th in 1993, after Michigan lost a House seat as a result of the [[1990 United States Census]].

From 1991 to 2002, Bonior was the House Democratic Whip. He served as [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] in the [[102nd United States Congress|102nd]] and [[103rd United States Congress|103rd]] Congresses. He was [[Minority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Whip]] for the [[104th United States Congress|104th]] through [[107th United States Congress|107th]] Congresses. While the Democrats were in the majority, Bonior was the third-ranking Democrat in the House, behind [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Tom Foley]] and [[House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Gephardt]].  While they were in the minority, Bonior was second-in-command behind Gephardt.

In Congress, Bonior generally had a progressive voting record, but opposed abortion in most cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_1_39/ai_94079351|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1991 he strongly supported recognition of [[Ukraine]] as an independent nation and was critical of the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush#Soviet Union|Bush administration]] on that matter.<ref name=ukrweek/>

For most of his tenure in Congress, Bonior represented a fairly compact district in Macomb and [[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair]] counties northeast of Detroit.  However, after the [[2000 United States Census]], Michigan lost one of its 16 seats in the House of Representatives. The redistricting process was controlled by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] majority in the state legislature, and Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] was shifted from the 10th District to the 12th District. That district had long been represented by Democrat [[Sandy Levin]], a longtime friend of Bonior's.  At the same time, the state legislature radically altered the 10th, extending it all the way to [[the Thumb]]. The new district was considerably more rural and Republican than its predecessor; [[George W. Bush]] narrowly won the old 10th, but would have won the new 10th by a large margin. By all accounts, the 10th had been redrawn for popular Republican [[Michigan Secretary of State]] and Macomb County resident [[Candice Miller]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Due to this, Bonior did not run for reelection to the House, and chose to run for [[Governor of Michigan]], stepping down as House Democratic Whip in early 2002; [[Nancy Pelosi]] of California succeeded him as Whip. He lost in a heavily contested primary between former Governor [[James Blanchard]], and then-[[Michigan Attorney General]] and eventual nominee [[Jennifer Granholm]], who went on to win the general election. As expected, Miller easily won Bonior's House seat and held it until retiring in 2016. Proving how Republican the new district is, no Democratic nominee has won more than 40% of the vote since Bonior retired.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Post-congressional career==
Following his retirement from the House, Bonior became a professor of [[trade union|labor studies]] at [[Wayne State University]],<ref>Wayne State University Public Relations.
