==Personal life==
Beers earned a bachelor's degree from [[Dartmouth College]] and a master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' described Beers as "always a Democrat, though he served in several Republican administrations and says he voted for only one Republican: [[Spiro T. Agnew]] for [[1966 Maryland gubernatorial election|governor of Maryland in 1966]]".<ref>"The New Team", ''New York Times'', February 22, 2014, [http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/new_team/show/rand-beers Retrieved 2014-06-27]</ref>

==John McCain controversy==

Beers stirred up controversy with remarks<ref>[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/06/top-dem-mccain.html 'Top Dem: McCain 'Limited' by POW Years']</ref> he made at an event hosted by the [[Center for American Progress]] in June 2008.  The event, dubbed "McCain University," was a comprehensive effort to illustrate [[John McCain]]'s policy proposals in the context of the 2008 Presidential Election.  During the question and answer portion of the event, Beers noted that "his [John McCain's] national security experience [...] is sadly limited" due to the fact that "he was in isolation essentially for many of those years and did not experience the turmoil here or the challenges that were involved for those of us who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam war." McCain, a captured [[U.S. Navy]] aviator, was a [[prisoner of war]] of the [[North Vietnam]]ese government for several years, and was repeatedly tortured.  Beers's comments elicited widespread criticism from conservative observers such as [[Rush Limbaugh]]<ref>[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_070108/content/01125100.guest.html Rush Limbaugh Website, Comment on Rand Beers Remarks]</ref> and [[Karl Rove]],<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,374643,00.html Karl Rove Fox News]</ref> as well as a variety of right-wing blogs.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2194565/ Blog]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2011}}
