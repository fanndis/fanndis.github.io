It has been alleged that Clegg joined the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]] between 1986 and 1987. Clegg has maintained he has "no recollection of that whatsoever".

Clegg next moved to [[Brussels]], where he worked alongside [[Guy Spier]] for six months as a trainee in the G24 co-ordination unit which delivered aid to the countries of the former [[Soviet Union]]. After the internship he studied for a master's degree at the [[College of Europe]] in [[Bruges]], a university for European studies in Belgium, where he met his wife, [[Miriam González Durántez]], a lawyer and the daughter of a Spanish senator.<ref name="typepad1"/> Nick Clegg is an alumnus of the "[[College of Europe#Promotions|Mozart Promotion]]" (1991–92) of the College of Europe.<ref>[[Dieter Mahncke]], [[Léonce Bekemans]], [[Robert Picht]], ''The College of Europe.

==Careers before politics==
Between 1992 and 1993, he was employed by GJW Government Relations Ltd, which lobbied on behalf of [[Libya]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/ian-burrell-skeleton-of-gaddafi-is-dragged-out-of-cleggs-closet-1949619.html "Ian Burrell: Skeleton of Gaddafi is dragged out of Clegg's closet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424192731/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/ian-burrell-skeleton-of-gaddafi-is-dragged-out-of-cleggs-closet-1949619.html |date=24 April 2010 }}, The Independent. 21 April 2010.

In 1993, Clegg won the inaugural ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}} David Thomas Prize, in remembrance of an ''FT'' journalist killed on assignment in [[Kuwait]] in 1991. He was later sent to Hungary, where he wrote articles about the mass privatisation of industries in the former [[Eastern Bloc|communist bloc]].<ref name="typepad1"/>

He took up a post at the [[European Commission]] in April 1994, working in the [[Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States|TACIS]] aid programme to the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]]. For two years, Clegg was responsible for developing direct aid programmes in Central Asia and the [[Caucasus]] worth €50&nbsp;million. He was involved in negotiations with Russia on airline overflight rights, and launched a conference in [[Tashkent]] in 1993 that founded [[TRACECA]]—an international transport programme for the development of a [[transport corridor]] for Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-President]] and [[European Commissioner for Trade|Trade Commissioner]] [[Leon Brittan]] then offered him a job in his private office, as a European Union policy adviser and speechwriter. As part of this role, Clegg was in charge of the EC negotiating team on Chinese and Russian accession talks to the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref name="typepad1"/>

===Written publications===
Clegg has written extensively, publishing and contributing to a large number of pamphlets and books. With [[Richard Grayson (academic)|Dr Richard Grayson]] he wrote a book in 2002 about the importance of devolution in secondary education systems, based on comparative research across Europe. The final conclusions included the idea of [[pupil premium]]s so that children from poorer backgrounds receive the additional resources their educational needs require.

He wrote a controversial pamphlet for the Centre for European Reform advocating devolution and evolution of the European Union, and contributed to the 2004 ''[[The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism|Orange Book]]'', where he offered [[Classical liberalism|market liberal]] solutions for reform of European institutions.<ref name="orangebook"/> He co-authored a pamphlet with Duncan Brack arguing for a wholesale reform of world trade rules to allow room for a greater emphasis on development, internationally binding environmental treaties, and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] within the WTO system.

==Member of the European Parliament (1999–2004)==
In 1998, Clegg was selected as the lead Liberal Democrat candidate for the [[European Parliament]] in the [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands]] constituency; the following year, [[Paddy Ashdown]] was first to tip him as a politician to watch.<ref name="cleggbackground">{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7046587.stm|title =The Nick Clegg story|work =BBC News|accessdate =6 February 2008|date =19 December 2007|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071022113141/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7046587.stm|archivedate =22 October 2007|df =dmy-all}}</ref> On his election in 1999, he was the first Liberal parliamentarian elected in the [[East Midlands]] since [[Ernest Harold Pickering|Ernest Pickering]] was elected MP for [[Leicester West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester West]] in 1931, and was credited with helping to significantly boost the Liberal Democrat poll rating in the region in the six months after his election. Clegg worked extensively during his time as an MEP to support the party in the region, not least in [[Chesterfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterfield]] where [[Paul Holmes (politician)|Paul Holmes]] was elected as MP in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. Clegg helped persuade Conservative MEP [[Bill Newton Dunn]] to defect to the Liberal Democrats, with Newton Dunn subsequently succeeding him as MEP for the East Midlands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/scotsman-edinburgh-scotland-the/mi_7951/is_2010_April_17/profile-nick-clegg-cactus-burner/ai_n53209100/ |title=Articles in 17 April 2010 issue of Scotsman (Edinburgh, Scotland) |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=17 April 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2004, Clegg explained to the [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] on European Union that the aim of MEPs like himself, who had been active in the debate on the EU's negotiating mandate, was to obtain the right to ratify any major WTO deal entered into by the European Union.<ref>{{cite web |author=The Committee Office, House of Lords |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldselect/ldeucom/104/10406.htm |title=Publications.parliament.uk |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616201402/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldselect/ldeucom/104/10406.htm |archivedate=16 June 2013  }}</ref> That same year he chaired a policy working group for the Liberal Democrats on the [[Old age#Third age|Third Age]], which focused on the importance of ending the cliff-edge of retirement and providing greater opportunities for older people to remain active beyond retirement. The group developed initial proposals on transforming post offices to help them survive as community hubs, in particular for older people. He served on [[Charles Kennedy]]'s policy review, "Meeting the Challenge", and the "It's About Freedom" working parties.

Clegg, for four years whilst an MEP, wrote a fortnightly column for ''[[TheGuardian.com|Guardian Unlimited]]''. One particular article in 2002 accused [[Gordon Brown]] of encouraging "condescension" towards Germany. In an article, Clegg wrote that "all nations have a cross to bear, and none more so than Germany with its memories of Nazism. But the British cross is more insidious still. A misplaced sense of superiority, sustained by delusions of grandeur and a tenacious obsession with the last war, is much harder to shake off".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/randall-and-rentoul-unleashed-election-oscars-2010-1969217.html |title=Randall and Rentoul unleashed: Election Oscars 2010 – UK Politics, UK |work=The Independent |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512155857/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/randall-and-rentoul-unleashed-election-oscars-2010-1969217.html |archivedate=12 May 2010  }}</ref> The article was dusted down during the 2010 general election campaign when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' interpreted the article as being a "Nazi slur on Britain" and Clegg had begun to feel the full heat of the British tabloid press following his success during the first [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010|leaders' debate]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Chancellor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/23/get-clegg-campaign-backfire-press |title=This Clegg campaign could backfire on the press |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910093700/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/23/get-clegg-campaign-backfire-press |archivedate=10 September 2013  }}</ref>

==Parliamentary candidate==
On leaving the European Parliament, Clegg joined political lobbying firm GPlus in April 2004 as a fifth partner:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpluseurope.com/archive.html|title=GPlus welcomes Clegg as Fifth Partner|publisher=GPlus Europe|date=30 April 2004|accessdate=20 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427201724/http://www.gpluseurope.com/archive.html|archivedate=27 April 2010}}</ref>

In November 2004, [[Richard Allan]], the then Liberal Democrat MP for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]], announced his intention to stand down from the House of Commons. Clegg was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate. He took up a part-time teaching position in the politics department of the [[University of Sheffield]], combining it with ongoing EU consultancy work with GPlus. He also gave a series of seminar lectures in the [[international relations]] Department of the University of Cambridge.

==Member of Parliament (2005–2017)==
Clegg worked closely with Allan throughout the campaign in Sheffield Hallam—including starring in a local pantomime—and won the seat in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] with over 50% of the vote, and a majority of 8,682.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-1280,00.html |title=2005 general election: Sheffield Hallam |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 November 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309201212/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0%2C%2C-1280%2C00.html |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This result represents one of the smallest swings away from a party in a seat where an existing MP has been succeeded by a newcomer (4.3%).

Following his election to parliament, Clegg was promoted by leader [[Charles Kennedy]] to be the party's spokesperson on Europe, focusing on the party's preparations for an expected referendum on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European constitution]] and acting as deputy to Foreign Affairs Spokesperson [[Menzies Campbell]]. Clegg's ability to articulate liberal values at a very practical level quickly lent him prominence, with many{{who|date=April 2017}} already seeing him as a future Liberal Democrat leader.

===Liberal Democrats' Home Affairs spokesperson===
After the 2006 leadership election, Clegg was promoted to be Home Affairs spokesperson, replacing [[Mark Oaten]]. In this job he spearheaded the Liberal Democrats' defence of civil liberties, proposing a Freedom Bill to repeal what he described as "unnecessary and illiberal legislation",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/8746 |title=Why we need a Freedom Bill |first=Nick |last=Clegg |publisher=eGov Monitor |date=27 November 2006 |accessdate=2 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927044249/http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/8746 |archivedate=27 September 2007  }}</ref> campaigning against [[National identity card (United Kingdom)|Identity Cards]] and the retention of innocent people's DNA, and arguing against excessive counter-terrorism legislation. He has campaigned for prison reform, a liberal approach to immigration, and defended the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] against ongoing attacks from across the political spectrum. In January 2007, Clegg launched the 'We Can Cut Crime!' campaign, "proposing real action at a national level and acting to cut crime where the Liberal Democrats are in power locally".<ref name="wecancutcrime">{{cite web|year =2007|url =http://www.wecancutcrime.com/|title =We Can Cut Crime!|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2 June 2008|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080531075904/http://www.wecancutcrime.com/|archivedate =31 May 2008|df =dmy-all}}</ref>

===Relationships with the frontbench===
Upon his election Clegg appointed leadership rival Huhne as his replacement as Home Affairs spokesperson and following his strong performances as acting party leader, Vince Cable was retained as the main Treasury spokesperson. Media commentators noted that the Clegg-Huhne-Cable triumvirate provided the Liberal Democrats with an effective political team for the coming years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2007/12/familiar_recipe.html |title=A familiar recipe |authorlink=Nick Robinson (journalist)|last=Robinson |first=Nick |work=Nick Robinson's newslog |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220202048/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2007/12/familiar_recipe.html |archivedate=20 December 2007  }}</ref> On 5 March 2008, Clegg suffered a real test following the resignation of three of his front bench team.

Clegg said "though we have disagreed on this issue I fully understand and respect their strongly held views on the subject.... However, as they have recognised, the shadow cabinet cannot operate effectively unless the principle of collective responsibility is maintained."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7279805.stm |title=Senior Lib Dems quit over Euro vote |work=BBC News |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309002819/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7279805.stm |archivedate=9 March 2008  }}</ref>

The Speaker's authority was called into question when, led by Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats marched out of the House of Commons, calling the Speaker's decision a constitutional "outrage". Just moments earlier, frontbench foreign affairs spokesman for the party [[Ed Davey]] had been expelled from the chamber by the Speaker's deputy, Sir [[Michael Lord]], for further challenging the ruling.<ref>{{cite news |last=Helm |first=Toby |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/1579987/Lib-Dems-walkout-over-Michael-Martins-ruling.html |title=Lib Dems walk out over Michael Martin's ruling |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

In November 2008, Clegg suffered more allegations of difficulties with the front bench following an article in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that reported that Clegg had criticised senior members of his front bench whilst on a plane journey.

===Parliamentary expenses===
[[File:Clegg Victory for the Gurkhas.jpg|left|thumb|Clegg with [[David Cameron]], and [[Chris Huhne]] in 2009]]
Clegg became the first party leader in modern political history to call for a Speaker of the House of Commons to resign, describing then-Speaker Michael Martin, following his handling of the expenses scandal, as a defender of the status quo and an obstacle to the reform of Parliament.<ref name="typepad1"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6304632.ece |title=Speaker Michael Martin's position weakens Nick Clegg breaks rank |work=The Times |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2009 |location=London |first=Sam |last=Coates |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519004406/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6304632.ece |archivedate=19 May 2009  }}</ref>

In response to revelations about MPs' expenses, Clegg set out his plans for reform of Parliament in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/27/nick-clegg-a-new-politics |title=Nick Clegg: Bar the gates.

He argued for the "reinvention of British politics" within 100 days, calling for a commitment to accept the Kelly expenses report in full; the power to [[recall election|recall]] members suspended for misconduct; [[House of Lords]] reform; reform of party funding; fixed-term parliaments; enabling legislation for a referendum on [[Alternative Vote Top-up|AV+]]; and changes to House of Commons procedure to reduce executive power.<ref name="takebackpower1"/>

Shortly ahead of the election, Clegg was asked about his own expenses by [[Andrew Neil]] of the BBC. Clegg allegedly claimed the full amount permissible under the Additional Cost Allowance, including claims for food, gardening and redecorating his second home. ''The Telegraph'' also said Clegg claimed £80 for international call charges, a claim he said he would repay.<ref>{{cite news |last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5314418/How-Nick-Clegg-pushed-expenses-claims-to-the-limit-MPs-expenses.html |title=Nick Clegg |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 December 2005 |accessdate=13 May 2009 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516231442/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5314418/How-Nick-Clegg-pushed-expenses-claims-to-the-limit-MPs-expenses.html |archivedate=16 May 2009  }}</ref>

===Perspective===
Clegg aimed to modernise the Liberal Democrat Party at the same time as maintaining its traditions of political and philosophical Liberalism. In 2011, he told a party conference that the Liberal Democrats were [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] in orientation:

<blockquote>
Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre.<ref>

When he became leader of the Liberal Democrats, Clegg called for more choice for patients on waiting lists in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), giving them the option to go private and to be funded by the NHS if they wish; a substantial tax cut to "put more money back into the pockets of people", better action on the environment, the abandonment of Britain's Trident missile-defence system, [[Fixed-term election|fixed-term parliaments]]; devolving more power to local councils; giving constituents the power to force a by-election if their MP was found responsible for serious wrongdoing; and a slimming of government across the board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://network.libdems.org.uk/manifesto2010/libdem_manifesto_2010.pdf |title=Liberal Democrats Manifesto for 2010 General Election |accessdate=20 April 2010 |publisher=The Liberal Democrats |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219211028/http://network.libdems.org.uk/manifesto2010/libdem_manifesto_2010.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2011 }}

===Gurkha campaign===

On 29 April 2009 the Liberal Democrats proposed in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to offer all Gurkhas an equal right of residence; the motion resulted in a defeat for the Government by 267 votes to 246. It was the only first day motion defeat for a government since 1978. On speaking about the result Clegg said "this is an immense victory [...] for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice, a victory for Parliament, a victory for decency". He added that it was "the kind of thing people want this country to do".<ref>Brown defeated over Gurkha rules {{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm |title=Brown defeated over Gurkha rules |accessdate=3 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506202727/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm |archivedate=6 May 2009  |date=29 April 2009 }}

On 21 May 2009, the Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith]] announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years' service could settle in the UK. The actress and daughter of Gurkha corps Major James Lumley, [[Joanna Lumley]], who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights, commented: "This is the welcome we have always longed to give".<ref>BBC News – Gurkhas win right to settle in UK {{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm |title=Gurkhas win right to settle in UK |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523012535/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm |archivedate=23 May 2009  |date=21 May 2009 }}</ref>

===Coalition Agreement===
{{Main|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement}}
The morning after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] presented the country with no single political party able to form a government that would command a majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], since the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Harold Wilson]] falling short of a majority. In light of this reality the Conservative leader, David Cameron, went public and gave a "big, open and comprehensive offer" to the Liberal Democrats' leader and said that he wanted to open up negotiations with them to form Britain's first [[coalition government]] since [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Churchill war ministry|war ministry]] during the Second World War. In reply, Clegg said that he had always maintained that the party with the most seats and the most votes should have the right to seek to govern. Speaking to the press he said: "It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party which has more votes and more seats – although not an absolute majority – which is why I now think that it is the Conservative Party which should seek to govern in the national interest."<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7119359.ece The Times | David Cameron opens talks with Liberal Democrats after election results in hung parliament] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601204318/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7119359.ece |date=1 June 2010 }}</ref>

Following the announcement, teams of negotiators from both parties formulated what would become the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition Agreement]] which would form the basis of their partnership together.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8674103.stm |title=Hung parliament Labour close to conceding defeat |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906140749/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8674103.stm |archivedate=6 September 2017  }}</ref> [[Gordon Brown|Gordon Brown's]] resignation on 11 May 2010 meant that Cameron was invited by the Queen to form a government<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8675265.stm |title=David Cameron becomes Britains new prime minister |work=BBC News |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906140341/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8675265.stm |archivedate=6 September 2017  }}</ref> and a coalition with the Liberal Democrats was agreed, with Nick Clegg as the [[Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy PM]] and [[Lord President of the Council]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8677552.stm |title=Timeline: How the coalition unfolded |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906140456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8677552.stm |archivedate=6 September 2017  }}</ref> The initial agreement was published on 12 May 2010. It consisted of a seven-page document, in 11 sections. In the foreword, it stated "These are the issues that needed to be resolved between us in order for us to work together as a strong and stable government". Of the 57 Liberal Democrat MPs, only two ([[Charles Kennedy]] and [[John Leech (politician)|John Leech]]) refused to support the Conservative Coalition agreement.<ref name="nextleft.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.nextleft.org/2010/09/john-leech-voted-against-coalition-but.html|title=John Leech did not vote for the coalition - but who is the third man?|publisher=Next Left}}</ref>

===Plans for electoral reform===

====Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill====
{{Main|Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011}}

On 5 July 2010, Clegg unveiled plans to have fewer MPs and to hold a referendum on the voting system so that the next general election would be contested under the Alternative Vote system. In a statement, he said UK democracy was "fractured", with some votes counting more than others. As part of the statement he also changed initial plans requiring the number of MPs needed to vote to dissolve Parliament from 55% to 66%. The [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011|Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill]] was presented to parliament on 22 July 2010 for its first reading which if successful would see the date of the referendum on changing the voting system from the current 'first past the post' system to the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] (AV) system set for 5 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/parliamentaryvotingsystemandconstituencies.html |title=Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 |publisher=Parliament of the UK |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725090205/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/parliamentaryvotingsystemandconstituencies.html |archivedate=25 July 2010  }}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10516429.stm |title=Nick Clegg outlines plans for electoral reform |work=BBC News |date=5 July 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708213338/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10516429.stm |archivedate=8 July 2010  }}</ref>

The bill also introduced plans to reduce the number of MP's in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, something the Labour party attacked as [[gerrymandering]], as to do this there would need to be boundary changes. Clegg told MPs: "Together, these proposals help correct the deep unfairness in the way we hold elections in this country. Under the current set-up, votes count more in some parts of the country than others, and millions feel that their votes don't count at all. Elections are won and lost in a small minority of seats. We have a fractured democracy, where some people's votes count and other people's votes don't count."<ref name="bbc"/> On 22 July 2010, the question for the referendum on AV was published, asking voters if they wish to "adopt the 'alternative vote' system instead of the current 'first past the post' system" for electing MPs". The question required a yes or no answer.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10729454 |title=AV referendum question published |publisher=BBC |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216054218/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10729454 |archivedate=16 December 2010  }}</ref> The Act received Royal Assent on 16 February 2011. The result of the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum]] was that the alternative vote proposal was defeated by a margin of 2:1.

====Fixed-term Parliaments Bill====
{{Main|Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011}}

Clegg also confirmed that the government planned to introduce legislation for five-year fixed-term parliaments, with elections to be held on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, starting with 7 May 2015. The corresponding bill was presented to parliament on 22 July 2010 and the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] received Royal Assent on 15 September 2011.

===Prime Minister's Questions===
[[File:Rutte-Clegg.jpg|thumb|Nick Clegg with the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] [[Mark Rutte]] on 15 November 2010]]
On 21 July 2010, Clegg became the first Liberal Democrat leader to answer for [[Prime minister's questions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/clegg+yarlaposs+wood+will+close/3718532 |title=Government clarifies Clegg's PMQ remarks |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925174439/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/clegg+yarlaposs+wood+will+close/3718532 |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}</ref> He courted controversy during the exchange when at the despatch box he attacked Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor [[Jack Straw]] for the decision to invade Iraq, saying "perhaps one day you could account for your role in the most disastrous decision of all, which is the illegal [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]." Despite having long-held views about the issue, the comment was controversial, as it did not reflect the policy of the government, which was that the legality of the war in Iraq was currently being studied by the Iraq inquiry.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-under-pressure-after-illegal-war-comment-2032768.html |title=Clegg under pressure after Iraq war comment |work=The Independent |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |first=Alan |last=Jones |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725073059/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-under-pressure-after-illegal-war-comment-2032768.html |archivedate=25 July 2010  }}</ref>

Clegg next stepped in for Prime Minister's Questions on 8 September 2010 following the news that Cameron's father had taken very ill. Standing in for the Labour deputy leader [[Harriet Harman]], Jack Straw challenged Clegg on the allegations of phone hacking against Downing Street's director of communications [[Andy Coulson]]. Responding, Clegg claimed that the allegations dating from Coulson's time at the ''[[News of the World phone hacking affair|News of the World]]'' were a matter for the police to investigate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nick-clegg-challenged-on-phonehacking-row-2073687.html |title=Clegg challenged on phone hacking row |work=The Independent |date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114061440/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nick-clegg-challenged-on-phonehacking-row-2073687.html |archivedate=14 November 2010  }}</ref> On 10 November 2010, as Cameron was making a trade visit to China, Clegg deputised for the third time, meeting Harman across the despatch box. On a day that coincided with violent student protests against tuition fees in London, the Labour deputy leader chose the same subject to quiz Clegg, accusing him of a U-turn on pledges made before the election. Responding, Clegg accused Harman of trying to re-position Labour as the party of students when the party had previously campaigned against fees only to end up introducing them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/11/prime-minister-deputy-fees |title=Clegg attacked on tuition fees at PMQ's |work=New Statesman |accessdate=21 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114132627/http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/11/prime-minister-deputy-fees |archivedate=14 November 2010  }}</ref>

===Tuition fees===
{{Main|Tuition fees in the United Kingdom}}

The issue of student financing had been considered one of the flagship policies of the Liberal Democrats with all of the party's MPs, including Nick Clegg, signing the [[Vote for Students pledge]] to oppose any increase in student tuition fees prior to the 2010 general election.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Watt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/12/lib-dems-tuition-fees-clegg |title=Lib dems planned before election to abandon tuition fees pledge |work=The Guardian |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105054215/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/12/lib-dems-tuition-fees-clegg |archivedate=5 November 2013  }}</ref> As part of the coalition agreement the Lib Dems abandoned their pledge to oppose any increase in tuition fees but gained permission to abstain on any vote relating to the increase of tuition fees. The [[Browne Review]] recommended that the present cap on student fees be lifted, potentially paving the way for universities to charge much higher fees in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638 |title=BBC The Browne review Q&A |publisher=BBC |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216044737/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638 |archivedate=16 December 2010  }}</ref>

Clegg wrote to his MPs saying that he had "struggled endlessly" with the issue and said that departing from the pledge he had made prior to the election would be "one of the most difficult decisions of my political career". Defending recommendations of the review, Clegg said that poorer students would pay less since the income level at which students needed to earn before beginning to pay off their student loan would rise from £15,000 to £21,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11537333 |title=Clegg urges MP's to think before opposing Browne review |work=BBC News |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016065708/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11537333 |archivedate=16 October 2010  }}</ref>

During an interview on 24 October 2010 with the BBC's [[Andrew Marr]], Clegg said that he "regretted" not being able to keep his pre-election policy to scrap tuition fees but claimed that this was a result of the financial situation the country had found itself in.<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Sharp|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11615212|title=Tuition fee increases will be capped says Clegg|work=BBC News|date=24 October 2010|accessdate=27 October 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027010151/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11615212|archivedate=27 October 2010}}</ref>

On 19 September 2012, Clegg apologised, not for breaking his pledge, but for having "made a promise we weren't absolutely sure we could deliver".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19646731 |title=Senior Lib Dems apologise over tuition fees pledge |work=BBC News |date=20 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919201227/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19646731 |archivedate=19 September 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/09/20/watch-nick-clegg-s-tuition-fees-apology |title=Watch: Nick Clegg's tuition fees apology |publisher=Politics.co.uk |date=20 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006065815/http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/09/20/watch-nick-clegg-s-tuition-fees-apology |archivedate=6 October 2012  }}</ref> The apology was [[Nick Clegg Says I'm Sorry (The Autotune Remix)|parodied in a song]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo |title=The Nick Clegg Apology Song: I'm Sorry (The Autotune Remix) |publisher=YouTube |date=19 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106015807/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo |archivedate=6 January 2016  }}</ref>

===Fairness premium===
On 14 October 2010, Clegg delivered a speech at a school in [[Chesterfield]], at which he announced the government's intention to spend £7&nbsp;billion on a 'fairness premium' designed to see extra support going to the poorest pupils over the course of the parliament. Clegg claimed that the funds for the scheme would be "additional" to the current education budget and this view was backed up by a [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]] aide who when interviewed by ''The Guardian'' said "the money for this will come from outside the education budget. We're not just rearranging furniture – this is real new money from elsewhere in Whitehall."<ref>{{cite news |first=Allegra |last=Stratton |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/15/nick-clegg-pupil-premium |title=Nick Clegg secures £7&nbsp;billion for fairness premium |work=The Guardian |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105052327/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/15/nick-clegg-pupil-premium |archivedate=5 November 2013  }}</ref> The package announced would provide 15 hours a week free nursery education for the poorest two-year-olds and a 'pupil premium' which would be given to schools to help those pupils eligible for free school meals worth £2.5&nbsp;billion a year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8066263/Nick-Clegg-poor-children-will-receive-7bn-fairness-premium.html |title=Poor pupils will receive £7bn fairness premium |work=The Telegraph |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |first1=Laura |last1=Roberts |first2=Graeme |last2=Paton |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018055854/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8066263/Nick-Clegg-poor-children-will-receive-7bn-fairness-premium.html |archivedate=18 October 2010  }}</ref>

The announcement by Clegg ensured that two elements of the government's Coalition Agreement had been fulfilled, that of the promise to support free nursery care to pre-school children and that of funding a 'significant premium for disadvantaged pupils from outside the schools budget by reductions in spending elsewhere'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409088/pfg_coalition.pdf |title=The Coalition: our programme for government |accessdate=27 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018123329/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409088/pfg_coalition.pdf |archive-date=18 October 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> For Clegg the announcement was an important one politically coming two days after the publication of the Browne Review into the future of university funding which signalled the reversal of the long cherished Liberal Democrat policy of opposing any increase in tuition fees.<ref>{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Simon |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413872&c=1 |title=Poor students could benefit from £7bn pupil premium |work=Times Higher Education |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119170058/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413872&c=1 |archivedate=19 November 2011  |date=15 October 2010 }}</ref> The pupil premium announcement was important as it formed one of the four key 'priorities' on which the party had fought the last election.<ref name="libdems6"/> On 20 October 2010, the plans for the 'fairness premium' were introduced by the Treasury as part of the spending review which said that the money would be introduced over the period of the review which "will support the poorest in the early years and at every stage of their education".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spend_sr2010_fairness.htm |title=Spending review – Fairness |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023083405/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spend_sr2010_fairness.htm |archivedate=23 October 2010  }}</ref>

===Bank shares===
In June 2011, Clegg proposed that more than 46&nbsp;million people would be handed shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group under the "people's bank" plan. The plan proposes that ordinary voters would be able to profit from any increase in the value of their shares once the Treasury has recouped taxpayers' money used for the bail-out – an offer that could eventually be worth up to £1,000 to householders. Clegg said that it was "psychologically immensely important" for people to be given a stake in the banks in the wake of the financial crisis.

===House of Lords reform===
{{Main|House of Lords Reform Bill 2012}}

In August 2012, after [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012|reform of the House of Lords]] was abandoned, Clegg said the Conservatives had defied the Coalition agreement by trying to "pick and choose" which items of Government policy they support. The row marked one of the most serious crises for the Coalition since the 2010 general election. [[Jeremy Hunt]], the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, said he was "very disappointed", describing the decision as a "great shame". Clegg said that favoured by the Conservatives to make sure the Coalition is a fair and equal partnership. "My party has held to that [Coalition] contract even when it meant voting for things that we found difficult," he said. "But the Conservative party is not honouring the commitment to Lords reform and, as a result, part of our contract has now been broken." Clegg also revealed the Conservatives rejected his suggestion of a "last ditch" compromise to save both policies. "Clearly I cannot permit a situation where Conservative rebels can pick and choose the parts of the contract they like, while Liberal Democrat MPs are bound to the entire agreement," he said.<ref>Winnett, Robert. (6 August 2012) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9456720/Nick-Clegg-the-Coalition-contract-is-broken-over-Lords-and-boundary-reform.html Clegg: the Coalition contract is 'broken' over Lords and boundary reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809010740/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9456720/Nick-Clegg-the-Coalition-contract-is-broken-over-Lords-and-boundary-reform.html |date=9 August 2012 }}. Telegraph.co.uk.</ref>

In September 2012, Clegg formally announced that he was "regrettably" withdrawing proposals to reform the Lords in the face of overwhelming opposition from Conservative MPs. He signalled he would exact his revenge by refusing to sack any Liberal Democrat minister who voted against changes to MPs' boundaries – which is Government policy – in retaliation over the Lords reform débâcle. Traditionally party leaders are offered peerages when they leave the House of Commons. When asked by the Member of Parliament for [[Bolsover (UK Parliament constituency)|Bolsover]] [[Dennis Skinner]], from the Labour Party, if he would take a seat in the Lords, he said: "No", adding: "I personally will not take a seat in an unreformed House of Lords. It just sticks in the throat."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9518526/Arise-Lord-Clegg-No-it-would-stick-in-my-throat-the-Deputy-Prime-Minister-says.html |title='Arise Lord Clegg?'

==Opposition (2015–2017)==
Clegg retained his Sheffield Hallam seat in the 2015 election, despite a strong campaign from Labour with a 17% swing in the vote. Clegg campaigned for Remain in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], as did all other Liberal Democrat MPs, and became the Lib Dem spokesperson for [[Department for Exiting the European Union|Exiting the European Union]] and [[Department for International Trade|International Trade]].

===Parliamentary by-elections (2008–2010)===
Five parliamentary by-elections were held during Clegg's leadership prior to the 2010 general election. At [[Crewe and Nantwich]] the party's share of the vote decreased by 4%. In the subsequent [[2008 Henley by-election|Henley by-election]] the party achieved a 1.8% increase in their vote. At the [[2009 Norwich North by-election|Norwich North by-election]] the party came third with a 2.2% fall in their vote share. The two Scottish by-elections, [[2008 Glenrothes by-election|Glenrothes]] and [[2008 Glasgow East by-election|Glasgow East]], saw decreases in the Liberal Democrat vote, 8% and 10% respectively.

===2008 and 2009 local elections===
The local election results for the Liberal Democrats during the same period were mixed. In the [[2008 United Kingdom local elections|2008 local elections]] the Liberal Democrats took second place with 25% of the vote making a net gain of 34 councillors and took control of [[Sheffield City Council]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7378924.stm Lib Dems take power in Sheffield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505060333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7378924.stm |date=5 May 2008 }} BBC News</ref> but their share of the vote was down 1%.

===2008 London elections===
In the [[2008 London Assembly election]]s the Liberal Democrats were the only one of the three main parties to see a decrease in their share of the vote, and in the [[2008 London mayoral election|mayoral election]] the Liberal Democrat candidate [[Brian Paddick]] came third again with a decreased share of the vote.

===2010 general election===
At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the Liberal Democrats won 23% of the vote, an improvement of 1%, however they only won 57 seats, 5 fewer than in 2005. No political party had an overall majority, resulting in the nation's first [[hung parliament]] since [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results Election 2010 results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414102452/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ |date=14 April 2010 }} BBC News.</ref> Talks between Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, and Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition, enabling [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] to invite Cameron to form a government.

===Parliamentary by-elections (2010 onwards)===
Since the 2010 general election, Clegg's Liberal Democrats have contested 13 by-elections in Great Britain (as of 2 March 2013).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/hcio/by-elections-2010/ |title=By-elections since the 2010 General Election – UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304131723/http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/hcio/by-elections-2010/ |archivedate=4 March 2013  }}</ref> The party scored their first by-election win of Clegg's leadership at [[2013 Eastleigh by-election|Eastleigh]] in 2013, with [[Mike Thornton (politician)|Mike Thornton]] holding the seat for the Liberal Democrats, despite a 19% swing away from the party.

They polled 32% of the vote, a small increase on 2010, but lost out to Labour whose vote was up by 10 percentage points. The Liberal Democrats also came second at [[2011 Leicester South by-election|Leicester South]] (which they had held between [[2004 Leicester South by-election|2004]] and [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]]) in May 2011 with 23% (down 4% on 2010),<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/jonathan-ashworth/27620 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202170339/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/jonathan-ashworth/27620 |date=2 February 2013 }}</ref> and at [[2012 Manchester Central by-election|Manchester Central]] in November 2012 where they polled 9% (down 17%).<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/lucy-powell/60214 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202183011/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/lucy-powell/60214 |date=2 February 2013 }}</ref>

In the remaining nine contests, Liberal Democrats have finished no higher than third place (and in [[2013 Rotherham by-election|Rotherham]] finished in an unprecedented 8th position, with just 451 votes, or 2% of the total).<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/sarah-champion/101347 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202171950/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/sarah-champion/101347 |date=2 February 2013 }}</ref> In every by-election except Oldham East and Saddleworth their vote has fallen, with decreases of over 10% recorded at eight of the contests.

In London, elections were held to the [[2012 London Assembly election|London Assembly]] and [[2012 London mayoral election|Mayoralty]].

Despite not winning any contests under their official party label, one Liberal Democrat, [[Winston Roddick]] was elected as Police and Crime Commissioner for [[North Wales Police|North Wales]] having stood as an Independent.<ref>[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2012/11/20/new-police-commissioner-says-he-didn-t-try-to-hide-lib-dem-membership-55578-32266040/ News: The latest North Wales news from] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130420024153/http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2012/11/20/new-police-commissioner-says-he-didn-t-try-to-hide-lib-dem-membership-55578-32266040/ |date=20 April 2013 }}. ''The Daily Post'' (24 May 2013).</ref> Roddick claimed that he had never hidden his party membership and that his campaign was "financed by himself with no donations or backing from any political party and he was an independent candidate in every sense of the word". His campaign also dismissed as "sour grapes" claims from the Labour Party that "the only way in which the Lib Dems thought they could win the election was by presenting themselves as independent."

===2015 and 2017 general elections===
In the 2015 general election, the Liberal Democrats were reduced from 57 seats to 8. Clegg held his Sheffield Hallam seat with a reduced majority. After his party's result, he resigned the party leadership the day after the election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-england-32644487|title=Election 2015: Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband resign as leaders|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=17 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127132933/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-england-32644487|archivedate=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633462|title=Election results: Nick Clegg resigns after Lib Dem losses|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515161631/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633462|archivedate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

==Career after Parliament==
===Brexit===
In October 2017, Clegg wrote ''[[How To Stop Brexit (And Make Britain Great Again)]]'', which made the case that [[Brexit]] was not inevitable.

In May 2018 he joined [[David Miliband]] and [[Nicky Morgan]] calling for a [[soft Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Culbertson|first=Alix|title=David Miliband joins Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan in call for soft Brexit|url=https://news.sky.com/story/david-miliband-joins-nick-clegg-and-nicky-morgan-in-call-for-soft-brexit-11370115|work=Sky News|date=14 May 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080948/https://news.sky.com/story/david-miliband-joins-nick-clegg-and-nicky-morgan-in-call-for-soft-brexit-11370115|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The next month he appeared at a [[People's Vote]] march in London to mark the second anniversary of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum of 2016]].

In July 2019 Clegg said that "aggressive and regressive [[English nationalism]]" had taken over the Conservative Party in their competition with [[Nigel Farage]], the leader of the [[Brexit Party]] established in November 2018. When asked how he expected the next few years to unfold, Clegg told the ''[[New Statesman]]'': "the clock is now ticking for the end of the union of the United Kingdom."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/105377/nick-clegg-says-tories-brexit-stance-has-left-%E2%80%98-clock|title=Nick Clegg says Tories' Brexit stance has left 'the clock ticking' towards break-up of UK|last=PoliticsHome.com|date=2019-07-17|website=PoliticsHome.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717173844/https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/105377/nick-clegg-says-tories-brexit-stance-has-left-%E2%80%98-clock|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
