"'''S&M'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] from her fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). The song was released on January 21, 2011, as the fourth single from the album. The American songwriter [[Ester Dean]] wrote "S&M" in collaboration with the producers [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]]. Backed by [[Beat (music)|bass beats]], a [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] and guitars, it is an [[uptempo]] [[Hi-NRG]] and [[Eurodance]] track with lyrics about [[sexual intercourse]], [[sadomasochism]], [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], and [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]].

Critical response to "S&M" was mixed: some critics praised its sound and composition while others criticized its overtly sexual lyrics. After it reached number two on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, a remix that features [[Britney Spears]] was released. When combined with sales of the solo version, it became Rihanna's tenth and Spears' fifth number-one single on the chart. It has been certified quintuple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and sextuple platinum in Australia. "S&M" peaked at number one in ten countries in addition to the United States while peaking within the top five in France, Germany, Ireland, Spain, and the UK.

To promote "S&M", Rihanna performed a shortened version at the [[2011 Brit Awards|31st Brit Awards]] and sang the remix with Spears at the 2011 [[2011 Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. [[Melina Matsoukas]] directed the song's music video, which was, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics. It portrays [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] sadomasochist acts and fetishes. The music video was banned in many countries and restricted to nighttime television in others. Critics complimented Rihanna's sensuality and the vibrant colors. Photographer [[David LaChapelle]] filed a lawsuit alleging that the video incorporates ideas from his photographs. Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case for an undisclosed sum of money.

==Concept and development==
[[File:Kuk Harrell.jpeg|thumb|upright|140px|left|Rihanna's vocals on "S&M" were recorded and produced by [[Kuk Harrell]].|alt=A man wearing a black suit and white converse trainers.]]

"S&M" was written by [[Ester Dean]] in collaboration with the song's producers, [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]].<ref name="LoudNotes"/> Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'': "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471195/ester-dean-talks-solo-career-writing-sm-and-firework|title=Ester Dean Talks Solo Career, Writing 'S&M' and 'Firework'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2011-05-24|accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref> Rihanna told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about her interest in [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]] and other [[sadomasochism]] activities, themes central to "S&M": "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive&nbsp;... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Joyce|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20049249-10391698.html|title=Rihanna talks Chris Brown, S&M tendencies in Rolling Stone|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>

"S&M" was recorded during Rihanna's [[Last Girl on Earth]] tour: the instrumental parts for the song were recorded by Eriksen and Miles Walker at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and the [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles, and by Vee at The Bunker Studios in Paris. Rihanna's vocals were recorded by [[Kuk Harrell]] and were produced by Harrell, Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar; Bobby Campbell assisted in the singer's vocal recording. [[Veronika Bozeman]] provided additional vocal production. The song was mixed by Vee at The Bunker Studios and by [[Phil Tan]] at The Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia; additional and assistant engineering was carried out by Damien Lewis. All instrumental production was completed by Eriksen, Hermansen and Vee.<ref name="LoudNotes"/>

==Critical reception==
"S&M" received mixed responses from music critics.

(Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Skin (Rihanna song)|Skin]]", were songs which allowed Rihanna to boast about how good she is in certain situations, as she did on ''Rated R''. He chose the lyrics "I may be bad/ but I'm perfectly good at it... Chains and whips excite me" as an example of her [[Boasting|vaunt]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Conner |first=Thomas |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127070714/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510%2Cconner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article |archive-date=2010-11-27 |title='Loud' a well-deserved party for Rihanna |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2010-11-19 |access-date=2011-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Steve Jones opined that "''Loud''{{'}}s pulsating opener, 'S&M,' makes it clear from the jump where [Rihanna is] headed as she acknowledges that 'chains and whips excite [her]'",<ref name="SteveJones">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Steve|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-11-16-listen16_ST_N.htm|title=Listen Up: Rihanna is living out 'Loud' on new album|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> while Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called "S&M" an "explicitly carnal opener" with "late-night-[[Cinemax]] naughtiness".<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20440920,00.html|title=Loud |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2010-11-10|accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref>

As the video opens, Rihanna is arrested into a press conference, where she is covered with plastic wrap and taped to a wall. Microphones and gagged reporters surround her.<ref name="bb" /> In an outdoor scene, she wears a beige latex dress and leads a spoofed [[Perez Hilton]] around by a dog leash. Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are taped to the wall of the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white two-piece latex and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body where the wall behind her and eating pink popcorn. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of Rihanna with frizzy curls while wearing a feather boa and a midriff-baring tube top with "censored" printed across it. The video then alternates between past scenes and images in which Rihanna eats fruits and cream, and jeweled ice cream while wearing a heart-shaped eye patch. In the last scene, she lays on a newsroom desk, with a smiley face emblem over one eye and a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] tongue logo over her mouth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657302/rihanna-s-m-video-director.jhtml|title=Rihanna's 'S&M' Director Explains Video, Frame By Frame – Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=2011-02-04|accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657066/rihanna-s-m-video.jhtml|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|title=Rihanna's 'S&M' Video: A Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2013-07-30|date=2012-02-01}}</ref> Drag queens [[Willam Belli]], [[Detox Icunt]], and [[Morgan McMichaels]] appear in the video.<ref name="Rodulfo">{{cite magazine |last1=Rodulfo |first1=Kristina |title=Everything We Know About Beauty We Learned From Drag Queens |url=https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a25426378/drag-influence-beauty-industry/ |accessdate=22 January 2019 |magazine=Elle |date=December 11, 2018}}</ref>

===Copyright infringement lawsuits===
[[File:Rihanna – S&M screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rihanna singing, facing to the camera. Three others are visible behind, in a pink striped room|Rihanna, in a scene from the video. The "pink room" scene was the subject of a US copyright infringement case]]
The video was involved in further controversy when photographer [[David LaChapelle]] sued Rihanna, [[Island Def Jam]] and related parties for [[copyright infringement]]. The lawsuit included claims of [[trade dress]] infringement under the [[Lanham Act]], [[unfair competition]] under New York state law and [[unjust enrichment]], all of which were later dismissed.<ref name="dismissed">[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011cv00945/375120/34/ ''LaChapelle v. Fenty et al''] (S.D.N.Y. 2011-07-20) Retrieved 2013-08-04.</ref> Judge [[Shira A. Scheindlin]] of New York's Southern District Court denied a [[motion to dismiss]] the copyright violation allegations,<ref name="dismissed" /> noting similarities between the works:

{{quote|1=Both works feature: hot-pink and white striped walls; two single-hung windows in the middle of the back wall; windows with glossy hot-pink casings and interior framework, with opaque panes exhibiting a half-vector pattern of stripes against a yellow background; a solid hot-pink ceiling; hot-pink baseboards; a hot-pink couch under the windows; women wearing frizzy red wigs; a woman posed on top of a piece of furniture; black tape wrapped around a man; and a generally frantic mood&nbsp;... [Both works are] well-lit and intensely saturated, with all of the details in sharp focus and almost no shadows.<ref name=dismissed/>}}

In August 2011, a judge agreed that the "{{'}}pink room scene', which shows Rihanna dominating a man in front of pink and white striped walls, was very similar to LaChapelle's "Striped Face" photograph; the judge pinpointed a scene where Rihanna is seen against a blue background, wearing pink latex and placing a sweet on her tongue."<ref name="CaseResolved" /> Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref name="CaseResolved">{{cite news|last=White|first=Belinda|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/columns/belinda-white/TMG8836353/Rihanna-and-David-LaChapelle-settle-their-SandM-dispute.html|title=Rihanna and David LaChapelle settle their S&M dispute|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2011-10-19|accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was "not personal, it's strictly business", and that "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats and there should be no difference when sampling an artist's visuals."<ref name="CaseResolved" /> In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a plastic sheet in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series ''Paperworld.''<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/rihanna-s-s-m-video-elicits-photographer-1005256862.story|title=Rihanna's 'S&M' Video Elicits Photographer's Copyright Infringement Lawsuit, Again|work=Billboard|date=2011-06-29|accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref>
