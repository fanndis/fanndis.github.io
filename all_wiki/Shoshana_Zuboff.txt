'''Shoshana Zuboff''' (born 1951)<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy</ref> is an American author, Harvard professor, social psychologist, philosopher, and scholar.

She is the author of the books ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'' and ''The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism'', co-authored with James Maxmin. ''[[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism]]: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power,'' integrates her lifelong themes: the [[Digital Revolution|digital revolution]], the evolution of [[capitalism]], the historical emergence of psychological individuality, and the conditions for human development.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy|title=Shoshana Zuboff: 'Surveillance capitalism is an assault on human autonomy'|last=Kavenna|first=Joanna|date=2019-10-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Zuboff's work is the source of many original concepts including '[[surveillance capitalism]]', 'instrumentarian power', 'the division of learning in society', 'economies of action', 'the means of behavior modification', 'information civilization', 'computer-mediated work', the 'automate/[[Informating|informate]]' dialectic, 'abstraction of work', and 'individualization of consumption'.

== Education ==

Zuboff received her B.A. in philosophy from the [[University of Chicago]], and her Ph.D. in [[social psychology]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref name=":0" />

== Career ==
Zuboff joined the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1981 where she became the [[Charles Edward Wilson (businessman)|Charles Edward Wilson]] Professor of Business Administration and one of the first [[tenure]]d women on the Harvard Business School faculty. In 2014 and 2015 she was a Faculty Associate at the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at the [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/new/about/|title=About {{!}} Shoshana Zuboff|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref>

== Surveillance capitalism ==
Zuboff's new work explores a novel market form and a specific logic of capitalist accumulation that she named "[[surveillance capitalism]]". She first presented her concept in a 2014 essay, "A Digital Declaration", published in German and English in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html|title=A Digital Declaration|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=September 15, 2014|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=December 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221170008/https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html|archive-date=2014-12-21}}</ref> Her followup 2015 scholarly article in the ''Journal of Information Technology'' titled "Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=2015-04-04|title=Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization|journal=Journal of Information Technology|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|volume=30|pages=75–89|ssrn=2594754|doi=10.1057/jit.2015.5}}</ref> received the International Conference on Information Systems Scholars' 2016 Best Paper Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aisnet.org/news/324749/AIS-Awards-Best-and-Brightest-at-ICIS-2016.htm|title=AIS Awards Best and Brightest at ICIS 2016 - Association for Information Systems (AIS)|website=aisnet.org|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

Surveillance capitalism and its consequences for twenty-first century society are most fully theorized in her book, ''The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power.'' Zuboff's scholarship on surveillance capitalism as a "rogue mutation of capitalism" has become a primary framework for understanding [[big data]] and the larger field of commercial surveillance that she describes as a "surveillance-based economic order". She argues that neither [[Privacy law|privacy]] nor [[Competition law|antitrust]] laws provide adequate protection from the unprecedented practices of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as an economic and social logic. Her book originates the concept of 'instrumentarian power', in contrast to [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian power]]. Instrumentarian power is a consequence of surveillance capitalist operations which threaten individual autonomy and democracy.

Many issues that plague contemporary society including the assault on privacy and the so-called 'privacy paradox', behavioral targeting, [[fake news]], ubiquitous tracking, legislative and regulatory failure, [[Government by algorithm|algorithmic governance]], [[social media addiction]], abrogation of human rights, democratic destabilization, and more are reinterpreted and explained through the lens of surveillance capitalism's economic and social imperatives.

=== ''In the Age of the Smart Machine'' ===
Zuboff's 1988 book, ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'', is a study of [[information technology]] in the workplace.<ref>Avgerou, Chrisanthi, Claudio Ciborra, and Frank Land. “Introduction.” The Social Study of Information and Communication Technology: Innovation, Actors and Contexts.

Major concepts introduced in this book relate to knowledge, authority, and power in the information workplace. These include the duality of information technology as an [[informating]] and an automating technology; the abstraction of work associated with information technology and its related intellectual skill demands; computer-mediated work; the "[[Panopticon#Criticism and use as metaphor|information panopticon]]"; information technology as a challenge to managerial authority and command/control; the social construction of technology; the shift from a division of labor to a division of learning; and the inherently collaborative patterns of information work, among others.

===''The Support Economy''===
''The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism'', co-authored with James Maxmin, was the product of multi-disciplinary research integrating history, sociology, management and economics. It argued that the new structure of demand associated with the 'individuation of consumption' had produced widespread institutional failures in every domain, including a growing divide between the individuals and the commercial organizations upon which they depend.

Written before the introduction of the iPod or the widespread penetration of the Internet, Zuboff and Maxmin argued that wealth creation in an individualized society would require leveraging new digital capabilities to enable a 'distributed capitalism'.

This entails a shift away from a primary focus on [[economies of scale]], asset intensification, concentration, central control, and anonymous transactions in 'organization-space' towards support-oriented relationships in 'individual-space' with products and services configured and distributed to meet individualized wants and needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/interviews/8748784/where-we-go-from-here|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234723/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/interviews/8748784/where-we-go-from-here|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-03-03|title=Where We Go From Here|publisher=}}</ref>

== Other work ==

===Odyssey===

In 1993, Zuboff founded the executive education program “Odyssey: School for the Second Half of Life” at the Harvard Business School. The program addressed the issues of transformation and career renewal at midlife. During twelve years of her teaching and leadership, Odyssey became known as the premier program of its kind in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/26/teacher.html|title=Fast Company Magazine Issue 26 JulyAugust 1999 - Business + Innovation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140239/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/26/teacher.html|archivedate=2010-07-16|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/49719/new-new-adulthood|title=The New New Adulthood|date=1 August 2004|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Non-academic work ===
In addition to her academic work, Zuboff brought her ideas to many commercial and public/private ventures through her public speaking as well as her direct involvement in key projects, particularly in social housing, health care, education, and elder care.

She also became a business columnist, developing and disseminating new concepts from ''The Support Economy''. From 2003 to 2005, Zuboff shared her ideas in her widely read monthly column “Evolving”, in the magazine ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/resources/support|title=Fast Company - Business + Innovation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116040958/http://www.fastcompany.com/resources/support|archivedate=2013-01-16}}</ref> From 2007 through 2009 she was a featured columnist for ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Business Week]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-07-02/the-old-solutions-have-become-the-new-problems|title=Terms of Service Violation|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|authorlink=Shoshana Zuboff|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>
