'''50 & Counting''' was a [[concert tour]] by [[The Rolling Stones]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the band, which started in October 2012 (with two secret club gigs in [[Paris]]) and ended in July 2013 (with two major shows at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]).

==History==
[[File:Whole Rolling Stones Band 2013.jpg|thumb|280px|In Boston, MA on 12 June 2013- The Rolling Stones and support musicians from L-R in foreground: Jagger, Wood, Richards, and Jones- in the rear: Leavell (on keyboards), and Watts. Not visible: Mick Taylor, Wyman, horns and backing vocalists]]

===2012 preliminary rehearsals and recording sessions===
In late April / early May 2012, the band met up at a studio in [[Weehawken]], [[NJ]] for some secretive, preliminary rehearsals (their 1st time playing together since 2007).

On 19 May 2012, [[Mick Jagger]] hosted and performed on the season finale of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The Rolling Stones then made their first public appearance in over four years on 12 July 2012 at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[London]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their first ever concert. They also published a book entitled ''The Rolling Stones: 50'' as well as a documentary, [[Crossfire Hurricane]], released on 15 November 2012 on [[HBO]]. The documentary included interviews from all six of the living band members.

In August 2012, the Stones gathered at a studio in [[Paris]] to record their first new material since ''[[A Bigger Bang]]'', over seven years ago.

===2012 tour===
In October and November 2012, they conducted rehearsals for their 50th anniversary concerts. The rehearsals for the 2012 tour took place in [[Bondy]] near Paris, France (in a rehearsal studio named Planet Live) and in London, England at the [[Wembley Arena]] for the 2012 shows. On 12 November 2012, they released [[GRRR!]], a greatest hits compilation album that included the two new songs from the August recording sessions: "[[Doom And Gloom]]" (previously released as a single on 11 October 2012) and "One More Shot".
