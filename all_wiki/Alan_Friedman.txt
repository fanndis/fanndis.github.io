On December 2, Friedman received the Premio Pannunzio 2014, an Italian journalism award, with this motivation read on behalf of the Jury: “He represents a fine example of journalism in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, a journalism where facts are separated from opinions, with independent judgement in describing Italian politics, and this is very much to his credit. Friedman succeeds in putting the present into historical perspective, with objectivity and impartiality”.<ref>[http://www.savonanews.it/2014/11/30/leggi-notizia/argomenti/eventi-spettacoli/articolo/albenga-premio-pannunzio-2014-a-friedman-delegazione-ponente-ligure.html Premio Pannunzio 2014 a Friedman delegazione Ponente Ligure].

In June 2015 it was announced in the Italian media that Friedman would write the first authorized biography of the former Italian Prime Minister and media tycoon [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. In a video message in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'' Berlusconi explained that for many years journalists had asked him to write his biography but he had always declined. He finally decided to work with Friedman because he trusted him. Berlusconi also added: "As [[Steve Jobs]] said to his biographer: I will tell you my story. You will write what you like".<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2015/06/15/news/_my_way_alan_friedman_scrivera_la_prima_biografia_autorizzata_di_berlusconi-116916992 Alan Friedman scriverà la prima biografia autorizzata di Berlusconi.] Retrieved 16 June 2015.</ref>

Friedman's biography of Berlusconi was published in 19 languages and in 32 countries in the United States, Europe and Asia.

In the documentary „My Way – The Rise and Fall of Silvio Berlusconi“ Friedman leads as narrator through the research phase for his book. It first appeared on Netflix and shows interview footage with Berlusconi at his estate in Arcore. Friedman lets Berlusconi chronologically tell his life story but confronts him with allegations and leads interviews with investigators and companions.<ref>[https://www.fr.de/kultur/einer-donald-trump-11634888.html Einer wie Donald Trump.] Retrieved 28 September 2020.</ref>

In February 2017 Friedman published a book called This Is Not America ([[Biteback Publishing]] in UK and Newton Compton in Italy) that was harshly critical of [[Donald Trump]] and examined the divisions in American society.<ref>[http://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/this-is-not-america This Is Not America.] Retrieved 15 June 2018.</ref> The book was a bestseller in Italy for several months in 2017.<ref>[http://libreriamo.it/libri/alan-friedman-conquista-il-primo-posto-segue-chiara-gamberale/ Alan Friedman conquista il primo posto, segue Chiara Gamberale.] Retrieved 15 June 2018.</ref>

In March 2018 Friedman gave his first TEDxTalk at Oxford University in the UK to an audience of 1,800 people. In his talk Friedman repeatedly criticized Donald Trump for damaging the social fabric of the United States, sowing hatred and division and leading a populist wave of demagogy that threatened America's traditions of strength through cultural diversity. Friedman also warned that Trump was attacking several pillars of American democracy with his repeated attacks on law enforcement, the Justice Department, the rule of law, the free press and the rights of women, gays and minorities.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd_jZjAYUrI This Is Not America | Alan Friedman | TEDxOxford.] Retrieved 15 June 2018.</ref>

In a June 2018 article, ''[[The New York Times]]'' named Friedman as a former associate of [[Paul Manafort]] who had contacted Special Counsel [[Robert Mueller]] to inform the counsel of Manafort's attempt at witness tampering.<ref name=NYT2018-06-07>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/us/politics/mueller-manafort-witnesses.html|title=With Mueller Closing In, Manafort’s Allies Abandon Him|date=June 7, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth P.|last2=LaFraniere|first2=Sharon|last3=Horowitz|first3=Jason|access-date=September 14, 2018}}</ref> The article described how Friedman had helped to arrange and gave advice on writing op-eds that favored [[Viktor Yanukovich]] of [[Ukraine]] during his short tenure as president at the behest of Manafort and that Friedman "helped lead a project to which prosecutors say Mr. Manafort funneled more than $2 million."
