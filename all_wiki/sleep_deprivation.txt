===Type 2 diabetes===
It has been suggested that people experiencing short-term sleep restrictions process glucose more slowly than individuals receiving a full 8 hours of sleep, increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/consequences/sleep-and-disease-risk|title = Sleep and Disease Risk|date = 2007|website = Healthy Sleep|publisher = Harvard Medical School|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160325003506/http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/consequences/sleep-and-disease-risk|archive-date = 25 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005, a study of over 1400 participants showed that participants who habitually slept few hours were more likely to have associations with [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].<ref name="DGottlieb">{{cite journal |author=Gottlieb DJ |title=Association of sleep time with diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance |journal=Arch.

===On the brain===

One study suggested, based on neuroimaging, that 35 hours of total sleep deprivation in healthy controls negatively affected the brain's ability to put an emotional event into the proper perspective and make a controlled, suitable response to the event.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The human emotional brain without sleep- a prefrontal amygdala disconnect|last1 = Yoo|first1 = Seung-Schik|date = 2007|journal = Current Biology|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.08.007|pmid = 17956744|first2 = Ninad|last2 = Gujar|first3 = Peter|last3 = Hu|first4 = Ferenc|last4 = Jolesz|first5 = Matthew|last5 = Walker|issue = 20|volume = 17|pages = R877–R878|s2cid = 9008816}}</ref>

The negative effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and cognitive performance suggest decreases in brain activity and function. These changes primarily occur in two regions: the thalamus, a structure involved in alertness and attention; and the prefrontal cortex, a region sub-serving alertness, attention, and higher-order cognitive processes.<ref name="performance" /> This was the finding of an American study in 2000. Seventeen men in their 20s were tested. Sleep deprivation was progressive with measurements of glucose (absolute regional CMRglu), cognitive performance, alertness, mood, and subjective experiences collected after 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours of sleep deprivation. Additional measures of alertness, cognitive performance, and mood were collected at fixed intervals. [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans were used and attention was paid to the circadian rhythm of cognitive performance.<ref name="performance" />

A noted 2002 University of California animal study indicated that [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]] (NREM) is necessary for turning off [[neurotransmitter]]s and allowing their receptors to "rest" and regain sensitivity which allows monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) to be effective at naturally produced levels. This leads to improved regulation of mood and increased learning ability. The study also found that [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM) deprivation may alleviate [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] because it mimics [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs). This is because the natural decrease in monoamines during REM is not allowed to occur, which causes the concentration of neurotransmitters in the brain, that are depleted in clinically depressed persons, to increase. Sleep outside of the REM phase may allow enzymes to repair brain cell damage caused by [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]. High metabolic activity while awake damages the enzymes themselves preventing efficient repair. This study observed the first evidence of brain damage in rats as a direct result of sleep deprivation.<ref name="Siegel">{{cite news |first=Jerome M. |last=Siegel |title=Why We Sleep |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2008-04-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203071459/http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf |archive-date=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Animal studies suggest that sleep deprivation increases levels of stress hormones, which may reduce new cell production in adult brains.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6347043.stm No sleep means no new brain cells] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211003214/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6347043.stm |date=11 February 2007 }}.

===On growth===
A 1999 study<ref name="BlockQuote">{{cite journal |author=Vgontzas AN, Mastorakos G, Bixler EO, Kales A, Gold PW, Chrousos GP |title=Sleep deprivation effects on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and growth axes: potential clinical implications |journal=Clin.

Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which controls reactions to stress and regulates body functions such as [[digestion]], the [[immune system]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]], sex, or energy usage) while suppressing growth [[hormones]]. The results supported previous studies, which observed adrenal insufficiency in [[idiopathic hypersomnia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Trakada|first1=Georgia|last2=Chrousos|first2=George P.|last3=Pejovic|first3=Slobodanka|last4=Vgontzas|first4=Alexandros N.|date=June 2007|title=Sleep Apnea and its Association with the Stress System, Inflammation, Insulin Resistance and Visceral Obesity|journal=Sleep Medicine Clinics|volume=2|issue=2|pages=251–261|doi=10.1016/j.jsmc.2007.04.003|pmc=2128620|pmid=18516220}}</ref>

===On attention and working memory===
Among the possible physical consequences of sleep deprivation, deficits in attention and working memory are perhaps the most important;<ref name="Alhola"/> such lapses in mundane routines can lead to unfortunate results, from forgetting ingredients while cooking to missing a sentence while taking notes. Performing tasks that require attention appears to be correlated with number of hours of sleep received each night, declining as a function of hours of sleep deprivation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|last1 = Kolb|first1 = Bryan|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 9781429242288|location = New York, New York|pages = 468–469|last2 = Whishaw|first2 = Ian|edition = 4th}}</ref> Working memory is tested by such methods as choice-reaction time tasks.<ref name="Alhola"/>

The attentional lapses also extend into more critical domains in which the consequences can be life-or-death; car crashes and industrial disasters can result from inattentiveness attributable to sleep deprivation. To empirically measure the magnitude of attention deficits, researchers typically employ the [[psychomotor vigilance task]] (PVT) which requires the subject to press a button in response to a light at random intervals. Failure to press the button in response to the stimulus (light) is recorded as an error, attributable to the microsleeps that occur as a product of sleep deprivation.

Crucially, individuals' subjective evaluations of their fatigue often do not predict actual performance on the PVT. While totally sleep-deprived individuals are usually aware of the degree of their impairment, lapses from chronic (lesser) sleep deprivation can build up over time so that they are equal in number and severity to the lapses occurring from total (acute) sleep deprivation. Chronically sleep-deprived people, however, continue to rate themselves considerably less impaired than totally sleep-deprived participants.<ref name="SleepDepPVT">{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year=2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469 |last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152642/http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1093/sleep/26.2.117 }}</ref> Since people usually evaluate their capability on tasks like driving subjectively, their evaluations may lead them to the false conclusion that they can perform tasks that require constant attention when their abilities are in fact impaired.

===On driving ability===
{{main|Sleep-deprived driving}}
The dangers of sleep deprivation are apparent on the road; the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] (AASM) reports that one in every five serious motor vehicle injuries is related to driver fatigue, with 80,000 drivers falling asleep behind the wheel every day and 250,000 accidents every year related to sleep,<ref name="DrowsyDriving">{{cite web |title=Drowsy Driving Fact Sheet |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |work=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |date=2 December 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152642/http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests the figure for [[traffic accidents]] may be closer to 100,000.<ref name="SleepDepReport">{{cite journal|author=Carpenter|first=Siri|author-link=Siri Carpenter|year=2001|title=Sleep deprivation may be undermining teen health|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct01/sleepteen.html|url-status=live|journal=Monitor on Psychology|volume=32|issue=9|page=42|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006064800/http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct01/sleepteen.html|archive-date=6 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The AASM recommends pulling off the road and taking a 15- or 20-minute nap to alleviate drowsiness.<ref name="DrowsyDriving"/>

According to a 2000 study published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', researchers in Australia and New Zealand reported that sleep deprivation can have some of the same hazardous effects as being drunk.<ref name="Drunkhazard">{{cite journal |author=Williamson AM, Feyer AM |title=Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication |journal=Occup. Environ. Med. |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=649–55 |year=2000 |pmid=10984335 |pmc=1739867 |doi= 10.1136/oem.57.10.649|last2=Feyer }}</ref> People who drove after being awake for 17–19 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent, which is the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries and Australia. Another study suggested that performance begins to degrade after 16 hours awake, and 21 hours awake was equivalent to a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent, which is the [[blood alcohol limit]] for drunk driving in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K.<ref name="FatigueandAlcohol">{{cite journal |author1=Dawson, Drew  |author2=Kathryn Reid |title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6639 |year=1997 |page=235 |doi=10.1038/40775 |pmid=9230429|bibcode=1997Natur.388..235D |s2cid=4424846 }}</ref>

Fatigue of drivers of goods trucks and passenger vehicles have come to the attention of authorities in many countries, where specific laws have been introduced with the aim of reducing the risk of traffic accidents due to driver fatigue. Rules concerning minimum break lengths, maximum shift lengths and minimum time between shifts are common in the driving regulations used in different countries and regions, such as the [[drivers' working hours]] regulations in the European Union and [[hours of service]] regulations in the United States.

The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill was the second largest oil spill in the United States. This accident occurred when an Exxon oil tanker struck a reef at the Prince William Sound in Alaska. Approximately 10.8 million gallons of oil spilled into the sea. The accident caused great environmental damage including the death of hundreds of thousands of birds and sea creatures. Fatigue and sleep deprivation were the major contributors to the accident. The captain of the ship was asleep after a night of heavy drinking; he was severely fatigued and had been awake for 18 hours. The entire crew was suffering from fatigue and inadequate sleep. <ref>{{ProQuest|2092623770}}</ref>

===On sleep transition===
Sleep propensity (SP) can be defined as the readiness to transit from wakefulness to sleep, or the ability to stay asleep if already sleeping.<ref>Schulz, H., Bes, E., Jobert, M. (1997). Modelling Sleep Propensity and Sleep Disturbances. In: Meier-Ewert K., Okawa M. (eds) Sleep—Wake Disorders. Springer. doi:[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-0245-0_2 10.1007/978-1-4899-0245-0_2]</ref> Sleep deprivation increases this propensity, which can be measured by polysomnography (PSG), as a reduction in sleep latency (the time needed to fall asleep).<ref name=Durmer2005>{{cite journal | author = Durmer J. S., Dinges D. F. | year = 2005 | title = Neurocognitive Consequences of Sleep Deprivation | journal = Semin Neurol | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 117–129 | doi = 10.1055/s-2005-867080 | pmid = 15798944 | pmc = 3564638 }}</ref> An indicator of sleep propensity can also be seen in the shortening of transition from light stages of non-REM sleep to deeper slow-waves oscillations can also be measured as indicator of sleep propensity.<ref name=Durmer2005 />

On average, the latency in healthy adults decreases by a few minutes after a night without sleep, and the latency from sleep onset to slow-wave sleep is halved.<ref name=Durmer2005/> Sleep latency is generally measured with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In contrast, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) also uses sleep latency, but this time as a measure of the capacity of the participants to stay awake (when asked to) instead of falling asleep.<ref name=Durmer2005/>

Sleep deprivation can negatively impact overall performance, and has led to major fatal accidents. Due largely to the February 2009 crash of [[Colgan Air Flight 3407]], which killed 50 people and was partially attributed to pilot fatigue, the FAA reviewed its procedures to ensure that pilots are sufficiently rested. Air traffic controllers were under scrutiny when in 2010 there were 10 incidents of controllers falling asleep while on shift.  The common practice of turn-around shifts caused sleep deprivation and was a contributing factor to all air traffic control incidents.  The FAA reviewed its practices of shift changes and the findings saw that controllers were not well rested.<ref name="PlaneCrash">{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=11857|title=Fact Sheet – Pilot Fatigue|date=10 September 2010|work=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005194346/http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=11857|archive-date=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A 2004 study also found medical residents with less than four hours of sleep a night made more than twice as many errors as the 11% of surveyed residents who slept for more than seven hours a night.<ref name="MedicalErrors">{{cite journal |author1=Baldwinn, DeWitt C.

An even lighter type of sleep has been seen in rats that have been kept awake for long periods of time. In a process known as [[local sleep]], specific localized brain regions went into periods of short (~80 ms) but frequent (~40/min) NREM-like states. Despite the on and off periods where neurons shut off, the rats appeared to be awake, although they performed poorly at tests.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Local sleep in awake rats| author=Vyazovskiy VV, Olcese U, Hanlon EC, Nir Y, Cirelli C, Tononi G | journal=Nature| year=2011| volume=472| pages=443–447 |lay-url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110427/full/news.2011.259.html |doi=10.1038/nature10009 | issue=7344 | pmid=21525926 | pmc=3085007| last2=Olcese | last3=Hanlon | last4=Nir | last5=Cirelli | last6=Tononi | bibcode=2011Natur.472..443V }}</ref>

The association between sleep deprivation and obesity appears to be strongest in young and middle-age adults. Other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems, such as [[sleep apnea]], reduce an individual's chances of getting a good night's sleep.{{By whom|date=July 2018}}

Sleep loss is currently{{Clarify timeframe|date=January 2018}} proposed to disturb endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis leading to weight gain and obesity.

Similar endocrine alterations have been shown to occur even after a single night of sleep restriction.

In a balanced order, nine healthy normal-weight men spent three nights in a sleep laboratory separated by at least two weeks: one night with a total sleep time of seven hours, one night with a total sleep time of 4.5 hours, and one night with total sleep deprivation (SD).
On a standard symptom-rating scale, subjects rated markedly stronger feelings of hunger after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (3.9 ± 0.7 versus 1.7 ± 0.3; P = 0.020) or 4.5 hours sleep (2.2 ± 0.5; P = 0.041). Plasma ghrelin levels were 22 ± 10% higher after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (0.85 ± 0.06 versus 0.72 ± 0.04&nbsp;ng mL(−1); P = 0.048) with intermediate levels of the hormone after 4.5 hours sleep (0.77 ± 0.04&nbsp;ng mL(−1)).
Feelings of hunger as well as plasma ghrelin levels are already elevated after one night of SD, whereas morning serum leptin concentrations remain unaffected. Thus, the results provide further evidence for a disturbing influence of sleep loss on endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis, which in the long run may result in weight gain and obesity.<ref name="weight/metabolism" />

===Interrogation===
Sleep deprivation can be used as a means of interrogation, which has resulted in court trials over whether or not the technique is a form of [[torture]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Binyam Mohamed torture appeal lost by UK government... |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8507852.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211025746/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8507852.stm |archive-date=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Under one interrogation technique, a subject might be kept awake for several days and when finally allowed to fall asleep, suddenly awakened and questioned. [[Menachem Begin]], the Prime Minister of [[Israel]] from 1977 to 1983, described his experience of sleep deprivation as a prisoner of the [[NKVD]] in Soviet Union as follows:
{{quote|In the head of the interrogated prisoner, a haze begins to form. His spirit is wearied to death, his legs are unsteady, and he has one sole desire: to sleep...

Sleep deprivation was one of the [[five techniques]] used by the British government in the 1970s.

=== Insomnia ===
Sleep deprivation can be implemented for a short period of time in the treatment of insomnia. Some common sleep disorders have been shown to respond to [[Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia|cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]]. One of the components is a controlled regime of "sleep restriction" in order to restore the [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] drive to sleep and encourage normal "sleep efficiency".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=CB |display-authors=etal |title=The evidence base of sleep restriction therapy for treating insomnia disorder.|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|date=October 2014|volume=18|issue=5|pages=415–24|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.01.006|pmid=24629826}}</ref> The main goal of stimulus control and [[Cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_insomnia#Sleep_restriction_therapy|sleep restriction therapy]] is to create an association between bed and sleep.

These include: psychophysiological, idiopathic insomnia, and [[sleep state misperception]] (paradoxical insomnia).<ref name=WHO /> Psychophysiological insomnia is anxiety-induced. Idiopathic insomnia generally begins in childhood and lasts the rest of a person's life. It's suggested that idiopathic insomnia is a neurochemical problem in a part of the brain that controls the sleep-wake cycle, resulting in either under-active sleep signals or over-active wake signals. Sleep state misperception is diagnosed when people get enough sleep but inaccurately perceive that their sleep is insufficient.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chunhua L, Hongzhong Q | title = Paradoxical Insomnia: Misperception of Sleep Can Be a Tormenting Experience | journal = American Family Physician | date=15 Jun 2017 | url = https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p770.html | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | page = 770 | accessdate = 10 May 2020 | pmid = 28671423}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Secondary insomnia, or comorbid insomnia, occurs concurrently with other medical, neurological, psychological and psychiatric conditions.  Causation is not necessarily implied.<ref>Biological Rhythms, Sleep and Hypnosis by Simon Green</ref>

Sleep is known to be cumulative. This means that the fatigue and sleep one lost as a result, for example, staying awake all night, would be carried over to the following day. Not getting enough sleep a couple days cumulatively builds up a deficiency and that's when all the symptoms of sleep deprivation come in. When one is well rested and healthy, the body naturally spends not as much time in the REM stage of sleep. The more time one's body spends in REM sleep, causes one to be exhausted, less time in that stage will promote more energy when awakened.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sleep and learning : the magic that makes us healthy and smart|author=Plaford, Gary R.|isbn=9781607090915|location=Lanham|oclc=310224798|year = 2009}}</ref>

====Voluntary====
Sleep deprivation can sometimes be self-imposed due to a lack of desire to sleep or the habitual use of stimulant drugs. Sleep deprivation is also self-imposed to achieve personal fame in the context of [[world record|record-breaking stunts]].

===Sleep apnea===
Obstructive [[sleep apnea]] is often caused by collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which reduces airflow to the lungs. Those who suffer from sleep apnea may experience symptoms such as awakening gasping or [[choking]], restless sleep, morning headaches, morning confusion or irritability and restlessness. This disorder affects between 1 and 10 percent of Americans. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Zammit, Gary K.|url=https://archive.org/details/goodnightshowtos00zamm|title=Good nights : how to stop sleep deprivation, overcome insomnia, and get the sleep you need|date=1997|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|others=Zanca, Jane A.|isbn=0-8362-2188-5|location=Kansas City|oclc=35849087|url-access=registration}}</ref> It has many serious health outcomes if untreated. [[Positive airway pressure]] therapy using a CPAP ([[Continuous positive airway pressure]]), APAP or BPAP devices is considered to be the first line treatment option for sleep apnea.<ref>Spicuzza L, Caruso D, Di Maria G. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and its management. Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease. 2015;6(5):273-285. doi:10.1177/2040622315590318.</ref> Mandibular displacement devices in some cases can reposition the jaw and tongue to prevent the airway from collapsing. For some patients supplemental oxygen therapy may be indicated. Nasal problems such as a deviated septum will shut down the airway and increase swelling in the mucus lining and nasal turbinates. Corrective surgery ([[septoplasty]]) in some cases may be an appropriate choice of treatment.

Central [[sleep apnea]] is caused by a failure of the central nervous system to signal the body to breathe during sleep. Treatments similar to obstructive sleep apnea may be used as well as other treatments such as Adaptive Servo Ventilation and certain medications. Some medications such as opioids may contribute to or cause central sleep apnea.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Muza RT | year = 2015 | title = Central sleep apnoea—a clinical review | journal = Journal of Thoracic Disease | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 930–937 | doi = 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.04.45 | pmid = 26101651 | pmc = 4454847 }}</ref>

===Mental illness===
The specific causal relationships between sleep loss and effects on psychiatric disorders have been most extensively studied in patients with mood disorders. Shifts into mania in bipolar patients are often preceded by periods of [[insomnia]], and sleep deprivation has been shown to induce a manic state in susceptible individuals. Sleep deprivation may represent a final common pathway in the genesis of mania,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wehr|first1=TA|title=Sleep reduction as a final common pathway in the genesis of mania|journal=Am. J. Psychiatry|date=1987|volume=144|issue=2|pages=201–204|pmid=3812788|doi=10.1176/ajp.144.2.201}}</ref> and sleep loss is both a precipitating and reinforcing factor for the manic state.

It is known that during human adolescence, [[circadian rhythm]]s and therefore sleep patterns typically undergo marked changes. [[Electroencephalography|Electroencephalogram]] (EEG) studies indicate a 50% reduction of deep (stage 4) sleep and a 75% reduction in the peak amplitude of delta waves during NREM sleep in adolescence. School schedules are often incompatible with a corresponding delay in sleep offset, leading to a less than optimal amount of sleep for the majority of adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giedd JN |title=Linking adolescent sleep, brain maturation, and behavior |journal=[[Journal of Adolescent Health]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |date=October 2009 |pages=319–320 |pmid=19766933 |pmc=3018343 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.07.007 }}</ref>

==Treatment==

Sleep deprivation is not a disease but rather a symptom of illnesses such as [[insomnia]]. Several strategies are common in attempting to increase alertness and counteract the effects of sleep deprivation. [[Caffeine]] is often used over short periods to boost wakefulness when acute sleep deprivation is experienced; however, caffeine is less effective if taken routinely.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.aasmnet.org/resources/factsheets/sleepdeprivation.pdf|title = Sleep Deprivation|date = 2008|accessdate = 25 March 2015|website = American Academy of Sleep Medicine|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226011724/http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/SleepDeprivation.pdf|archive-date = 26 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Other strategies recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine include prophylactic sleep before deprivation, naps, other stimulants, and combinations thereof.

Recovery of cognitive function is accomplished more rapidly after acute total sleep deprivation than after chronic partial sleep restriction.<ref name="Alhola"/> Chronic deprivation is the more common in everyday life.

For long term involuntary sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) is now commonly recommended as a first-line treatment, after exclusion of physical diagnosis (f.e. sleep apnea). CBT-i contains five different components: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. These components together have shown to be effective in adults, with clinical meaningful effect sizes<ref name="Trauer 191"/> As this approach has minimal adverse effects, and long-term benefits, it is often preferred to (chronic) drug therapy.

== Changes in American sleep habits ==

''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' has reported that the demands of work, social activities, and the availability of 24-hour home entertainment and Internet access have caused people to sleep less now than in premodern times.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0224_050224_sleep.html "U.S. Racking Up Huge "Sleep Debt""] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210051110/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0224_050224_sleep.html |date=10 December 2006 }}, ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', 24 February 2005</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' reported in 2007 that most adults in the USA get about an hour less than the average sleep time 40 years ago.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-11-25-sleep-deficit_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Kathleen | last=Fackelmann | title=Study: Sleep deficit may be impossible to make up | date=25 November 2007 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628121051/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-11-25-sleep-deficit_N.htm | archive-date=28 June 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Other researchers have questioned these claims. A 2004 editorial in the journal ''[[Sleep (journal)|Sleep]]'' stated that according to the available data, the average number of hours of sleep in a 24-hour period has not changed significantly in recent decades among adults. Furthermore, the editorial suggests that there is a range of normal sleep time required by healthy adults, and many indicators used to suggest chronic sleepiness among the population as a whole do not stand up to scientific scrutiny.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Horne |first=Jim |title=Is there a sleep debt? |journal=Sleep |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=1047–9 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15532195}}</ref>

A comparison of data collected from the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]' American Time Use Survey from 1965–1985 and 1998–2001 has been used to show that the median amount of sleep, napping, and resting done by the average adult American has changed by less than 0.7%, from a median of 482 minutes per day from 1965 through 1985, to 479 minutes per day from 1998 through 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/sdaweb/glaser/Doc/GLAS.htm|title=National Time Use Studies (1965–1985)|work=umd.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907204651/http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/sdaweb/glaser/Doc/GLAS.htm|archive-date=7 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/sdaweb/diary9801/Doc/Diar.htm|title=National Time Use Studies (1998 - 2001)|work=umd.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907204005/http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/sdaweb/diary9801/Doc/Diar.htm|archive-date=7 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Longest periods without sleep==
[[Randy Gardner (record holder)|Randy Gardner]] holds the scientifically documented record for the longest period of time a human being has intentionally gone without sleep not using [[stimulant]]s of any kind. Gardner stayed awake for 264 hours (11 days), breaking the previous record of 260 hours held by [[Tom Rounds]] of [[Honolulu]].<ref name="Coren"/> [[Lieutenant commander|LCDR]] John J.

For example, Rhett Lamb of [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] was initially reported to not sleep at all, but actually had a rare condition permitting him to sleep only one to two hours per day in the first three years of his life. He had a rare abnormality called an [[Arnold–Chiari malformation]] where [[brain tissue]] protrudes into the spinal canal and the skull puts pressure on the protruding part of the brain. The boy was operated on at [[All Children's Hospital]] in St. Petersburg in May 2008. Two days after surgery he slept through the night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/05/16/boy-3-sleeps-for-first-time-after-experimental-surgery.html|title=Boy, 3, Sleeps for First Time After Experimental Surgery|date=16 May 2008|publisher=FoxNews.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204927/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/05/16/boy-3-sleeps-for-first-time-after-experimental-surgery.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=6711810&page=1 |title=Mystery of Sleepless Boy Solved: Boy Who Couldn't Sleep Undergoes Risky, Life-Changing Operation |work=[[ABC News]]|author=Canning, Andrea|date=23 January 2009}}</ref>

French sleep expert [[Michel Jouvet]] and his team reported the case of a patient who was quasi-sleep-deprived for four months, as confirmed by repeated [[polygraph]]ic recordings showing less than 30 minutes (of [[NREM sleep|stage-1 sleep]]) per night, a condition they named "agrypnia". The 27-year-old man was suffering from [[Morvan's syndrome|Morvan's fibrillary chorea]], a rare disease that leads to involuntary movements, and in this particular case, extreme [[insomnia]]. The researchers found that treatment with [[5-HTP]] restored almost normal sleep stages. However some months after this recovery the patient died during a relapse which was unresponsive to 5-HTP. The cause of death was pulmonary edema. Despite the extreme insomnia, psychological investigation showed no sign of cognitive deficits, except for some [[hallucination]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sommeil.univ-lyon1.fr/articles/jouvet/ecn_74/print.php |title=One case of agrypnia (4 months without sleep) in a morvan disease, favourable action of 5-hydroxytryptophane |author=Fischer-Perroudon C, Mouret J, Jouvet M |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |year=1974 |volume=36 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(74)90132-1 |pmid=4128428 |issue=1 |last2=Mouret |last3=Jouvet |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130132421/http://sommeil.univ-lyon1.fr/articles/jouvet/ecn_74/print.php |archive-date=30 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Fatal familial insomnia]] is a neurodegenerative disease eventually resulting in a complete inability to go past [[Sleep#NREM 1|stage 1 of NREM sleep]]. In addition to insomnia, patients may experience panic attacks, paranoia, phobias, hallucinations, rapid weight loss, and [[dementia]]. Death usually occurs between 7 and 36 months from onset.
