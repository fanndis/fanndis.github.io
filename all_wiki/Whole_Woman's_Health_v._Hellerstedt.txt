'''''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt''''', 579 U.S. ___ (2016), was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] of the [[US Supreme Court]] decided on June 27, 2016. The Court ruled 5–3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi where federal appeals courts had struck down similar laws. Other states with similar laws may also be impacted.

== Background ==
{{Main|Texas House Bill 2}}
In 2013, [[Texas]] passed a law, H.B. 2, placing a series of [[Types of abortion restrictions in the United States|restrictions]] on [[abortion clinics]] within the state.<ref name="US News" /> In November 2013, one of H.B. 2's requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a [[hospital]] within 30 miles took effect.<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=A New Supreme Court Challenge: The Erosion of Abortion Access in Texas|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/a-new-supreme-court-challenge-the-erosion-of-abortion-access-in-texas/415929/|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Atlantic|date=November 13, 2015}}</ref> In the time since the admitting privileges requirement took effect, the number of abortion clinics in Texas declined from 42 to 19.<ref name= "US News" />

The law also required abortion providers to meet the same standards as [[Outpatient surgery|ambulatory surgical centers]]<ref name=ACS>{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=B.

Hellerstedt'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf], slip. op. at 12</ref> but had not waived any part of the surgical-center requirements for any of the abortion clinics in the state.<ref>''Whole Woman's Health v.

===First lawsuit===
A group of plaintiffs including Whole Woman's Health sued, bringing a [[facial challenge]] to the admitting-privileges provision. On October 28, 2013, the day before the law was to take effect, Judge [[Earl Leroy Yeakel III]] of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]] in [[Austin, Texas]] granted the plaintiffs an injunction invalidating the provision.<ref name=YaleLJ>{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Greenhouse |authorlink=Linda Greenhouse |first2=Reva |last2=Siegel |authorlink2=Reva Siegel |year=2016 |title=''Casey'' and the Clinic Closings: When 'Protecting Health' Obstructs Choice |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=1428–1480 |ssrn=2621839 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/casey-and-the-clinic-closings }}</ref><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2099386983225132349&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex.

Three days later, a motions panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] made of Circuit Judges [[Priscilla Owen]], [[Jennifer Walker Elrod]], and [[Catharina Haynes]], granted an emergency stay of the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.<ref name=YaleLJ/><ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11402263624687015759&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex.

===Second lawsuit===
On April 6, 2014, Whole Woman's Health filled a new lawsuit, now seeking to block the admitting-privileges provision as applied to the Whole Woman's Health in [[McAllen, Texas]] and the Nova Health Systems in [[El Paso, Texas]], as well as to block the surgical centre provision throughout Texas.  The court held a four-day [[bench trial]] and on August 29, 2014, Judge Yeakel issued a state-wide injunction barring enforcement of both provisions.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16984873954220059412&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Whole Woman's Health v.

On October 2, 2014, Circuit Judge Elrod, joined by Judge [[Jerry Edwin Smith]] and with [[Stephen A.

The Fifth Circuit reversed the court order protecting the El Paso clinic but upheld the order protecting the McAllen clinic. The three-judge panel upheld the majority of the Texas law.<ref>''Whole Woman's Health v.

== Supreme Court ==
Before H.B. 2 could take effect, the petitioners requested a stay from the Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the court granted a temporary stay by a 5–4 vote, and it later granted an indefinite stay. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[Samuel Alito]] would have denied the stay. On November 13, 2015, the court granted a writ of certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit's holding. Over eighty amicus curiae briefs were filed with the Court,<ref> {{Cite news|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

During the questioning phase of the oral arguments, the liberal side of the court, including Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan]], questioned the true intention of the law<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/02/ruth_bader_ginsburg_asks_the_most_important_question_of_oral_arguments_in.html|title=The Most Important Exchange of Wednesday's SCOTUS Abortion Arguments|last=Stern|first=Mark Joseph|date=March 2, 2016|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> and Texas's justification for it. Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argued that women living far from Texas abortion clinics––due to the closure of many abortion clinics struggling to comply with the requirement's standards––were not unduly burdened in gaining access to abortions because they could access clinics in New Mexico, a state with more lenient standards. In response, Justice Ginsburg noted: "So if your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out for Texas, because Texas says: To protect our women, we need these things. But send them off to New Mexico... and that's perfectly all right."<ref name="auto"/>

===Opinion of the Court===
[[Image:Stephen Breyer, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] was the author of the Court's opinion.]]
On June 27, 2016, the Court ruled by a 5–3 vote that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for women seeking an abortion, and therefore the sections of Texas law H.B. 2 challenged here are invalid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11713644/whole-womans-health-supreme-court-choice|title=Pro-choice advocates just won the biggest Supreme Court abortion case in decades|last=Crockett |first=Emily|date=June 27, 2016|website=Vox|access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> In an opinion written by Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], the court struck down key provisions of the law––those requiring doctors who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities––as violating a woman's right to an abortion.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last1=Adam Liptak|first1=|title=Justices Overturn Texas Abortion Limits: 'Burden' Is Found - 10 Clinics to Stay Open|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 3, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=June 28, 2016|page=A1|author1-link=Adam Liptak}}</ref> Observing that these provisions do not offer medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes, the majority concluded: "Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution."<ref name="20160627Reuters">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-idUSKCN0ZC0JL|title=Supreme Court firmly backs abortion rights, tosses Texas law|last=Hurley|first=Lawrence|date=June 28, 2016|website=Reuters|access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref> The majority opinion struck down both provisions "facially", that is, the very words of the provisions are invalid, irrespective of how they might be implemented or applied.<ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston">{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

Justice Breyer wrote, "We have found nothing in Texas’ record evidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which required a “working arrangement” with a doctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas’ legitimate interest in protecting women's health." He noted that, when asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.<ref>''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf], slip. op. at 23</ref> He found that, if H.B. 2 were allowed to take full effect, the number of Texan women living more than 200 miles from the nearest abortion clinic would increase from 10,000 to 750,000.<ref>''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf], slip. op. at 6</ref>

Justice Breyer dismissed the state's claim that the Pennsylvania case of [[Kermit Gosnell]] justified additional regulation: "Gosnell's behavior was terribly wrong. But there is no reason to believe that an extra layer of regulation would have affected that behavior. Determined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing statutes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations. Regardless, Gosnell's deplorable crimes could escape detection only because his facility went un-inspected for more than 15 years. Pre-existing Texas law already contained numerous detailed regulations covering abortion facilities, including a requirement that facilities be inspected at least annually."<ref>''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf], slip. op. at 27</ref>

===Concurrence===
In a two-page concurrence, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory surgical-center or hospital admitting-privileges requirements. ... Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law 'would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.' ... When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners. ... [L]aws like H. B. 2 that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion' cannot survive judicial inspection."<ref>{{cite news | accessdate = June 27, 2016 | date = June 27, 2016 | title = The Supreme Court Strikes Down the Texas Abortion Law HB2 |url = http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-supreme-court-strikes-down-the-texas-abortion-law-hb2-8473280 | work = Houston Press | first = Dianna | last = Wray}}</ref>

===Dissents===
Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, stating that the majority "reimagines the undue-burden standard" for abortion access, creating a "benefits-and-burdens balancing test" that courts should have instead deferred to the legislatures to resolve.<ref name="NYT"/> Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, filed a second dissenting opinion, arguing that there is no direct causal link between the Texas law and the closings of abortion clinics, and they may have also been affected by the withdrawal of state funds, declining demand for abortions, and retirements of doctors.<ref name="NYT"/> Alito also stated that Texas might well have been motivated to protect women by the [[Kermit Gosnell]] case in Pennsylvania, in which a doctor had been convicted on three charges of murder and one of manslaughter.<ref name="NYT"/>

==Subsequent developments==
===Reception===
Former U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] praised the decision as a victory for women, saying "By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court upheld every woman’s right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives."<ref name=Guardian0627>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/us-supreme-court-abortion-clinton-trump-sanders-november-election |title= Clinton hails Texas abortion decision as 'victory for women', Trump stays silent |work= The Guardian | accessdate =June 27, 2016 | date = June 27, 2016 }}</ref> President [[Obama]] issued a statement applauding the Court's decision and reiterating his commitment to "women's health, including protecting a woman's access to safe, affordable health care and her right to determine her own future."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/27/obama-applauds-supreme-courts-abortion-decision/86432184/ |title=Obama applauds Supreme Court's abortion decision |work= USA Today |accessdate= June 27, 2016 | date= June 27, 2016 | first = Gregory | last = Korte }}</ref> Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] applauded the decision, calling it a "decisive victory for women across the country."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sanders-applauds-supreme-court-abortion-ruling/article/2594995 |title = Sanders applauds Supreme Court abortion ruling |work=Washington Examiner | accessdate =June 27, 2016 |date= June 27, 2016 |first= Robert | last = King}}</ref>

Senator [[Ted Cruz]] expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying "the Supreme Court sided with abortion extremists who care more about providing abortion-on-demand than they do protecting women’s health." He also vowed to fight for "unborn life."<ref name=Guardian0627/>

A statement issued on behalf of the [[Catholic Church]] bishops in Texas said the decision "puts women at grave risk" because "Surgical abortion is an invasive procedure that poses numerous and serious medical complications.  The state has a legitimate interest in ensuring the maximum level of safety for the woman subjected to the procedure and that viable emergency care is available if complications such as hemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation, blood clots, cervical tears, or allergic reactions occur. It is irresponsible for physicians to perform this procedure without being able to provide follow-up treatment for the associated complications."<ref>{{cite web|title=Texas Bishops highly concerned with ruling that puts women at grave risk|url=http://www.txcatholic.org/#!bishops-denounce-scotus-ruling-on-hb2/c1aii|publisher=Texas Catholic Conference|accessdate=June 17, 2016}}</ref>

At the time of the decision, five states required abortion clinics to operate under "hospital-like" standards: Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Tennessee, though in the last of these{{which|date=August 2020}}  a court order prevented enforcement. Nine states required doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, of which three were enforcing that requirement (North Dakota, Missouri, and Tennessee) and six were not (Wisconsin, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Domonoske|first1=Camila|title=Supreme Court Strikes Down Abortion Restrictions In Texas|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/27/483686616/supreme-court-strikes-down-abortion-restrictions-in-texas |accessdate=June 27, 2016|publisher=NPR|date=June 27, 2016}}</ref>

A few hours after the Supreme Court announced its ruling, Alabama Attorney General [[Luther Strange]] announced he would drop his appeal of a U.S. District Court ruling that had invalidated the state's hospital admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers.<ref>{{cite news | accessdate = June 28, 2016 | date = June 27, 2016 | url = http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/alabama_ag_luther_strange_says.html |publisher = AL.com | title = Alabama AG Luther Strange says state will drop appeal of abortion ruling | first = Mike | last = Cason}}</ref> On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court declined appeals in related cases from Wisconsin and Mississippi.

Louisiana had passed Act 620 in 2014, modeled after Texas' law that would require doctors to have admission privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, effectively reducing the number of legal clinics to one at the time of passage. The law was challenged by abortion clinics and doctors in ''[[June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo]]'', and while the District Court ordered an injunction to prevent the law going into effect, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] reversed the injunction. The plaintiffs obtained an emergency stay of the Fifth Circuit's decision from the Supreme Court while ''Whole Woman's Health'' was under litigation. Following this case's decision, the Louisiana law was declared unconstitutional by the District Court on rehearing on the basis of ''Whole Woman's Health'', but the Fifth Circuit again reversed the decision. Plaintiffs have again sought an emergency stay order from the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/eyes-on-kavanaugh-and-gorsuch-as-supreme-court-weighs-abortion-law.html | title = Eyes on Kavanaugh and Gorsuch as Supreme Court weighs whether Louisiana abortion law can go into effect | first= Tucker | last =Higgens | date = January 29, 2019 | accessdate = January 29, 2019 | work = [[CNBC]] }}</ref> On February 7, 2019, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] granted a stay and temporarily enjoined the state of Louisiana from enforcing the law while the plaintiffs appeal the decision of the Fifth Circuit.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/louisiana-abortion-law-supreme-court.html | title = Supreme Court Blocks Louisiana Abortion Law | first= Adam | last =Liptak | date = February 7, 2019 | accessdate = February 9, 2019 | work = [[New York Times]] }}</ref> The Supreme Court ruled on June 29, 2020 that the Louisiana law was similarly unconstitutional, with Roberts as the deciding vote.
