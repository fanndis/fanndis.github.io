Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as is the case in Canada) or may own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as is the case in the United Kingdom). "Single-payer" describes the mechanism by which healthcare is paid for by a single public authority, not a private authority, nor a mix of both.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/09/19/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-single-payer/|title=What We Talk About When We Talk About Single Payer|website=healthaffairs.org|access-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142309/http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/09/19/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-single-payer/|archive-date=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/single-payer/what-is-single-payer-health-care|title=What is single-payer health care?|date=March 26, 2014|access-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142239/https://www.vox.com/cards/single-payer/what-is-single-payer-health-care|archive-date=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A single-payer health system establishes a single risk pool, consisting of the entire population of a geographic or political region. It also establishes a single set of rules for services offered, reimbursement rates, drug prices, and minimum standards for required services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hsiao|first1=William C.|last2=Cheng|first2=Shou-Hsia|last3=Yip|first3=Winnie|title=What can be achieved with a single-payer NHI system: The case of Taiwan|journal=Social Science & Medicine|volume=233|pages=265–271|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.12.006|pmid=29054594|year=2016}}</ref>

In wealthy nations, single-payer health insurance is typically available to all citizens and legal residents. Examples include the United Kingdom's [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom|National Health Service]], Australia's [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], and Taiwan's [[healthcare in Taiwan|National Health Insurance]].

===History of the term===
The term was coined in the 1990s to characterize the differences between the Canadian healthcare system with those such as the United Kingdom's NHS. In the Canadian healthcare system, the government pays private agencies to provide healthcare for qualifying individuals. In other systems, the government both funds and delivers care.<ref name="Liu 2017"> Liu, J. L., & Brook, R. H. (2017).  What is single-payer health care? A review of definitions and proposals in the U.S. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 32(7), 822-831. </ref>

Typically, "single-payer healthcare" refers to health insurance provided as a public service and offered to citizens and legal residents; it does not usually refer to delivery of healthcare services. The fund can be managed by the government directly or as a publicly owned and regulated agency.<ref name="MedicalSubject" /> Single-payer contrasts with other funding mechanisms like 'multi-payer' (multiple public and/or private sources), 'two-tiered' (defined either as a public source with the option to use qualifying private coverage as a substitute, or as a public source for catastrophic care backed by private insurance for common medical care), and 'insurance mandate' (citizens are required to buy private insurance which meets a national standard and which is generally subsidized). Some systems combine elements of these four funding mechanisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.40thdems.org/blog/2017/5/15/single-payer-is-great-but-its-not-the-only-option|title=Single-payer is great but it's not the only option|access-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193522/http://www.40thdems.org/blog/2017/5/15/single-payer-is-great-but-its-not-the-only-option|archive-date=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In contrast to the standard usage of the term, some writers describe all publicly administered systems as "single-payer plans," and others have described any system of healthcare which intends to cover the entire population, such as voucher plans, as "single-payer plans," although these usages generally don't meet strict definitions of the term.<ref>Frank, Robert H. (2007-02-15). "A Health Care Plan So Simple, Even Stephen Colbert Couldn’t Simplify It."

==Regions with single-payer systems==
{{Main|Health care system#International comparisons}}
Several nations worldwide have single-payer health insurance programs. These programs generally provide some form of [[universal healthcare]], which is implemented in a variety of ways. In some cases doctors are employed and hospitals are run by the government, such as in the UK or Spain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/03/158020882/in-british-emergency-room-theres-no-card-to-show-there-are-no-bills|title=In British Emergency Room, 'There's No Card To Show; There Are No Bills'|work=[[NPR]]|last=Aguirre|first=Jessica Camille|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=August 9, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808224307/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/03/158020882/in-british-emergency-room-theres-no-card-to-show-there-are-no-bills|archive-date=August 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Socolovsky|first1=Jerome|title=What Makes Spain's Health Care System The Best?|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112014770|website=NPR|access-date=21 September 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319212430/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112014770|archive-date=March 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Alternatively, the government may purchase healthcare services from outside organizations, such as the approach taken in [[Health care in Canada|Canada]].

===Canada===
{{Main|Health care in Canada}}
{{See also|Medicare (Canada)|Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States}}

Healthcare in Canada is delivered through a [[publicly funded healthcare]] system, which is mostly free at the point of use and has most services provided by private entities.<ref name="CBC">Public vs. private health care ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.</ref> The system was established by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]] of 1984.<ref name="Canada Health Act">{{cite web |url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/medi-assur/cha-lcs/overview-apercu-eng.php |title=Overview of the Canada Health Act |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414052008/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/medi-assur/cha-lcs/overview-apercu-eng.php |archive-date=April 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual's health, which remains confidential between a person and their physician.

Canada's provincially based Medicare systems are cost-effective partly because of their administrative simplicity. In each province, every doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There is no need for the person who accesses healthcare to be involved in billing and reclaim. Private insurance represents a minimal part of the overall system.

In general, costs are paid through funding from income taxes. A health card is issued by the Provincial Ministry of Health to each individual who enrolls for the program and everyone receives the same level of care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php |title=Provincial/Territorial Role in Health |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206214055/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php |archive-date=February 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

There is no need for a variety of plans because virtually all essential basic care is covered, including maternity and infertility problems. Depending on the province, dental and vision care may not be covered but are often insured by employers through private companies. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized.

Cosmetic surgery and some forms of elective surgery are not considered essential care and are generally not covered. These can be paid out-of-pocket or through private insurers. Health coverage is not affected by loss or change of jobs, and there are no lifetime limits or exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

Pharmaceutical medications are covered by public funds or through employment-based private insurance.<ref>CIHI p. 91</ref> Drug prices are negotiated with suppliers by the federal government to control costs. [[Family physician]]s (often known as general practitioners or GPs in Canada) are chosen by individuals. If a patient wishes to see a specialist or is counseled to see a specialist, a referral can be made by a GP.

Canadians do wait for some treatments and diagnostic services. Survey data shows that the median wait time to see a special physician is a little over four weeks with 89.5% waiting less than three months. The median wait time for diagnostic services such as MRI and CAT scans{{NoteTag|Diagnostic tests defined as the following: non-emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices; computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans; and angiographies that use X-rays to examine the inner opening of blood-filled structures such as veins and arteries.}} is two weeks, with 86.4% waiting less than three months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2006-fed-comp-indicat/2006-fed-comp-indicat-3-eng.php#a1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604194222/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2006-fed-comp-indicat/2006-fed-comp-indicat-3-eng.php#a1|url-status=dead|title=Section from Healthy Canadians: A Federal report on Comparable Health Indicators|archive-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref> The median wait time for surgery is four weeks, with 82.2% waiting less than three months.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/161/8/1028 |title=How bad is the brain drain?|first=Charlotte|last=Gray|date=October 19, 1999 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=161|issue=8|pages=1028–1029|access-date=December 12, 2017|via=www.cmaj.ca|pmid=10551204|pmc=1230682|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213081819/http://www.cmaj.ca/content/161/8/1028 |archive-date=December 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

While physician income initially boomed after the implementation of a single-payer program, a reduction in physician salaries followed, which many feared would be a long-term result of government-run healthcare. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, medical professionals were again among Canada's top earners.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|date=2016-11-17|title=The Impact of Single-Payer Health Care on Physician Income in Canada, 1850–2005|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.300093|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3110239|pmid=21566029}}</ref>

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Healthcare in Taiwan}}
Healthcare in Taiwan is administered by the [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] of the [[Executive Yuan]]. As with other [[Developed country|developed economies]], Taiwanese people are well-nourished but face such health problems as chronic [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]].<ref name=cp/>

In 2002, [[Taiwan]] had nearly 1.6 physicians and 5.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population, and there were a total of 36 hospitals and 2,601 clinics in the island.<ref name=cp>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|title=Taiwan country profile|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]]|date=March 2005|access-date=2008-05-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512172454/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|archive-date=May 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> Health expenditures constituted 5.8 percent of the [[GDP]] in 2001, 64.9% of which coming from public funds.<ref name=cp/>

Despite the initial shock on Taiwan's economy from increased costs of expanded healthcare coverage, the single-payer system has provided protection from greater financial risks and has made healthcare more financially accessible for the population, resulting in a steady 70% public satisfaction rating.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Jui-Fen Rachel|last2=Hsiao|first2=William C.|date=2003-05-01|title=Does Universal Health Insurance Make Health Care Unaffordable?

The current [[healthcare system]] in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care funds. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.<ref>Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 |date=June 6, 2008 }}, ''Taiwan Journal'', January 2, 2004, Accessed March 28, 2008</ref>

NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many healthcare providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government.

In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. Taiwan's success with a single-payer health insurance program is owed, in part, to the country's human resources and the government's organizational skills, allowing for the effective and efficient management of the government-run health insurance program.<ref name=":0" />

===South Korea===
{{Main|Healthcare in South Korea}}

South Korea used to have a multipayer [[social health insurance]] universal healthcare system, similar to systems used in countries like Japan and Germany, with healthcare societies providing coverage for the whole populace. Prior to 1977, the country had voluntary private health insurance, but reforms initiated in 1977 resulted in universal coverage by 1989.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Health Care Reform in South Korea: Success or Failure?|first=Jong-Chan|last=Lee|date=January 1, 2003|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=1|pages=48–51|pmid=12511383|pmc=1447690|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.1.48}}</ref> A major healthcare financing reform in 2000 merged all medical societies into the National Health Insurance Service.

==Regions with 'Beveridge Model' systems==

===Nordic countries===

The [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes considered to have single-payer health care services, as opposed to single-payer national health care insurance like Taiwan or Canada. This is a form of the '[[Beveridge Report|Beveridge Model]]' of health care systems that features public health providers in addition to public health insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php|title=Health Care Systems - Four Basic Models - Physicians for a National Health Program|website=www.pnhp.org|access-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031123300/http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php|archive-date=October 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The term 'Scandinavian model' or 'Nordic model' of health care systems has a few common features: largely public providers, limited private health coverage, and regionally-run, devolved systems with limited involvement from the central government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98417/E93429.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809195038/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98417/E93429.pdf |archive-date=August 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Due to this third characteristic, they can also be argued to be single-payer only on a regional level, or to be multi-payer systems, as opposed to the nationally run health coverage found in Taiwan and South Korea.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], meaning that [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] all have their own system of private and [[publicly funded healthcare]], generally referred to as the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). With largely public or government owned providers, this also fits into the 'Beveridge Model' of health care systems, sometimes considered to be single-payer, with relatively little private involvement compared to other universal systems. Each country's having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm 'Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216225814/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm |date=February 16, 2009 }} BBC News, 28 August 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403211931/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm |date=April 3, 2009 }} [[BBC]] 2 January 2008</ref> That said, each country provides public healthcare to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] that is free at the point of use, being paid for from general taxation.

In addition, each also has a private sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as [[HIV]]/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].<ref>[http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html BUPA exclusions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131160104/http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html |date=January 31, 2009 }} bupa.co.uk, accessed 23 February 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/01/16/the-awkward-world-of-private-insurance-in-the-uk/| author=Bob Wachter, MD| title=The Awkward World of Private Insurance in the UK| publisher=The Health Care Blog| date=January 16, 2012| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116164308/http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/01/16/the-awkward-world-of-private-insurance-in-the-uk/| archive-date=November 16, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

* Scotland: [[NHS Scotland]]
* Wales: [[NHS Wales]]
* Northern Ireland: [[Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland)|Health and Social Care]] (HSC)
In England, funding from general taxation is channeled through NHS England, which is responsible for commissioning mainly specialist services and primary care, and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which manage 60% of the budget and are responsible for commissioning health services for their local populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/|title=NHS Commissioning|first=NHS|last=Commissioning|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216223927/https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/|archive-date=December 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

These commissioning bodies do not provide services themselves directly, but procure these from NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, as well as private, voluntary, and social enterprise sector providers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The structure of the NHS in England|url = http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhsstructure.aspx|website = www.nhs.uk|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = NHS|last = Choices|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160220171503/http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhsstructure.aspx|archive-date = February 20, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

==Regions with hybrid single-payer/private insurance systems==

===Australia===
{{Main|Health care in Australia}}
Healthcare in Australia is provided by both private and government institutions. [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] is the publicly funded [[universal health care]] venture in Australia. It was instituted in 1984 and coexists with a private health system. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% [[income tax]] levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private [[health insurance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy increase to fund DisabilityCare Australia|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|website=www.ato.gov.au|access-date=28 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] that considerably subsidises a range of prescription medications. The [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Health]] administers national health policy, elements of which (such as the operation of hospitals) are overseen by individual [[States and territories of Australia|states]].

Building upon less structured foundations, in 1963 the existence of a single-payer healthcare system in Spain was established by the Spanish government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/LaSeguridadSocial/HistoriadelaSegurid47711/index.htm|title=Seguridad Social:Conócenos|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103055711/http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/LaSeguridadSocial/HistoriadelaSegurid47711/index.htm|archive-date=January 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The system was sustained by contributions from workers, and covered them and their dependants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revista-portalesmedicos.com/revista-medica/historia-de-la-sanidad-publica-espanola-revision-bibliografica/2/|title=Historia de la Sanidad Pública española.

The universality of the system was established later in 1986. At the same time, management of public healthcare was delegated to the different [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msssi.gob.es/organizacion/sns/docs/proteccion08.pdf|title=La protección de la salud en España|website=msssi.gob.es|access-date=May 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918015821/http://www.msssi.gob.es/organizacion/sns/docs/proteccion08.pdf|archive-date=September 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While previously this was not the case, in 1997 it was established that public authorities can delegate management of publicly funded healthcare to private companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1997-9021|title=Documento BOE-A-1997-9021|publisher=BOE.es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224164536/https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1997-9021|archive-date=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Additionally, in parallel to the single-payer healthcare system there are private insurers, which provide coverage for some private doctors and hospitals. Employers will sometimes offer private health insurance as a benefit, with 14.8% of the Spanish population being covered under private health insurance in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elblogsalmon.com/entorno/muface-y-la-sanidad-privada-de-verdad-tiene-sentido|title=Muface y la sanidad privada, ¿de verdad tiene sentido?|first=Alejandro Nieto|last=González|date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224172439/http://www.elblogsalmon.com/entorno/muface-y-la-sanidad-privada-de-verdad-tiene-sentido|archive-date=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnalisisSituacion_2013.pdf|title=Informe IDIS, Análisis de situación 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224164343/http://www.fundacionidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnalisisSituacion_2013.pdf|archive-date=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2000, the Spanish healthcare system [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000|was rated]] by the World Health Organization as the 7th best in the world.

Spain's healthcare system ranks 19th in Europe according to the 2018 [[Euro health consumer index]].<ref>{{cite web|title= 2018 European Health Consumer Index|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/media/EHCI-2018/EHCI-2018-report.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare in the United States]] is a public healthcare system, but is restricted to persons over the age of 65, people under 65 who have specific disabilities, and anyone with [[end-stage renal disease]].<ref>HealthCare.gov: [http://www.healthcare.gov/using-insurance/medicare-long-term-care/medicare/index.html#whatmedicare What is Medicare?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220211708/http://www.healthcare.gov/using-insurance/medicare-long-term-care/medicare/index.html |date=February 20, 2013 }}.</ref>

A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, among them the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (popularly known as H.R. 676 or "Medicare for All") originally introduced in the House in February 2003 and repeatedly since.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medicare for All: What Americans Can Expect |url=https://www.newsmax.com/finance/personal-finance/medicare-for-all-what/2020/03/24/id/959784/ |website=NewsMax |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

Advocates argue that [[preventive healthcare]] expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year because publicly funded universal healthcare would benefit employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less, would be spared administrative costs, and inequities between employers would be reduced. Prohibitively high cost is the primary reason Americans give for problems accessing health care.<ref name="dpeaflcio.org">{{cite web|url=http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-u-s-health-care-system-an-international-perspective/|title=The U.S. Health Care System: An International Perspective - DPEAFLCIO|website=dpeaflcio.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328093811/http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-u-s-health-care-system-an-international-perspective/|archive-date=March 28, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At over 27 million, the number of people without [[health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] coverage in the [[United States]] is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]].

Backers of single-payer or Medicare for All note that minorities and the poor, as well as [[Medical deserts in the United States|rural residents]] in general, are less able to afford private health insurance, and that those who can must pay high deductibles and co-payments that threaten families with financial ruin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Health Care In Rural America|url=https://www.cfra.org/Healthcare|date=2007-08-22|website=Center for Rural Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Single-Payer Health Reform: A Step Toward Reducing Structural Racism in Health Care {{!}} Harvard Public Health Review: A Student Publication|url=http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/single-payer-health-reform-a-step-toward-reducing-structural-racism-in-health-care/|website=harvardpublichealthreview.org|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref>

====National policies and proposals====
Government is increasingly involved in [[Health care in the United States|U.S. health care]] spending, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on individuals' medical care in 2004. However, studies have shown that the publicly administered share of health spending in the U.S. may be closer to 60% as of 2002.<ref>Health Affairs, July 2002. Woolhandler, Steffi</ref>

According to [[Princeton University]] health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]], U.S. Medicare, [[Medicaid]], and [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) represent "forms of '[[social insurance]]' coupled with a largely private health-care delivery system" rather than forms of "[[socialized medicine]]." In contrast, he describes the [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Administration healthcare system]] as a pure form of socialized medicine because it is "owned, operated and financed by government."<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 "Letters: For Children's Sake, This 'Schip' Needs to Be Relaunched"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710035107/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 |date=July 10, 2017 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', July 11, 2007, [[Uwe Reinhardt]] and others.</ref>

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] and related government agencies scored the cost of a single-payer health care system several times since 1991. The [[General Accounting Office]] published a report in 1991 noting that "[I]f the US were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer, as in Canada, the savings in administrative costs [10 percent of health spending] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage."<ref>[http://archive.gao.gov/d20t9/144039.pdf "Canadian Health Insurance: Lessons for the United States,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529114235/http://archive.gao.gov/d20t9/144039.pdf |date=May 29, 2005 }} General Accounting Office, June 1991.</ref>

The CBO scored the cost in 1991, noting that "the population that is currently uninsured could be covered without dramatically increasing national spending on health" and that "all US residents might be covered by health insurance for roughly the current level of spending or even somewhat less, because of savings in administrative costs and lower payment rates for services used by the privately insured."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/76xx/doc7652/91-CBO-039.pdf Universal Health Insurance Coverage Using Medicare’s Payment Rates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111233222/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/76xx/doc7652/91-CBO-039.pdf |date=November 11, 2011 }}, Congressional Budget Office, December 1991.</ref>

A CBO report in 1993 stated that "[t]he net cost of achieving universal insurance coverage under this single payer system would be negative" in part because "consumer payments for health would fall by $1,118 per capita, but taxes would have to increase by $1,261 per capita" in order to pay for the plan.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/64xx/doc6442/93doc171.pdf "Single-Payer and All-Payer Health Insurance Systems Using Medicare’s Payment Rates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013135844/http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/64xx/doc6442/93doc171.pdf |date=October 13, 2011 }} Congressional Budget Office, April 1993.</ref> A July 1993 scoring also resulted in positive outcomes, with the CBO stating that, "[a]s the program was phased in, the administrative savings from switching to a single-payer system would offset much of the increased demand for health care services.

Later, the cap on the growth of the national health budget would hold the rate of growth of spending below the baseline."<ref>"Estimates of Health Care Proposals from the 102nd Congress" Congressional Budget Office, July 1993.</ref> The CBO also scored Sen.

A 2014 study published in the journal BMC Medical Services Research by James Kahn, et al., found that the actual administrative burden of health care in the United States was 27% of all national health expenditures. The study examined both direct costs charged by insurers for profit, administration and marketing but also the indirect burden placed on health care providers like hospitals, nursing homes and doctors for costs they incurred in working with private health insurers including contract negotiations, financial and clinical record-keeping (variable and idiosyncratic for each payer).

Kahn, et al. estimate that the added cost for the private insurer health system in the US was about $471 billion in 2012 compared to a single-payer system like Canada's.

According to SB-562, a Healthy California Trust Fund would be established to provide funding for the bill. Currently, states receive funding from the federal government for certain healthcare services such as [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. In addition to taxes, these funds would be pooled into the new [[trust fund]] and provide the sources of funding needed to implement The Healthy California Act. However, California must first obtain a waiver from the federal government which would allow California to pool all the money received from these federal programs into one central fund.<ref name="HealthyReform"/>

{{Main|ColoradoCare}}
The Colorado State Health Care System Initiative, Amendment 69, was a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment proposal in November 2016 to vote on a single-payer healthcare system funded by a 10% payroll tax split 2:1 between employers and employees. This would have replaced the private health insurance premiums currently paid by employees and companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2015/11/09/colorado-puts-single-payer-healthcare-on-2016-ballot/|title=Colorado Puts Single-Payer Healthcare On 2016 Ballot|first=Dan|last=Munro|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729211052/https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2015/11/09/colorado-puts-single-payer-healthcare-on-2016-ballot/|archive-date=July 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The ballot was rejected by 79% of voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/63746/183105/Web01/en/summary.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114234307/http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/63746/183105/Web01/en/summary.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
