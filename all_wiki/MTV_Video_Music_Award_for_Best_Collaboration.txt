The '''MTV Video Music Award for Best Collaboration''' was first introduced to the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 2007 under the name '''Most Earthshattering Collaboration''', as the VMAs were revamped and a few new categories were added to the show. When MTV brought the VMAs back to their old format in 2008, this category did not return. It was not until 2010 that the category was reintroduced under the name '''Best Collaboration'''.

[[Beyoncé]] has received the most wins in this category with three moonmen, followed by [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Lady Gaga]] with two moonmen. [[Rihanna]] and [[Ariana Grande]] are the most nominated artist with six nominations, followed by [[Beyoncé]] with five nominations.
