Senior policy adviser [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] and staff secretary [[Rob Porter]] took the lead in writing the speech.

== Contents and delivery ==

=== Taxation ===
A significant portion of the scripted speech was dedicated to the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|tax package]] passed in December, which Trump labeled as the largest tax reform bill in U.S. history.

=== Economy and employment ===
[[File:Donald Trump State of the Union 2018 (39974382192).jpg|thumb|Trump next to the podium prior to delivering the speech]]
The speech also focused on the economic successes of the first year of the presidency. Trump highlighted the creation of new jobs, specifically 200,000 manufacturing jobs. To support this claim, Trump pointed to invited guests from Staub Manufacturing in Dayton, Ohio, a business that has seen their greatest earnings since starting their business 20 years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ohio-manufacturer-trump-has-our-back/article/2647530|title=Ohio manufacturer: 'Trump has our back'|last=Bedard|first=Paul|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}</ref> The president also reiterated a 45-year low in unemployment, with the lowest rate of African-American and Hispanic unemployment ever recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-hold-fact-check-black-unemployment-rate-1517364943-htmlstory.html|title=Fact check: Black unemployment rate is at a record low; Latino rate is close|last=Puzzanghera|first=Jim|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref>

=== Infrastructure ===
Trump called on Congress to support a plan to spend $1.5 trillion on rebuilding infrastructure across the country. His speech reflected on the building of the [[Empire State Building]], claiming that it was built in one year while current regulations delay construction of some roads by 10 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-of-the-union-trump-infrastructure/|title=Behind Trump's infrastructure plan outlined in State of the Union address|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}</ref> Trump concluded by declaring "we will rebuild infrastructure with American heart, American hands and American grit.‚Äù

=== Immigration ===
Much of the State of the Union came in the form of general policy goals. This was especially the case for the issue of immigration. Trump used personal accounts in order to support his pitch for an overhaul in the U.S. immigration system. Two Long Island families, both of whom had children who were killed by a member of the [[MS-13|MS-13 gang]], a group with ties to Central America, were used to highlight the need to close ‚Äúglaring loopholes‚Äù in the immigration system. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer‚Äôs fight with MS-13 was used as an example for greater border security. After listing the perceived dangers of the current immigration system, Trump gave ‚Äúfour pillars‚Äù of what he sees as the ideal path forward. He offered a broad framework that includes an eventual pathway to citizenship for ‚Äú[[DREAM Act|Dreamers]]‚Äù that will take 12 years and increased border security, two tenets of the current budget negotiations between Democrats and the White House. Trump repeated his desire to move away from the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa|visa-lottery system]], and towards a more merit-based system, which will likely prioritize foreigners with a higher-level of education and wealth. The fourth pillar was to end what has become known as [[chain migration]], the practice of prioritizing the family members of immigrants who are already state-side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-hold-trump-on-chain-migration-1517356312-htmlstory.html|title=Trump says chain migration allows 'virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives'|last=Bennett|first=Brian|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
In a nod to foreign policy and recent provocations against North Korea‚Äôs nuclear ambitions, the speech also said that ‚Äúas part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.‚Äù

Much of the foreign policy portion of the speech criticized North Korea over human rights. Trump introduced both the parents of [[Otto Warmbier]], the American university student who returned to the U.S. in a coma and eventually died following a long detention in North Korea, as well as [[Ji Seong-ho]], an amputee who escaped North Korea as a child after being tortured by authorities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/30/trump-state-of-the-union-2018-speech-quotes-379314|title=Trump offers same policies in new bipartisan packaging|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
In an aim to repeal and replace the [[Affordable Care Act]], Trump highlighted the GOP's action in repealing the [[individual mandate]] as part of their tax overhaul. He also shared that the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] had approved more drugs in 2017 than in any year prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugInnovation/ucm537040.htm|title=Drug Innovation - Novel Drug Approvals for 2017|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref> Additionally, his speech covered his administration's goal to give veterans choice for their healthcare, as well as allowing patients with terminal illnesses to get access to experimental treatments.

Trump emphasized that one of his top priorities in 2018 is to reduce the price of [[prescription drug]]s, citing that drugs in other countries cost far less than the same drugs in the United States.
