"'''Just Dance'''" is the debut [[Single (music)|single]] by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. She co-wrote the song with [[Akon]] and its producer [[RedOne]]. It also features vocals from [[Colby O'Donis]] and was released on April 8, 2008 as the [[lead single]] from Gaga's debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]''. The song was written by Gaga in 10 minutes as "a happy record". "Just Dance" lyrically speaks about being [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] at a [[nightclub|club]].

The song received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its club, anthem-like nature and the sound associated with it. The song reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as well as the top five in the Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Spain, and Sweden. In the United States, "Just Dance" was a [[sleeper hit]], spending almost five months on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] before finally reaching the chart's summit in January 2009. The single is among the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]], having sold over 10 million copies.

The music video of the song portrayed Lady Gaga appearing in a party where she plays the song, prompting party-goers to start dancing in enjoyment. Gaga compared her experience of shooting the video with being on a [[Martin Scorsese]] movie set. "Just Dance" was performed by Gaga in a number of live appearances,  such as ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', all of her concert tours, and the [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]]. She usually plays on a [[keytar]] while performing the song. In 2009, the song received a [[51st Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] category but lost to [[electronic music|electronic]] duo [[Daft Punk]] for their song "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger|Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (Alive 2007)]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1600678/20081204/coldplay.jhtml|title=Lil Wayne, Coldplay Lead Grammy Nominations|date=December 4, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2009|last=Harris|first=Chris|publisher=[[MTV]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308092135/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1600678/20081204/coldplay.jhtml|archivedate=March 8, 2009}}</ref>

Very pristine, big huge room with giant speakers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gagas-poker-face-about-bisexuality-just-dance-written-in-10-minutes/story-e6frewyr-1225699697459|title=Lady GaGa's Poker Face about bisexuality, Just Dance written in 10 minutes|last=Reporter|first=Daily|date=April 17, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=April 28, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013112831/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gagas-poker-face-about-bisexuality-just-dance-written-in-10-minutes/story-e6frewyr-1225699697459|archivedate=October 13, 2009}}</ref> Gaga wrote "Just Dance" during 2008 and according to her it was "hard work and a lot of people didn't believe in it at first".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/91020-lady-gaga-interview|title=Lady GaGa Interview|last=Madsen|first=Ben|date=January 15, 2009|publisher=MTV|accessdate=April 28, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428095033/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/91020-lady-gaga-interview|archivedate=April 28, 2009}}</ref> Later, Gaga reflected on the song by saying,
<blockquote>
"That record saved my life. I was in such a dark space in New York. I was so depressed, always in a bar. I got on a plane to LA to do my music and was given one shot to write the song that would change my life and I did. I never went back. I left behind my boyfriend, my apartment. I still haven't been back. My mother went in and cleared it for me."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/06/lady-gaga-popandrock|title=Soundtrack of my life: Lady Gaga|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|last=Thomson|first=Graeme|date=September 6, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2010|location=London|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922011757/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/06/lady-gaga-popandrock|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Being asked the reason for which "Just Dance" has become popular, Gaga said that she thought, "Everyone is looking for a song that really speaks to the joy in our souls and in our hearts and having a good time. It's just one of those records. It feels really good, and when you listen to it, it makes you feel good inside. It's as simple as that. I don't think it's rocket science when it comes to the heart.
