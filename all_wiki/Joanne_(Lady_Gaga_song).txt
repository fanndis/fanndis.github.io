"'''Joanne'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] for her fifth studio album, also called ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'', in 2016. It was released as the album's third official single on December 22, 2017 in Italy, and a piano version,  titled "'''Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?)'''", followed in the rest of the world on January 26, 2018.<ref name="earone">{{cite news|last1=Aldi|first1=Giorgia|title=Joanne – Lady Gaga (Radio Date: 22-12-2017)|url=http://www.earone.it/news/lady_gaga_joanne_radio_date_22_12_2017_26911449/|accessdate=December 19, 2017|publisher=Earone Radio|date=December 19, 2017|language=Italian}}</ref> The track was written and produced by Gaga and [[Mark Ronson]], with additional production from [[BloodPop]]. Inspired by the singer's late aunt, Joanne Germanotta, the song became a focal point for the musical direction of the album. Gaga intended the song to have a healing effect for those dealing with loss and pain.

Musically, it is a [[Country music|country]] song with stripped-down acoustic composition. The lyrics talk about Joanne's death from the point of view of Gaga's family. The track was complimented for Gaga's vocals and the personal, stripped-down nature of the composition. Prior to being released as a single, "Joanne" had minor chart placements in France and the United Kingdom. Gaga performed "Joanne" at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|60th Grammy Awards]] and during her [[Joanne World Tour]] (2017–2018). It was also featured in the 2017 documentary ''[[Gaga: Five Foot Two]]'', during a scene involving Gaga and her grandmother listening to the track.

The piano version of the song was accompanied by the release of a music video, which continued the loose storyline set in the previous videos for the album. The clip shows the singer belting the song around various natural settings and was critically praised. This version of the song won the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]].

== Background and development ==

[[Lady Gaga]]'s deceased aunt, Joanne Germanotta, had a profound effect on the singer's life and career. Gaga included one of her aunt's unpublished poems on her [[The Fame (album)|first album's]] booklet, and tattooed the date of her death on her left arm. She had initially written a song called "Paradise", inspired by her aunt, while making her fourth studio album, ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'', in 2014 with [[Tony Bennett]]. However, the song was not included on the album. While developing her fifth studio album in 2016, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'', Gaga wrote its title track with producer [[Mark Ronson]] at Shangri-La Studios, where the rest of the album was crafted.<ref name=dailytelegraph/> Describing the song as "the true heart and soul of the record", Gaga emphasized how much Joanne had influenced her family and herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-details-new-album-joanne-w440039|title=Lady Gaga Details New Album 'Joanne'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=September 15, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=November 5, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104032426/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-details-new-album-joanne-w440039|archivedate=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

Joanne died due to complications arising from the autoimmune disease [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] when she was 19 years old. In an interview, Gaga revealed that Joanne's lupus got more complicated after she experienced a sexual assault, and those complications resulted in her death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/157173/who-is-joanne-the-meaning-behind-lady-gaga-s-new-album-title#.qX4jzPcVB|title=Who is 'Joanne?'

During the New York City show of her [[Dive Bar Tour (Lady Gaga)|Dive Bar Tour]] (2016), Gaga added that despite the song's relevance to her family, she wanted the track to appeal to everyone who had suffered the loss of any loved ones.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/10/25/lady-gaga-father-joanne-tattoos/|title=Lady Gaga, father get Joanne tattoos|last=Nolfi|first=Joey|date=October 25, 2016|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 23, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045701/http://ew.com/article/2016/10/25/lady-gaga-father-joanne-tattoos/|archivedate=September 24, 2017}}</ref>
<blockquote>
"My connection to her has been strong my whole life. I always wondered what it was—the mystery of Joanne—this person that I never got to meet that was an absolute tornado of both love and tragedy... She was a powerful, beautiful force in my family's life and then it's like a beautiful light that just goes out, so I've always used the fact that she didn't get to live the rest of her life as a sense of strength and power within me that I have to go out and live the rest for her."<ref name="eonline"/>

== Critical reception ==
''Joanne'' received positive reviews from music critics.

== Media appearance ==
"Joanne" was featured in the [[documentary film]], ''[[Gaga: Five Foot Two]]'', which chronicled the recording of the eponymous album and the singer's life. In one of the scenes, the singer and her father visit her grandmother at the nursing home, so that she can listen to the track about Joanne. Gaga's father is "overcome with emotion, [and] steps out of the room during the visit", and her grandmother reassures the singer that she "got it right" with the song.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7965926/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-netflix-documentary-things-learned|title=11 Things We Learned in Lady Gaga's 'Five Foot Two' Netflix Documentary|last=Armstrong|first=Megan|date=September 21, 2017|accessdate=September 23, 2017|magazine=Billboard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212134831/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7965926/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-netflix-documentary-things-learned|archivedate=December 12, 2017}}</ref> Spencer Kornhaber of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' named it "the most memorable scene of the documentary".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/lady-gagas-illness-is-not-a-metaphor/540369/|title=Lady Gaga's Illness Is Not a Metaphor|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|date=September 21, 2017|accessdate=October 3, 2017|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002003339/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/lady-gagas-illness-is-not-a-metaphor/540369/|archivedate=October 2, 2017}}</ref> Bonnie Stiernberg of ''Billboard'' said that "the film reaches an apex during [this] key scene", calling it "an intimate single-camera shot that moves from Gaga's grandmother's face to her father to Gaga, who plays the song on her cellphone".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7965579/lady-gaga-netflix-documentary-most-emotional-scene-interview|title=Lady Gaga's Netflix Documentary: Inside The Most Emotional Scene|last=Stiernberg|first=Bonnie|date=September 15, 2017|accessdate=September 23, 2017|magazine=Billboard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917063259/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7965579/lady-gaga-netflix-documentary-most-emotional-scene-interview|archivedate=September 17, 2017}}</ref> Leslie Helperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the scene as "fascinating", adding that "[Gaga's] grandmother seems resistant to all this emotional hyperbole, insisting that the loss is well in the past now."<ref name="holrev">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/gaga-five-foot-two-review-1036987|title='Gaga: Five Foot Two': Film Review <nowiki>|</nowiki> TIFF 2017|last=Felperin|first=Leslie|date=September 9, 2017|accessdate=September 23, 2017|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045235/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/gaga-five-foot-two-review-1036987|archivedate=September 24, 2017}}</ref>
