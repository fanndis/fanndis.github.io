The '''Venice Film Festival''' or '''Venice International Film Festival''' ({{lang-it|Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia}}, "International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the [[Venice Biennale]]") is the world's oldest film festival and one of the "[[Film festival#Notable festivals|Big Three]]" film festivals, alongside the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in [[France]] and the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-lineup-720770|title=Venice: David Gordon Green's 'Manglehorn,' Abel Ferrara's 'Pasolini' in Competition Lineup|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Anderson|first=Ariston| accessdate = 9 September 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMujCwAAQBAJ&q=Big+three+film+festivals&pg=PA54|title = Film Festivals: History, Theory, Method, Practice|isbn = 9781317267218|last1 = Valck|first1 = Marijke de|last2 = Kredell|first2 = Brendan|last3 = Loist|first3 = Skadi|date = 26 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3291348/addio-lido-last-postcards-from-the-venice-film-festival/|title=Addio, Lido: Last Postcards from the Venice Film Festival|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate = 9 September 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-09-08|title=50 unmissable film festivals|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/50-unmissable-film-festivals-1117971644/|access-date=2020-06-23|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref> The Big Three are internationally acclaimed for giving creators the artistic freedom to express themselves through film.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The international film festival and the making of a national cinema|first=F.|last=Chan|date=1 June 2011|journal=Screen|volume=52|issue=2|pages=253–260|doi=10.1093/screen/hjr012}}</ref> In 1951, [[FIAPF]] formally accredited the festival.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moeran|first1=Brian|last2=Jesper|first2=Strandgaard Pedersen|date=2011|title=Negotiating Values in the Creative Industries: Fairs, Festivals and Competitive Events|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6P4lZ5Mw30C&q=fiapf+accreditation+1956+berlin&pg=PA173|location=[[Cambridge]] |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=173|isbn=978-1-107-00450-4}}</ref>

Founded in [[Venice]], Italy in August 1932, the festival is part of the [[Venice Biennale]], one of the world's oldest exhibitions of art, created by the Venice City Council on 19 April 1893.<ref>{{cite web| title = La Biennale di Venezia – The origin | url = http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/history/origin.html?back=true | accessdate = 9 September 2018 | date = 7 April 2017 }}</ref> The range of work at the Venice Biennale now covers Italian and international art, architecture, dance, music, theatre, and cinema.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Accounting and the Development of Management Control in the Cultural Sphere: The Case of the Venice Biennale|first1=Maria|last1=Bergamin Barbato|first2=Chiara|last2=Mio|date=1 March 2007|journal=Accounting, Business & Financial History|volume=17|issue=1|pages=187–208|doi=10.1080/09585200601127871|s2cid=154228824}}</ref> These works are experienced at separate exhibitions: the International Art Exhibition, the International Festival of Contemporary Music, the International Theatre Festival, the International Architecture Exhibition, the International Festival of Contemporary Dance, the International Kids' Carnival, and the annual Venice Film Festival, which is arguably the best-known of all the events.

The festival is held in late August or early September on the island of the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] in the [[Venice Lagoon]]. Screenings take place in the historic [[Palazzo del Cinema di Venezia|Palazzo del Cinema]] on the Lungomare Marconi. The festival continues to be one of the world's most popular and fastest-growing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Border Exchanges: The Role of the European Film Festival|first=Owen|last=Evans|date=1 April 2007|journal=Journal of Contemporary European Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–33|doi=10.1080/14782800701273318|s2cid=143590320}}</ref>

==History==

=== 1930s ===
During the 1930s, the government and Italian citizens were heavily interested in film. Of the money Italians spent on cultural or sporting events, most of it went for movies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Italian Fascism's Empire Cinema|last=Ben-Ghiat|first=Ruth|author-link=Ruth Ben-Ghiat|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=4–5}}</ref> The majority of films screened in Italy were American, which led to government involvement in the film industry and the yearning to celebrate Italian culture in general.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Taillibert|first1=Christel|last2=Wäfler|first2=John|date=2 January 2016|title=Groundwork for a (pre)history of film festivals|journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1080/17400309.2015.1106688|s2cid=190859918|issn=1740-0309|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-02177501/file/Taillibert-W%C3%A4fler.%20Groundwork%20for%20a%20%28Pre%29History%20of%20Film%20Festivals.pdf}}</ref> With this in mind, the Venice International Film Festival was created by [[Giuseppe Volpi]], Luciano de Feo, and Antonio Maraini in 1932.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Venice: The Biography of a City|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|year=1989|isbn=978-0-393-02676-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/venice00chri/page/315 315–320]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/venice00chri/page/315}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://asac.labiennale.org/it/|title=ASAC Dati|website=asac.labiennale.org|language=it|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Volpi, a statesman, wealthy businessman, and avid [[fascist]] who had been [[Benito Mussolini]]'s minister of finance, was appointed president of the Venice Biennale the same year. Maraini served as the festival's [[secretary general]], and de Feo headed its executive committee.<ref name=":1" />

On the night of 6 August 1932, the festival opened with a screening of the American film [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'']] on the terrace of the Excelsior Palace Hotel. A total of nine countries participated in the festival, which ended on 21 August.<ref name=":1" />

No awards were given at the first festival, but an audience referendum was held to determine which films and performances were most praiseworthy. The French film ''[[À Nous la Liberté]]'' was voted the Film Più Divertente (the Funnest Film). ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'' was chosen the Film Più Commovente (the Most Moving Film) and its star, [[Helen Hayes]], the best actress. Most Original Film (Film dalla fantasia più originale) was given to ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'', and its leading man, [[Fredric March]], was voted best actor.<ref name=":1" />

Despite the success of the first festival, it did not return in 1933. In 1934, the festival was declared to be an annual event, and participation grew from nine countries to seventeen. That year the festival also gave its first official awards, namely the Mussolini Cup for Best Italian Film, the Mussolini Cup for Best Foreign Film, and the Corporations Ministry Cup. Seventeen awards were given: fourteen to films and three to individuals. Five films received honorable mentions.<ref name=":1" />

The third installment of the festival in 1935 was headed by its first artistic director, [[Ottavio Croze]], who maintained this position until [[World War II]]. The following year, a jury was added to the festival's governing body; it had no foreign members.<ref name=":1" /> The majority of funds for the festival came from the Ministry of Popular Culture, with other portions from the Biennale and the city of Venice.<ref name=":3">{{Citation|last=Stone|first=Marla|title=The Last Film Festival|work=Re-viewing Fascism|pages=293–314|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253109149|doi=10.2307/j.ctt2005t72.15|year=2002}}</ref>

The year 1936 marked another important development in the festival. A law crafted by the Ministry of Popular Culture made the festival an autonomous entity, separate from the main Venice Biennale. This allowed additional fascist organizations, such as the Department of Cinema and the Fascist National Federation of Entertainment Industries, to take control of the festival.<ref name=":3" />

The fifth year of the festival saw the establishment of its permanent home. Designed and completed in 1937, the [[Palazzo del Cinema di Venezia|Palazzo del Cinema]] was built on [[Lido di Venezia|the Lido]]. The Palazzo has since been the site for every Venice Film Festival, with the exception of the three years from 1940 to 1942, when the festival was moved away from Venice for fear of bombing. However, Venice received almost no damage during that time.<ref name=":2" />

===1940s===
[[File:Mostra di Venezia al Palazzo Ducale 1947.jpg|thumb|The [[Doge's Palace]] in [[Piazza San Marco]] hosted the [[8th Venice International Film Festival|1947 edition]].]]

The 1940s represent one of the most difficult moments for the festival itself. Nazi propaganda movie ''[[Heimkehr]]'' was presented in 1941 winning an award from the Italian [[Ministry of Popular Culture]]. With the advent of the conflict the situation degenerated to such a point that the editions of 1940, 1941 and 1942, subsequently are considered as if they did not happen because they were carried out in places far away from Lido.<ref name="la_biennale"/> Additionally, the festival was renamed the Italian-German Film Festival (Manifestazione Cinematografica Italo-Germanica) in 1940. The festival carried this title until 1942 when the festival was suspended due to war.<ref name=":3" />

The festival resumed full speed in 1946, after the war. For the first time, the [[7th Venice International Film Festival|1946 edition]] was held in the month of September, in accordance to an agreement with the newly-reborn [[Cannes Film Festival]], which had just held its first review in the spring of that year. With the return to normality, Venice once again became a great icon of the film world.<ref name="la_biennale"/>

In 1947 the festival was held in the courtyard of the [[Doge's Palace]], a most magnificent backdrop for hosting a record 90 thousand participants. The [[8th Venice International Film Festival|1947 festival]] is widely considered one of the most successful editions in the history of the festival.<ref name="la_biennale">{{cite web| title = History of the Venice Film Festival| url = http://www.labiennale.org/en/history-venice-film-festival | accessdate = 9 September 2018 | date = 7 December 2017 }}</ref>

===Development and closure===
[[File:Aldo Moro, Pier Paolo Pasolini - Venezia 1964.jpg|thumb|The Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]] and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] together in [[Venice]] at the premiere of the movie ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]'' in 1964.]]
In 1963 the winds of change blew strongly during [[Luigi Chiarini]]’s directorship of the festival (1963–1968). During the years of his directorship, Chiarini aspired to renew the spirit and the structures of the festival, pushing for a total reorganization of the entire system. For six years the festival followed a consistent path, according to the rigid criteria put in place for the selection of works in competition, and took a firm stand against the political pressures and interference of more and more demanding movie studios, preferring the artistic quality of films to the growing commercialization of the film industry.

The social and political unrest of 1968 had strong repercussions on the Venice Bienniale. From 1969 to 1979 no prizes were awarded and the festival returned to the non-competitiveness of the first edition due to the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]. In 1973, 1977 and 1978, the festival was not even held. The [[Golden Lion]] didn't make its return until 1980.<ref name="la_biennale"/>

The long-awaited rebirth came in 1979, thanks to the new director [[Carlo Lizzani]] (1979–1983), who decided to restore the image and value the festival had lost over the last decade. The [[36th Venice International Film Festival|1979 edition]] laid the foundation for the restoration of international prestige. In an attempt to create a more modern image of the festival, the neo-director created a committee of experts to assist in selecting the works and to increase the diversity of submissions to the festival.

In 2004 an independent and parallel film festival [[Venice Days]] (Le Giornate degli Autori) was created in association with the Festival.

To celebrate the 70th edition of the festival, in 2013 the new section "Venezia 70 – Future Reloaded" was created.

===Great Gold Medals of the National Fascist Association for Entertainment===
"Le Grandi Medaglie d’Oro dell’Associazione Nazionale Fascista dello Spettacolo" in Italian.

This was awarded to Best Actor and Best Actress. It was later replaced by the Volpi Cup for actors and actresses.<ref name=labiennale.org />

===Audience Referendum===
In the first edition of the festival in [[1st Venice International Film Festival|1932]], due to the lack of a jury and the awarding of official prizes, a list of acknowledgements was decided by popular vote, a tally determined by the number of people flocking to the films, and announced by the Organizing Committee. From this, the ''Best Director'' was declared – Russian Nikolai Ekk for the film [[Road to Life (1931 film)|''Road to Life'']], while the film by [[René Clair]] ''[[À Nous la Liberté]]'' was voted Best Film.
