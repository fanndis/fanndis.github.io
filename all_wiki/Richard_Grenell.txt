Grenell was a regular contributor on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Tucker Carlson Tonight]]'' during the first few months of his ambassadorship in Germany. In November 2018, he appeared on the show and repeated his criticism of Angela Merkel's immigration policies. Grenell compared Merkel unfavorably to the recently elected [[Chancellor of Austria]] [[Sebastian Kurz]], who (according to Grenell) "won in a very big way" because of his strict stance on immigration. The magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' called these remarks a "thinly veiled call for a change of government in Berlin".<ref name="Spiegel"/>

In December 2018, during the affair surrounding ''Der Spiegel'' journalist [[Claas Relotius]], Grenell wrote to the magazine, complained about an [[Anti-American sentiment in Germany|anti-American institutional bias]], and asked for an independent investigation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Connolly|first1=Kate|last2=Le Blond|first2=Josie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/23/anti-america-bias-der-spiegel-scandal-relotius|title=Der Spiegel takes the blame for scandal of reporter who faked stories|work=The Guardian|date=December 23, 2018|access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article185986368/Fall-Relotius-US-Botschaft-wirft-Spiegel-eklatanten-Anti-Amerikanismus-vor.html|title=US-Botschaft wirft "Spiegel" "eklatanten Anti-Amerikanismus" vor |publisher=[[Die Welt]]|date=December 22, 2018| language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Der Spiegel to press charges against reporter who made up article about Fergus Falls, Minnesota |url=http://www.startribune.com/der-spiegel-to-press-charges-against-reporter-who-made-up-article-about-fergus-falls-minnesota/503414652/ |work=Star Tribune |date=December 24, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2019, Grenell told ''[[Handelsblatt]]'' that European companies participating in the construction of the [[Nord Stream 2]] gas pipeline are "always in danger, because sanctions are always possible".

''Der Spiegel'' published a profile of Grenell on January 11, 2019, using interviews with 30 “American and German diplomats, cabinet members, lawmakers, high-ranking officials, lobbyists and think tank experts". The magazine wrote that "almost all of these sources paint an unflattering portrait of the ambassador, one remarkably similar to Donald Trump, the man who sent him to Berlin. A majority of them describe Grenell as a vain, narcissistic person who dishes out aggressively, but can barely handle criticism." The profile claimed that Grenell was politically isolated in Berlin because of his alleged association with the far-right [[Alternative for Germany]] Party, causing the leaders of the mainstream German parties—including the Chancellor herself—to avoid contact with him; while Grenell had pressed German parliamentarians to invite him to their districts, most had declined.<ref name="Spiegel">{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/u-s-ambassador-richard-grenell-is-isolated-in-berlin-a-1247610.html| title=Trump's Ambassador Finds Few Friends in Germany| author=Konstantin von Hammerstein| publisher=Der Spiegel| date=January 11, 2019| access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref> The sources claimed that Grenell knew little "about Germany and Europe, that he ignores most of the dossiers his colleagues at the embassy write for him, and that his knowledge of the subject matter is superficial".<ref name="Spiegel"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/01/germans-shunning-trumps-vain-narcissistic-gay-ambassador/|title=Germans are shunning Trump's 'vain, narcissistic' gay ambassador|first=Bil|last=Browning|date=January 14, 2019|website=LGBTQ Nation}}</ref>

In March 2019, [[Wolfgang Kubicki]], [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Vice President of the Bundestag]] and deputy chairman of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], called for Grenell to be expelled from Germany.

A February 20, 2020, White House press release announcing the appointment of Grenell to the post of Acting Director of National Intelligence, stated that Grenell had "years of experience working with our Intelligence Community in a number of additional positions";<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement from the Press Secretary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-113/|date=February 20, 2020|work=The White House}}</ref> however, this assertion was disputed by others who asserted Grenell had little background in intelligence matters.<ref>{{cite web|title=White House Appoints Outspoken Ambassador As New Acting Head Of Intelligence|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/20/807644469/white-house-appoints-outspoken-ambassador-as-new-acting-head-of-intelligence|website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=President Trump appoints loyalist Richard Granell as acting intelligence chief - CNN Video|website=cnn.com|url=https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/20/richard-grenell-national-intelligence-marquardt-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Trump angry after House briefed on Russia meddling in 2020 election on his behalf|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-anger-cost-joseph-maguire-job-director-national-intelligence-n1140086|website=NBC News}}</ref> Republican Senator [[Susan Collins]], one of four co-authors of the legislation creating the ODNI in 2004, said: "I care deeply about that position and believe the person needs experience in the intelligence community, which regrettably Ambassador Grenell does not have."<ref>{{cite web|title=Trump Creates New Headaches for GOP with Top Intelligence Pick|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/484440-trump-creates-new-headaches-for-gop-with-top-intelligence-pick|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|date=February 25, 2020|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

On March 10, 2020, Grenell declined to attend a congressional hearing on election security, "citing apprehension about his preparedness to address sensitive subjects that tend to upset the president."<ref>{{Cite web|title=No evidence yet that Russia has taken steps to help any candidate in 2020, intelligence official tells Congress|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/richard-grenell-trump-intelligence-election-security/2020/03/10/6504cc36-62d6-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|website=Washington Post}}</ref>

Grenell claimed in August 2020 that "President Trump is the most pro-gay president in American history. I can prove it." ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker gave his claim "Four Pinocchios" and described the claim as absurd. The fact-checker noted, "the only items Grenell can cite in support of his supposedly pro-gay record concern Grenell’s own temporary appointment and a policy announced by Grenell that Trump apparently knew little about... That’s pretty thin gruel on which to claim Trump is the most pro-gay president in history, especially when Trump has worked actively to undermine protections for the LGBT community that were enacted under Obama."<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020|title=The absurd claim that Trump is the ‘most pro-gay president in American history’|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/24/absurb-claim-that-trump-is-most-pro-gay-president-american-history/}}</ref>

On November 2, 2020, the day before election day, Grenell posted an old photo from 2019 to claim that Joe Biden did not wear a mask on a plane during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grenell called Biden a "Washington, DC phony!", suggesting that Biden only wore a mask in public for appearances' sake while not wearing one in private.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-02|title=Trump’s former intelligence chief uses a 2019 photo to attack Biden for not wearing a face mask|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/joe-biden-face-mask-trump-richard-grenell-b1532243.html|access-date=2020-11-02|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Daniel Dale|title=Fact check: Viral photo of Biden on a plane without a mask is from before the pandemic|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/politics/biden-photo-on-plane-no-face-mask/index.html|access-date=2020-11-02|website=CNN}}</ref>

Ten days later, ''[[LGBTQ Nation]]'' reported that Grenell was being called a "towering imbecile" on social media after having been tricked on [[Veterans Day]], November 11, 2020, into tweeting well wishes to [[William Calley]], the former [[U.S. Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] convicted for the premeditated killings of 22 unarmed civilians in the 1968 [[Mỹ Lai massacre]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. ''[[The Nation]]'' journalist [[Ken Klippenstein]] had tweeted a picture of Calley to Grenell, pretending it was a photo of his own grandfather and requesting public recognition of the elderly veteran. In response, Grenell tweeted, "Thank you for your service, Bill Calley! #VeteransDay". Upon learning that he'd been duped, Grenell tweeted, "It's a shame people would do this on a day like today."<ref name="Thanked a war criminal">{{cite web|author=Browning, Bil|date=November 12, 2020|title=Trump's gay outreach director thanked a war criminal for his "service" on Veterans Day|url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/11/trumps-gay-outreach-director-thanked-war-criminal-service/|access-date=November 12, 2020|work=[[LGBTQ Nation]]}}</ref>
