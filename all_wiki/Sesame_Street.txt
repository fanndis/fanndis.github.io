'''''Sesame Street''''' is an American [[educational television|educational]] [[children's television]] series that combines live-action, sketch comedy, animation and puppetry. It is produced by [[Sesame Workshop]] (known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) until June 2000) and was created by [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]]. The program is known for its images communicated through the use of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[The Muppets|Muppets]], and includes short films, with humor and cultural references. The series premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy,<ref name="morrow-3"/> and high viewership; it has aired on the U.S.'s national [[Public broadcasting|public television]] provider [[PBS]] since its debut, with its first run moving to [[Pay television|premium channel]] [[HBO]] on January 16, 2016, then its sister streaming service [[HBO Max]] in 2020.

The format of ''Sesame Street'' consists of a combination of [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience's viewing habits. With the creation of ''Sesame Street'', producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a [[curriculum]] to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied. The show, therefore, has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum.

Shortly after creating ''Sesame Street'', its producers developed what came to be called the "CTW model" (after the production company's previous name), a system of television show planning, production, and evaluation based on collaborations between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales, and other media. By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or "[[Sesame Street international co-productions|co-productions]]", of ''Sesame Street'' broadcast in twenty countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of ''Sesame Street'', and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.

''Sesame Street'' was by then the fifteenth-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American [[preschool]]ers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched the series as children. As of 2018, ''Sesame Street'' has won 189 [[Emmy Award]]s and 11 [[Grammy Award]]s, more than any other children's show.

==History==
{{Main|History of Sesame Street}}
''Sesame Street'' was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would "master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them",<ref name="davis-8">Davis, p. 8</ref> such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8|1969}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} from the Carnegie Foundation, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] to create and produce a new children's television show.<ref name="finch-53">Finch, p. 53</ref> The program premiered on [[public broadcasting|public television]] stations on November 10, 1969.<ref name="brooke">{{cite news | last = Brooke| first = Jill | title = 'Sesame Street' Takes a Bow to 30 Animated Years | work = The New York Times | date = November 13, 1998 | url = http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/13/sesame.street/ | accessdate = March 11, 2019}}</ref> It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research.<ref name="palmer">Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 9</ref>  Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy,<ref name="morrow-3"/> and high ratings.

According to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s ''Sesame Street'' the show had become "an American institution".<ref>Davis, p. 220</ref> The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to, and expanded, other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book [[Royalty payment|royalties]], product licensing, and foreign broadcast income.<ref name="odell">O'Dell, pp. 73-74</ref> ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s curriculum has expanded to include more [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew, most notably, the 1982 death of [[Will Lee]]—who played [[Mr. Hooper]]<ref name="hellman-52">{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = November 23, 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = March 12, 2019}}</ref>—and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 80</ref>

By the end of the 1990s, ''Sesame Street'' faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in viewing habits of young children, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings.<ref>Davis, p. 320</ref>  After the turn of the 21st century, ''Sesame Street'' made major structural changes. For example, starting in 2002, its format became more narrative and included ongoing storylines. After its thirtieth anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet [[Elmo]] the show also incorporated a popular segment known as "[[Elmo's World]]".<ref name="goodman">{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Goodman | title = Word on the 'Street': Classic children's show to undergo structural changes this season | url = http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/WORD-ON-THE-STREET-Classic-children-s-show-to-2877849.php | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date = February 4, 2002 | accessdate = October 18, 2019}}</ref>  In 2009, the show was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eng |first1=Joyce |title=Guiding Light, Sesame Street to Be Honored at Daytime Emmys |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/guiding-light-sesame-1009313/ |accessdate=October 18, 2019 |work=TV Guide |date=August 28, 2009}}</ref>

==Format==
{{Main|Format of Sesame Street}}
From its first episode, ''Sesame Street'' has structured its format by using "a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music," as well as animation and live-action short films.<ref>O'Dell, p. 70</ref>  When ''Sesame Street'' premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long [[attention span]]s; therefore, the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. At first, the show's "street scenes"—the action taking place on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories. Instead, they consisted of individual, curriculum-based segments which were interrupted by "inserts" consisting of puppet sketches, short films, and animations. This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary the show's pace. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.<ref>Morrow, p. 87</ref><ref>Gikow, p. 179</ref>

}}

Upon recommendations by [[developmental psychology|child psychologists]], the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children.<ref>Fisch & Bernstein, p. 39</ref> When the CTW tested the appeal of the new show, they found that although children paid attention to the shows during the Muppet segments, their interest was lost during the "Street" segments.<ref>Gladwell, p. 105</ref> The producers requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as [[Big Bird]] and [[Oscar the Grouch]] to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot.<ref>Gladwell, p. 106</ref><ref>Fisch & Bernstein, pp. 39—40</ref> ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s format remained intact until the 2000s, when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format. In 1998, the popular "Elmo's World", a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created.<ref>Clash, p. 75</ref> Starting in 2014, during the show's 45th season, the producers introduced a half-hour version of the program. The new version, which originally complemented the full-hour series, was both broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dockterman|first1=Eliana|title=We're Getting a Half-Hour Version of Sesame Street|url=http://time.com/2894617/sesame-street-half-hour/|accessdate=October 18, 2019|work=Time Magazine|date=June 18, 2014}}</ref>  In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show's producers decreased the show's length from one hour to thirty minutes across all its broadcast platforms.  The new version focused on fewer characters, reduced the pop culture references "once included as winks for their parents", and focused "on a single backbone topic".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harwell |first1=Drew |title=Sesame Street, newly revamped for HBO, aims for toddlers of the Internet age |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2016/01/12/9350ec70-b491-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html |accessdate=15 May 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=12 January 2016}}</ref>

[[File:BlogHer 08 - Sesame Street Suite (2682321763).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Signpost of the ''Sesame Street''.]]
Author [[Malcolm Gladwell]] said that "''Sesame Street'' was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them".<ref>Gladwell, p. 100</ref> [[Gerald S. Lesser]], the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention.<ref name="Lesser, p. 116">Lesser, p. 116</ref> ''Sesame Street'' was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, "small but critical adjustments" to keep it.<ref>Gladwell, p. 91</ref> According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, ''Sesame Street'' was one of the few children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from [[formative assessment|formative]] and [[summative]] research.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fisch | first = Shalom M. | author2 = Rosemarie T.

The creators of ''Sesame Street'' and their researchers formulated both [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[affect (psychology)|affective]] goals for the show.

After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s first season, its critics forced its producers and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of [[cultural diversity|diversity]], and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters.<ref>{{cite book | last = Huston | first = Aletha C |author2=Daniel R. Anderson |author3=John C.

The show's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.<ref>Gikow, p. 181</ref>

==Funding==
As a result of Cooney's initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her an $1 million grant to create a new children's television program and establish the CTW,<ref name="davis-8"/><ref name="finch-53"/><ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 3</ref> renamed in June 2000 to [[Sesame Workshop]] (SW). Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, [[The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations]], [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|CPB]], and the [[Ford Foundation]]. Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show.<ref>Davis, p. 105</ref> As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks, but created challenges in procuring future funding.<ref>Lesser, p. 17</ref>

After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered "seed" money, would need to be replaced.<ref name="davis-203">Davis, p. 203</ref> The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.<ref name="odell"/>

In 1998, the CTW accepted [[sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsorship]] to raise funds for ''Sesame Street'' and other projects. For the first time, they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer [[Discovery Zone]], their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]], who had previously appeared on ''Sesame Street'', called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was "exploiting impressionable children".<ref name="brooke"/>  In 2015, in response to funding challenges, it was announced that [[pay television|premium television]] service [[HBO]] would air first-run episodes of ''Sesame Street''.<ref name="movetohbo"/>  Steve Youngwood, SW's Chief Operating Officer, called the move "one of the toughest decisions we ever made".<ref name="guthrie2">{{cite news |last1=Guthrie |first1=Marisa |title=Where 'Sesame Street' Gets Its Funding — and How It Nearly Went Broke |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sesame-street-gets-funding-how-it-went-broke-1183032 |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> According to ''The New York Times'', the move "drew an immediate backlash".<ref name="steel" /> Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less-advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show.

==Production==

===Research===
{{Main|Sesame Street research}}

Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, "Without research, there would be no ''Sesame Street''".<ref name="cooney-xi">Cooney in Fisch & Truglio, p. xi</ref> 
In 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, "positively heretical".<ref name="cooney-xi"/> Shortly after creating ''Sesame Street'', its producers began to develop what came to be called "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show's first season.<ref name="morrow-68">Morrow, p. 68</ref>{{refn|See Gikow, p. 155, for a visual representation of the CTW model.|group=note}} According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: "the interaction of receptive television producers and [[child development|child science]] experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning".<ref name="morrow-68"/>

Cooney credited the show's high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors [[Gerald S. Lesser]], who the CTW hired to design the show's educational objectives, and [[Edward L. Palmer]], who was responsible for conducting the show's formative research and for bridging the gap between the show's producers and researchers.<ref name="cooney-xii">Cooney in Fisch & Truglio, p. xii</ref> The CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production,<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 84–85</ref> and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) during the show's first two seasons, which measured its educational effectiveness.<ref name="palmer"/> Cooney stated, "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners".<ref>Borgenicht, p. 9</ref> Cooney also described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".<ref name="cooney-xi"/>

===Writing===
''Sesame Street'' has used many writers in its long history. As Peter Hellman wrote in his 1987 article in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', "The show, of course, depends upon its writers, and it isn't easy to find adults who could identify the interest level of a pre-schooler".<ref name="hellman-52"/> Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. [[Norman Stiles]], head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would "burn out" after writing about a dozen scripts.<ref name="hellman-52"/> According to Gikow, ''Sesame Street'' went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy.<ref name="gikow-178">Gikow, p. 178</ref> As Stone stated, "Writing for children is not so easy".<ref name="gikow-178"/> Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, "It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".<ref>Gikow, p. 174</ref>

[[File:Kaufman Univ Studio LIC jeh.JPG|right|200px|thumb|alt=Facade of a large white building, the left having large pillars beneath a strip with dozens of windows and the right three stories of large windows.|The [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], where ''Sesame Street'' is taped]]

The show's research team developed an annotated document, or "Writer's Notebook", which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development.<ref name="lesser-101">Lesser, p. 101</ref> The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points,<ref>Morrow, p. 82</ref> provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material.<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 10</ref> Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 11</ref>

The research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed "a curriculum sheet" that described the show's goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an "assignment sheet" was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic.<ref name="lesser-101"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Lesser | first = Gerald S. |author2=Joel Schneider  |editor= Shalom M.

Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes, lights, and sets. The writers were present during the show's taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in [[Manhattan]], and after 1992, at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens]] to make last-minute revisions when necessary.<ref>{{cite news | last = Murphy | first = Tim | title = How We Got to 'Sesame Street' | work = New York Magazine | url = http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/61744/ | date = November 1, 2009 | accessdate = July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = How to Get to 'Sesame Street' at the Apollo Theater | publisher = New York City Mayor's Office | date = November 19, 2008 | url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news_2008/110108_sesame_panel_recap.shtml | accessdate = July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Spinney | first = Caroll | author2 = Jason Milligan | title = The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch): Lessons from a Life in Feathers | publisher = Random House | year = 2003 | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/wisdomofbigbirda00spin/page/3 3] | isbn = 0-375-50781-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/wisdomofbigbirda00spin/page/3 }}</ref>{{refn|Most of the first season was filmed at a studio near [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but a strike forced their move to [[Teletape Studios]].

Early in their history ''Sesame Street'' and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, "a multiple-media institution".<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref> In 1970, the CTW created a "non-broadcast" division responsible for creating and publishing books and ''[[Sesame Street Magazine]]''.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 197–198</ref>  By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.<ref name="guthrie"/>  The Workshop decided from the start that all materials their licensing program created would "underscore and amplify"<ref name="davis-205">Davis, p. 205</ref><ref name="davis-195"/> the show's curriculum.

[[Jim Henson]], the creator of the Muppets, owned the [[trademark]]s to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, [[Sesame Street video games|computer games]], and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts.<ref name="davis-203"/><ref>Gikow, p. 268</ref> Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions.<ref name="davis-205"/> Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show's airings.<ref name="davis-204">Davis, p. 204</ref> As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref name="davis-204"/>{{refn|According to ''Parade Magazine'' in 2019, 1 million children played with ''Sesame Street'' toys daily.<ref name="wallace"/>|group=note}}

Director Jon Stone, talking about the music of ''Sesame Street'', said: "There was no other sound like it on television".<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref> For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref> In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like [[Joe Raposo]], ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s first musical director, to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest.<ref>Davis, p. 256</ref> By 2019, there were 180 albums of ''Sesame Street'' music produced, and its songwriters had received 11 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].<ref name="wallace"/><ref name="guthrie"/>  In late 2018, the SW announced a multi-year agreement with [[Warner Music Group]] to re-launch Sesame Street Records in the U.S. and Canada.

''Sesame Street'' used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios,<ref name="gikow-236"/> interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters.<ref>Morrow, p. 89</ref> Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show.<ref name="gikow-236">Gikow, p. 236</ref> Shortly after ''Sesame Street'' debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home.

Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".<ref>Davis, pp. 128–129</ref> She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. [[Jon Stone]] was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.<ref>Davis, p. 147</ref> Cameraman Frankie Biondo worked on ''Sesame Street'' from its first episode.<ref>Gikow, p. 15</ref>

Jim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in ''Sesame Street'' began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should "make do without puppets".<ref name="finch-53"/> Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join ''Sesame Street'' to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW.<ref name="davis-5"/> As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention.<ref>Morrow, p. 93</ref> Davis reported that Henson was able to take "arcane academic goals" and translate them to "effective and pleasurable viewing".<ref>Davis, p. 163</ref> In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.<ref>Morrow, pp. 94–95</ref>

Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for ''Sesame Street'', instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors,<ref>Lesser, p. 99</ref> they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities",<ref>Lesser, p. 125</ref> both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority,<ref name="hellman-52"/> was responsible for hiring the show's first [[List of human Sesame Street characters|cast]]. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the "most enthusiastic thumbs up" were cast.<ref name="Borgenicht-15">Borgenicht, p. 15</ref>  For example, [[Loretta Long]] was chosen to play [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Susan]] when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of "[[I'm a Little Teapot]]".<ref name="Borgenicht-15"/><ref>Davis, p. 172</ref> Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was "just completely haphazard".<ref name="davis-195">Davis, p. 195</ref> Most of the cast and crew found jobs on ''Sesame Street'' through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.<ref name="davis-195" />  According to puppeteer [[Martin P. Robinson|Marty Robinson]] in 2019, longevity was common among the show's cast and crew.<ref name="guthrie"/>

According to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes.<ref>Lesser, p. 127</ref> Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used,<ref name="morrow-84">Morrow, p. 84</ref> so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult [[List of human Sesame Street characters|cast]] learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson.<ref>Lesser, pp. 127–128</ref>  CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers.<ref>Gikow, p. 123</ref> According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a "fresh quality", especially in its early years.<ref name="morrow-84"/>

===Ratings===
When ''Sesame Street'' premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating, which totaled 1.9 million households.<ref name="Seligsohn">Seligsohn, Leo. (February 9, 1970). "Backstage at Sesame Street". ''New York Newsday''. Quoted in Davis, p. 197.</ref> By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school.

The show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, due to changes in children's viewing habits and in the television marketplace.

{{Main|Sesame Street research#Summative research}}
As of 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture.<ref name="cooney-xii" /> The CTW solicited the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show.<ref name="mielke-85"/> ETS's two "landmark"<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 88</ref> summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers.<ref name="palmer-20"/> These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children.<ref name="mielke-85">Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 85</ref>{{refn|According to Edward Palmer and his colleague Shalom M.

Lesser believed that ''Sesame Street'' research "may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children".<ref name="lesser-235">Lesser, p. 235</ref> He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry.<ref name="lesser-235"/> Historian Robert Morrow, in his book ''Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television'', which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw ''Sesame Street'' as a "straightforward illustration for reform".<ref name="morrow-122">Morrow, p. 122</ref> Les Brown, a writer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', saw in ''Sesame Street'' "a hope for a more substantial future" for television.<ref name="morrow-122"/>

Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as "appeasement gestures".<ref>Morrow, p. 127</ref> According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them.<ref>Morrow, p. 130</ref> By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming.<ref>Morrow, p. 132</ref> Other critics hoped that ''Sesame Street'', with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers.<ref>Morrow, p. 124</ref> It was not until the mid-1990s that another children's television educational program, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of ''Blue's Clues'' were influenced by ''Sesame Street'', but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, "We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further".<ref>Gladwell, p. 111</ref>

Critic [[Richard Roeper]] said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of ''Sesame Street'' has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially speculation concerning the sexuality of [[Bert and Ernie]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Roeper | first = Richard | title = Hollywood Urban Legends: The Truth Behind All Those Delightfully Persistent Myths of Film, Television and Music | year = 2001 | publisher = Career Press | location = Franklin Lakes, New Jersey | isbn = 1-56414-554-9 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/hollywoodurbanle00rich/page/48 48–53] | url = https://archive.org/details/hollywoodurbanle00rich/page/48 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45566451|title=Bert and Ernie sexuality debate rages|date=September 18, 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 16, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Sesame Street'' was praised from its debut in 1969. ''Newsday'' reported that several newspapers and magazines had written "glowing" reports about the CTW and Cooney.<ref name="Seligsohn"/> The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.<ref>Morrow, pp. 119–120</ref> In 1970, ''Sesame Street'' won twenty awards, including a [[Peabody Award]], three Emmys, an award from the [[Public Relations Society of America]], a [[Clio Awards|Clio]], and a Prix Jeunesse.<ref>Morrow, p. 119</ref> By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four [[Parents' Choice Award]]s. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].<ref name="allshow"/>

''Sesame Street'' was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in [[Mississippi]], where Henson was from, operated the state's PBS [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|member station]]; in May 1970 it voted to not air ''Sesame Street'' because of its "highly [racially] integrated cast of children" which "the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for".<ref>"Mississippi Agency Votes for a TV Ban on 'Sesame Street'". (May 3, 1970). ''The New York Times''.

Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called "surprisingly intense",<ref name="morrow-3">Morrow, p. 3</ref> stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, "the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them".<ref name="morrow-3"/>

According to Morrow, the "most important" studies finding negative effects of ''Sesame Street'' were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist [[Thomas D. Cook]] during its first two seasons.<ref>Morrow, pp. 146–147</ref> Social scientist and [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] founder [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] criticized the show for being too wholesome.<ref>{{cite news | last = Kanfer | first = Stefan | title = Who's Afraid of Big, Bad TV? | work = Time | date = November 23, 1970 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943327,00.html?iid=digg_share | accessdate = October 17, 2019}}</ref> Psychologist [[Leon Eisenberg]] saw ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s urban setting as "superficial" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.<ref>Morrow, p. 98</ref> Head Start director [[Edward Zigler]] was probably ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s most vocal critic in the show's early years.<ref>Morrow, p. 147</ref>

In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s depiction of Latinos and women.<ref>Morrow, pp. 157–158</ref> The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that "the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words".<ref>Morrow, p. 155</ref> As ''The New York Times'' has stated, creating strong female characters "that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes" has been a challenge for the producers of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Gikow, p. 142</ref> According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on ''Sesame Street'' occurred slowly.<ref>Morrow, p. 156</ref> As more female Muppet performers like [[Camille Bonora]], [[Fran Brill]], [[Pam Arciero]], [[Carmen Osbahr]], [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]], [[Jennifer Barnhart]], and [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] were hired and trained, stronger female characters like [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] and [[Abby Cadabby]] were created.<ref>Gikow, p. 143</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Olivera |first1=Monica |title=Carmen Osbahr, the talented puppeteer behind Sesame Street’s "Rosita" |url=http://nbclatino.com/2013/09/20/sesame-streets-rosita-latina-puppeteer-makes-a-difference/ |accessdate=October 17, 2019 |work=NBC Universal |date=September 20, 2013}}</ref>
