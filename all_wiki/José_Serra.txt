Serra interrupted his studies in engineering at age 22 and left the country in 1964, after the coup that established the military government in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jose Serra|title=Cinquenta anos esta noite: O golpe, a Ditadura e o exílio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oS0mBAAAQBAJ|date=30 July 2014|publisher=Editora Record|isbn=978-85-01-05494-4}}</ref> Serra came to the attention of the authorities having served as President of the [[União Nacional dos Estudantes]] (UNE), (National Student Union) which opposed the existing conservative regime while he was a 4th year engineering student at the Polytechnic School at the [[University of São Paulo]].

José Serra was in exile from 1964 to 1978 in Bolivia, France, Chile, and the United States. In Chile, he did his masters in Economics and taught Economics at the University of Chile (Universidad de Chile). There he also married Monica Allende (1967), then a top ballerina at the National Ballet of Chile. They had two children, Veronica (1969) and Luciano (1973). In the United States José Serra was awarded a Masters and Ph.D. in economics at [[Cornell University]] ([[Ithaca, NY]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Cornell Masters’ Thesis for José Serra?|url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/askalib/2010/03/22/cornell-masters-thesis-for-jose-serra/|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref> and later spent 2 years at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, NJ]].

On returning to Brazil after the political amnesty in 1978, Serra lectured in economics at the [[University of Campinas]], did research for Cebrap, and wrote for the newspaper [[Folha de S. Paulo]].

==Political career==
In 1982 he was appointed São Paulo's State Secretary for Economics and Planning under [[André Franco Montoro|Franco Montoro]]'s governorship, and became an influential secretary of Montoro's government. In 1986 and 1990 he was elected and then reelected to Congress. In 1994 he was elected Senator for the State of São Paulo with more than 6.5 million votes.

His first bid for the mayorship of the City of São Paulo came in 1988 in an election won for the [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] (PT) by [[Luiza Erundina]]. He ran again in 1996, resigning as Minister of Planning to participate in the election for mayor, which was won by [[Celso Pitta]]. Pitta was the designated successor of mayor [[Paulo Maluf]], who headed the right-wing populist [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|Progressive Party]] (PP). After another stint as minister in the federal government, Serra ran for president on behalf of the PSDB party in 2002. He was beaten by four-time candidate and PT founder [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in the second round.

In every elections since 1988 Serra represented the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), which he helped found in 1988 alongside former and future São Paulo State governors Franco Montoro and Mario Covas and future Brazilian president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], from a split in the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB). PSDB was seen as a coalition of democrats, liberals and social democrats with more centrist outlook than the leftist [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) of presidents Lula da Silva and [[Dilma Rousseff]]. Both parties have great support in São Paulo state, but the state has been governed by the PSDB since 1994.

Serra came to political prominence under [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s presidency (1994–2002), when he was appointed minister of planning, and later minister of health. During Serra's tenure in the Health Ministry, the [[generic drug]] industry, which gave wider access to medicines to a poor population, and ANVISA, the Brazilian food and drug regulatory agency, were both created. All forms of tobacco advertising were banned, and cigarette packages were required to display images of smoking-related diseases.

=== Mayor of São Paulo ===

Serra was elected mayor of São Paulo in 2004, defeating incumbent [[Marta Suplicy]] in the second round. Serra created the [[Virada Cultural]], a 24-hour cultural festival inspired by the French [[Nuit Blanche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/trabalhandoporvoce/cultura-virada |title=Virada Cultural Paulista: diversão para todo o Estado |publisher=Government of the State of São Paulo |language=Portuguese |accessdate=9 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429093355/http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/trabalhandoporvoce/cultura-virada |archivedate=April 29, 2010 }}</ref> He also established the [[Bilhete Único]] system in the [[São Paulo Metro]] subway system.

Serra sought nomination as the PSDB candidate for president in the [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006 elections]], but on March 14, 2006 decided to run instead for governor of the state of São Paulo. He resigned as mayor of São Paulo, although he had signed a pledge to finish his four-year term.<ref>

==Role in Brazilian politics today==
Serra was the presidential candidate of the incumbent [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) party in [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002]], an election he lost to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] (Lula). In 2004, he was elected mayor of São Paulo in a run-off election with 55% of the votes after he signed a public commitment to stay in office for the full term. Nevertheless, he resigned after 15 months to run for governor of São Paulo in [[2006 São Paulo State election|2006]], and was elected in the first round with almost 60% of the vote.

[[File:Serradiscursando2010.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Serra during the annual meeting of PSDB, in which he announced his pre-candidacy, 10 April 2010.]]

Serra announced another run for the Brazilian presidency as the PSDB candidate in the [[2010 Brazilian general election|2010 elections]]. He received support from his party, as well as the [[Socialist People's Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] (PPS) and the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM). His primary opposition in the election was [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) candidate [[Dilma Rousseff]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8614138.stm |title=Jose Serra launches bid to be Brazil's next president |accessdate=2010-04-13 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2010-04-11 }}</ref> Serra's candidacy received support from ''[[O Estado de S.

On February 2012, Serra announced he would run for mayor of São Paulo, which would have resulted in his second non-consecutive term, though he had left the first one before it ended.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Twitter, Serra anuncia que disputará candidatura à Prefeitura de SP|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/nacional,no-twitter-serra-anuncia-que-disputara-candidatura-a-prefeitura-de-sp,841065,0.htm|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=[[O Estado de S.
