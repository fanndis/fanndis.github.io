Retrieved November 20, 2006.</ref> and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] in 1972, completing a senior thesis titled "An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court" under the supervision of [[Walter F. Murphy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/dsp01cz30pt46d|title=An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court|first=Samuel|last=Alito|via=catalog.princeton.edu}}</ref> Alito then attended [[Yale Law School]], where he served as an editor on the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1975.

At Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called "The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society" which, among other things, supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|a statute]] and [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|a court]] to oversee national security surveillance.<ref>[http://epic.org/privacy/justices/alito/report110205.pdf Report of the Chairman − Samuel Alito], Conference on the Boundaries of Privacy in American Society, Woodrow Wilson Sch. of Pub. & Int'l Affairs, Princeton Univ. at 5 (January 4, 1972).</ref> The conference report itself also called for the [[decriminalization]] of [[sodomy]], and urged for an end to discrimination against [[homosexuality|gays]] in hiring by employers.

While a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number, 32, in the [[Selective Service]] drawing on December 1, 1969.<ref name="reserves">The washington Post(November 3, 2005) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/02/AR2005110202722.html "Alito Joined ROTC While at Princeton"].</ref> In 1970, he became a member of the school's [[United States Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] program, attending a six-week basic training camp that year at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]. Alito was a member of the [[Concerned Alumni of Princeton]], which was formed in October 1972 at least in part to oppose Princeton's decisions regarding admitting women. Apart from Alito's written 1985 statement of membership of CAP on a job application, which he says was truthful, there is no other documentation of Alito's involvement with or contributions to the group. Alito has cited the banning and subsequent treatment of [[ROTC]] by the university as his reason for belonging to CAP.

At Princeton, Alito was "almost alone" in his familiarity with the writings of [[John Marshall Harlan II]]<ref name="princeton">Bernstein, Mark F. (2006).[http://www.princeton.edu/paw/archive_new/PAW05-06/09-0308/features_alito.html "A Tiger on the Court: Sam Alito ’72 at Princeton,"] ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'', March 8.

As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name="supreme conflict"/>

===Notable opinions===
;Abortion 
* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.

;Federalism
* A dissenting opinion in ''[[United States v. Rybar]]'', 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning [[submachine gun]]s was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and thus outside the authority of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].
* A majority opinion in ''[[Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development]]'', 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] against the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. States are free to maintain [[sovereign immunity]] under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.

;First Amendment
* A majority opinion in ''[[Saxe v. State College Area School District]]'', 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]] guarantees of [[free speech]].
* A majority opinion in ''[[ACLU v. Schundler]]'', 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.
* A dissenting opinion in ''[[C. H. v. Oliva et al.]]'' (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in "a less conspicuous spot" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.

;Fourth and Eighth Amendments
*A dissenting opinion in ''[[Doe v. Groody]]'', arguing that [[qualified immunity]] should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they [[strip-search]]ed a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a [[search warrant]] that authorized the search of a residence.
*A unanimous opinion in ''Chadwick v. Janecka'' (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was "no federal constitutional bar" to the "indefinite confinement" of a [[H. Beatty Chadwick|man imprisoned]] for [[contempt of court|civil contempt]] because he would not pay his $2.5&nbsp;million debt to his wife.

;Civil rights
*A majority opinion in ''[[Williams v. Price]]'', 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of [[habeas corpus]] to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.<ref>http://vls.law.villanova.edu/locator/3d/Sept2003/002305p.pdf</ref>
* A dissenting opinion in ''Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company'', 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.

{{Main|Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination}}
On July 1, 2005, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] announced her retirement from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated [[John G. Roberts]] to the vacancy, but when [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.

On October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.<ref>New York Times (October 31, 2005)  [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31cnd-court.html "Bush Picks Appeals Court Judge to Succeed O'Connor on Court"]</ref> Alito was unanimously rated "well qualified" to fill the Associate Justice post by the [[American Bar Association]]'s Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of Stephen L.

Alito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge [[Maryanne Trump Barry]] and Chief Judge [[Anthony J.

He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw [[LGBT employment discrimination in the United States]] if it wished, and told Senator [[Joe Biden]] (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the [[unitary executive theory]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Few Glimmers of How Conservative Judge Alito Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/politics/politicsspecial1/few-glimmers-of-how-conservative-judge-alito-is.html|access-date=2 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006|page=A1}}</ref>

On January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of [[Clarence Thomas]] or [[Robert Bork]]. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' if that decision were to be challenged.

Democrats on the committee grilled Alito on his past association with the conservative group [[Concerned Alumni of Princeton]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181385,00.html | publisher=Fox News Channel | title=Dems Slam Alito's Alumni Group | date=January 12, 2006 | access-date=July 17, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904115121/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181385,00.html | archive-date=September 4, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: "You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out...

==U.S. Supreme Court career==
{{expand section|date=June 2020}}

===Review of cases as Associate Justice===

Because Alito joined the court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases&nbsp; – ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'', ''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'', and ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]''&nbsp; – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.

Alito delivered his first written opinion on May 1, 2006, in ''[[Holmes v. South Carolina]]'', a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. (Since the beginning of the [[Rehnquist Court]], new justices have been given unanimous opinions to write as their first opinion, often done as a courtesy "breaking in" of new justices, so that every justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt). Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in ''[[Zedner v. United States]]'', ''[[Woodford v. Ngo]]'', and ''[[Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy]]''.

[[File:Alitoswornin.JPG|left|thumb|Alito ceremonially sworn in by [[Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.]]

In his first term, Alito voted fairly conservatively. For example, in the three reargued cases (''Garcetti v. Ceballos'', ''Hudson v. Michigan'' and ''Kansas v. Marsh''), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices&nbsp;– [[John G. Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]]. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on ''[[Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/04-10566.pdf |title=Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 04-10566 |access-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> and ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]''. Alito also dissented in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.

Alito is considered "one of the most [[American conservatism|conservative]] justices on the Court".<ref name=Granick/> But while his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the most conservative Justices on the Court. On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the [[stay of execution]] issued by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] for death-row inmate [[Michael Taylor (prisoner)|Michael Taylor]]; Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay. Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.<ref>CNN (February 2, 2006)[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/01/alito/index.html "Justice Alito casts his first vote"]</ref> Alito has also dissented from the Supreme Court's conservative justices on notable free speech cases, one of which, ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]]'', had to do with [[Westboro Baptist Church]] members' right to protest a military funeral.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-snyder-v-phelps|title=Facts and Case Summary - Snyder v. Phelps|publisher=}}</ref> Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters "were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/samuel-alito/?start=3350&end=4117|title=Samuel Alito on Conversations with Bill Kristol|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on [[partial birth abortion]] was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in ''Roe'') and O'Connor (a supporter of ''Roe'') respectively. Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy, writing for the court, did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not they were valid.

Alito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ginsburg, Souter, Breyer, and Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.

Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed "Scalito," Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case cited above and various other cases of the 2005 term. A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation, Scalia was the only member of the Court in ''[[Zedner v. United States]]'' not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and [[campaign finance reform]] (''[[LULAC v. Perry]]'' and ''[[Randall v. Sorrell]]''), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court. According to a scotusblog.com analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions (in which both participated), and concurred in full in 75%.<ref>[http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/June28VotingStats.pdf SCOTUS Blog]  (By scotusblog.com's reckoning, this is less agreement than between Scalia and Kennedy, O'Connor and Souter, or Stevens and Ginsburg.) On the recent abortion ruling, Alito simply joined Anthony Kennedy's opinion rather than join Scalia in Thomas's stronger assertion.</ref>

In the 2007 landmark free speech case ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the [[medical marijuana]] debate.

Alito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case ''[[Gomez-Perez v. Potter]]'' cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court, inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.

In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by [[Clarence Thomas]] to ''[[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia]]'', arguing that Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] does not prohibit discrimination by [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/502729-supreme-court-rules-lgbt-workers-protected-by-civil-rights-law|title=Workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender, Supreme Court rules|first=Harper|last=Neidig|date=June 15, 2020|access-date=June 17, 2020|work = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1= Gerstein|first1= Josh |last2= Rainey|first2= Rebecca |date= June 15, 2020 |title = Supreme Court finds federal law bars LGBT discrimination in workplace |url = https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/15/supreme-court-lgbt-rights-decision-319693|work = [[Politico]]|access-date= June 17, 2020 }}</ref> In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices to deny an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but joined Thomas in writing a separate opinion reiterating his dissent in ''[[Obergefell v.

On November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]]. Speaking to the [[Federalist Society]], Alito bemoaned what he called the "loss of individual liberties", saying, "We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020", and calling the pandemic "a Constitutional stress test".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=Robert |title=Justice Alito says pandemic has resulted in 'unimaginable' restrictions on individual liberty |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/12/samuel-alito-federalist-society-speech/ |website=WashingtonPost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref>
