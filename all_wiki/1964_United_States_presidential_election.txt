The '''1964 United States presidential election''' was the 45th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964. Incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] defeated [[Barry Goldwater]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee. With 61.1% of the popular vote, Johnson won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|largest share]] of the popular vote of any candidate since the largely uncontested [[1820 United States presidential election|1820 election]].

Johnson [[First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|took]] office on November 22, 1963, following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of his predecessor]], [[John F. Kennedy]]. He easily defeated a [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1964|primary challenge]] by [[racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] [[List of governors of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]] to win the nomination to a full term. At the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]], Johnson also won the nomination of his preferred running mate, [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]]. [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]], a leader of his party's [[conservativism in the United States|conservative]] faction, defeated [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate]] [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[List of governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[William Scranton]] of [[Pennsylvania]] at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]].

Johnson championed his passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], also advocating a series of anti-poverty programs collectively known as the [[Great Society]]. Goldwater espoused a low-tax, small-government philosophy. Although he supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the [[24th Amendment]] outlawing the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as he felt that Title II violated individual liberty and [[states' rights]]. Democrats successfully portrayed Goldwater as a dangerous extremist, most famously in the "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]" [[Campaign advertising|television advertisement]]. The Republican Party was divided between its moderate and conservative factions, with Rockefeller and other moderate party leaders refusing to campaign for Goldwater. Johnson led by wide margins in all [[Historical polling for United States presidential elections|opinion polls conducted during the campaign]], although his lead continued to dwindle throughout.

Johnson carried 44 states and the [[District of Columbia]], which [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|voted for the first time]] in this election. Goldwater won his home state and swept the states of the [[Deep South]], most of which had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in 1877. This was the last time that the Democratic Party won the white vote, although they came close in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]. Johnson's landslide victory coincided with the [[United States elections, 1964|defeat]] of many conservative Republican Congressmen. The subsequent [[89th United States Congress|89th Congress]] would pass major legislation such as the [[Social Security Amendments of 1965]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]]. Goldwater's unsuccessful bid significantly influenced the [[Conservatism in the United States|modern conservative movement]]. The long-term realignment of conservatives to the Republican Party continued, culminating in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential victory]] of [[Ronald Reagan]].

While on the first campaign stop of his re-election campaign in 1964, [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on November 22, 1963 in [[Dallas, Texas]].

The only candidate other than President Johnson to actively campaign was then [[List of governors of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[George Wallace]] who ran in a number of northern primaries, though his candidacy was more to promote the philosophy of [[states' rights]] among a northern audience; while expecting some support from delegations in the South, Wallace was certain that he was not in contention for the Democratic nomination.<ref name=tetl>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/11/97156981.html?pageNumber=11|title=Jan 11, 1964: WALLACE CONSIDERS PRIMARIES IN NORTH|newspaper = New York Times|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> Johnson received 1,106,999 votes in the primaries.

At the national convention the integrated [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) claimed the seats for delegates for Mississippi, not on the grounds of Party rules, but because the official Mississippi delegation had been elected by a [[White primaries|white primary]] system. The national party's liberal leaders supported an even division of the seats between the two Mississippi delegations; Johnson was concerned that, while the regular Democrats of Mississippi would probably vote for Goldwater anyway, rejecting them would lose him the South. Eventually, [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and the black civil rights leaders including [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Bayard Rustin]] worked out a compromise: the MFDP took two seats; the regular Mississippi delegation was required to pledge to support the party ticket; and no future Democratic convention would accept a delegation chosen by a discriminatory poll. [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]], the MFDP's lawyer, initially refused this deal, but they eventually took their seats. Many white delegates from Mississippi and Alabama refused to sign any pledge, and left the convention; and many young civil rights workers were offended by any compromise.<ref>Unger and Unger; ''LBJ; a Life'' (1999) pp. 325–26; Dallek ''Flawed Giant'', p. 164</ref> Johnson biographers Rowland Evans and Robert Novak claim that the MFDP fell under the influence of "black radicals" and rejected their seats.<ref>Evans and Novak (1966) pp. 451–56</ref> Johnson lost [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]].

Johnson also faced trouble from [[Robert F. Kennedy]], President Kennedy's younger brother and the U.S. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Kennedy and Johnson's relationship was troubled from the time Robert Kennedy was a Senate staffer.  Then-Majority Leader Johnson surmised that Kennedy's hostility was the direct result of the fact that Johnson frequently recounted a story that embarrassed Kennedy's father, [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], the ambassador to the United Kingdom.  According to his recounting, Johnson and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] misled the ambassador, upon a return visit to the United States, to believe that Roosevelt wished to meet in Washington for friendly purposes; in fact Roosevelt planned to—and did—fire the ambassador, due to the ambassador's well publicized views.<ref>[[Robert A. Caro]]; "[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power]]" (2012), ch. 3 ("It's about Roosevelt and his father", Johnson said)</ref>  The Johnson–Kennedy hostility was rendered mutual in the 1960 primaries and the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], when Robert Kennedy had tried to prevent Johnson from becoming his brother's running mate, a move that deeply embittered both men.

In early 1964, despite his personal animosity for the president, Kennedy had tried to force Johnson to accept him as his running mate. Johnson eliminated this threat by announcing that none of his cabinet members would be considered for second place on the Democratic ticket. Johnson also became concerned that Kennedy might use his scheduled speech at the 1964 Democratic Convention to create a groundswell of emotion among the delegates to make him Johnson's running mate; he prevented this by deliberately scheduling Kennedy's speech on the last day of the convention, after his running mate had already been chosen. Shortly after the 1964 Democratic Convention, Kennedy decided to leave Johnson's cabinet and run for the U.S. Senate in [[New York (state)|New York]]; he won the general election in November. Johnson chose [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] from [[Minnesota]], a liberal and civil rights activist, as his running mate.

Technically in South Dakota and Florida, Goldwater finished in second to "Unpledged Delegates," but he finished before all other candidates.]]
The Republican Party (GOP) was badly divided in 1964 between its [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and moderate-[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] factions. Former Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]], who had been beaten by Kennedy in the extremely close 1960 presidential election, decided not to run. Nixon, a moderate with ties to both wings of the GOP, had been able to unite the factions in 1960; in his absence the way was clear for the two factions to engage in an all-out political civil war for the nomination. Barry Goldwater, a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Arizona]], was the champion of the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]. The conservatives had historically been based in the American [[Midwest]], but beginning in the 1950s they had been gaining in power in the South and West. The conservatives favored a low-tax, small federal government which supported individual rights and business interests and opposed [[social welfare]] programs. The conservatives also resented the dominance of the GOP's [[moderate]] wing, which was based in the [[Northeastern United States]]. Since 1940, the Eastern moderates had defeated conservative presidential candidates at the GOP's national conventions. The conservatives believed the Eastern moderates were little different from liberal Democrats in their philosophy and approach to government. Goldwater's chief opponent for the Republican nomination was [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the [[Governor of New York]] and the longtime leader of the GOP's liberal-moderate faction.

Initially, Rockefeller was considered the front-runner, ahead of Goldwater. However, in 1963, two years after Rockefeller's divorce from his first wife, he married [[Happy Rockefeller|Margaretta "Happy" Murphy]], who was nearly 18 years younger than he and had just divorced her husband and surrendered her four children to his custody.<ref name="'70s 58">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/58 58–59]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/58|url-access= registration}}</ref> The fact that Murphy had suddenly divorced her husband before marrying Rockefeller led to rumors that Rockefeller had been having an extramarital affair with her. This angered many [[social conservatives]] and female voters within the GOP, many of whom called Rockefeller a "wife stealer".<ref name="'70s 58" /> After his remarriage, Rockefeller's lead among Republicans lost 20 points overnight.<ref name="'70s 58" /> Senator [[Prescott Bush]] of [[Connecticut]], the father of President [[George H.W. Bush]] and grandfather of President [[George W. Bush]], was among Rockefeller's critics on this issue: "Have we come to the point in our life as a nation where the governor of a great state—one who perhaps aspires to the nomination for president of the United States—can desert a good wife, mother of his grown children, divorce her, then persuade a young mother of four youngsters to abandon her husband and their four children and marry the governor?"<ref name="'70s 58" />

In the first primary, in New Hampshire, both Rockefeller and Goldwater were considered to be the favorites, but the voters instead gave a surprising victory to the U.S. [[ambassador]] to [[South Vietnam]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], Nixon's running mate in [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]] and a former [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|senator]]. Lodge was a [[write-in]] candidate. He went on to win the [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Jersey]] primaries before withdrawing his candidacy because he had finally decided he didn't want the Republican nomination.<ref>Johnson, Robert David; ''All the Way with LBJ''; p. 111 {{ISBN|9780521425957}}</ref>

Despite his defeat in New Hampshire, Goldwater pressed on, winning the [[Illinois]], [[Texas]], and [[Indiana]] primaries with little opposition, and [[Nebraska]]'s primary after a stiff challenge from a [[Draft (politics)|draft]]-Nixon movement. Goldwater also won a number of state [[caucuses]] and gathered even more delegates. Meanwhile, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] won the [[West Virginia]] and [[Oregon]] primaries against Goldwater, and [[William Scranton]] won in his home state of [[Pennsylvania]]. Both Rockefeller and Scranton also won several state [[caucuses]], mostly in the Northeast.

The final showdown between Goldwater and Rockefeller was in the [[California]] primary. In spite of the previous accusations regarding his marriage, Rockefeller led Goldwater in most opinion polls in California, and he appeared headed for victory when his new wife gave birth to a son, Nelson Rockefeller Jr., three days before the primary.<ref name="'70s 58" /> His son's birth brought the issue of [[adultery]] front and center, and Rockefeller suddenly lost ground in the polls.<ref name="'70s 58" /> Goldwater won the primary by a narrow 51–49% margin, thus eliminating Rockefeller as a serious contender and all but clinching the nomination. With Rockefeller's elimination, the party's moderates and liberals turned to [[William Scranton]], the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], in the hopes that he could stop Goldwater. However, as the Republican Convention began Goldwater was seen as the heavy favorite to win the nomination.

==== Convention ====
The [[1964 Republican National Convention]] at [[Daly City, California]]'s [[Cow Palace]] arena was one of the most bitter on record, as the party's moderates and conservatives openly expressed their contempt for each other. Rockefeller was loudly booed when he came to the podium for his speech; in his speech he roundly criticized the party's conservatives, which led many conservatives in the galleries to yell and scream at him. A group of moderates tried to rally behind Scranton to stop Goldwater, but Goldwater's forces easily brushed his challenge aside, and Goldwater was nominated on the first ballot. The presidential tally was as follows:

*[[Barry Goldwater]] 883
*[[William Scranton]] 214
*[[Nelson Rockefeller]] 114
*[[George W. Romney|George Romney]] 41
*[[Margaret Chase Smith]] 27
*[[Walter Judd (politician)|Walter Judd]] 22
*[[Hiram Fong]] 5
*[[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] 2

The vice-presidential nomination went to little-known Republican Party Chairman [[William E. Miller]], a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]. Goldwater stated that he chose Miller simply because "he drives [President] Johnson nuts". This would be the only Republican ticket between 1948 and 1976 that did not include Nixon.

In accepting his nomination, Goldwater uttered his most famous phrase (a quote from [[Cicero]] suggested by speechwriter [[Harry Jaffa]]): "I would remind you that [[extremism]] in the defense of [[liberty]] is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of [[justice]] is no virtue." For many GOP moderates, Goldwater's speech was seen as a deliberate insult, and many of these moderates would defect to the Democrats in the fall election.

[[File:Civilrightsact1964.jpg|thumb|250px|right|First page of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]]]Although Goldwater had been successful in rallying conservatives, he was unable to broaden his base of support for the [[general election]]. Shortly before the Republican Convention, he had alienated moderate Republicans by his vote against the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 – CRA – Title VII – Equal Employment Opportunities – 42 US Code Chapter 21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125033337/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archive-date=January 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which Johnson championed and signed into law.  Goldwater said that he considered [[desegregation]] a states' rights issue, rather than a national policy, and believed the 1964 act to be unconstitutional.  Goldwater's vote against the legislation helped cause African-Americans to overwhelmingly support Johnson.<ref name="wapoobit">{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Bart |date=May 30, 1998 |title=Barry Goldwater, GOP Hero, Dies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=November 6, 2016 }}</ref>  Goldwater had previously voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960 Civil Rights acts]], but only after proposing "restrictive amendments" to them.<ref name="wapoobit"/>  Goldwater was famous for speaking "off-the-cuff" at times, and many of his former statements were given wide publicity by the Democrats. In the early 1960s, Goldwater had called the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration "a [[five and dime|dime store]] [[New Deal]]", and the former president never fully forgave him or offered him his full support in the election.

In December 1961, he told a [[news conference]] that "sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] and let it float out to sea", a remark which indicated his dislike of the liberal economic and social policies that were often associated with that part of the nation. That comment came back to haunt him, in the form of a Johnson [[television commercial]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/eastern-seabord|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Eastern Seabord}}</ref> as did remarks about making [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] voluntary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/social-security|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Social Security}}</ref> and selling the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. In his most famous verbal gaffe, Goldwater once joked that the U.S. military should "lob one [a nuclear bomb] into the men's room of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]" in the [[Soviet Union]].

Goldwater was also hurt by the reluctance of many prominent moderate Republicans to support him. Governors [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York and [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] of Michigan refused to endorse Goldwater and did not campaign for him. On the other hand, former Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and Governor Scranton of Pennsylvania loyally supported the GOP ticket and campaigned for Goldwater, although Nixon did not entirely agree with Goldwater's political stances and said that it would "be a tragedy" if Goldwater's platform were not "challenged and repudiated" by the Republicans.<ref>[[Conrad Black|Black, Conrad]] (2007), p. 464.</ref> The ''[[New York Herald-Tribune]]'', a voice for eastern Republicans (and a target for Goldwater activists during the primaries), supported Johnson in the general election. Some moderates even formed a "Republicans for Johnson" organization, although most prominent GOP politicians avoided being associated with it.

Shortly before the Republican convention, [[CBS]] reporter [[Daniel Schorr]] wrote from [[Germany]] that "It looks as though Senator Goldwater, if nominated, will be starting his campaign here in [[Bavaria]], center of Germany's right wing." He noted that a prior Goldwater interview with the German magazine ''Der Spiegel'' was an "appeal to right-wing elements." However, there was no ulterior motive for the trip; it was just a vacation.<ref name="BeforeTheStorm">{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |date=2009 |title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DG3BE0C0VkAC&q=It+looks+as+though+Senator+Goldwater,+if+nominated,+will+be+starting+his+campaign+here+in+Bavaria,+center+of+Germany%E2%80%99s+right+wing&pg=PA375 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Nation Books |page=375 |isbn=978-1568584126 |author-link=Rick Perlstein}}</ref>

''[[Fact (U.S. magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine published an article polling psychiatrists around the country as to Goldwater's sanity. Some 1,189 psychiatrists appeared to agree that Goldwater was "emotionally unstable" and unfit for office, though none of the members had actually interviewed him. The article received heavy publicity and resulted in a change to the ethics guidelines of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. In a [[libel]] suit, a federal court awarded Goldwater $1 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30gillespie.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=goldwater%20psychiatrists%201964&st=cse |title=The Hard Right|author=Nick Gillespie | author-link = Nick Gillespie |date=July 30, 2006 |work= New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/health/essay-the-perils-of-putting-national-leaders-on-the-couch.html?scp=3&sq=goldwater%20psychiatrists%201964&st=cse |title=Essay; The Perils of Putting National Leaders on the Couch |author=Sally Satel| author-link = Sally Satel|date=June 30, 2004 |work= New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A11F8345415738DDDAC0894D1405B858AF1D3&scp=6&sq=goldwater%20psychiatrists%201964&st=cse|title=' 64 Poll of Psychiatrists On Goldwater Defended|date=September 5, 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/16/archives/expert-condemns-goldwater-poll-tells-libel-trial-magazine-survey.html?sq=goldwater%2520psychiatrists%25201964&scp=14&st=cse|title=EXPERT CONDEMNS GOLDWATER POLL – Tells Libel Trial Magazine Survey Was 'Loaded' – Article – NYTimes.com|date=May 16, 1968}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/25/archives/goldwater-awarded-75000-in-damages-in-his-suit-for-libel-goldwater.html?sq=goldwater%2520psychiatrists%25201964&scp=34&st=cse|title=Goldwater Awarded $75,000 in Damages In His Suit for Libel |page=1| newspaper=NYTimes.com|date=May 25, 1968}}</ref>

Eisenhower's strong backing could have been an asset to the Goldwater campaign, but instead, its absence was clearly noticed. When questioned about the presidential capabilities of the former president's younger brother, university administrator [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], in July 1964, Goldwater replied, "One Eisenhower in a generation is enough." However, Eisenhower did not openly repudiate Goldwater and made one television commercial for Goldwater's campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Ike at Gettysburg}}</ref> A prominent Hollywood [[celebrity]] who vigorously supported Goldwater was [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan gave a well-received televised speech supporting Goldwater; it was so popular that Goldwater's advisors had it played on local television stations around the nation. Many historians consider this speech—"[[A Time for Choosing]]"—to mark the beginning of Reagan's transformation from an actor to a political leader. In [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|1966]], Reagan would be elected [[Governor of California]] in a landslide.

===Ads and slogans===

Johnson positioned himself as a moderate and succeeded in portraying Goldwater as an extremist. Goldwater had a habit of making blunt statements about [[war]], [[nuclear weapons]], and [[economics]] that could be turned against him. Most famously, the Johnson campaign broadcast a television commercial on September 7 dubbed the [[Daisy (advertisement)|"Daisy Girl"]] ad, which featured a little girl picking petals from a daisy in a field, counting the petals, which then segues into a [[rocket launch|launch]] [[countdown]] and a nuclear explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Peace Little Girl (Daisy)}}</ref> The ads were in response to Goldwater's advocacy of "tactical" nuclear weapons use in [[Vietnam]].<ref>Farber, David; ''The Age of Great Dreams: America in the 1960s''; {{ISBN|1429931264}}</ref> "[[Confessions of a Republican]]", another Johnson ad, features a monologue from a man who tells viewers that he had previously voted for Eisenhower and Nixon, but now worries about the "men with strange ideas", "weird groups" and "the head of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]" who were supporting Goldwater; he concludes that "either they're not Republicans, or I'm not".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/confessions-of-a-republican|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Confessions of a Republican}}</ref> Voters increasingly viewed Goldwater as a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] fringe candidate. His slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" was successfully parodied by the Johnson campaign into "In your guts, you know he's nuts", or "In your heart, you know he might" (as in "he might push the [[nuclear button]]"), or even "In your heart, he's too far right".{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The Johnson campaign's greatest concern may have been voter complacency leading to low turnout in key states. To counter this, all of Johnson's [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] ads concluded with the line: "Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home." The Democratic campaign used two other slogans, "All the way with LBJ"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=0b075ae5-36a0-4a35-80e3-e237a8e01a19@pdc-v-sessmgr03|title=Login to eResources, The University of Sydney Library|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref> and "LBJ for the USA".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2012646840/|title=LBJ for the USA|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

The election campaign was disrupted for a week by the death of former president [[Herbert Hoover]] on October 20, 1964, because it was considered disrespectful to be campaigning during a time of mourning. Hoover died of natural causes. He had been U.S. president from 1929 to 1933. Both major candidates attended his funeral.<ref>Best, Gary Dean; ''Herbert Hoover, the Postpresidential Years, 1933–1964: 1946–1964''; pp. 415, 431–32 {{ISBN|0817977511}}</ref>

The election was held on November 3, 1964. Johnson beat Goldwater in the general election, winning over 61% of the popular vote, the highest percentage since the popular vote first became widespread in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]. In the end, Goldwater won only his native state of [[Arizona]] and five [[Deep South]] states—[[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]] and [[South Carolina]]—which had been increasingly alienated by Democratic civil rights policies. 

The five Southern states that voted for Goldwater swung over dramatically to support him. For instance, in Mississippi, where Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had won 97% of the popular vote in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], Goldwater won 87% of the vote.<ref>[[Steve Kornacki|Kornacki, Steve]] (February 3, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html The "Southern Strategy," fulfilled] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413151441/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html |date=April 13, 2011 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref>  Of these states, Louisiana had been the only state where a Republican had won even once since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina had not voted Republican in any presidential election since Reconstruction, whilst Georgia had never voted Republican even during Reconstruction (thus making Goldwater the first Republican to ever carry Georgia).

[[File:1964 Presidential Election, Results by Congressional District.png|thumb|right|250px|Results by congressional district.]]
The 1964 election was a major transition point for the South, and an important step in the process by which the Democrats' former "[[Solid South]]" became a Republican bastion. Nonetheless, Johnson still managed to eke out a bare popular majority of 51–49% (6.307 to 5.993 million) in the eleven former Confederate states. Conversely, Johnson was the first Democrat ever to carry the state of [[Vermont]] in a Presidential election, and only the second Democrat, after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the Republican Party was divided, to carry [[Maine]] in the twentieth century. Maine and Vermont had been the only states that FDR had failed to carry during any of his four successful presidential bids.

Of the 3,126 counties/districts/independent cities making returns, Johnson won in 2,275 (72.77%) while Goldwater carried 826 (26.42%). Unpledged Electors carried six counties in Alabama (0.19%).

The Johnson landslide defeated many conservative Republican congressmen, giving him a majority that could overcome the [[conservative coalition]].

This is the first election to have participation of the [[District of Columbia]] under the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment to the US Constitution]].

The Johnson campaign broke two American election records previously held by Franklin Roosevelt: the most number of Electoral College votes won by a major-party candidate running for the White House for the first time (with 486 to the 472 won by Roosevelt in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]) and the largest share of the popular vote under the current Democratic/Republican competition (Roosevelt won 60.8% nationwide, Johnson 61.1%). This first-time electoral count was exceeded when [[Ronald Reagan]] won 489 votes in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. Johnson retains the highest percentage of the popular vote as of the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].

== Consequences ==
Although Goldwater was decisively defeated, some political pundits and historians believe he laid the foundation for the conservative [[revolution]] to follow. Among them is [[Richard Perlstein]], historian of the American conservative movement, who wrote of Goldwater's defeat, "Here was one time, at least, when history was written by the losers."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Richard|title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus|publisher=Nation Books|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56858-412-6|location=New York|pages=x}}</ref>  [[Ronald Reagan]]'s speech on Goldwater's behalf, [[grassroots]] [[organization]], and the conservative takeover (although temporary in the 1960s) of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] would all help to bring about the "[[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Revolution]]" of the 1980s.

Johnson went from his victory in the 1964 election to launch the [[Great Society]] program at home, signing the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and starting the [[War on Poverty]]. He also escalated the [[Vietnam War]], which eroded his popularity. By 1968, Johnson's popularity had declined and the Democrats became so split over his candidacy that he withdrew as a candidate. Moreover, his support of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] for blacks helped split white union members{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and Southerners away from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt's]] Democratic [[New Deal Coalition]], which would later lead to the phenomenon of the "[[Reagan Democrat]]". Of the 13 presidential elections that followed up to 2016, Democrats would win only five times, although in 7 of those elections, a majority, the Democratic candidate received the highest number of popular votes.

The election also furthered the shift of the black voting electorate away from the Republican Party, a phenomenon which had begun with the [[New Deal]]. Since the 1964 election, Democratic presidential candidates have almost consistently won at least 80–90% of the black vote in each presidential election.
