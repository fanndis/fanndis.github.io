'''Koo Kwang-ming''' ({{zh|t=辜寬敏|p=Gū Kuānmǐn|poj=Ko͘ Khoan-bín}}; born on 15 October 1926) is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] statesman, businessman and [[Taiwanese independence|independence activist]].

==Family background==
Koo was born into a life of privilege. He was the eighth son of [[Koo Hsien-jung]], a prominent [[Lukang]] businessman who had relocated to [[Taipei]] at the time of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], when Taiwan was ceded by the [[Qing Dynasty]] to the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Yeh |first=Lindy |title=The Koo family: a century in Taiwan |work = Taipei Times |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/04/15/132003 |date = 15 Apr 2002 |page=3 }}</ref> He swiftly made common cause with the Japanese colonial authorities in Taiwan and grew extremely wealthy during the period of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. The family proved adept at bending with the political winds, and Koo's older brother [[Koo Chen-fu]] became a confidant of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Koo Kwang-ming, however, went into exile in Japan after the [[228 massacre]], where he lived for decades as an advocate for Taiwanese independence. His son born in Kobe, [[Richard Koo]], is a prominent economist in Japan.

==Political career==
Koo enrolled at what became [[National Taiwan University]] in 1941 to study political science. He became chair of the school's student association, and was actively opposed to the [[Kuomintang]]. He left Taiwan for Hong Kong soon after the [[228 incident]], and later settled in Japan.<ref name="lyeh">{{cite news |last1=Yeh |first1=Lindy |title=For Koo, the outsider's role is a natural one |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/02/28/2003224907/2 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=28 February 2005}}</ref> In 1972, Koo traveled in secret from Japan via Thailand to Taiwan. He met [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], son of ruler [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to argue for the lifting of martial law. As a consequence he was expelled from the Japanese chapter of [[WUFI]]. The younger Chiang invited Koo to end his exile to "share in the affairs of the country". Koo accepted, but on landing in Taiwan was upset to see his return described as "surrender" in an evening newspaper. He replied that he "had not returned to surrender, but to bring my influence to bear [on the situation]".<ref>「我不是回來投降，我是回來發揮影響力的」</ref> Influential independence activist [[Su Beng]] contradicted this assertion, accusing Koo of "surrendering to the Chiang government".<ref>Su, p. 1113</ref> Koo joined the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 1996, when fellow independence activist [[Peng Ming-min]] received its presidential nomination.<ref name="lyeh"/> Koo later served president [[Chen Shui-bian]] as an adviser, resigning his post and DPP membership in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Huang |first1=Tai-lin |title=Advisers to Chen resign over accord |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2005/03/02/2003225131 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=2 March 2005}}</ref>

===2008 DPP leadership bid===
After the DPP's comprehensive defeat in the 2008 presidential elections, a leadership election was held to find the new party chairperson. Koo, then 82 years old, stood as a candidate. The campaign was notable for controversial remarks made by Koo about the suitability of an unmarried woman to lead,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/05/08/2003411329 |work=Taipei Times |title=Koo apologizes for offensive remarks |author=Ko Shu-ling |date=2008-05-08}}</ref> widely interpreted as an attack on the eventual winner, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], who became the first elected female head of the party.
