The March 2020 independent ''Windrush Lessons Learned Review''<ref name="Patel" /><ref name="Williams-1" /> conducted by the [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services|inspector of constabulary]] concluded that Theresa May's Home Office showed an inexcusable "ignorance and thoughtlessness", and that what had happened had been "foreseeable and avoidable". It further found that immigration regulations were tightened "with complete disregard for the Windrush generation", and that officials had made "irrational" demands for multiple documents to establish residency rights.<ref name="Review-review" />

== Background==
[[File:HMT Empire Windrush FL9448.jpg|alt=HMT Empire Windrush|thumb|[[HMT Empire Windrush|HMT ''Empire Windrush'']] after which the [[Windrush generation]] is named.]]
The [[British Nationality Act 1948]] gave [[British subject#1949 to 1982|citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] status and the right of settlement in the UK to everyone who was at that time a British subject by virtue of having been born in a [[British colony]].<ref name="Archives">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/citizenship4.htm National Archives]. Citizenship 1906–2003. Retrieved 6 November 2006</ref> The act and encouragement from British government campaigns in [[Caribbean]] countries led to a wave of immigration. Between 1948 and 1970, nearly half a million people moved from the Caribbean to Britain, which in 1948 faced severe labour shortages in the wake of the [[Second World War]]. The immigrants were later referred to as "the [[Windrush generation]]".<ref name="MirrorWhatis" /> Working age adults and many children travelled from the Caribbean to join parents or grandparents in the UK or travelled with their parents without their own passports.<ref name="BeebMPsvote" />

Since these people had a legal right to come to the UK, they neither needed nor were given any documents upon entry to the UK, nor following changes in immigration laws in the early 1970s.<ref name="BBCMayapologises" /> Many worked or attended schools in the UK without any official documentary record of their having done so, other than the same records as any UK-born citizen.<ref name="Nokes">{{cite web|url=https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2018/04/15/immigration-minister-op-ed-in-the-voice/|title=Immigration Minister: Immigration status of the Windrush generation|last=Nokes|first=Caroline|quote=Having not previously needed documentation they have now found themselves without any way of proving their status today.”|date=15 April 2018|work=originally published in [[The Voice (British newspaper)|The Voice]]|publisher=Home Office|access-date=27 June 2018}}</ref>

Many of the countries from which the immigrants had come became independent of the UK after 1948, and people living there became citizens of those countries. [[British Nationality Act 1948#Reform of the Act, and subsequent Acts|Legislative measures]] in the 60s and early 70s limited the rights of citizens of these former colonies, now members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], to come to or work in the UK. Anyone who had arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 was granted an automatic right permanently to remain, unless they left the UK for more than two years.<ref name="MirrorWhatis" /><ref name="BBCMayapologises" /> Since the right was automatic, many people in this category were never given, or asked to provide, documentary evidence of their right to remain at the time or over the next forty years, during which, many continued to live and work in the UK, believing themselves to be British.<ref name="MirrorWhatis" /><ref name="Nokes" />

The [[Immigration and Asylum Act 1999]] specifically protected long-standing residents of the UK from Commonwealth countries from enforced removal. This provision was not transferred to [[Immigration Act 2014|2014 immigration legislation]] because Commonwealth citizens living in the UK before 1 January 1973 were "adequately protected from removal", according to a [[Home Office]] spokesperson.<ref name="GdnRemovedprot">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/immigration-law-key-clause-protecting-windrush-immigrants-removed-in-2014|title=UK removed legal protection for Windrush immigrants in 2014|last=Taylor|first=Diane|quote=The government did not announce the removal of this clause, nor did it consult on the potential ramifications.|date=16 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref>

In June 2020, Britain's [[human rights]] watchdog, the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) launched a legal action to review the "hostile environment" immigration policy and to assess whether the Home Office had complied with its equality duties (as outlined in the [[Equality Act 2010]]). The EHRC planned to develop recommendations by September 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/windrush-human-rights-watchdog-reviewing-uks-hostile-environment-policy-12005085|title=Windrush: Human rights watchdog reviewing UK's 'hostile environment' policy|access-date=12 June 2020|website=Sky News}}</ref> In November 2020, the EHRC said that the Home Office had broken  the law by failing to obey public-sector equality duties by not considering how its policies affected black members of the Windrush generation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gentleman |first1=Amelia |title=Home Office broke equalities law with hostile environment measures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/25/home-office-broke-equalities-law-with-hostile-environment-measures |access-date=26 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=25 November 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Initial warnings==
The Home Office received warnings from 2013 onwards that many Windrush generation residents were being treated as illegal immigrants and that older Caribbean born people were being targeted. The Refugee and Migrant Centre in [[Wolverhampton]] said their caseworkers were seeing hundreds of people receiving letters from [[Capita]], the Home Office's contractor, telling them that they had no right to be in the UK, some of whom were told to arrange to leave the UK at once. Roughly half the letters went to people who already had leave to remain or were in the process of formalising their immigration status. Caseworkers had warned the Home Office directly and also through local [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|MP]]s of these cases since 2013. People considered illegal were sometimes losing their jobs or homes as a consequence of having benefits cut off and some had been refused medical care under the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), some placed in [[Immigration detention|detention centres]] as preparation for their deportation, some deported or refused right to return to the UK from abroad.<ref name="YoungeDesign" /><ref name="GdnLefttodie">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/denied-free-nhs-cancer-care-left-die-home-office-commonwealth|title=Londoner denied NHS cancer care: 'It's like I'm being left to die'|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=Official suspicion about his immigration status led to him being evicted last summer, and he was homeless for three weeks.

===Home Affairs Select Committee report===
In January 2018, the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] issued a report which said the hostile environment policies were "unclear" and had seen too many people threatened with deportation based on "inaccurate and untested" information. The report warned that the errors being made, in one instance 10 per cent, threatened to undermine the "credibility of the system". A major concern voiced in the report was that the Home Office did not have means to evaluate the effectiveness of its hostile environment provisions and commented that there had been a "failure" to understand the effects of the policy. The report also noted that a shortage of accurate data about the scale of illegal immigration had allowed public anxiety about the issue to "grow unchecked", which, the report said, showed government "indifference" towards an issue of "high public interest".<ref name="IndyHASCreport" />

A month before the report was published, more than 60 MPs, academics and campaign groups wrote an open letter to Amber Rudd urging the Government to halt the "inhumane" policy, citing the Home Office's "poor track record" of dealing with complaints and appeals in a timely manner.<ref name="IndyHASCreport">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-s-hostile-environment-policy-too-open-to-error-and-risks-undermining-credibility-of-a8158656.html|title=Britain's immigration system 'too open to error', MPs warn|last=Bulman|first=May|quote=Government measures of reducing illegal immigration undermine credibility in the system due to high instances of inaccuracies and error, an influential group of MPs has warned.|date=15 January 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref>

The press coverage accused Home Office agencies of operating a "guilty until proven innocent" and "deport first, appeal later" regime; of targeting the weakest groups, particularly those from the Caribbean; of inhumanely applying regulations by cutting off access to jobs, services and bank accounts while cases were still being investigated; of losing large numbers of original documents which proved right to remain; of making unreasonable demands for documentary proof – in some instances, elderly people had been asked for 4 documents for each year they had lived in the UK and of leaving people stranded outside the UK because of British administrative errors or intransigence and denial of medical treatment.<ref name="GdnInhumane" /><ref name="YoungeDesign" /><ref name="IndyHASCreport" /><ref name="GdnMorecompass">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/caribbean-diplomats-ask-uk-for-more-compassion-for-citizens|title=Caribbean diplomats ask UK for more compassion for citizens|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=In this system one is guilty before proven innocent rather than the other way around.|date=22 February 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="YoungeTarget">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/theresa-may-windrush-equality|title=With Windrush, Theresa May mistook a national treasure for an easy target|last=Younge|first=Gary|date=20 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="GdnAntigua">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/30/antiguan-who-has-lived-59-years-in-britain-told-he-is-in-uk-illegally|title=Man who moved from Antigua 59 years ago told he is in UK illegally|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=[[Kate Osamor]] said she wanted the Home Office to explain why a large group of black Caribbean men and women who have been here since the 1960s were being targeted by immigration officials.|date=30 March 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="GdnDisgusted">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/how-windrush-scandal-shattered-two-brothers-lives-trevor-desmond-johnson|title='I feel disgusted': how Windrush scandal shattered two brothers' lives|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|date=22 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="GdnMayIntervene">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/theresa-may-refuses-to-intervene-over-mans-54000-nhs-cancer-bill-albert-thompson|title=Theresa May refuses to intervene over man's £54,000 NHS cancer bill|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|date=22 March 2018|quote=Thompson, 63, is not receiving the radiotherapy treatment he needs for prostate cancer because he has been unable to provide officials with sufficient documentary evidence showing that he has lived in the UK continuously since arriving from Jamaica as a teenager in 1973.|work=The Guardian|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="GdnPaperslost">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/vital-immigration-papers-lost-by-uk-home-office|title=Vital immigration papers lost by UK Home Office|last1=Grierson|first1=Jamie|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|quote=Important original documents submitted to the Home Office by applicants are lost, then applications are denied or applicants remain in limbo, sometimes for years because it is claimed documents are not available.

==Parliament==
In early March 2018, questions began to be asked in Parliament about individual cases that had been highlighted in the press. On 14 March, when [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition Leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] asked May about an individual who had been refused medical treatment under the NHS during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], May initially said she was "unaware of the case", but later agreed to "look into it".<ref name="GdnMaylookinto">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/14/theresa-may-promises-to-look-into-mans-54000-nhs-cancer-bill|title=Theresa May promises to look into man's £54,000 NHS cancer bill|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=May has promised to look into the case of a Londoner asked to pay £54,000 for cancer treatment despite having lived in the UK for 44 years, after Jeremy Corbyn raised it at prime minister's questions.|date=14 March 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 June 2018}}</ref> Parliament thereafter continued to be involved in what was increasingly being referred to as "the Windrush scandal".

On 16 April 2018, [[David Lammy]] MP challenged [[Amber Rudd]] in the House of Commons to give numbers as to how many had lost their jobs or homes, been denied medical care, or been detained or deported wrongly. Lammy called on Rudd to apologise for the threats of deportation and called it a "day of national shame", blaming the problems on the government's "hostile environment policy".<ref name="LammyFleas">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-43789247/david-lammy-lambasts-government-over-windrush-deportations|title=David Lammy lambasts government over Windrush deportations|quote=Lammy, calls this a "day of national shame", telling the Commons: "Let us call it as it is.

On 25 April, in answer to a question put to her by the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] about deportation targets (i.e. specific numbers to meet), Rudd said she was unaware of such targets,<ref name="IndyMeaCulpa">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/windrush-scandal-amber-rudd-yvette-cooper-home-affairs-select-committee-a8322561.html|title=Amber Rudd's one hundredth mea culpa for the Windrush Scandal was perhaps the least satisfying of them all|last=Peck|first=Tom|quote=Both Ms Rudd and Mr Williams said they would "go away and find out", whether their own department had been setting removal targets, because neither of them were aware.|date=25 April 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=6 July 2018}}</ref> saying "that's not how we operate",<ref name="Gdn£21m" /> although another witness had discussed deportation targets.<ref name="BBCCooper">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-43903986/cooper-challenges-rudd-on-removals-targets|title= Cooper challenges Rudd on removals 'targets'|work=[[BBC News]]|date= 26 April 2018|access-date= 27 April 2018}}</ref> The following day, Rudd admitted in Parliament that targets had existed, but characterised them as "local targets for internal performance management" only, not "specific removal targets".

Two days later, ''The Guardian'' published a leaked memo that had been copied to Rudd's office. The memo said that the department had set "a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017–18" and "we have exceeded our target of assisted returns". The memo added that progress had been made towards "the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the Home Secretary earlier this year".

On 15 May 2018, Javid told the Home Affairs Select Committee that 63 people had thus far been identified as having been possibly wrongly deported, though stating the figure was provisional and could rise.

===Parliamentary committees===
====Human Rights committee report====
On 29 June 2018, the parliamentary [[Joint Committee on Human Rights|Human Rights]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] published a "damning" report on the exercise of powers by immigration officials. MPs and [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peers]] concluded in the report that there had been "systemic failures" and rejected the Home Office description of a "a series of mistakes" as not "credible or sufficient". The report concluded that the Home Office demonstrated a "wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty", and urged the Home Secretary to take action against the "human rights violations" occurring in his department. The committee had examined the cases of two people who had both twice been detained by the Home Office, whose detentions the report described as "simply unlawful" and whose treatment was described as "shocking".

[[Harriet Harman]] MP and chair of the committee accused immigration officials of being "out of control", and the Home Office of being a "law unto itself". Harman commented that "protections and safeguards have been whittled away until what we can see now ... ''[is]'' that the Home Office is all powerful and human rights have been totally extinguished."

====Home Affairs Select Committee report====
On 3 July 2018, the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] (HASC) published a critical report which said that unless the Home Office was overhauled the scandal would "happen again, for another group of people". The report found that "a change in culture in the Home Office over recent years" had led to an environment in which applicants had been "forced to follow processes that appear designed to set them up to fail". The report questioned whether the hostile environment should continue in its current form, commenting that "rebranding it as the 'compliant' environment is a meaningless response to genuine concerns".<ref name="IndySetthemup" /><ref name="SkyMPscall" /> (Sajid Javid had previously referred to the policy as the 'compliant' environment policy).<ref name="ITVhepreview">{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-06-03/home-offices-hostile-environment-faces-review-after-windrush-sajid-javid/|title=Sajid Javid says Home Office's 'hostile environment' towards immigrants to be reviewed after Windrush|last=ITV report|date=3 June 2018|publisher=ITV news|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

The report recommended that the Home Office should re-assess all hostile environment policies to evaluate their "efficacy, fairness, impact (both intended and unintended consequences) and value for money", as the policy placed "a huge administrative burden and cost on many parts of society, without any clear evidence of its effectiveness, but with numerous examples of mistakes made and significant distress caused".<ref name="GdnMPscall">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/03/mps-call-total-reform-home-office-after-windrush-scandal|title=MPs call for total reform of Home Office after Windrush scandal|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=The "appalling treatment" of thousands of Windrush victims shows that the Home Office has become a callous and hostile institution in need of "root and branch reform".|date=3 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

The report made a series of recommendations designed to give the "Home Office a more human face". It also called for "passport fees to be abolished for Windrush citizens; for a return to face-to-face immigration interviews; for immigration appeal rights and legal aid to be reinstated; and for the net migration target to be dropped".<ref name="IndySetthemup" />

The report commented that they had hoped to uncover the extent of the impact on the Windrush generation, but that the government had "not been able to answer many of our questions … and we have not had access to internal Home Office papers". Commenting that it was "unacceptable that the Home Office still cannot tell us the number of people who have been unlawfully detained, were told to report to Home Office centres, who lost their jobs, or were denied medical treatment or other services."<ref name="IndySetthemup" />

The report also recommended extending the government compensation scheme to recognise "emotional distress as well as financial harm" and that the scheme should be open to Windrush children and grandchildren who had been adversely affected. The report reiterated its call for an immediate hardship fund for those in acute financial difficulty.<ref name="IndySetthemup">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windrush-home-office-set-them-up-fail-mps-affairs-select-committee-a8428041.html|title=Windrush generation: Home Office 'set them up to fail', say MPs|last=Agerholm|first=Harriet|date=3 July 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="SkyMPscall" /> Committee chair Yvette Cooper said the decision to delay hardship payments was "very troubling" and victims "should not have to struggle with debts while they are waiting for the compensation scheme".<ref name="SkyMPscall" />

The report also said that Home Office officials should have been aware of, and addressed, the problem much earlier.<ref name="HASCSummary">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmhaff/990/99003.htm|title=The Windrush generation – Summary|quote=We are deeply concerned that it took so long for the Government to acknowledge and address the situation of the Windrush generation.

The Labour party responded to the report by saying "many questions remained unanswered by the Home Office". [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[Diane Abbott]] said it was a "disgrace" that the government had not yet published "a clear plan for compensation" for Windrush cases and that it had refused to institute a hardship fund, "even for people who have been made homeless or unemployed by their policies".<ref name="IndySetthemup" /><ref name="SkyMPscall">{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/mps-call-for-major-reform-of-home-office-after-windrush-scandal-11424588|title=MPs call for major reform of Home Office after Windrush scandal|quote=Theresa May's "hostile environment" policy should change after the "appalling" treatment of the Windrush generation, MPs say|date=3 July 2018|publisher=Sky News|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="SkyJaviddraggingfeet">{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/javid-dragging-feet-on-windrush-compensation-11412773|title=Javid 'dragging feet' on Windrush compensation|quote=The government has not reached a decision on a compensation scheme more than two months after it was raised by MPs|date=22 June 2018|publisher=Sky News|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

====Home Office replies====
In response to questions from Parliamentary select committees, and questions asked in Parliament, the Home Office issued a number of replies during the scandal.

On 28 June 2018, a letter to the HASC from the Home Office reported that it had "mistakenly detained" 850 people in the five years between 2012 and 2017. In the same five-year period, the Home Office had paid compensation of over £21m for wrongful detention. Compensation payments varied between £1 and £120,000; an unknown number of these detentions were Windrush cases. The letter also acknowledged that 23% of staff working within immigration enforcement had received performance bonuses, and that some staff had been set "personal objectives" "linked to targets to achieve enforced removals" on which bonus payments were made.<ref name="Gdn£21m">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/28/wrongful-detention-cost-21m-as-immigration-staff-chased-bonuses|title=Home Office pays out £21m after mistakenly detaining 850 people|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=The Home Office mistakenly detained more than 850 people between 2012 and 2017, some of whom were living in the UK legally, and the government was forced to pay out more than £21m in compensation as a result, officials have revealed|date=28 June 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>

Figures released on 5 June by immigration minister [[Caroline Nokes]] revealed that in the 12 months prior to March 2018, 991 seats had been booked on commercial flights by the Home Office to remove people to the Caribbean who were suspected of being in the UK illegally. The 991 figure was not necessarily the number of deportations, as some removals may not have happened, and others may have involved multiple tickets for one person's flights. The figures did not say how many of the tickets booked were used for deportations. Nokes also said that in the two-year period from 2015 to 2017, the government had spent £52m on all deportation flights, including £17.7m on charter flights. Costs for the 12 months prior to March 2018 were not available.<ref name="Gdn991booked">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/991-people-deported-to-caribbean-in-year-before-windrush-row|title=991 deportation flights booked to Caribbean in year before Windrush row|last=Grierson|first=Jamie|work=The Guardian|date= 5 June 2018|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref>

In November 2018, in a monthly update to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Javid said there were 83 cases in which it had already been confirmed that people had been wrongfully deported, and officials feared there might be a further 81. At least 11 deportees had subsequently died.<ref name="Gdn121118" />

==National Audit Office report==
In a report published in December 2018, the UK's [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] found that the Home Office "failed to protect [the] rights to live, work and access services" of the Windrush scandal victims, had ignored warnings of the impending scandal, which had been raised up to four years earlier, and had still not adequately addressed the scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46445109|title=Windrush: 'Home Office ignored warnings'|date=5 December 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

==Resumption of deportations==
Public outcry against the deportations caused them to be paused in 2018. However, in February 2019 it emerged that the Home Office intended to resume deportations.<ref name="indy-feb2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windrush-charter-flight-deported-jamaica-home-office-immigration-caribbean-remove-a8759916.html|title=Dozens of Caribbean nationals to be deported on first charter flight to Jamaica since Windrush scandal|date=2 February 2019|first=May|last= Bulman|website=The Independent}}</ref> The news led to renewed outcries against the Home Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/03/resumption-of-deportation-flights-brutal-say-labour-mps|title=New Caribbean deportation flights attacked as 'insult to Windrush victims'|first=Robert|last=Booth |date=3 February 2019|access-date=3 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://w.jamaica-gleaner.com/article/world-news/20190204/new-jamaica-deportation-flights-attacked-insult-windrush-victims|title=New Jamaica deportation flights attacked as 'insult to Windrush victims'|date=4 February 2019|website=W.jamaica-gleaner.com|access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/05/deportation-flights-ministers-pandering-to-far-right-says-lammy|title=Deportation flights: ministers pandering to far-right, says Lammy|first=Amelia|last=Gentleman|date=5 February 2019|access-date=5 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/06/lawyers-slam-deportation-flights-jamaica-appalling-insult-justice-8461061/|title=Lawyers slam deportation flights to Jamaica as 'appalling insult to justice'|date=6 February 2019|website=Metro.co.uk|access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref>

On 5 February 2019, Javid claimed that all of the people due to be deported were guilty of "very serious crimes ... like rape and murder, firearms offences and drug-trafficking", but the claim was rebutted by the Home Office and was criticised by commentators as inaccurate and potentially detrimental to the futures of the deportees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sajid-javid-jamaica-deportation-crimes-home-office-hostile-environment-immigration-a8767986.html|title=Home secretary urged to apologise for falsely claiming Jamaica deportees were all guilty of 'very serious crimes'|date=7 February 2019|first=May|last=Bulman|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paul-douglas-colnbrook-removal-centre-immigration-deportation-young-offender-a8792696.html|title=Paul Douglas: I did 12 years in jail from the age of 16.

On 24 May Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, outlined a series of measures to process citizenship applications for people affected by the scandal. The measures included free citizenship applications for children who joined their parents in the UK when they were under 18 and for children born in the UK of Windrush parents, and free confirmation of right to remain for those entitled to it but currently outside the UK, subject to normal good character requirements. The measures were criticised by MPs, as they provided no right of appeal or review of decisions. [[Yvette Cooper]], chair of the Commons [[Home Affairs Committee]], said: "Given the history of this, how can anyone trust Home Office not to make further mistakes? If the Home Secretary is confident that senior caseworkers will be making good decisions in Windrush cases, he has nothing to fear about appeals and reviews." Javid also said that a Home Office team had identified 500 potential cases thus far.<ref name="IndyNoappeal">{{cite news|

In subsequent weeks, Javid also promised to provide figures on how many people had been wrongly detained and indicated that he did not believe in quantified targets for removals.<ref name="Gdn£21m" />

On 21 May 2018, it was reported that many Windrush victims were still destitute, sleeping rough or on the sofas of friends and relatives while waiting for Home Office action. Many could not afford to travel to Home Office appointments if they got them. David Lammy MP described it as "yet another failure in a litany of abject failures that Windrush citizens are being left homeless and hungry on the streets."<ref name="GdnSleeprough" /> In late May and early June, there were calls from MPs for a hardship fund to be set up to meet urgent needs.<ref name="GdnSleeprough">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/windrush-migrants-still-sleeping-rough-one-month-after-ministers-promise|title=Windrush migrants still sleeping rough one month after minister's promise|last1=Gentleman|first1=Amelia|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|date=21 May 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 June 2018}}</ref><ref>Grierson, Jamie (13 June 2018), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/windrush-scandal-mps-call-for-urgent-hardship-fund-for-victims "Windrush scandal: MPs call for urgent hardship fund for victims"], ''The Guardian''.</ref> By late June, it was reported that the government's two-week deadline for resolving cases has been repeatedly breached, and that many of the most serious cases still had not been addressed. Jamaican High Commissioner Seth George Ramocan said: "There has been an effort to correct the situation now that it has become so very open and public." <ref name="GdnShambles" />

In August 2018 a compensation plan had still not been implemented. Examples cited included, a man who was still homeless while waiting for a decision; a former NHS nurse, Sharon, who told a caseworker, "I am not allowed to work, I have no benefits. I have a 12-year-old child." The caseworker replied, "Well I'm afraid these are the immigration rules,... but obviously the Home Office point of view [is] if you don't have a legal status in the UK you're not entitled to work or study." Satbir Singh of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants stated, "It's appalling that the Home Office effectively told Sharon to go and beg for food, when there are laws requiring the state to act in the best interests of children, and provide financial support to children facing destitution." Also in August 2018, a caseworker for [[David Lammy]], said: "We have referred 25 constituents to the Windrush taskforce in total. Only three have been granted their citizenship so far, and the others are left in a strange limbo … We still have some people who have not even got biometric residence permits and we alerted the Home Office to these people months ago."<ref>Marsh, Sarah (10 August 2018), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/10/windrush-citizens-still-waiting-for-cases-to-be-resolved "Windrush citizens still waiting for cases to be resolved"], ''The Guardian''.</ref>

===Hardship scheme===
In February 2019, the Home Office admitted that, although it had set up a hardship scheme in December 2018 for victims of the scandal, only one of the applicants to the scheme had thus far received any assistance. Also the compensation scheme promised by the Home Office in April 2018 was still not in place in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windrush-home-office-hardship-scheme-sajid-javid-yvette-cooper-a8768511.html|title=Home Office admits just one person helped by Windrush hardship scheme|date=7 February 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref>

In February 2020, government ministers were told that the number of people wrongly classified as illegal immigrants could be much greater than previously thought and that as many as 15,000 people could be eligible for compensation. Despite this, only 36 people's compensation claims had thus far been settled and only £62,198 has been paid out from a Home Office compensation pot which was expected to distribute between £200m and £570m.<ref name="Gdn922020">{{cite news |last1=Gentleman |first1=Amelia |last2=Walker |first2=Peter |title=Windrush claimants 'tip of the iceberg' as payout struggle continues |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/windrush-scandal-wrongly-designated-illegal-immigrants |access-date=14 February 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=9 February 2020}}</ref>

By April 2020, the Windrush taskforce, which was set up to deal with applications from people who were wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants, still had 3,720 outstanding cases. 1,111 of these cases had yet to be considered, more than 150 of these had waited for over six months, and thirty-five had waited for over a year for a response. The Home Office revealed that it had thus far identified 164 people from Caribbean countries who it had wrongly detained or deported. Twenty-four people who had been wrongly deported had died before the UK government had been able to contact them, fourteen people who had been wrongly deported to the Caribbean, had thus far not been traced. Officials refused to attempt to trace people who had been wrongly deported to non-Caribbean Commonwealth countries. Up to that date thirty-five people had been granted "urgent and exceptional support" payments, totalling £46,795.<ref name="Gdn30420">{{cite news |last1=Gentleman |first1=Amelia |title=Windrush backlog reaches 3,720 cases, Home Office reveals |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/windrush-case-backlog-remains-at-3700-home-office-reveals |access-date=30 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=30 April 2020}}</ref>

By October 2020, nine victims had died without receiving their compensation, and many others had yet to receive compensation. <ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54748038</ref>

==Landing cards==
The only official records of the arrival of many "Windrush" immigrants in the 1950s through to the early 1970s were landing cards collected as they disembarked from ships in UK ports. In subsequent decades, these cards were routinely used by British immigration officials to verify dates of arrival for borderline immigration cases.<ref name="GdnContradict">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/whistleblowers-contradict-no-10-over-destroyed-windrush-landing-cards|title=Whistleblowers contradict No 10 over destroyed Windrush landing cards|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|quote=Staff routinely used landing card information as part of their decision-making process,|date=18 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref> In 2009, those landing cards were earmarked for destruction as part of a broader clean up of paper records.

==Caribbean reactions==
*Antigua and Barbuda: Prime Minister [[Gaston Browne]] told Sky News' ''All Out Politics'' that an apology from the British government over the Windrush issue "would be welcome". He said it had been a major concern, but that he was pleased the government had stepped in. "We have had at least one Antiguan who incidentally has a British passport, who was apparently identified for deportation on the basis that he had no original documents. He came here about 59-years ago as an infant with his parents, and would have been on his parents' passport. Many of these individuals do not have any connection with the country of their birth, would have lived in the UK their entire lives and worked very hard towards the advancement of the UK."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/live-home-office-unaware-of-windrush-deportations-11334509|title=May apologises for Windrush immigration row|work=Sky News|date=17 April 2018|access-date=1 May 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

We have to call it out for what it is, but we also have to ensure that those who have been deported get access to a process that gets them back. They should get access to all the benefits that their citizenship will entitle them to. If there was an acceptance that a wrong was done, then there should be a process of restoration. I’m certain that the robust civil society and democracy that you have will come up with a process of compensation."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/jamaican-pm-labour-mp-call-windrush-compensation|title=Jamaican PM and Labour MP call for Windrush compensation|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=18 April 2018|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>
