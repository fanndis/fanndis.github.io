In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held [[January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election|multi-party elections]] in 2005. [[Nouri al-Maliki]] became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's previously dominant Sunni minority and worsening [[sectarian]] tensions. In the summer of 2014, the ISIL launched a military offensive in northern Iraq and declared a [[Worldwide caliphate|worldwide]] Islamic [[caliphate]], leading to [[Operation Inherent Resolve]], another military response from the United States and its allies.

The Iraq War caused at least one hundred thousand civilian deaths, as well as tens of thousands of military deaths (see estimates [[#Casualty estimates|below]]). The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007. Subsequently, the [[Iraq–ISIL War]] of 2013 to 2017, which is considered a [[domino effect]] of the invasion, caused at least 155,000 deaths, in addition to the displacement of five million people within the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=7865:un-casualty-figures-for-iraq-for-the-month-of-august-2017&Itemid=633&lang=en|title=UN Casualty Figures for Iraq for the Month of August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iom.int/news/displacement-iraq-exceeds-33-million-iom|title=Displacement in Iraq Exceeds 3.3 Million: IOM|date=23 February 2016|website=International Organization for Migration}}</ref><ref>[http://iraqdtm.iom.int] 2,780,406 displaced and 2,844,618 returnees.

Strong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began after Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990. The international community condemned the invasion,<ref name=Global>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1990/900816-151051.htm "World Acts Against Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921182559/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1990/900816-151051.htm |date=21 September 2016}}. GlobalSecurity.org.</ref> and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the [[Gulf War]] to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Following the Gulf War, the US and its allies tried to keep Saddam Hussein in check with a policy of [[containment]]. This policy involved numerous [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions]] by the [[UN Security Council]]; the enforcement of [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] declared by the US and the UK to protect the [[Kurds]] in Iraqi Kurdistan and [[Shia]]s in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections to ensure Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions concerning [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction]].

[[File:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|left|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq, 2002]]
The inspections were carried out by the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM). UNSCOM, in cooperation with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], worked to ensure that Iraq destroyed its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and facilities.<ref name="Zilinskas">Zilinskas, Raymond A., "UNSCOM and the UNSCOM Experience in Iraq", ''Politics and the Life Sciences'', Vol. 14, No. 2 (Aug. 1995), 230.</ref> In the decade following the Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the special commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations.

Key U.S. allies in [[NATO]], such as the [[United Kingdom]], agreed with the US actions, while [[France]] and [[Germany]] were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]], which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised "serious consequences" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm "France threatens rival UN Iraq draft"].

Resolution 1441 set up inspections by the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman [[Hans Blix]] and IAEA Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]].

In October 2002, the US Congress passed the "[[Iraq Resolution]]", which authorized the President to "use any means necessary" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan (see [[popular opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq]]). The US government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.<ref name="CBSnews-20030124">[https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml "Poll: Talk First, Fight Later"].

In March 2003, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq with a host of public relations and military moves. In an address to the nation on 17 March 2003, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html|title=President Says Saddam Hussein Must Leave Iraq Within 48 Hours|date=17 March 2003 |publisher=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

In October 2002, former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] warned about possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq. Speaking in the UK at a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference he said: "As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future....

There were serious [[Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|legal questions]] surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the [[Bush Doctrine]] of [[preemptive war]] in general.

{{quote|"First, ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens.

The invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the U.S., British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular, [[asymmetric warfare]] at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller-scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes.

On 1 May 2003, President Bush visited the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] operating a few miles west of San Diego, California. At sunset, he held his nationally televised [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|"Mission Accomplished" speech]], delivered before the sailors and [[airmen]] on the [[flight deck]]. Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq, due to the defeat of Iraq's conventional forces, while maintaining that much still needed to be done.

Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein remained at large, and significant pockets of resistance remained. After Bush's speech, coalition forces noticed a flurry of attacks on its troops began to gradually increase in various regions, such as the "[[Sunni Triangle]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom Maps|publisher=GlobalSecurity.Org |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraqi_freedom-ops-maps.htm}}</ref> The initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and [[Iraqi Special Republican Guard|Republican Guard]].

Initially, Iraqi resistance (described by the coalition as "Anti-Iraqi Forces") largely stemmed from [[fedayeen]] and Saddam/[[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party&nbsp;– Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] loyalists, but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The three governorates with the highest number of attacks were [[Baghdad Governorate|Baghdad]], [[Al Anbar Governorate|Al Anbar]], and [[Saladin Governorate|Saladin]]. Those three governorates account for 35% of the population, but by December 2006 they were responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx |title=iCasualties: Iraq Coalition Casualty Count&nbsp;— Deaths by Province Year/Month|publisher=Icasualties.org|accessdate=27 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708203616/http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx |archive-date=8 July 2008}}</ref>

Insurgents used various [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], including mortars, missiles, [[suicide attack]]s, [[Juba (sniper)|snipers]], [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), car bombs, small arms fire (usually with [[assault rifle]]s), and RPGs ([[rocket propelled grenades]]), as well as sabotage against the petroleum, water, and electrical infrastructures.

Coalition efforts to establish [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|post-invasion Iraq]] commenced after the fall of Saddam's regime. The coalition nations, together with the United Nations, began to work to establish a stable, compliant democratic state capable of defending itself from non-coalition forces, as well as overcoming internal divisions.<ref name=Soriano>{{cite news|title=Poll: Iraqis out of patience|work=USA Today|date=30 April 2004|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/13/232154.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116031824/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/13/232154.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mariam |last=Karouny |url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=49603 |title=Gloom descends on Iraqi leaders as civil war looms |newspaper=Turkish Daily News |agency=Reuters |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165233/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=49603 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |date=23 July 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Meanwhile, coalition military forces launched several operations around the [[Tigris]] River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. In late 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the "[[Ramadan Offensive (2003)|Ramadan Offensive]]", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]].

To counter this offensive, coalition forces began to use airpower and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion, by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents was stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam's birthplace of [[al-Auja]] and the small town of [[Abu Hishma]], were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.

==== Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraq Survey Group ====
{{See also|Iraqi Governing Council|International Advisory and Monitoring Board|Coalition Provisional Authority Program Review Board|l3=CPA Program Review Board|Development Fund for Iraq|Reconstruction of Iraq}}
Shortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA; {{lang-ar|سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة}}), based in the [[Green Zone]], as a [[transitional government]] of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483]] (22 May 2003) and the [[laws of war]], the CPA vested itself with executive, [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.

[[File:Iraq 2003 occupation.png|thumb|left|Occupation zones in [[Coalition Provisional Authority|Iraq]] as of September 2003]]
The CPA was originally headed by [[Jay Garner]], a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted only until 11 May 2003, when President Bush appointed [[L.&nbsp;Paul Bremer]]. On 16 May 2003, his first day on the job, Paul Bremer issued [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1]] to exclude from the new Iraqi government and administration members of the Baathist party. This policy, known as [[De-Ba'athification]], eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their job,<ref>[http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders,%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf "US Blunders in Iraq"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181004/http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders%2C%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf |date=29 November 2016}} ''Intelligence and National Security'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 76–85, February 2010.</ref> including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to keep their jobs. U.S. army general [[Ricardo Sanchez]] called the decision a "catastrophic failure".<ref>Sanchez, Wiser in Battle, p.185.</ref> Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.

In May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, [[Walter B. Slocombe]], advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased.<ref>"Reintegration of Regular [IRAQ] Army", DDR Tasks – The Army, 3 July 2003 10:03 AM</ref> At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Despite advice from U.S. Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the U.S. policy. Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy. Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army, no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq; the week after, five U.S. soldiers were killed. Then, on 18 June 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad who were throwing rocks at coalition forces. The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.<ref>America vs. Iraq, 26 August 2013, National Geographic, Television Production, Documentary</ref>

Another group created by the [[multinational force in Iraq]] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [[Iraq Survey Group]], who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. In 2004, the ISG's [[Duelfer Report]] stated that Iraq did not have a viable WMD program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd_2004/|title=Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD – Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>

==== Capturing former government leaders ====

[[File:Iraqi insurgents with MANPADS.jpg|thumb|Two insurgents in Iraq with SA-7b and SA-14 MANPADS]]
In summer 2003, the multinational forces focused on [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|capturing the remaining leaders]] of the former government. On 22 July, a raid by the U.S.&nbsp;[[101st Airborne Division]] and soldiers from [[Task Force&nbsp;20]] killed Saddam's sons ([[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]]) along with one of his grandsons. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.

Most significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003, on a farm near [[Tikrit]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pentagon: Saddam is POW|publisher=CNN|date=10 January 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/01/09/sprj.nirq.saddam/}}</ref> The operation was conducted by the [[United States Army]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] and members of [[Task Force 121]]. Intelligence on Saddam's whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole|publisher=CNN|date=15 December 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/14/sprj.irq.saddam.operation/index.html?iref=newssearch}}</ref>

With the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}} in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.

Shortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an [[Iraqi Interim Government]]. Most prominent among these was the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] cleric [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]]. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the U.S. is Running Scared of Elections in Iraq |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 January 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/19/usa.iraq|accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> The insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around [[Fallujah]] and the poor [[Shia]] sections of cities from [[Baghdad]] ([[Sadr City]]) to [[Basra]] in the south.

The start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganised during this time, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive. However, violence did increase during the [[Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004]] with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]], an affiliated [[al-Qaeda]] group led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], helping to drive the insurgency.{{Citation needed|reason=What is that about?

[[File:Soldiers firing a M120 120mm mortar (Iraq).jpg|thumb|U.S. troops fire mortars.]]
As the insurgency grew there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia [[Mahdi Army]] also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.

The most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] ambushed a [[Blackwater&nbsp;USA]] convoy led by four U.S. [[private military contractor]]s who were providing security for food caterers [[Eurest Support Services]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/contractors/highrisk.html |title=frontline: private warriors: contractors: the high-risk contracting business |publisher=PBS |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> The four armed contractors, [[Scott Helvenston]], Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Subsequently, their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people, beaten, set ablaze, and their burned corpses hung over a bridge crossing the [[Euphrates]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/03/31/iraq.main/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406012238/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/03/31/iraq.main/|archive-date=6 April 2004|last1=Flower|first1=Kevin|last2=Gray|first2=Melissa|last3=Kroll|first3=Sue|last4=Paulsen|first4=Vivian|last5=Sadik|first5=Auday|title=U.S. expects more attacks in Iraq: Residents hang slain Americans' bodies from bridge |publisher=CNN |date=31 March 2004|accessdate=6 April 2004}}</ref> Photos of the event were released to [[news agency|news agencies]] worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and [[moral panic|moral outrage]] in the United States, and prompting an unsuccessful "pacification" of the city: the [[First Battle of Fallujah]] in April 2004.

The offensive was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war: the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], described by the U.S. military as "the heaviest [[urban warfare|urban combat]] (that they had been involved in) since the [[Battle of Hue City]] in Vietnam."<ref>[http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Jan2005/n01112005_2005011103.html ScanEagle Proves Worth in Fallujah Fight] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115202751/http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Jan2005/n01112005_2005011103.html |date=15 January 2016}}, ''DefenseLINK News''</ref> During the assault, U.S.&nbsp;forces used [[White phosphorus use in Iraq|white phosphorus]] as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel, attracting controversy. The 46‑day battle resulted in a victory for the coalition, with 95 U.S.&nbsp;soldiers killed along with approximately 1,350 insurgents. Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting, though civilian casualties were low, as they had mostly fled before the battle.<ref>Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 398–405</ref>

Another major event of that year was the revelation of widespread [[prisoner abuse]] at [[Abu Ghraib]], which received international media attention in April 2004. First reports of the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], as well as graphic pictures showing U.S.&nbsp;military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners, came to public attention from a ''[[60&nbsp;Minutes&nbsp;II]]'' news report (28 April) and a [[Seymour M.

2004 also marked the beginning of [[Military Transition Teams]] in Iraq, which were teams of U.S. military advisors assigned directly to New Iraqi Army units.

=== 2005: Elections and transitional government ===
{{Further|2005 in Iraq|Military transition team}}
[[File:Baghdad Convention Center inside.jpg|thumb|Convention center for Council of Representatives of Iraq]]
On 31 January, Iraqis [[January 2005 Iraqi legislative election|elected]] the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]] in order to draft a permanent constitution. Although some violence and a widespread Sunni [[boycott]] marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, [[Paul Wolfowitz]] announced that 15,000 U.S.&nbsp;troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. to pull out 15,000 from Iraq|work=BBC News|date=4 February 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4235787.stm |accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref> February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.

The [[Battle of Abu Ghraib]] on 2 April 2005 was an attack on United States forces at Abu Ghraib prison, which consisted of heavy mortar and rocket fire, under which an estimated 80–120 armed insurgents attacked with grenades, small arms, and two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). The U.S. force's munitions ran so low that orders to fix bayonets were given in preparation for hand-to-hand fighting. It was considered to be the largest coordinated assault on a U.S. base since the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite news |title=Insurgents attack Abu Ghraib prison|date=3 April 2005|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/04/02/iraq.main |accessdate=26 March 2014|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Hopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed in May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.

The summer of 2005 saw fighting around [[Baghdad]] and at [[Tall Afar]] in northwestern Iraq as U.S. forces tried to seal off the Syrian border. This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the [[Euphrates]] valley between the capital and that border.<ref name="Ricks-2006">Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 413</ref>

A referendum was held on 15 October in which the new [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi constitution]] was [[2005 Iraqi constitutional referendum|ratified]]. An [[Iraqi National Assembly]] was [[December 2005 Iraqi legislative election|elected in December]], with participation from the Sunnis as well as the Kurds and Shia.<ref name="Ricks-2006"/>

The beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.

Although no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on 23 February, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack the U.S.&nbsp;military calculated that the average homicide rate in [[Baghdad]] tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a "civil war-like situation".<ref>{{cite news |title=Decrying violence in Iraq, UN envoy urges national dialogue, international support|publisher=UN News Centre|date=25 November 2006|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20726&Cr=Iraq&Cr1=}}</ref>

On 12 March, five United States Army soldiers of the [[502nd Infantry Regiment]] raped the 15-year-old Iraqi girl Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, and then murdered her, her father, her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen and her six-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza al-Janabi.

[[File:Bush and al-Maliki.jpg|thumb|upright|Nouri al-Maliki meets with George W. Bush, June 2006]]
On 6 June 2006, the United States was successful in tracking [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] who was killed in a [[targeted killing]], while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Baqubah. Having been tracked by a British UAV, radio contact was made between the controller and two United States Air Force [[F-16]]C jets, which identified the house and at 14:15&nbsp;GMT, the lead jet dropped two 500‑pound (230&nbsp;kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided GBU‑12 and GPS-guided GBU‑38 on the building where he was located. Six others—three male and three female individuals—were also reported killed. Among those killed were one of his wives and their child.

The government of Iraq took office on 20 May 2006, following approval by the [[Members of the 1st Iraqi Council of Representatives|members]] of the [[Iraqi National Assembly]]. This followed the [[December 2005 Iraqi legislative election|general election in December 2005]]. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government, which had continued in office in a [[Caretaker government|caretaker capacity]] until the formation of the permanent government.

==== Iraq Study Group report and Saddam's execution ====
{{Main|Iraq Study Group|Execution of Saddam Hussein}}
The [[Iraq Study Group Report]] was released on 6 December 2006. The Iraq Study Group made up of people from both of the major U.S.&nbsp;parties, was led by co-chairs [[James Baker]], a former Secretary of State (Republican), and [[Lee H. Hamilton]], a former U.S.&nbsp;Representative (Democrat). It concluded that "the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating" and "U.S.&nbsp;forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end." The report's 79&nbsp;recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Attacks in Iraq at All-Time High, Pentagon Report Says|publisher=PBS|date=19 December 2006|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec06/iraq_12-19.html|work=Newshour}}</ref>

Coalition forces formally transferred control of a governorate to the Iraqi government, the first since the war. Military prosecutors charged eight U.S. Marines with the murders of 24 Iraqi civilians in [[Haditha]] in November 2005, 10 of them women and children.

In 2007, tensions increased greatly between [[Iran]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group [[Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan]] (PEJAK.) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August. These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants.<ref>{{cite news|last=Collins |first=Chris |author2=Yaseen Taha |title=Iranians attack Kurdish rebels in Iraq |publisher=McClatchy Washington Bureau |date=23 August 2007 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/19172.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703071530/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/19172.html |archive-date=3 July 2009 }}</ref>

Coalition forces also [[Kill or Capture strategy|began to target]] alleged Iranian [[Quds force]] operatives in Iraq, either [[U.S. raid on the Iranian Liaison Office in Arbil|arresting or killing suspected members]].

Further sanctions on Iranian organizations were also announced by the Bush administration in the autumn of 2007. On 21 November 2007, Lieutenant General James Dubik, who is in charge of training Iraqi security forces, praised Iran for its "contribution to the reduction of violence" in Iraq by upholding its pledge to stop the flow of weapons, explosives and training of extremists in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gyE_23JcWcBZt06lpBqxSXqpkOXg|title=US general says Iran helping stop Iraq bloodshed|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=21 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527151841/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gyE_23JcWcBZt06lpBqxSXqpkOXg|archive-date=27 May 2013}}</ref>

Throughout 2008, U.S.&nbsp;officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics. According to the [[U.S.&nbsp;Defense Department]], in December 2008 the "overall level of violence" in the country had dropped 80% since before [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|the surge]] began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels.

Meanwhile, the proficiency of the Iraqi military increased as it launched a spring offensive against Shia militias, which Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] had previously been criticized for allowing to operate. This began with a March [[Battle of Basra (2008)|operation]] against the [[Mehdi Army]] in Basra, which led to fighting in Shia areas up and down the country, especially in the [[Sadr City]] district of Baghdad. By October, the British officer in charge of Basra said that since the operation, the town had become "secure" and had a murder rate comparable to [[Manchester]] in England.<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4304 "DoD News Briefing with Maj.

At the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed "Charge of the Knights", in Basra to secure the area from militias. This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops. The offensive was opposed by the [[Mahdi Army]], one of the militias, which controlled much of the region.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dagher|first=Sam|title=Across Iraq, battles erupt with Mahdi Army|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=26 March 2008|page=2|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0326/p01s13-woiq.html?page=2}}</ref><ref name=driveinbasra>{{cite news |author=Stephen Farrell and Ahmar Karim|title=Drive in Basra by Iraqi Army Makes Gains|work=The New York Times|date=12 May 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/world/middleeast/12basra.html?ref=middleeast|accessdate=12 May 2008}}</ref> Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including [[Sadr City]], [[Al Kut]], [[Al Hillah]] and others.

"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status", al‑Maliki said.

The U.S.&nbsp;military attributed a decline in reported civilian deaths to several factors including the U.S.‑led "troop surge", the growth of U.S.-funded [[Sunni Awakening|Awakening Councils]], and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.civilians/index.html?iref=newssearch |title=Iraqi civilian deaths down in January |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>

On 27 February, United States President [[Barack Obama]] gave a speech at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] in the U.S. state of [[North Carolina]] announcing that the U.S. combat mission in Iraq would end by 31 August 2010. A "transitional force" of up to 50,000 troops tasked with training the [[Iraqi Security Forces]], conducting [[counterterrorism]] operations, and providing general support may remain until the end of 2011, the president added. However, the insurgency in 2011 and the rise of ISIL in 2014 caused the war to continue.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/us/politics/27obama-text.html?pagewanted=1|title=Obama's Speech at Camp Lejeune, N.C.|work=The New York Times|date=27 February 2009}}</ref>

On 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations. Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] characterized the operation in Iraq as a "success story" because of UK troops' efforts.

On 28 July, Australia withdrew its combat forces as the Australian military presence in Iraq ended, per an agreement with the Iraqi government.

The withdrawal of U.S.&nbsp;forces began at the end of June, with 38 bases to be handed over to Iraqi forces. On 29 June 2009, U.S.&nbsp;forces withdrew from Baghdad.

On 17 February 2010, U.S.&nbsp;Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] announced that as of 1 September, the name "Operation Iraqi Freedom" would be replaced by "Operation New Dawn".<ref>{{cite news |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/exclusive-war-in-iraq-to-be-given-new-name.html |title=Exclusive: War in Iraq to Be Given New Name |publisher=ABC News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220213117/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/exclusive-war-in-iraq-to-be-given-new-name.html |archive-date=20 February 2010}}</ref>

On 18 April, U.S. and Iraqi forces killed [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] the leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] in a joint American and Iraqi operation near [[Tikrit]], Iraq.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/04/19/iraqi-al-qaeda-leader-killed-countrys-intelligence-team-pm-maliki-says/ "2 Most Wanted Al Qaeda Leaders in Iraq Killed by U.S., Iraqi Forces"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701141957/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/04/19/iraqi-al-qaeda-leader-killed-countrys-intelligence-team-pm-maliki-says/ |date=1 July 2015}} Fox News, 19 April 2010</ref> The coalition forces believed al-Masri to be wearing a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri, [[Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi]], an assistant to al-Masri, and al-Baghdadi's son. A suicide vest was indeed found on al-Masri's corpse, as the Iraqi Army subsequently stated.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110503224053/http://rss.msnbc.msn.com/id/36664251/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/ "US : Al-Qaida in Iraq warlord slain"] MSNBC, 20 April 2010</ref>
Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] announced the killings of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri at a news conference in Baghdad and showed reporters photographs of their bloody corpses. "The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles," Mr Maliki said. "During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists, Osama bin Laden and [his deputy] Ayman al-Zawahiri", Maliki added. U.S.&nbsp;forces commander Gen. [[Raymond Odierno]] praised the operation. "The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al‑Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency", he said. "There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists."

U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] stated that the deaths of the top two al‑Qaeda figures in Iraq are "potentially devastating" blows to the terror network there and proof that Iraqi security forces are gaining ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8630213.stm |work=BBC News |title=Iraqi al-Qaeda leaders 'killed' |date=19 April 2010}}</ref>

On 20 June, Iraq's Central Bank was bombed in an attack that left 15 people dead and brought much of downtown Baghdad to a standstill. The attack was claimed to have been carried out by the [[Islamic State of Iraq]]. This attack was followed by another attack on Iraq's Bank of Trade building that killed 26 and wounded 52 people.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/world/middleeast/21iraq.html |title=Car Bombs Hit Crowds Outside Bank in Baghdad |first1=Khalid D.|last1=Ali|first2=Timothy|last2=Williams |date=20 June 2010 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In late August 2010, insurgents conducted [[25 August 2010 Iraq bombings|a major attack]] with at least 12 car bombs simultaneously detonating from Mosul to Basra and killing at least 51.

From the end of August 2010, the United States attempted to dramatically cut its combat role in Iraq, with the withdrawal of all U.S.&nbsp;ground forces designated for active combat operations.

The desire to step back from an active counter-insurgency role did not however mean that the Advise and Assist Brigades and other remaining U.S.&nbsp;forces would not be caught up in combat. A standards memo from the Associated Press reiterated "combat in Iraq is not over, and we should not uncritically repeat suggestions that it is, even if they come from senior officials".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/03/ap-memo-iraq-war_n_705446.html |title=AP Issues Standards Memo: 'Combat In Iraq Is Not Over' |work=The Huffington Post |date=3 September 2010|accessdate=23 October 2010 |first=Jason |last=Linkins}}</ref>

On the same day in Iraq, at a ceremony at one of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s former residences at [[Al Faw Palace]] in Baghdad, a number of U.S.&nbsp;dignitaries spoke in a ceremony for television cameras, avoiding overtones of the [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|triumphalism]] present in U.S. announcements made earlier in the war. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that "they expect a government that reflects the results of the votes they cast". Gen. [[Ray Odierno]] stated that the new era "in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq". Speaking in [[Ramadi]] earlier in the day, Gates said that U.S.&nbsp;forces "have accomplished something really quite extraordinary here, [but] how it all weighs in the balance over time I think remains to be seen". When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that "It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of what happens here in the long run". He noted the Iraq War "will always be clouded by how it began" regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed [[weapons of mass destruction]], which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, "This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html?hp|work=The New York Times |title=U.S. Formally Begins a New Era in Iraq |first=Michael |last=Gordon |date=1 September 2010}}</ref> On the same day Gen.

==== The UN lifts restrictions on Iraq ====
In a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN&nbsp;restrictions on Iraq. These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Security-Council-Lifts-Some-Restrictions-On-Iraq-111951129.html |title=UN Security Council Lifts Some Restrictions on Iraq |publisher=Voice of America |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217160324/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Security-Council-Lifts-Some-Restrictions-On-Iraq-111951129.html |archive-date=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September, Iraq signed a contract to buy 18 Lockheed Martin F-16 warplanes, becoming the 26th nation to operate the F-16.

The invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence, which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians. The Iraqi Red Crescent organization estimated the total internal displacement was around 2.3&nbsp;million in 2008, with as many as 2 million Iraqis having left the country. Poverty led many Iraqi women to turn to prostitution to support themselves and their families, attracting sex tourists from regional lands. The invasion led to a constitution, which supported democracy as long as laws did not violate traditional Islamic principles, and a parliamentary election was held in 2005. In addition, the invasion preserved the autonomy of the Kurdish region, and stability brought new economic prosperity. Because the Kurdish region is historically the most democratic area of Iraq, many Iraqi refugees from other territories fled into the Kurdish land.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeFronzo |first=James |editor=Karl Yambert |chapter=Impacts of the Iraq War |title=The Contemporary Middle East |edition=Third |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Westview Press |year=2012 |pages=210–211 |isbn=978-0813348391}}</ref>

Sectarian violence continued in the first half of 2013. At least 56 people died in April when a Sunni protest in Hawija was interrupted by a government-supported helicopter raid and a series of violent incidents occurred in May. On 20 May 2013, at least 95 people died in a wave of car bomb attacks that was preceded by a car bombing on 15 May that led to 33 deaths; also, on 18 May, 76 people were killed in the Sunni areas of Baghdad.

On 22 July 2013, at least five hundred convicts, most of whom were senior members of al-Qaida who had received death sentences, broke out of Iraq's Abu Ghraib jail when comrades launched a military-style assault to free them.

By mid-2014 the country was in chaos with a new government yet to be formed following national elections, and the insurgency reaching new heights. In early June 2014 the [[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) took over the cities of Mosul and Tikrit and said it was ready to march on Baghdad, while Iraqi Kurdish forces took control of key military installations in the major oil city of Kirkuk. The al-Qaida breakaway group formally declared the creation of an Islamic state on 29 June 2014, in the territory under its control.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Karouny |first1=Mariam |title=How ISIS Is Filling A Government Vacuum In Syria With An 'Islamic State' |url=https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5763536?guccounter=2 |website=Huffington Post |publisher=Reuters|date=4 September 2014}}</ref>

In January 2020, the Iraqi parliament voted for all foreign troops to leave the country. This would end its standing agreement with the United States to station 5,200 soldiers in Iraq.

The Bush Administration's [[rationale for the Iraq War]] has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, with many U.S.&nbsp;citizens finding many parallels with the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Vietnam war-eyewitness booksW.; ''Iraq and Vietnam: Differences, Similarities and Insights'', (2004: Strategic Studies Institute)</ref> For example, a former CIA officer described the [[Office of Special Plans]] as a group of [[ideologue]]s who were dangerous to U.S. national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030608/ai_n12583062 "Revealed: The Secret Cabal Which Spun for Blair,"] ''Sunday Herald'', Neil Mackay, 8 June 2003</ref> The [[Center for Public Integrity]] alleges that the [[George W.

Most significantly, critics have assailed the United States and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission, not adequately planning for [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|post-invasion Iraq]], and for permitting and perpetrating human rights abuses. As the war has progressed, critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs. In 2016, the United Kingdom published the [[Iraq Inquiry]], a public inquiry which was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the aftermath of the war.<ref name="GuardianReport">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war|title=Chilcot delivers crushing verdict on Blair and the Iraq war |author=Luke Harding|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="TelegraphReport">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/chilcot-inquiry-judgement-day-for-tony-blair-as-iraq-war-report/|title=Chilcot report: 2003 Iraq war was 'unnecessary', invasion was not 'last resort' and Saddam Hussein was 'no imminent threat'|author=Leon Watson|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref><ref name="BBCReport">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645|title=Chilcot report: Findings at a glance|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|work=BBC News}}</ref>

A [[CNN]] report noted that the United States-led interim government, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] lasting until 2004 in Iraq had lost $8.8&nbsp;billion in the [[Development Fund for Iraq]]. In June 2011, it was reported by CBS News that $6&nbsp;billion in neatly packaged blocks of $100&nbsp;bills was air-lifted into Iraq by the George W. Bush administration, which flew it into Baghdad aboard C‑130 military cargo planes. In total, the ''Times'' says $12&nbsp;billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate flights by May 2004, all of which has disappeared. An inspector general's report mentioned that "'Severe inefficiencies and poor management' by the Coalition Provisional Authority would leave no guarantee that the money was properly used", said Stuart W. Bowen,&nbsp;Jr., director of the [[Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction]]. "The CPA did not establish or implement sufficient managerial, financial, and contractual controls to ensure that funds were used in a transparent manner."<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.audit/ Audit: U.S. lost track of {{Nowrap|$9 billion}} in Iraq funds] Monday, 31 January 2005.

In July 2019, [[Michael P.

Many explosive devices, including improvised explosives ([[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]) and explosively-formed projectiles (EFPs), used by insurgents are claimed by Lynch to be Iranian-made or designed.

According to two unnamed U.S.&nbsp;officials, [[the Pentagon]] is examining the possibility that the [[Karbala provincial headquarters raid]], in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five U.S.&nbsp;soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians. In a speech on {{Nowrap|31 January 2007}}, Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq<ref>{{cite news |title=Al-Maliki: Iraq won't be battleground for U.S., Iran |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.main/ |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202013010/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.main/ |archive-date=2 February 2007}}</ref> and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by U.S.&nbsp;forces in the northern Iraqi city of [[Irbil]] on {{Nowrap|11 January}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran involvement suspected in Karbala compound attack |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Baer |author-link=Robert Baer |title=Are the Iranians Out for Revenge? |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1583523,00.html?cnn=yes |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2007}}</ref>

In 2011, U.S. ambassador [[James Franklin Jeffrey]] stated "that Iranian proxies accounted for roughly a quarter of US combat casualties in Iraq—around 1,100 deaths and many thousands more injuries."<ref>{{cite news |last=Chulov|first=Martin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/qassem-suleimani-iran-iraq-influence|title=Qassem Suleimani: the Iranian general 'secretly running' Iraq|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>

A 1,300-page US Army Iraq War study, released in January 2019, concluded that “At the time of this project’s completion in 2018, an emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor" and that the outcome of the war triggered a "deep skepticism about foreign interventions” among America's public opinion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/01/18/armys-long-awaited-iraq-war-study-finds-iran-was-the-only-winner-in-a-conflict-that-holds-many-lessons-for-future-wars/|title=Army's long-awaited Iraq war study finds Iran was the only winner in a conflict that holds many lessons for future wars|last=South|first=Todd|date=4 February 2019|website=Army Times|language=en-US|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>
