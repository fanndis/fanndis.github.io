"'''Me, Myself and I'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] from her debut solo [[studio album]] ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). It was written by Beyoncé, [[Scott Storch]] and Robert Waller and produced by Storch with [[guitar]] played by musician Aaron Fishbein. Beyoncé decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song as the third single; the song was sent by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the United States on October 19, 2003. "Me, Myself and I" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song about dealing with a philandering partner and learning from the consequences.

The live performance of the song from ''[[The Beyoncé Experience Live]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] in 2009, and the original version earned Beyoncé, Storch and Waller an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP Pop Music Award]]. "Me, Myself and I" peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The single reached the top twenty in Australia, the Netherlands, Scotland and the United Kingdom.

Directed by [[Johan Renck]], the accompanying [[music video]] follows the plot of the song's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse. "Me, Myself and I" was part of Beyoncé's set lists on the [[Dangerously in Love Tour]] (2003), [[Verizon Ladies First Tour]] (2004), [[The Beyoncé Experience]] (2007), the [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009&ndash;10) and [[The Formation World Tour]] (2016)

==Background and release==
After the release of her former group [[Destiny's Child]]'s third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), Beyoncé worked on her debut solo studio album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.

According to [[Neil Drumming]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "Me, Myself and I" is similar to "[[Say My Name]]" (2000), in terms of "&nbsp;...&nbsp;its specificity and earnestness&nbsp;...&nbsp;" and the way Beyoncé defends "&nbsp;...&nbsp;her chastity [a]gainst some greedy boy&nbsp;...&nbsp;."<ref name="ent">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,459850,00.html|title=Dangerously in Love (2003)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Neil Drumming|accessdate=February 11, 2011|date=June 27, 2003}}</ref> This was echoed by James Poletti of [[Yahoo!

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
[[Mark Anthony Neal]] of [[PopMatters]] said: "Beyoncé sounds assured" in her singing of the song and "&nbsp;...&nbsp;lacking any of the 'shrill overboard' that describes some of the 'melisma fits'&nbsp;...&nbsp;that marked earlier vocal efforts."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Neal |first=Mark Anthony |title=BEYONCÉ: Dangerously in Love  |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/beyonce-dangerously.shtml |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=July 11, 2003 |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref> Ryan Schreiber of [[Pitchfork Media]] noted the song as the "most notable 80s throwback" of the album, as its "augmented chords" call to mind [[Patti Austin]] and [[James Ingram]]'s 1983 single "Baby Come to Me" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s 1983 single "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", or a decelerated version of "[[Baby Be Mine (Michael Jackson song)|Baby Be Mine]]", from Jackson's 1982 album, ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.<ref name="pit">{{Cite web |last=Schreiber |first=Ryan |title=Beyoncé: "Me, Myself and I" |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/36418-me-myself-and-i |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]].

{{cquote|The video and actually the song I wrote it for the ladies because I know sometimes we go through relationships and they don’t work out and we blame the guy or we blame the other girl or we blame ourselves. And we have this inner voice that kind of leads us in the right direction. We can always depend on ourself and the song 'Me, myself and I' and I wanted the video to reflect that. I was trying to think of something different, something fresh and new visually to do.|author=Beyoncé|source=<ref name="trl"/>}}

When some of the behind-the-scenes footage was used in a ''[[Black Entertainment Television|BET Access Granted]]'' special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown shooting did not appear in the finished video.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Access Granted: Episode Info – Beyonce |date=December 13, 2003 |url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/access-granted/beyonce.1/  |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012045518/http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/access-granted/beyonce.1/ |archive-date=October 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she wanted it to be and she had to reshoot most of it.<ref name="trl"/> In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.<ref name="trl"/>

The footage follows the plot of the song's theme, in which Beyoncé deals with a cheating boyfriend when she finds his mistress' red panties. From the aftermath of the affair, Beyoncé discards her old possessions that reminds her of her boyfriend (e.g. scratching his car). She goes back to the hotel, removes her jewellery and makeup and laments over her ex-boyfriend in the bathtub. As a result, Beyoncé cuts her hair short into a bob as she dresses up and goes out in her bare feet. The events in the video are played in reverse. Beyoncé said that this music video was the hardest video she had ever made. ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'''s Patrick DeMarco described the video as "sexy".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.phillymag.com/gphilly/2013/06/24/alert-beyonces-dangerously-love-album-turns-10/|title=We're Getting Old Alert: Beyonce's 'Dangerously in Love' Album Turns 10|work=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]|first=Patrick|last=DeMarco|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> In 2004, the video was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video|Best R&B Video]] at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=2004 MTV Video Music Awards: Winner Predictions |date=July 25, 2004 |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/2004-mtv-video-music-awards-winner-predictions/158 |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref> In May 2010, an alternative version of the video was released; this does not show the events in reverse and includes some of the scenes that were not included in the first version.<ref name="rapup1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/05/29/video-beyonce-me-myself-and-i-alternate-version/ |title=Video: Beyoncé – 'Me, Myself and I' (Alternate Version) |work=Rap-Up  |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate= February 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Live performances==
During the [[Verizon Ladies First Tour]] which also featured [[Alicia Keys]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Tamia]], Beyoncé performed "Me, Myself and I" in [[New York City]] to an audience of over 20,000.<ref name="mtvb1"/> Before singing, she told the audience that she was going to sing about "a relationship horror story". She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress.<ref name="mtvb1"/> During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was "is all I got in the end". She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back, and continued singing, then told the audience that she wrote the song for "each and every one of y'all!".<ref name="mtvb1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486349/beyonce-steals-show-at-ladies-first.jhtml |title=First Among Equals: Beyonce Steals The Show At Ladies First |publisher=[[MTV News]].
