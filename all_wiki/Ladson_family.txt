The '''Ladson family''' is an American family of English descent that belonged to the [[planter class|planter]] and merchant elite of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] from the late 17th century. The family were among the first handful of European settlers of the English colony of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] in the 1670s, where the family quickly became part of the [[American gentry]].<ref>Walter B. Edgar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC South Carolina: A History]'', p. 48</ref> The Ladson were large plantation owners and wealthy merchants in Charleston, and owned hundreds of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] until slavery was abolished in 1865. [[James Ladson]] served in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and became lieutenant-governor of South Carolina, while his son [[James H. Ladson]] was part of the Charleston oligarchy that was influential in launching the [[American Civil War]]. The President of the European Commission [[Ursula von der Leyen]], who lived under the name Rose Ladson in her 20s, is a descendant of the family through her American great-grandmother.

==History==

The family is descended from John Ladson (died 1698), a [[Quaker]]<ref>Edward P. Lawton, ''A saga of the South'', p. 58, 1965</ref> from [[Brigstock]] in England; he emigrated to [[Barbados]] and then in 1679 to the newly established Charles Town (Charleston) in Carolina where he acquired land. When he moved to Charles Town John Ladson brought with him a single black slave from Barbados, 21-year old Sara.<ref>Jennifer L. Morgan, ''Laboring Women: Reproduction and Gender in New World Slavery'', p. 124</ref> He married Mary Stanyarne, who had been born in Barbados around 1667 to parents also from Brigstock. Described as being of undistinguished background in Barbados, John Ladson rose to become a leading member of the Royal Assembly in Carolina in the 1690s and his descendants accumulated great wealth in Carolina in the 18th and 19th centuries as major plantation owners with hundreds of slaves.<ref>Richard S. Dunn, ''Sugar and Slaves: The Rise of the Planter Class in the English West Indies'', p. 114</ref>

John and Mary Ladson were the parents of Captain Thomas Ladson (1690–1731), who was the father of William Ladson (1725–1755). William Ladson married Anne Gibbes (1730–1755), a daughter of [[John Gibbes (Carolina)|John Gibbes]] and a granddaughter of governor [[Robert Gibbes]] as well as a great-granddaughter of the first European settler of Carolina [[Henry Woodward (colonist)|Henry Woodward]]. The [[Gibbes Museum of Art]] is named for her family.

William Ladson and Anne Gibbes were the parents of the American revolutionary and Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina [[James Ladson]] (1753–1812).<ref>''Biographical directory of the South Carolina Senate, 1776–1985'', vol. 2, p. 881, University of South Carolina Press, 1986, {{ISBN|9780872494800}}</ref> James Ladson married [[Judith Smith Ladson|Judith Smith]], a daughter of the slave trader [[Benjamin Smith (slave trader)|Benjamin Smith]] and granddaughter of the largest slave trader in British North America, Englishman [[Joseph Wragg]] formerly of London; she was also a descendant of English colonial governors [[Thomas Smith (governor of South Carolina)|Thomas Smith]], [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]], [[James Moore (governor)|James Moore]] and [[John Yeamans]]. Judith's first cousin [[Elizabeth Wragg Manigault|Elizabeth Wragg]] was married to [[Peter Manigault]], the wealthiest man in the British North American colonies by the 1770s. Judith was related to some of the former [[Lord proprietor|lords proprietors]] of Carolina.

Among the children of James and Judith Ladson were the businessman and plantation owner [[James H. Ladson]] (1795–1868), who owned over 200 slaves and served as the [[Denmark|Danish]] consul in South Carolina. He was married to Eliza Ann Fraser, a daughter of the merchant and plantation owner Charles Fraser (1782–1860), who owned the Bellevue plantation near the Pocotaligo river and whose grandfather John Fraser had moved from Scotland to South Carolina around 1700. 

The Ladson family has numerous descendants who were prominent in American society—especially in South Carolina—as businesspeople, lawyers, and politicians. Through her American great-grandmother Mary Ladson Robertson, [[Ursula von der Leyen]] is a descendant of two of the children of lieutenant governor James Ladson, including James H. Ladson, and lived briefly under the name Rose Ladson.<ref>[https://www.zeit.de/2016/26/ursula-von-der-leyen-brexit-london "Mehr gelebt als studiert"], Die Welt, 20 June 2016</ref>

Ladson Street and Ladson House in Charleston, the town of [[Ladson, South Carolina]] and the [[Ladson Formation]] are named after the family.<ref>Mary Preston Foster, ''Charleston: A Historic Walking Tour'', Arcadia, 2005, {{ISBN|0738517798}}</ref>
