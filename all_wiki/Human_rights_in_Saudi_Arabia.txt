'''Human rights in Saudi Arabia''' are a topic of concern. The Saudi government, which enforces [[Sharia|sharia law]] under the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of the [[House of Saud]], have been accused of and denounced by various international organizations and governments for violating multiple human rights within the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41731.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2004|author=Unattributed|date=February 28, 2005|accessdate=2008-06-02|publisher=US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour}}</ref> The [[totalitarian]] regime ruling the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is consistently ranked among the "worst of the worst" in [[Freedom House]]'s [[Freedom in the World|annual survey of political and civil rights]].<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/Worst%20of%20the%20Worst%202010.pdf Worst of the Worst 2010.

== Background ==
Saudi Arabia is one of approximately 30 countries in the world with [[judicial corporal punishment]]. In Saudi Arabia's case this includes [[amputation]]s of [[hands]] and feet for [[robbery]], and [[flogging]] for lesser crimes such as "sexual deviance" and [[drunkenness]]. In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court abolished the flogging punishment from its system and replaced it with jail time and fines.<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52420307|title=Saudi Arabia to abolish flogging - supreme court|date=2020-04-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> In the 2000s, it was reported that women were sentenced to lashes for adultery; the women were actually victims of rape, but because they could not prove who the perpetrators were, they were deemed guilty of committing adultery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=3899920|title=Exclusive: Saudi Rape Victim Tells Her Story|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> The number of lashes is not clearly prescribed by law and is varied according to the discretion of judges, and ranges from dozens of lashes to several hundred, usually applied over a period of weeks or months.  In 2004, the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the [[amputations]] and [[flogging]]s it carries out under [[Sharia]]. The Saudi delegation responded defending "legal [[traditions]]" held since the inception of Islam 1,400 years ago and rejected interference in its legal system. Saudi Arabia later abolished the punishment of flogging, and replaced it by jail time or fines or both.<ref name="BBC News"/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|url=http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/592301|title=Saudi Arabia to eliminate flogging punishment|date=2020-04-24|website=Saudigazette|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

The courts continue to impose sentences of flogging as a principal or additional punishment for many offences. At least five defendants were sentenced to flogging of 1,000 to 2,500 lashes. Flogging was carried out in prisons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-saudi-arabia-2013?page=3 |title=Annual Report: Saudi Arabia 2013 &#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref> In April 2020, flogging is no longer carried out as a punishment in the Saudi court system.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 2009, Mazen Abdul-Jawad was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and five years in prison for bragging on a Saudi TV show about his sexual exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/6269161/Saudi-man-jailed-and-gets-1000-lashes-for-talking-about-sex.html|title=Saudi man jailed and gets 1,000 lashes for talking about sex|date=7 October 2009|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/150525|title=Saudi man gets 1,000 lashes and five years for TV sex boasts|website=www.thesundaily.my|access-date=2016-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060151/http://www.thesundaily.my/node/150525|archive-date=2016-11-23}}</ref>

In 2014, Saudi blogger [[Raif Badawi]]'s sentence was increased to 1,000 lashes and ten years' imprisonment after he was accused of [[apostasy]] in 2012. The lashes were due to take place over 20 weeks. The first round (50) were administered on January 9, 2015, but the second round has been postponed due to medical problems. The case was internationally condemned and put a considerable amount of pressure on the Saudi legal system.

In October 2015, [[United Kingdom|UK]] pensioner and cancer victim Karl Andree, then 74, faced 360 lashes for home brewing alcohol.  His family feared the punishment could kill him. However, he was released and returned home in November that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34513096 |title=UK pensioner Karl Andree faces 360 lashes over Saudi wine |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref>

In 2016, a Saudi man was sentenced to 2,000 lashes, ten years in prison and a fine of 20,000 [[Saudi riyal|riyal]]s (US$5,300) for making tweets critical of Islam, and denying the existence of [[God]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/saudi-arabia-sentenced-man-to-10-years-in-prison-and-2000-lashes-for-atheist-tweets|title=Saudi Arabia Sentenced a Man to 10 Years in Prison and 2,000 Lashes for Atheist Tweets}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/saudi-court-sentences-man-to-10-years-2000-lashes-for-atheist-tweets/|title=Saudi court sentences man to 10 years, 2,000 lashes for atheist tweets|website=PBS NewsHour}}</ref>

In September 2018, the official Twitter account of the Saudi Arabia prosecutors issued a warning to punish those who share anything satirical on social media that "affects public order, religious values and public morals". The punishment included a five-year prison term and a fine of 3 million riyals (US$800,000). The government of Saudi Arabia arrested a few intellectuals, businessmen and activists last year for the same reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/jail-sentence-steep-fines-for-disrupting-saudi-public-order|title=Saudi Arabia Threatens Prison Time for Satire 'Disturbing Public Order'|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>

==Torture==
While Saudi Arabia's Criminal Procedure Code prohibits "[[torture]]" and "undignified treatment" (art. 2) in practice torture and using torture to extract forced confessions of guilt remains common.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/|title=Saudi Arabia 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/26/un-committee-against-torture-review-saudi-arabia|title=UN Committee against Torture: Review of Saudi Arabia|date=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2017/5/2/hundreds-of-tortured-bangladeshi-women-flee-saudi-arabia|title=Hundreds of 'tortured' Bangladeshi women flee Saudi Arabia|first=Diana|last=Alghoul}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/19/indonesia.saudi.maid.abuse/index.html|title=Indonesian maid dies after abuse in Saudi Arabia, rights group says|author1=Kathy Quiano |author2=Moni Basu|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/blog/saudi-arabia-s-record-torturing-those-who-dare-critique-it|title=Saudi Arabia's Record of Torturing Those Who Dare to Critique It|website=Human Rights First}}</ref>

According to [[Amnesty International]], security forces continued to torture and ill- treat detainees to extract confessions to be used as evidence against them at trial. According to the organization, 32 defendants accused of spying for Iran were subjected to torture and forced to confess. Detainees were held incommunicado and denied access to their families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/| title= SAUDI ARABIA 2016/2017 |access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref>

In 2018, a UN panel that visited Saudi Arabia on the kingdom's invitation to conduct an inspection, revealed that the country has been systematically using anti-terror laws to justify torture.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-torture-political-dissidents-anti-terror-laws-un-mohammad-bin-salman-a8388226.html|title=Saudi Arabia using anti-terror laws to detain and torture political dissidents, UN says|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref> The report found that Saudis, who have been exercising their right to freedom of expression peacefully and calmly in the kingdom, have been systematically persecuted by the authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/un-accuses-saudi-arabia-of-using-anti-terror-laws-to-justify-torture|title=UN accuses Saudi Arabia of using anti-terror laws to justify torture|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>

Prince [[Faisal bin Abdullah Al Saud]], the former head of the [[Saudi Red Crescent Authority|Saudi Red Crescent Society]] and son of late [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]], was arrested on March 27, 2020 and has since been kept under incommunicado detention. In November 2017, Prince Faisal was first arrested and put under [[arbitrary detention]] in the famous [[2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge|Ritz-Carlton purge]]. He was later released in December 2017 on the condition of handing over his assets. Currently, the authorities keeping him under detention refuse to share his whereabouts or status of health and well-being, as per [[Human Rights Watch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/09/saudi-arabia-prince-incommunicado-detention|title=Saudi Arabia: Prince in Incommunicado Detention|accessdate=May 8, 2020|website=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>

On 19 November 2020, based on the report exclusively shared by human rights charity, Grant Liberty, the Independent reported human rights violations endured by women’s rights activists and political prisoners in Saudi Arabian jails. Reportedly, the jailed women’s rights activists and political prisoners have been sexually assaulted, tortured and died as a result of their injuries in Saudi Arabian detention cells. According to the research, 20 prisoners were arrested for political crimes, 5 of whom have already been put to death, while the remaining 13 have been facing death penalty. The report was released days before Saudi Arabia hosted G20 summit with female empowerment a fundamental part of its agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-prisoners-womens-human-rights-b1745241.html|title=Women activists, political prisoners 'sexually assaulted, tortured and executed in Saudi Arabia' jails|accessdate=19 November 2020|website=Independent}}</ref>

A spokesman for the [[National Society for Human Rights]], an organisation which is funded by the Saudi Government, said that the number of executions is rising because crime rates are rising, that prisoners are treated humanely, and that the [[Decapitation|beheading]]s deter crime, saying, "Allah, our creator, knows best what's good for His people...Should we just think of and preserve the rights of the murderer and not think of the rights of others?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=45BQVYBAZNEV1QFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2007/07/16/wsaudi116.xml|title=Saudis prepare to behead teenage maid|author=Tim Butcher|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2008-10-14 | location=London | date=July 16, 2007|author-link=Tim Butcher}}</ref>

[[Saudi Arabian police]] and immigration authorities routinely abuse people who are stopped or detained, especially workers from developing countries. Earlier in November 2013, the authorities received criticism for the way they have planned and handled the crackdown on illegal workers.

Saudi Arabia is a notable destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of [[slavery|slave labour]] and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]], and many other countries voluntarily travel to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants or other low-skilled labourers, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude.<ref name="factbook">{{cite web|title=Trafficking In Persons|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2196.html|website=cia.gov|publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>

Women, primarily from Asian and African countries are trafficked into Saudi Arabia for commercial sexual exploitation; others were kidnapped and forced into prostitution after running away from abusive employers.<ref name="factbook"/>

===Sexual slavery===
Some Saudi men have also used contracted "temporary marriages" in countries such as Mauritania, Yemen, and Indonesia as a means by which to sexually exploit migrant workers. Females are led to believe they are being wed in earnest, but upon arrival in Saudi Arabia subsequently become their husbands' sexual slaves, are forced into domestic labor and, in some cases, prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2014/226806.htm |title=Saudi Arabia |publisher=State.gov |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref> Prostitution is illegal in Saudi Arabia.

They also urged the EU states to minimize their representation at the G20 [[Riyadh]] Summit that year, so that the rights violations by Saudi don’t get legitimized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/eu-parliament-condemns-human-rights-abuses-saudi-migrant-camps/ |title= EU Parliament condemns human rights abuses in Saudi migrant camps after Telegraph investigation |accessdate= 8 October 2020 |website= The Telegraph}}</ref>

The Saudi government has gone further than stopping Christians from worshipping in publicly designated buildings to even raid private prayer meetings among Christian believers in their own homes.  On December 15, 2011, Saudi security forces arrested 35 Ethiopian Christians in Jeddah who were praying in a home, beating them and threatening them with death. When the Ethiopian workers' employers asked security forces for what reason they were arrested, they said "for practising Christianity".  Later, under mounting international pressure, this charge was changed to "mixing with the opposite sex".

===Shia Muslims===
{{Main|Anti-Shi'ism#Saudi Arabia|Shia Islam in Saudi Arabia}}
The [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shia Muslims because of the funding of the Wahabbi ideology which denounces the Shia faith.<ref name=syedjaffar/>

In 1988 [[fatwas]] passed by the country's leading cleric, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz|Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz]]  denounced the [[Shias]] as [[Apostates from Islam|apostates]]. Another by [[Abdullah Ibn Jibreen|Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin]], a member of the Higher Council of Ulama is on record as saying

<blockquote>Some people say that the rejectionists (''Rafidha'', i.e. Shia) are Muslims because they believe in God and [[Muhammad|his prophet]], pray and fast. But I say they are heretics. They are the most vicious enemy of Muslims, who should be wary of their plots. They should be boycotted and expelled so that Muslims be spared their evil.<ref name=HAKIM>[https://www.mail-archive.com/osint@yahoogroups.com/msg35080.html&#91;osint&#93; A top Saudi cleric declares Shiites to be infidels, calls on Sunnis to drive them out] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 22 Jan 2007 (originally in iht.com)</ref></blockquote>

According to Vali Nasr, al-Jibrin's sanctioning of the killing of Shia was reiterated in Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002.

According to a 2009 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, Shia citizens in Saudi Arabia "face systematic discrimination in religion, education, justice, and employment".<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/09/02/saudi-arabia-treat-shia-equally Saudi Arabia: Treat Shia Equally]|hrw.org| 2009/09/02</ref>

[[Saudi Arabia]] has  no [[Shia]] cabinet ministers, [[mayors]] or police chiefs, according to another source, [[Vali Nasr]], unlike other countries with sizable [[Shia]] populations (such as [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]]). Shia are kept out of "critical jobs" in the armed forces and the security services, and not one of the three hundred [[Shia]] girls' schools in the Eastern Province has a [[Shia]] principal.

Pakistani columnist Mohammad Taqi has written that "the Saudi regime is also acutely aware that, in the final analysis, the Shiite grievances ... stem from socioeconomic deprivation, as a result of religious repression and political marginalization bordering on [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]."<ref>{{cite news|author=Mohammad Taqi |title=Saudi Arabia: the prized domino |date=March 10, 2011 |newspaper=Daily Times (Pakistan) |url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/editorial/10-Mar-2011/comment-saudi-arabia-the-prized-domino-dr-mohammad-taqi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211020/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/editorial/10-Mar-2011/comment-saudi-arabia-the-prized-domino-dr-mohammad-taqi |archive-date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>

Testifying before the US [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]], [[Ali al-Ahmed]], Director of the [[Institute for Gulf Affairs]], stated

<blockquote>Saudi Arabia is a glaring example of [[religious apartheid]]. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curriculums, and all religious instructions in media are restricted to the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jewish and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, there has not been a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of [[Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] instructs its students that Shia Islam is a [[Jewish conspiracy]].<ref>Human Rights in Saudi Arabia: The Role of Women, Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Testimony of Ali Al-Ahmed, Director of the Saudi Institute, June 4, 2002.</ref></blockquote>

In November 2014 at [[al-Dalwah]] village in the eastern province of [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|al-Ahsa]], three unknown masked gunmen [[2014 al-Dalwah attack|opened fire]] at a Husseiniya, or Shi'ite religious center, killing eight and injuring dozens.<ref name="HRW killings">{{cite web|last1=Coogle|first1=Adam|title=Dispatches: Killings of Saudi Shia a Wakeup Call|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/06/dispatches-killings-saudi-shia-wakeup-call|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref>

While the government and the official media and religious establishment strongly condemned the attack, a handful of articles in the Saudi press argued that the attack "had not come out of nowhere", that there was anti-Shi'ite incitement in the kingdom on the part of "the religious establishment, preachers, and even university lecturers – and that it was on the rise".<ref name=memri>{{cite web|title=Saudi Columnists: There Is Anti-Shi'ite Incitement In Our Country|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/8330.htm|accessdate=14 December 2014|date=December 10, 2014}}</ref>

The Saudi government has refused to allow Shia teachers and students exemption from school to partake in activities for the [[Day of Ashura]], one of the most important religious days for Shia Muslims which commemorates the martyrdom of [[Muhammad]]'s grandson, [[Husayn bin Ali]].<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>  In 2009, during Ashura commencements, Shia religious and community leaders were arrested.

Shiites are banned from building mosques and other religious centers, and are forced to perform Friday prayers in  homes (Al-Hassan).  In the Eastern city of [[Al-Khobar]], whose population is predominately Shia, there are no Shia mosques.<ref name="HRW">[https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/09/02/saudi-arabia-treat-shia-equally Saudi Arabia: Treat Shia Equally]" | [[Human Rights Watch]] |  3 Sept. 2009.</ref>  Saudi Arabia's religious police mandate prayers and all those in public buildings during prayer time are required to stop what they are doing to pray.  Because there are minor differences between the way that Shiites and Sunnis pray and between prayer times, Shiites are forced to either pray the Sunni way or take a break from work.

In 2009 a group of Shiites on their way to perform [[hajj]] pilgrimage (one of the five pillars of Islam that all able-bodied Muslims are required to perform once in their lives) in Mecca were arrested by Saudi religious police.<ref name="HRW"/> Between February 20 and 24, 2009, Shia pilgrims from the heavily Shia Eastern Province who had come to Medina for the anniversary of the prophet Muhammad's death clashed with Sunni religious police at the Baqi' cemetery over doctrinal differences concerning the rituals surrounding commemoration of the dead. Security forces shot a 15-year-old pilgrim in the chest, and an unknown civilian stabbed a Shia religious sheikh in the back with a knife, shouting "Kill the rejectionist [Shia]." The authorities denied that anyone had been wounded, and played down the ensuing arrests of Shia pilgrims.<ref name="HRW"/>

Religious police have arrested Shia Women in the Eastern Province for matters as trivial as organizing classes for Quranic studies and selling clothing for religious ceremonies as if they were involved in political activities which are not allowed in KSA.<ref name="HRW"/>

In the  eastern city of Dammam  where three quarters of the 400,000 residents are Shia, there are no Shia mosques or prayer halls, no Shia call to prayer broadcast on TV, and no cemeteries for Shia.

Much of education in Saudi Arabia is based on Sunni Wahhabi religious material.  From a very young age, students are taught that Shiites are not Muslims and that Shiism is a conspiracy hatched by the Jews, and so Shiites are worthy of death.<ref name=al-Hassan>[http://tryme3000.20megsfree.com/mystory2-eng.htm Discrimination against Shia Muslims in Saudi Arabia: The Old and New Reality] by Dr. Mohamed J.

The government has restricted the names that [[Shias]] can use for their children in an attempt to discourage them from showing their identity. [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] textbooks are hostile to Shiism, often characterizing the faith as a form of heresy worse than [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].

Because anti-Shia attitudes are engrained from an early age, they are passed down from generation to generation.  This prejudice is found not only in textbooks, but also within the teachers in the classroom, and even in the university setting.<ref name=al-Hassan/>  (Wahhabi) teachers frequently tell classrooms full of young Shia schoolchildren that they are heretics.<ref name=syedjaffar>{{cite web|last=syedjaffar|title=The Persecution of Shia Muslims in Saudi Arabia|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1015700|work=August 4, 2013|publisher=CNN Report|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="Nasr 2006, p. 237">Nasr, ''Shia Revival'', (2006), p. 237</ref> Teachers who proclaim that Shiites are atheists and deserve death have faced no repercussions for their actions, barely even receiving punishment.<ref name=al-Hassan/>  At a seminar about the internet, held in King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology, professor Dr. Bader Hmood Albader explained that the internet was beneficial to society, but that there were many Shia websites claiming to be Muslim websites, which needed to be stopped.<ref name=al-Hassan/>

The conviction was based on "his participation in protests in 2011 over discrimination against [[Shia Islam|Shia]]" and "his communication with international media and human rights organizations", supporting the right of Shia in the country. On 10 January, Abdulaziz al-Shubaily, a human rights activist, was re-sentenced to eight years in prison, an eight-year ban on using social media after his release and an eight-year travel ban; the charges included "his incitement against the government and judiciary" as well as "his communication with international agencies against his government".

The 1990s marked a slow period of political liberalization in the kingdom as the government created a written constitution, and the advisory ''[[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Council]]'', the latter being an appointed delegation of Saudi scholars and professionals that are allowed to advise the king.  Some political dissidents were released from prison, after agreeing to disband their political parties.  In 2005, adult male citizens were allowed to vote for some municipal seats, although plans for future elections, which may include adult women, have been put on hold indefinitely.

[[List of political parties in Saudi Arabia|Political parties are banned]], but some political dissidents were freed in the 1990s on the condition that they disband their political parties.  Today, only the [[Green Party of Saudi Arabia]] remains, although it is an illegal organization.  Trade unions are also banned, but the government has granted permission for Saudi citizens to form some private societies, which are allowed to do some humanitarian work within the kingdom.

Public demonstrations or any public act of dissent are forbidden.  In April 2011, during the [[2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests]], the kingdom made it a crime to publish any criticism harming the reputation of government or religious leaders, or which harms the interests of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/23/136570798/saudis-impatient-for-kings-promised-reforms|title=Saudis Impatient For King's Promised 'Reforms'|accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref>

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] annual report 2016, [[Saudi Arabia]] continued to prosecute pro-reform activists and dissidents.

== LGBT rights ==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|Death penalty for homosexuality}}
[[LGBT]] [[Human rights|rights]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] are unrecognized. [[Homosexuality]] is frequently a taboo subject in Saudi Arabian society and is punished with imprisonment, [[corporal punishment]] and [[capital punishment]]. [[Transgender]] people are generally associated with homosexuality and doctors are banned by the Saudi Ministry of Health from giving [[hormone replacement therapy]] to transgender people seeking to medically transition.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} In 2017, two [[transgender]] Pakistanis were tortured to death by Saudi police.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/transgender-pakistani-saudi-arabia-tortured-death-amna-meeno-11-custody-lgbt-rights-human-a7607446.html|title=Two transgender Pakistanis 'tortured to death' by police in Saudi Arabia}}</ref>

== HIV/AIDS ==
By law, all Saudi citizens who are infected with HIV or AIDS are entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy and employment opportunities. However, most hospitals will not treat patients who are infected, and many schools and hospitals are reluctant to distribute government information about the disease because of the strong taboos and stigma that are attached to how the virus can be spread.<ref>{{cite news

Until the late 1990s, information on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] was not widely available to the public, but this has started to change.  In the late 1990s, the government started to recognize [[World AIDS Day]] and allowed information about the disease to be published in newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret.  However, in 2003 the government announced the number of known cases of HIV/AIDS in the country to be 6,700, and over 10,000 in June 2008.<ref>{{cite news
