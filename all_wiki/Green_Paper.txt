In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/85 |title=Chapter 4: The Internet Threat |work=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind |first=James |last=Boyle |access-date=2010-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727121107/http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/85 |archive-date=2010-07-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a '''green paper''' is a tentative government report and consultation document of [[policy]] proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82326.stm |title=Green Paper |publisher=BBC News | date=1 September 2008}}</ref> Green papers may result in the production of a [[white paper]]. They may be seen as [[grey literature]].

==Canada==
A green paper in [[Canada]], like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted [[legislation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/green-paper |title=Green Paper |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/green-papers/ |title=Green Papers |publisher=The UK Parliament}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careandsupportreform/what-green-paper|title=What is a Green Paper?|date=2009-06-18|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref>

==European Union==
A green paper released by the [[European Commission]] is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==International==
When following a definite article, 'The Green Paper' may also refer to the environmental newspaper by the same name. The Green Paper describes itself as "A fresh news site dedicated to timely and well-researched environmental news."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpapr.com |title=The Green Paper |publisher=[[The Green Papr]]}}</ref>


==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of [[defence policy]] in [[Australia]] culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on [[copyright]] was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the "[[knowledge economy]]" and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf this document]). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.
