=== Seat allocation ===
As is tradition before each session of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General drew lots to see which member state would occupy the first seat in the General Assembly Chamber, with the other member states following according to the English translation of their name. For the 74th Session, [[Ghana]] was selected to sit in the first seat by Secretary-General [[António Guterres]]. This same order is followed in the six main committees, as well as other United Nations bodies.<ref name="Election"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unhcr.org/5028f5129.pdf |title=63rd Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme: Information Note |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |publisher=United Nations |access-date=14 September 2019}}</ref>

=== General Debate ===
{{Main|General Debate of the seventy-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly}}

Each member of the General Assembly will have a representative speaking about issues concerning their country and the hopes for the coming year as to what the UNGA will do. This is an opportunity for the member states to opine on international issues of their concern. The General Debate will occur from the 24th of September to the 30th of September 2019.

The order of speakers is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities will have a chance to speak at the end of the debate if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and will be translated by the [[United Nations translators]]. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for supranational bodies.<ref name="data">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/5028f5129.pdf |format=PDF |title=63rd Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme, Geneva, 1 - 5 October 2012 |publisher=Unhcr.org |accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref>
