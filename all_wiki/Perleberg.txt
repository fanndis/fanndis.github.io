'''Perleberg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpɛʁləˌbɛʁk|lang|De-Perleberg2.ogg}}) is the capital of the district of [[Prignitz]], located in the northwest of the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Brandenburg]]. The town received [[German town law|city rights]] in 1239<ref name="StadtPerlebergGeschichte" /> and today has about 12,000 inhabitants. Located in a mostly agricultural area, the town has a long history of troops being stationed here (most notably [[Prussia]]n) and as an administrative center for local government.

==Geography==
[[Image:Roland Perleberg.JPG|upright|thumb|left|16th century [[Roland (statue)|Roland statue]]]]
Perleberg is located in the heart of the district of Prignitz, about halfway between the two largest German cities Berlin and Hamburg.<ref name="StadtPerlebergLiebenswert" /> It is surrounded by the municipalities [[Karstädt]] to the north-west, [[Gross Pankow (Prignitz)]] to the north-east, [[Plattenburg]] to the south-east; the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Ämter]]'' [[Bad Wilsnack/Weisen]] in the south, [[Lenzen-Elbtalaue]] in the west; and the town of [[Wittenberge]] to the south-west.

The [[Stepenitz (Elbe)|Stepenitz]] flows from northeast to southwest through Perleberg. The town's historic center is built on an island between two arms of the river.

==History==
One of the city's oldest buildings is St James's church. First mentioned in 1294,<ref name="HoepfnerJacobykirche" /> it was frequently altered and extensively remodelled in the 1850s.<ref name="KirchenkreisJacobi" /> In [[German language|German]], it is called the ''Jakobikirche'', and therefore sometimes mistakenly called ''St Jacob's'' in English.

In the 14th century the town was on its height as part of the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1523 it was the muster point for an army assembled by [[Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector Joachim I]] in support of his brother-in-law [[Christian II of Denmark]]'s attempt to recover his throne. The [[Thirty Years' War]] caused serious damage to the town: of 3,500 inhabitants, only 300 survived.<ref name="StadtPerlebergGeschichte" /> The mayor responsible for rebuilding the city after this period was Georg Krusemarck.

On November 25, 1809,  [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] disappeared in Perleberg. Later accounts of the incident exaggerated the circumstances to such an extent that the disappearance is sometimes claimed to have been caused by [[paranormal phenomena]].<ref name="Dash2010Bathurst" />
