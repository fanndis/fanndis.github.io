The original name was Fruit, Garden and Home from 1922 to 1924. The name was changed in 1925 to Better Homes and Gardens.

''Better Homes and Gardens'' is one of the "[[Seven Sisters (magazines)|Seven Sisters]]", a group of women's service magazines.

==Brand extension==
The Meredith Corporation publishes a number of books on [[home economics]] and gardening under the BH&G brand, the best known of which is the ''Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book'', colloquially known as the "''Red Plaid''" book. Now in its 15th edition (published in August 2010), the ''Red Plaid'' was originally published in 1930. Meredith also publishes the ''New Junior Cookbook'' for children learning to cook.

The magazine's title was used by Meredith's [[real estate]] arm, which was sold and then called [[GMAC Real Estate]]. In October 2007, Meredith entered a 50-year [[licensing]] agreement with [[Realogy Corporation]] to license the Better Homes and Gardens name to [[Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate]]. The company is based in [[Parsippany]], New Jersey, and has offices across the country.

Meredith's broadcasting division began producing the television program ''[[Better (TV series)|Better]]'' in the fall of 2007, which is a lifestyle show which has a mix of content from Meredith's various magazine titles (included BH&G), consumer advice and celebrity interviews. The program currently airs on stations owned by Meredith, [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]], [[Fisher Communications|Fisher]] and [[LIN TV]] groups.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/01/meredith_speeds_up_better_roll.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715075717/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/01/meredith_speeds_up_better_roll.php |archive-date=2009-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some Meredith-owned stations produce their own local edition of ''Better''.
