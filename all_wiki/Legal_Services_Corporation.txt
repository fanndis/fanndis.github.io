The '''Legal Services Corporation''' ('''LSC''') is a publicly funded, [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit corporation]] established by the [[United States Congress]]. It seeks to ensure equal access to justice under the law for all Americans by providing funding for civil [[legal aid in the United States|legal aid]] to those who otherwise would be unable to afford it. The LSC was created in 1974 with bipartisan congressional sponsorship and the support of the [[Nixon administration]], and LSC is funded through the congressional appropriations process.

LSC has a board of eleven directors, appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], that set LSC policy. By law the board is bipartisan; no more than six members can come from the same party.<ref name="lsc-board">{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/board.php | title=Board of Directors Profiles | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref> LSC has a president and other officers who implement those policies and oversee the corporation's operations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/office_president.php | title=Office of the President | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref>

For Fiscal Year 2018, LSC had an appropriation of $410 million in the federal budget to fund civil legal aid.<ref name="2018 budget">{{cite web|title=Inspector General Report 2018|url=https://lsc-live.app.box.com/s/abvut8a9c9wlj9eqiv7emx7dp42672ud|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> LSC is the largest single funder of civil legal aid in the country, distributing more than 90 percent of its total funding to 132 independent nonprofit legal aid programs.<ref name="2013 budget">{{cite web|title=LSC Funding {{!}} LSC – Legal Services Corporation: America's Partner for Equal Justice|url=http://www.lsc.gov/congress/lsc-funding|publisher=Legal Services Corporation|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>

For Fiscal Year 2019, Congress appropriated $415 million to LSC to fund civil legal aid.

== History ==
===Background===
LSC is one of the organizational descendants of the former [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO).<ref name="brock-96">{{cite book | last=Brock | first=David | authorlink=David Brock | title=[[The Seduction of Hillary Rodham]] | publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-684-83451-0}} pp. 96–97.</ref> The [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]], a key part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] vision, established the OEO. From 1965 on, starting with a budget of $1 million,<ref name="brock-96"/> the OEO created 269 local legal services programs around the country,<ref name="time072875">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913362,00.html | title=Corporation for the Poor | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1975-07-28 | accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> such as [[California Rural Legal Assistance]],<ref name="time072875"/> which made a name for themselves suing local officials and sometimes stirring up resentment against their federal funding.<ref name="time072875"/>

By the early 1970s the [[Nixon administration]] began dismantling the OEO; funding for legal services for the poor began to wither, and supporters looked for an alternative arrangement.<ref name="time072875"/> In 1971 a bipartisan congressional group, including Senators [[Ted Kennedy]], [[William A. Steiger]], and [[Walter Mondale]], proposed a national, independent Legal Services Corporation;<ref name="nyt031871">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/18/archives/bipartisan-group-in-congress-urges-a-legal-services-corporation-for.html| title=Bipartisan Group in Congress Urges a Legal Services Corporation for the Poor | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1971-03-18 | accessdate=2008-02-03 | format=fee required}}</ref> at the same time, administration officials such as Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and chief domestic advisor [[John Ehrlichman]] were proposing their own somewhat similar solution.<ref name="nyt031871"/>

===Creation and the Ford era===
The idea behind the LSC was to create a new corporate entity that would be funded by Congress but run independently, with eleven board members to be appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.<ref name="time072875"/>

LSC was created by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 ({{USPL|93|355}}).<ref name="lsc-act">{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/laws/act.php | title=LSC Act and Other Statutes | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | date=1974-07-25 | accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>  The LSC Act contains certain rules and restrictions regarding what LSC grantees can do.<ref name="lsc-act"/>  The initial budget was set at $90 million.<ref name="brock-96"/>

Naming and confirmation of the first LSC board was delayed by inaction and opposition,<ref name="time072875"/> but by July 1975, President [[Gerald R. Ford]] had named and the Senate had approved the first board, with [[Cornell University Law School]] Dean [[Roger Conant Cramton]] as its first chair.<ref name="time072875"/> South Dakota legal services lawyer ad prosector [[Bill Janklow]] was another member of the initial board.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://janklowlaw.com/our-attorneys/bill-janklow/ | title=Bill Janklow (1939–2012) | publisher=Janklow Law Firm | access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>

Debate existed from the start among the board members as to whether LSC's role should be the same as the OEO's of using lawsuits and other means to attack broad underlying difficulties of the poor or whether the focus should be more narrowly defined to addressing small, specific situations.<ref name="brock-96"/><ref name="time072875"/> The LSC Act said that the organization was to pursue "equal access to justice," but Cramton wrote that while the law was intended to proscribe the blatantly-political objects of the 1960s OEO's work, it was worded ambiguously.<ref name="brock-96"/>

===Carter era===
In December 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] nominated [[Hillary Rodham]] to the board of directors of the LSC,<ref name="carter-nom"/> for a term to expire in July 1980.<ref name="carter-nom">{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=7026 | title=Jimmy Carter: Nominations Submitted to the Senate, Week Ending Friday, December 16th, 1977 | work=American Presidency Project | accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> Rodham, an attorney with [[Rose Law Firm]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and the wife of [[Arkansas Attorney General]] [[Bill Clinton]], had a background in children's law and policy and had worked in providing legal services for the poor while at [[Yale Law School]].

During Rodham's Senate confirmation hearings, she subscribed to the philosophy that LSC should seek to reform laws and regulations that it viewed as "unresponsive to the needs of the poor."<ref>Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', p. 98.</ref>  Rodham was successful in getting increases in Congressional funding for LSC, stressing its usual role in providing low-income people with attorneys to assist them in commonplace legal issues and framed its funding as being neither a liberal nor a conservative cause.<ref>Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', p. 99–100.</ref> By her third year on the LSC board, Rodham had gotten the LSC budget tripled.<ref name="brock-105">Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', pp. 104–105.</ref> Opposition to LSC during this time came from both Republican Congressman [[James Sensenbrenner]], who favored a "[[judicare]]" approach of compensating private lawyers for work done for the poor,<ref name="brock-105"/> and [[The Conservative Caucus|Conservative Caucus]] head [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]], who objected to LSC representing [[gay]]s.<ref name="brock-105"/>

===Reagan era===
LSC was strongly opposed by some political groups. As [[Governor of California]] in the 1960s, [[Ronald Reagan]] had advocated elimination of all federal subsidies for free legal services to the poor in civil cases,<ref name="time112381"/> and had tried to block a grant to [[California Rural Legal Assistance]] in 1970.<ref name="time112381"/> Indeed, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine would state, "Of all the social programs growing out of the Great Society, there is none that Ronald Reagan dislikes more than the Legal Services Corporation."<ref name="time100383">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926255,00.html | title=An Organization at War with Itself | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1983-10-03 | accessdate=2008-02-03 | first1=David S. | last1=Jackson | first2=Michael S. | last2=Serrill}}</ref> The CRLA's executive director would characterize Reagan's attitude towards the organization as akin to that of [[Darth Vader]].<ref name="time100383"/>

When President Reagan took office in January 1981, he attempted to eliminate the LSC by zero funding it.<ref name="time112381"/> Supporters of LSC rallied to defend it; [[American Bar Association]] president [[W. Reece Smith, Jr.]] led 200 lawyers to Washington to press its case.<ref name="ejm30"/>  In response to Reagan's clear intentions against the LSC, the Coalition for Legal Services was formed to lobby outside, but on behalf of the LSC, which showed support via grant recipients.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Benson, Bruce Verfasser|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/960840934|title=Enterprise of Law Justice Without the State|isbn=978-1-59813-071-3|oclc=960840934}}</ref>

At the same time, the Reagan administration had named six other board members as recess appointments.<ref name="nyt010182"/> In February 1982, the Carter-appointed members of the previously existing board filed suit to against the recess appointments, claiming they were unlawful and that they should be enjoined from holding meetings.<ref name="brock-110">Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', pp. 110–111.</ref>  Rodham hired fellow [[Rose Law Firm]] associate [[Vince Foster]] to represent her in the case<ref name="brock-110"/> and to seek a restraining order against Reagan.<ref name="bernstein-book"/> The Reagan nominees may <!-- not sure Bernstein is right on this --> have been prohibited from meeting with the Legal Service Corporation before confirmation.<ref name="bernstein-book"/>

In September 1983 the [[General Accounting Office]] found that in early 1981, LSC officials and its local affiliates had used federal funds in assembling opposition to Reagan's efforts to eliminate LSC, and that this use had been in violation of the LSC Act's restrictions against such political activity.<ref name="nyt092183">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50F12F73A5C0C728EDDA00894DB484D81 | title=Ex-Legal Aid Officials Accused of Fund Abuse | author=Stuart Taylor Jr. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1983-09-21 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>  Such actions against the LSC Act were not crimes, and the GAO report did not claim any crimes had taken place.<ref name="nyt092183"/> The investigation had been initiated by the LSC in 1983 ordering a series of "raids" on their own offices to attempt to discover evidence of questionable actions taken by the LSC in 1981,<ref name="time100383"/> prompting ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to declare LSC "an organization at war with itself."<ref name="time100383"/>

===George H. W. Bush era===
Overt White House hostility towards LSC ended with the [[George H. W. Bush administration]], with calls for level funding rather than decreases.<ref name="ejm30"/> Under board chair George Wittgraff, LSC began to ease relations with private lawyers and with state grantees.<ref name="ejm30"/>  In fiscal 1992, LSC saw a funding increase back to $350 million.<ref name="ejm30"/>

===Clinton era===
Hillary Rodham's husband, the aforementioned Bill Clinton, took office as U.S. President in January 1993. The first two years of the [[Clinton administration]] saw more growth for LSC, as former chair McCalpin returned to the board and the previous former chair Hillary was  now [[First Lady of the United States]].<ref name="ejm30"/>  Funding rose to a high mark in absolute terms of $400 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1995.<ref name="ejm30"/>

Things turned upon the advent of the [[Republican Revolution]].<ref name="ejm30"/> In fiscal 1996, once the Republican party had taken over Congress the year prior, LSC had its funding cut again, from $400 million to $278 million.<ref name="wapo060196">{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-785874.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015155/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-785874.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2011-05-17 | title=Attacked as Left-Leaning, Legal Services Suffers Deep Cuts | author=William Booth | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=1996-06-01 | accessdate=2008-02-07 | format=fee required}}</ref>  A new set of much more extensive restrictions were added to LSC grantees. The organization's supporters expressed disappointment that the Clinton administration did not make LSC a critical priority in its budget battles with the Republican Congress, especially given Hillary Clinton's former role in it.<ref name="wapo060196"/>

As part of a comprehensive "[[welfare reform]]" of federal welfare laws beginning in 1996, most significantly the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], Congress imposed restrictions on the types of work that LSC grantee legal services organizations could engage in. For example, LSC-funded organizations could no longer serve as counsel in class action lawsuits<ref name="wapo060196"/> challenging the way public benefits are administered. Additionally, LSC grantees faced tightened restrictions on representing immigrants, specifically those illegally in the country.<ref name="wapo060196"/> However, in 2001, the restriction on welfare advocacy was ruled unconstitutional in ''[[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez]]''.

However, non-LSC funded organizations are not subject to these restrictions leading the legal services community to adopt a two-track approach: LSC restricted counsel taking on individual clients but not engaging in class actions, and non-restricted counsel (using private donor funding) both taking on individuals as well as engaging in otherwise restricted litigation. Poverty lawyers in both tracks still work together where they can, being careful not to run afoul of LSC restrictions.

===George W. Bush era===
In 2004, veteran [[Legal Aid Society]] attorney [[Helaine M. Barnett]] was named President of the LSC.<ref name="BanksNYLJ">{{cite news |last1=Banks |first1=Steve |title=Helaine Barnett |url=https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202625031932/helaine-barnett/ |publisher=The New York Law Journal |date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

According to LSC's 2009 report "Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans," all legal aid offices nationwide, LSC-funded or not, were together able to meet only about 20 percent of the estimated legal needs of low-income people in the United States.<ref>[http://www.lsc.gov/press/documents/LSC%20Justice%20Gap_FINAL_1001.pdf ''Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans''], pages 4 and 9. Legal Services Corporation, September 2005.</ref>

For 2007, LSC had a budget of some $350 million.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/FY07app.php | title=FY 2007 Appropriation | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053103/http://www.lsc.gov/about/FY07app.php | archive-date=2008-02-18 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Obama era===

Craig Fugate and [[American Red Cross]] President and CEO [[Gail J. McGovern]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 22, 2010.]]

In 2009 during the [[Obama administration]], the LSC was on the path to getting a $50 million increase in its $390 million budget.<ref name="cbs072809">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/28/eveningnews/main5194529.shtml | title=Legal Services Investigated for Waste | author=Sharyl Attkisson | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

However, the LSC came under criticism from Senator [[Charles Grassley]], who said, "There's just a lot of money being wasted," citing several [[General Accounting Office]] and [[Inspector General]] reports.<ref name="cbs072809"/>

By fiscal 2011, the annual budget amount for the LSC was $420 million.<ref name="lthskj">{{cite web|url=https://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2011/02/obama-proposes-legal-services-corp-budget-increase.html|title=Obama Proposes Legal Services Corp. Budget Increase|website=The BLT: The Blog of Legal Times}}</ref>  In early 2011, House now-majority Republican proposed a $75 million reduction in that current-year amount, while Obama's suggestion budget proposed a $30 million increase for the subsequent year.<ref name="lthskj"/>

On December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY 2015 that includes $375 million for LSC.<ref name="2013 budget"/>

===Trump era===
Since 2017, the Trump administration has called for the elimination of funding for LSC.<ref>[https://www.lsc.gov/media-center/press-releases/2019/legal-services-corporation-optimistic-about-bipartisan-support "Legal Services Corporation Optimistic About Bipartisan Support in Congress Despite White House Proposal to Defund"], ''Legal Services Corporation '', March 18, 2019</ref> LSC has strong bipartisan support on behalf of robust funding for LSC. External stakeholders, including members of the legal and business communities, state attorneys general, and law school deans across the country send letters to the House and Senate appropriations committees advocating for robust funding for LSC. They include:
* 252 General Counsels from some of the largest American businesses, including Apple, American Express, Google, Walmart, General Motors, and Walt Disney.
* 181 law firms from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
* The Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators.
* 41 bipartisan state Attorneys General.
* 167 Deans of law schools.

In addition, 209 members of the House of Representatives signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding for LSC, the largest number in history, and 46 bipartisan Senators signed a similar letter in support of funding for LSC.

==Restrictions==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2019}}
Due to the up-and-down nature of LSC's political history, there are many restrictions on lobbying, advocacy, and general impact work which apply to LSC-funded organizations.  Here they are broken into categories of expressly forbidden, forbidden with LSC funds, and expressly permitted.

'''Recipients may never:'''
* Publicly identify LSC or the recipient with any partisan or nonpartisan political activity or a candidate for office, or encourage others to do so (45 CFR 1608.4)<ref name="lsc.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.lsc.gov/node/1778|title=LSC Regulations|website=LSC - Legal Services Corporation: America's Partner for Equal Justice}}</ref>
* Staff attorneys may not use their position or authority to influence elections or coerce anyone to contribute to a political cause (45 CFR 1608.5)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Run for office (45 CFR 1608.5(c))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Register, transport to polls, or otherwise assist voters in election-related activities (45 CFR 1608.6)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Use non-LSC funds for anything prohibited by the LSC Act, unless it is specifically allowed in 45 CFR 1610.4, 1610.6, or 1610.7 (45 CFR 1610.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Lobby. In the language of the regulation, recipient organizations may not attempt to influence the passage or defeat of a bill, constitutional amendment, initiative, referendum, executive order, or provision which appropriates funds or defines the functions or authority of LSC or the recipient (45 CFR 1612.3).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* This includes using resources from a recipient organization to support lobbying efforts on employees' own time – don't even take an envelope! (45 CFR 1612.3(c))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* The caveat is that organizations may lobby at the State and local level with non-LSC funds regarding funding for their organization (45 CFR 1612.6(f)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Grassroots lobby (45 CFR 1612.4)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* During working hours or with resources provided by an LSC-funded organization, employees may not participate or encourage others to participate in public demonstrations, boycotts, picketing, or strikes. This must be on personal time (45 CFR 1612.7(a)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Employees of recipients may never engage in rioting or civil disturbances, actions which violate a court-imposed injunction, or take part in illegal activity of any kind (45 CFR 1612.7(b))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Support or conduct training sessions which advocate particular public policies, encourage or facilitate prohibited political activities, disseminate information about such policies or activities, or train participants to engage in prohibited activities (45 CFR 1612.8(a))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Form or organize an association, labor union, or other similar organization. This is distinct from holding informational meetings for attorneys or forming organizations of eligible clients for advice on service delivery (both of which are allowed). You may also advise your clients on the legal procedures for forming these types of organizations themselves, and even help them with documents like bylaws (45 CFR 1612.9).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Represent clients in criminal proceedings (unless you are appointed by a court or a situation arises out of your representation of the client in a civil case) (45 CFR 1613)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Initiate or participate in a class action suit (45 CFR 1617.3), although you may represent individuals who want to remove themselves from the suit or have not received the settlement ordered by the court (45 CFR 1617.2(b)(2)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Provide legal assistance to ineligible aliens (45 CFR 1626.3; see 45 CFR 1626.5 to judge eligibility), unless the alien in question is, or is the parent of someone subject to battery or extreme cruelty by a spouse, parent, or member of their spouse's or parent's family residing in the same household. In this case, non-LSC funds must be used for the case (45 CFR 1626.4).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Participate in any activity related to the redistricting of a legislative, judicial, or elective district at any level of government (45 CFR 1632.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Defend clients in eviction proceedings from a public housing unit if that client has been charged with or convicted of the sale, distribution, or manufacture of controlled substances, or of possession with the intent to sell or distribute (45 CFR 1633.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Participate in civil litigation on behalf of an incarcerated person, as plaintiff or defendant, nor any administrative hearing challenging the conditions of incarceration (45 CFR 1637.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Represent, nor refer for representation by another recipient any client gained through in-person, unsolicited advice (45 CFR 1638.3)
* Participate in legislation, lobbying, or rulemaking involving efforts to reform Federal or State welfare systems (45 CFR 1639.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* [[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez|LSC v. Velasquez (2001)]] was considered a victory by those trying to chip away at LSC regulations. It didn't change the overall prohibition, but it deleted the restriction barring litigation which attempts to change welfare law in the context of representing an individual client (45 CFR 1693.4).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>

'''Recipients may, with non-LSC funding:'''

In many of their regulations, LSC only states activities that their funding cannot be used to support. In 45 CFR 1610.2(c)–(h), however, several different types of non-LSC funding are defined:

:“(c) IOLTA funds means funds derived from programs established by State court rules or
:legislation that collect and distribute interest on lawyers' trust accounts.
:(d) Non-LSC funds means funds derived from a source other than the Corporation.
:(e) Private funds means funds derived from an individual or entity other than a
:governmental source or LSC.
:(f) Public funds means non-LSC funds derived from a Federal, State, or local government or
:instrumentality of a government. For purposes of this part, IOLTA funds shall be treated in
:the same manner as public funds...
:(h) Tribal funds means funds received from an Indian tribe or from a private nonprofit
:foundation or organization for the benefit of Indians or Indian tribes."<ref name="lsc.gov"/>

With these definitions in mind, 45 CFR 1610.4 goes on to specify what each type of funding can be used for:
* Tribal funds can be used for whatever purpose they were granted (45 CFR 1610.4(a))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Public, IOLTA, and Private funds can be used for whatever purpose they were granted, as long as it doesn't violate LSC's regulations (45 CFR 1610.4(b)-(c))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Non-LSC funds generally can be used to assist clients who are not financially eligible under LSC guidelines (45 CFR 1610.4(d))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>

In addition, the category of general non-LSC funds may be used to:
* Support a political party, association, candidate, ballot measure, initiative, or referendum – but not during working hours or at the recipient's office location (45 CFR 1608.3(b))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Respond to a written request from an agency, legislative body, elected official, etc. to participate in rulemaking or to provide oral or written testimony in order to provide information which may include analysis and/or comments on legislation (45 CFR 1612.6(a))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* However, you can only provide your testimony to the requesting party or parties – it cannot be distributed to a wider audience (45 CFR 1612.6(b));<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* You may not arrange for the written request (45 CFR 1612.6(c));<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* And, you must report this activity to LSC (45 CFR 1612.6(d)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Recipients may also provide oral or written comments to an agency in a public rulemaking session without having been requested (45 CFR 1612.6(e))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Lobby at the State or local level regarding the recipient's funding (45 CFR 1612.6(f))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Assist an ineligible alien or his or her child who has been subjected to battery and/ or extreme cruelty by the alien's parent, spouse, or a member of the parent's or spouse's family residing in the same household as the alien. To qualify, the alien him- or herself cannot have participated in the abuse, and the representation must be related to preventing or ending the abuse (45 CFR 1626.4(a)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Comment in a public rulemaking proceeding or respond to a written request for testimony in a legislative session or committee meeting concerning welfare reform (45 CFR 1639.5)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Participate in legal activity which seeks to obtain or compel an individual or institution to provide or assist with euthanasia or assisted suicide (45 CFR 1643.3) or a "nontherapeutic abortion" (term not defined) (LSC Act §1007(b)(8)<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=https://www.lsc.gov/node/1638|title=LSC Act|website=LSC - Legal Services Corporation: America's Partner for Equal Justice}}</ref> or the 1996 Appropriations Act §504(a)(14))<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3019eas/pdf/BILLS-104hr3019eas.pdf |title=Amendment papers |date=March 19, 1996 |website=www.gpo.gov |format=PDF |access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>
* Participate in legal activity seeking to desegregate elementary or secondary schools (LSC Act §1007(b)(9))<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
* Participate in legal activity relating to violation(s) of the Military Selective Service Act or desertion from the Armed Forces of the United States (LSC Act §1007 (b)(10))<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

'''Recipients may, with any funding:'''
* Accept fee-generating cases in situations in which local pro bono attorneys or the referral service are not viable options (45 CFR 1609.3)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* In terms of accounting, fees garnered from these services must go into the same category as the recipient's LSC grant in the same proportion that LSC funds supported the activity (versus other funds) (45 CFR 1609.4)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
:* This regulation was changed in Section 533 of the 2010 Appropriations Act from a statutory prohibition (which had been implemented in the 1996 Appropriations Act Section 504(a))
* Accept reimbursement from clients for out-of-pocket expenses related to their case, if the client has agreed to pay ahead of time and in writing (45 CFR 1609.5(a))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Represent eligible clients at the administrative level (45 CFR 1612.5(a))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Initiate or participate in litigation challenging a governmental agency's rules, regulations, policies, etc. (45 CFR 1612.5(b))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Communication with an agency to receive information (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(2))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Informing clients, other recipients, etc. about new or proposed statutes, executive orders, or administrative regulations. Note that legislation is not listed here (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(3)).<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Contact LSC to comment on its rules (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(4))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Advise a client of his or her right to contact an elected official (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(6))<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
* Provide assistance to eligible aliens (45 CFR 1626.5; also lists criteria for eligibility), as well as specific categories of other aliens (45 CFR 1626.10 and 1626.11)<ref name="lsc.gov"/>
