'''Community policing''', or '''community-oriented policing''' ('''COP'''), is a [[Police#Strategies|strategy of policing]] that focuses on building ties and working closely with members of the community. It is a philosophy of full-service policing that is highly personal, where an officer patrols the same area for a period of time and develops a partnership with citizens to identify and solve problems.<ref>Bertus, Ferreira.

==History==
[[File:Robert_Peel_Portrait.jpg|right|thumb|205x205px|[[Robert Peel]]'s ideas are sometimes considered a precursor to modern community policing.]]
Some authors have traced the core values of community policing to Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s 1829 [[Peelian principles|Peelian Principles]], most notably [[John Alderson (police officer)|John Alderson]], the former Chief Constable of [[Devon and Cornwall Police]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Alderson|first=John|title=Policing freedom : a commentary on the dilemmas of policing in western democracies|date=1979|publisher=Macdonald and Evans|isbn=978-0712118156|location=Estover [England]|oclc=7275569}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Alderson|first=John|title=Law and disorder|date=1984|publisher=H.

Kenneth Peak has argued that community policing in the United States has evolved through three generations: innovation (1979 to 1986), diffusion (1987 to 1994) and institutionalization (1995 to present day).<ref name=":82">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco0000unse_i3n7|title=Encyclopedia of community policing and problem solving|others=Peak, Kenneth J., 1947-|isbn=9781452276113|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=855731847|url-access=registration}}</ref>  He says the ''innovation'' ''period'' occurred following the civil unrest of the 1960s, in large part as an attempt to identify alternatives to the reactive methods developed in mid-century. This era was also saw the development of such programs as the [[broken windows theory]] and [[problem-oriented policing]].<ref name=":82" /> Peak says the ''diffusion era'' followed, in which larger departments began to integrate aspects of community policing, often through grants that initiated specialized units. Lastly, the ''institutionalization era'' introduced mass application of community policing programs, in not only large departments but also smaller and more rural ones.<ref name=":82" />

==Method==
[[File:Day_127_-_Cycle_all_out_day_(8717395182).
|Police in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. Community policing movements have led to a revival of foot patrols.]]
Many community-oriented police structures focus on assigning officers to a specific area called a “beat”, during this officers become familiar with that area through a process of “beat profiling.”<ref>{{Citation|last=Prenzler|first=Tim|title=Community safety, crime prevention, and 21st century policing|date=2020-10-30|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003028918-21|work=Australian Policing|pages=283–298|place=Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2021.|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-003-02891-8|access-date=2020-10-30|last2=Sarre|first2=Rick}}</ref> The officers are then taught how to design specific patrol strategies to deal with the types of crime that are experienced in that beat.<ref name="watson12">Watson, Elizabeth M, Alfred R Stone and Stuart M DeLuca. Strategies for Community Policing. Print. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall Inc, 1998.</ref>

These ideas are implemented in a multi-pronged approach using a variety of aspects, such as broadening the duties of the police officer and individualizing the practices to the community they're policing; refocusing police efforts to face-to-face interactions in smaller patrol areas with an emphasized goal of preventing criminal activity instead of responding to it; solving problems using input from the community they're policing; and, finally, making an effort to increase service-oriented positive interactions with police.<ref name="Cordner, G. W. 2010 pp. 432-4492">Cordner, G. W. (2010). Community Policing Elements and Effects. In R. G. Dunham, & G. P. Alpert, Critical Issues in Policing (pp. 432-449).

Common methods of community-policing include:<ref name="watson12" />

* Encouraging the community to help prevent crime by providing advice, talking to students and encouraging [[neighborhood watch]] groups. 
* Increased use of foot or bicycle patrols.
* Increased officer accountability to the communities they serve.
* Creating teams of officers to carry out community policing in designated neighborhoods.
* Clear communication between the police and the communities about their objectives and strategies.
* Partnerships with other organizations such as government agencies, community members, nonprofit service providers, private businesses and the media.
* Moving toward some decentralizing of the police authority, allowing more discretion among lower-ranking officers, and more initiative expected from them.

=== The Dallas Experiment ===
In 1971, the leadership of the Dallas Police Department wanted to redefine the role of Dallas police officers by identifying the basic needs of the Dallas community and restructuring police services to respond to those needs. The department sought to increase the number of minority police officers and to place those officers in minority communities. The department and foundation aimed to show that individual police officers have as much personal stake in providing better services as do members of the communities in which officers work.<ref name=":72">{{Cite web|title=Community Policing|url=https://www.policefoundation.org/projects/community-policing/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=National Police Foundation|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== The Cincinnati Team Policing Experiment ===
Experimentation with team policing was recommended in the [[President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice|President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice]] in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Special Message to the Congress on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. {{!}} The American Presidency Project|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-law-enforcement-and-the-administration-justice|access-date=2020-10-30|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu}}</ref> Neighborhood team policing was seen by many as a promising way to address problems of over-centralization and bureaucratization of police agencies and of an increasing sense of alienation of citizens and police. The experiment focused attention on the need for police to become closer to the community and on some of the barriers that must be overcome to achieve this goal.<ref name=":72" />

===Comparison With Traditional Policing===
Although researchers say that societies incorporate some mechanisms of social control,<ref>{{Cite book|last=A.)|first=Roberts, Simon (Simon|title=Order and dispute : an introduction to legal anthropology|year=2013|isbn=9781610271844|edition=2nd|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|oclc=841206487}}</ref> "policing" (as it is currently understood) is a very particular mechanism of control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zedner|first=Lucia|date=2005-05-03|title=Policing Before and After the Police|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1093/bjc/azi043|issn=1464-3529}}</ref> "Traditional policing" is used to describe policing styles that were predominant before modern community policing movements, or in police forces which have not adopted them. The response-centered style has also been called "[[Fire department|fire brigade]] policing" in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|author=Professor Robert Reiner, London School of Economics|date=April 2016|title=In praise of fire brigade policing: Contra common sense conceptions of the police role|url=https://howardleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/In-praise-of-fire-brigade-policing.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329184425/https://howardleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/In-praise-of-fire-brigade-policing.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2018|accessdate=29 March 2018|publisher=[[The Howard League for Penal Reform]]}}</ref> In countries with a tradition of [[Peelian principles|policing by consent]], the term "traditional policing" can be misleading. In those cases, Mike Brogden says community policing could be seen as a restoration of an earlier ideology, which had been overshadowed by reactive policing after the rise of automobiles and telecommunications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BROGDEN|first=MIKE|date=1987|title=The Emergence of the Police—The Colonial Dimension|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=4–14|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a047651|issn=1464-3529}}</ref>

The goal of traditional policing is to protect law-abiding citizens from criminals. As Jauregui notes, it reflects a "popular desire for justice and order through any means necessary."<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Jauregui|first=Beatrice|date=2013-05-07|title=Cultures of Legitimacy and Postcolonial Policing: Guest Editor Introduction|journal=Law & Social Inquiry|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=547–552|doi=10.1111/lsi.12026|issn=0897-6546}}</ref> He says police do this by identifying and apprehending criminals while gathering enough evidence to convict them. Traditional beat officers' approach on duty is to respond to incidents swiftly, and clear emergency calls as quickly as possible.<ref name=":11" /> Some researchers argue that this type of policing does not stop or reduce crime significantly; and say it is simply a temporary fix to a chronic problem where officers are often called to return to the same issue and individuals.<ref>More, Harry W. Special Topics in Policing. Cincinnati, OH: Anderson Pub., 1992. Print.</ref><ref name=":42" />

In contrast, community policing's main goal is to assist the public in establishing and maintaining a safe, orderly social environment. While apprehending criminals is one important goal of community policing, it is not the only goal. Community policing is concerned with solving the crimes that the community is concerned about by working with and gaining support from the community.<ref name=":9" /> Research indicates that the most effective methods include dialogue between police, government resources, citizens, and local business to address the problems affecting the community.<ref name="Bertus, Ferreira 1996">Bertus, Ferreira. ''The Use and Effectiveness of Community Policing in a Democracy''. Prod. National Institute of Justice. Washington, D.C., 1996.</ref> Police communicate with the community in variety of ways, including polls or surveys, town meetings, call-in programs, and meetings with interest groups. They use these connections to understand what the community wants out of its police officers and what the community is willing to do to solve its crime problem.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Sarah|date=November 2013|title=What Works in Community Policing?|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/What_Works_in_Community_Policing.pdf}}</ref>

The structure of the community policing organization differs in that police assets are refocused with the goals of specific, written rules to give more creative problem-solving techniques to the police officer to provide alternatives to traditional law enforcement.<ref name="Cordner, G. W. 2010 pp. 432-4492" />

=== In Nordic Countries and Camden, New Jersey ===
Journalist Ryan Cooper<ref>{{cite Q|Q98399923}}<!-- Ryan Cooper -->.</ref> described law enforcement in Nordic countries in terms that seem consistent with community policing.  In 2013 the city of Camden, New Jersey, with support from the state government, disbanded their city police and hired some of the officers back at lower pay into new [[Camden County Police Department]], following examples in Nordic countries.<ref name=":12" /> Camden had previously had higher than average crime rates, which have reportedly declined dramatically since the change, presumably because more people are more likely to report crime and cooperate with law enforcement.<ref name=":12" />

=== In High Conflict Zones ===
D. Scott Mann,<ref>{{cite Q|Q83933576}}<!-- D. Scott Mann -->.</ref> retired U.S. Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel, says that his troops made substantial progress against insurgents in places like Afghanistan and Columbia by embedding themselves in local, remote communities and working hard to actually protect the locals from insurgents.  Mann says they were not resisted when they initially arrive, but they were also not initially welcomed. After locals saw Mann's special forces working to understand their concerns and bleeding with them during attacks by insurgents, the locals begin to trust Mann's special forces and provide information about the insurgents that helped reduce the level of violence and make law enforcement easier, he says.<ref>{{cite Q|Q83934350}}<!-- Game Changers: Going local to defeat violent extremists -->.</ref>

==Community alienation==
Research indicates that the experience of community alienation among police officers is closely tied to the experience of ''mastery'', the state of mind in which an individual feels autonomous and experiences confidence in their ability, skill, and knowledge to control or influence external events.<ref>Wilson, Leon, "Family structure and dynamics in the Caribbean," Doctoral Dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor(1989): 1-187.</ref> Community policing requires departments to flatten their [[Hierarchical organization|organizational pyramid]] and place even more decision-making and discretion in the hands of line officers.<ref name="ankony12" /> Taylor and Fritsch say that as the level of community alienation or isolation that officers experience increases, there will be a corresponding decrease in officers' sense of mastery in carrying out their expanded discretionary role.<ref name=":0" /> Secondly, a strong sense of community integration for police officers would seem to be vital to the core community policing focus of proactive law enforcement, they say. Proactive enforcement is defined as the predisposition of police officers to be actively committed to crime prevention, community problem-solving, and a more open, dynamic quality-oriented law enforcement-community partnership.<ref name="ankony12">Ankony, Robert C., [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement"].

Research indicates that a lack of community support resulted in an increased sense of alienation and a greater degree of apathy among police officers.<ref>Berg, Bruce, Marc Gertz, and Edmond True, "Police-community relations and alienation," Police Chief, (Nov. 1984): 20-23</ref><ref>King, Barbara, "Cops and compliance-gaining: A study of the organizational realities of two cities," Doctoral Dissertation, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, (1995): 1-294</ref><ref>Mottaz, Clifford, "Alienation among police officers," ''Journal of Police Science and Administration'', (Mar. 1983):23-30</ref> A lack of community support and working in a larger populated community was associated with an increased sense of alienation and a greater degree of inactivity among police officers.<ref>Pogrebin, Mark, "Alienation among veteran police officers," ''Police Chief'' (Feb. 1987): 38-42</ref> An increased sense of alienation resulted in a greater degree of negative feelings and lethargy among police officers.

==Evaluation==
Traditionally, determining whether police or policies are effective or not can be done by evaluating the crime rate for a geographic area.<ref name=":1" /> A crime rate in the United States is determined using the FBI's "[[Uniform Crime Reports]]" (UCR) or "[[National Incident-Based Reporting System]]" (NIBRS) as well as the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ "[[National Crime Victimization Survey]]" (NCVS).<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Data Collection: National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328074613/http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245|archive-date=28 March 2015|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Crime Statistics|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/crimestats|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619020745/https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/crimestats|archive-date=2016-06-19|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref>

Community policing is more complicated than simply comparing crime rates and there is no universally-accepted criteria for evaluating community policing.<ref name="watson12" /> However, there are some structures that are commonly used. Researchers and officers say that one possible way to determine whether or not community policing is effective in an area is for officers and key members of the community to set a specific mission and goals when starting out.

The U.S. federal government continues to provide support for incorporating community policing into local law enforcement practices through funding of research such as through the National Center for Community Policing at [[Michigan State University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Publications|url=http://cj.msu.edu/programs/regional-community-policing-institute/national-center-community-policing-publications/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118015802/http://cj.msu.edu/programs/regional-community-policing-institute/national-center-community-policing-publications/|archive-date=18 November 2015|accessdate=14 Nov 2015|website=National Center for Community Policing|publisher=Michigan State University, School of Criminal Justice}}</ref> small COPS grants to local agencies, and technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Oriented Policing Series|url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022421/http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/|archive-date=2015-11-17|accessdate=14 Nov 2015|website=COPS|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Justice}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
Criminologists have raised several concerns vis-a-vis community policing and its implementation.  Many legal scholars have highlighted that the term "community," at the heart of "community policing," is in itself ambiguous.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Correia|first=Mark E.|date=2000|title=The conceptual ambiguity of community in community policing – Filtering the muddy waters|journal=Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies & Management|volume=23|issue=2|pages=218–233|doi=10.1108/13639510010333840|issn=1363-951X}}</ref> Without a universal definition of the word, it is difficult to define what "community policing" should look like.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coombs|first=Mary I.|date=1998|title=The Constricted Meaning of "Community" in Community Policing|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stjohn72&div=59&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|journal=St. John's Law Review|volume=72|pages=1367–1375}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=HERBERT|first=STEVE|date=2001|title=Policing the Contemporary City: Fixing Broken Windows or Shoring up Neo-Liberalism?|journal=Theoretical Criminology|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=445–466|doi=10.1177/1362480601005004003|issn=1362-4806}}</ref>

Others have remained skeptical of the political ambition behind community policing initiatives.  For example, in 1984 [[Peter Waddington]] cautioned that the "largely uncritical acceptance with which [the notion of community policing] has been welcomed is itself a danger. Any proposal, however attractive, should be subjected to careful and skeptical scrutiny."<ref name="Ferreira-criticisms22">{{Cite web|title=THE USE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY POLICING IN A DEMOCRACY|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/policing/use139.htm|access-date=2018-10-25|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}</ref> In particular, Waddington voiced concern that community policing was merely a restoration of the "bobby on the beat" concept, which had nostalgic appeal because it was less impersonal than the officer "flashing past" in a police car. He said that the former was a "romantic delusion", because "there was never a time when the police officer was everyone's friend, and there will never be such a time in the future." He also believed that order could only be maintained by the community itself, and not by the police alone.  

Similarly, C. B. Klockars and David Bayley both argue that community policing is unlikely to bring fundamental change to how police officers work, with Klockars calling it "mainly a rhetorical device".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhetoric of Community Policing|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=115748|access-date=2018-10-29|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}</ref><ref name="Ferreira-criticisms22" /> Unlike Klockars, Steven Herbert believe that community policing is proposing a fundamental change to policing, but says that it would be a difficult one to achieve. He says the progressive and democratic ethos of shared governance inherent in community policing runs counter to central elements in police culture and more widespread understandings of crime and punishment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Herbert|first=Steven Kelly|url=https://archive.org/details/citizenscopspowe0000herb|title=Citizens, cops, and power : recognizing the limits of community|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226327303|oclc=61240533}}</ref> Charles P. McDowell proposed in 1993 that because community policing was a radical departure from existing ideology, implementing it would take time.<ref name="Ferreira-criticisms22" />

Other criticisms revolve around the potential efficacy of community policing. David Bayley has argued that enacting community policing policies may lead to a reduction in crime control effectiveness, maintenance of order in the face of violence, increase in bureaucratic and governmental power over community affairs, increases in unequal treatment, and an erosion of constitutional rights.<ref>{{Cite book|last=H.|first=BAYLEY, DAVID|title=Community policing: a report from the devil's advocate.|publisher=COMMUNITY POLICING-RHETORIC OR REALITY PP. 225-237|oclc=976980284}}</ref>  According to Stenson,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stenson|first=Kevin|date=1993|title=Community policing as a governmental technology|journal=Economy and Society|volume=22|issue=3|pages=373–389|doi=10.1080/03085149300000025|issn=0308-5147}}</ref> there is a dilemma within community policing: when practicing community policing, police officers have the tendency of getting too involved with trying to institute "particularistic community normative standards". He says this could be in turn could be problematic, in that it could entice corruption or vigilantism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skolnick|first1=Jerome H.|last2=Bayley|first2=David H.|date=1988|title=Theme and Variation in Community Policing|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=10|pages=1–37|doi=10.1086/449142|issn=0192-3234}}</ref>
