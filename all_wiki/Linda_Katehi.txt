Chief Science Officer at Mars Inc., Harold Schmitz, called the relationship both research and innovation-based.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mars Partners for Innovation in Food, Agriculture, Health|url=http://consumergoods.edgl.com/news/Mars-Partners-for-Innovation-in-Food,-Agriculture,-Health97737|website=ConsumerGoods.EDGL.com|publisher=[[Consumer Goods Technology]]|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UC Davis and Mars, Incorporated announce plans to create first-of-its-kind innovation institute focusing on food, agriculture and health|url=http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=11022|publisher=[[UC Davis]]|accessdate=31 January 2015|date = 2014-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ortiz|first1=Edward|title=UC Davis launches food institute|url=http://www.sacbee.com/food-drink/food-science/article6595311.html|accessdate=31 January 2015|publisher=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=14 January 2015}}</ref>  Mars has pledged to contribute $40 million to the project over 10 years while UC Davis has committed to contribute $20 million over 10 years.<ref name="Mars Partnership Dollar Amounts">{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Pat|title=Food security, global agriculture focus of UC Davis symposium|url=http://www.dailydemocrat.com/general-news/20150109/food-security-global-agriculture-focus-of-uc-davis-symposium|accessdate=3 March 2015|issue=9 January 2015|publisher=[[Daily Democrat]]}}</ref>  Additionally, Katehi announced a partnership with a government agency in Chile to expand research on a global level in conjunction with the UC Davis World Food Center.<ref name="Chile Partnership Thing">{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Alan|last2=Katehi|first2=Linda|title=UC Davis, South American partnership can produce a research bounty|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article21307533.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=The Sacramento Bee|date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

Days after the announcement of the Mars partnership, Katehi and UC Davis announced that it will install a solar array on 70 acres of land south of [[Interstate 80]].  The power plant will provide 14 percent of all UC Davis's power consumption.  The array will be built in conjunction with [[SunPower]] who previously built a 4-megawatt solar array at the [[UC Davis West Village]] neighborhood, which is a net-zero community.<ref name="70 Acre Solar Array">{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=Massive solar array at UC Davis will supply 14% of campus power|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2014/09/24/massive-solar-array-at-uc-davis-will-supply-14.html|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Sacramento Business Journal|date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

Increasing the percentage of Latino students at UC Davis is a goal of the university, as stated by Katehi.  UC Davis aims to become a [[Hispanic Serving Institution]] by having at least 25% of their undergraduate student body made up of Latinos by the 2018-2019 school year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Katehi|first1=Linda|title=Diversity Leads to Success in Higher Education|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-katehi/diversity-leads-to-succes_b_5908624.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

In March, Katehi invited the public to participate in the construction of the [[Shrem Museum]] in UC Davis's Gateway District.

====Administrative leave====

On April 27, 2016, UC President [[Janet Napolitano]] placed Chancellor Katehi on investigatory administrative leave from her position as chancellor, pending the outcome of an investigation into multiple possible violations of several University of California policies.<ref name="NYT 28 April 2016"/>

According to ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]ucation'' (IHE) "Linda Katehi has held on as chancellor despite numerous controversies, but she is placed on leave over issues related to employing her daughter-in-law."<ref name="Inside Higher Ed 28 April 2016">{{cite web| url= https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/28/uc-davis-chancellor-placed-leave-over-employment-daughter-law-and-son| title= The Final Straw at UC Davis| last=  Jaschik| first = Scott| date= 28 April 2016| accessdate= 29 April 2016| website= [[Inside Higher Ed]]}}</ref>  IHE continued stating: A letter from Napolitano to Katehi said that the chancellor's daughter-in-law has received "promotions and salary increases over a two-and-a-half-year period that have increased her pay by over $50,000 and have resulted in several title changes. During that same period, you put forward a pay increase of over 20 percent and a title change for your daughter-in-law's supervisor." Further, Napolitano's letter said, the academic program that employs Katehi's son has been moved into the department where her daughter-in-law works, and "placed under her direct supervision." The letter said that it "does not appear that appropriate steps were taken to address, document or obtain approval for the fact that your son now reported to your daughter-in-law, who, in turn, was supervised by one of your direct reports." An independent investigation will now be launched, Napolitano said."<ref name="Inside Higher Ed 28 April 2016"/>

In its 28 April 2016 article entitled "Probe of nepotism, conduct and lying targets UC Davis head", the San Francisco Chronicle reported: "Katehi’s daughter-in-law, Emily Prieto-Tseregounis, was hired as an executive analyst at UC Davis in 2013, earning $77,000. In less than three years, she was promoted to assistant vice chancellor earning $130,000, said Dianne Klein, a UC spokeswoman. In February, a UC attorney advised against promoting her again, Klein said. The daughter-in-law’s boss, Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre, reports directly to Katehi, who raised de la Torre’s pay by 22 percent in July."<ref name="sfchronicle.com">{{Cite web | url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Probe-of-nepotism-conduct-and-lying-targets-UC-7382409.php |title = Probe of nepotism, conduct and lying targets UC Davis head|date = 2016-04-29}}</ref>  The San Francisco Chronicle further stated, as to 2009: "Questions swirled then about whether the new chancellor had known, in her previous job, about the improper admission of 800 under-qualified students to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a prestigious public university where Katehi was provost and oversaw admissions."<ref name="sfchronicle.com"/>

===Involvement in STEM===
In August 2011, Katehi voiced her support of the [[California STEM Learning Network]] in her Huffington Post blog.  The California STEM Learning Network, otherwise known as CLSNet, was starting in 2008 with funding provided by the [[S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].  CLSNet promotes the importance of STEM fields as well as pushes to increase the number of students graduating high school with the intent to go into STEM fields in the state of California.<ref name="HuffPo First Public Support of STEM">{{cite news|last1=Katehi|first1=Linda|title=Breakthroughs In How We Teach Science|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-katehi/science-education_b_915202.html|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=1 August 2011}}</ref>

In September 2012, Katehi was awarded a $3.725 million grant over 5 years from the [[National Science Foundation]] to establish an ADVANCE program at UC Davis, with the goal of increasing female participation in [[STEM fields|science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)]] education and careers.<ref name="Katehi lauded"/><ref name="Katehi receives"/><ref name="Chancellor-led center"/> Katehi serves as the [[principal investigator]] and chairs the project's steering committee.

=== Resumption of academic work ===
In July 2017, the ''Sacramento Bee'' reported that Katehi would begin teaching at UC Davis again in the 2017-18 [[academic year]] as a "distinguished professor". She would receive an equivalent salary to her salary as chancellor. [[Public interest]] experts criticized the move as atypical, noting that Katehi's salary would be higher than any other professor in her department, even those with full teaching loads.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article164312277.html|title=UC Davis' Linda Katehi returns to teaching, but she'll be paid like a chancellor|last=Lambert|first=Diana|date=2017-07-28|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}</ref> While UC Davis officials initially announced her position as being an engineering and gender studies professor, they revealed a few weeks later that she would only be teaching one engineering class every [[Academic quarter (year division)|academic quarter]].

==Controversies==

===University of Illinois clout scandal===
{{main|University of Illinois clout scandal}}

Before coming to UC Davis, Katehi served as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] from April 1, 2006, to June 2009. As the Provost, she oversaw all Colleges and Schools, the Library, HR, IT, facilities and was in charge of the University budget. She oversaw the admissions for UIUC during part of the time period (2003-2009) that came to be investigated under of the [[University of Illinois clout scandal]]. Katehi denied involvement, saying the "Category I" decisions were made at higher administrative levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-college-clout-ripples-19-jun19,0,487757.story|title=University of Illinois scandal ripples to California|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2011-11-21|first=Sara|last=Olkon}}</ref> That was also confirmed by the findings as described in the report published by the investigative committee.

In August 2015, a federal judge allowed a spoliation of evidence claim to proceed against the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in an action that was associated with the resignation of the Chancellor.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-08-27/judge-reinstates-motion-evidence-salaita-suit.html |title = Judge reinstates motion on evidence in Salaita suit}}</ref>  Rather than litigating the claim as to destroying evidence, the University of Illinois settled the action at cost of more than $2 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-steven-salaita-settlement-met-20151112-story.html | title=University of Illinois OKs $875,000 settlement to end Steven Salaita dispute}}</ref>

Some elected officials and fellow academics faulted Katehi for making personal profit from a firm whose practices and interests are in conflict with the values of public education that are central to the UC system; some saw the DeVry position as furthering a history of participation in ventures at odds with her responsibilities as chancellor of a public university.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article64148602.html|newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=March 4, 2016|title=Linda Katehi must explain DeVry blunder; UC must examine policy}}</ref> Katehi resigned from the board in late February 2016.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|title=Amid Public Pressure, UC-Davis Chancellor Resigns From DeVry Board|date=March 1, 2016|first=Rio|last=Fernandes|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/amid-public-pressure-uc-davis-chancellor-resigns-from-devry-board/109061}}</ref>

====John Wiley and Sons====
Katehi also served on the board of the textbook publisher [[John Wiley and Sons]], which has been criticized for the high cost of textbooks, and which has a direct interest in the textbook choices made by UC Davis. She received $420,000 (in pay and stock) from Wiley and Sons as compensation for her services from 2012 to 2014.<ref name="SB_Wiley">{{cite news|last1=Lambert|first1=Diana|title=UC Davis chancellor apologizes, will donate textbook stock to student scholarships|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article64041327.html|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=The Sacramento Bee|date=2016-03-04}}</ref> She cited correcting "the chronic lack of diversity on a number of boards" as a reason to join those boards. She served on this board with permission from the University of California.<!-- <ref>{{citation|url=http://abctell.com/uc-davis-katehi-explains-board-seats-in-letter-to-students/|title=Lightning blamed for}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Not in link given, this continually updates. -->

In March 2016, Katehi said that she would donate all stock proceeds earned while serving on Wiley's board to a UC Davis scholarship fund.<ref name="KatehiApologize"/> On July 2016, Katehi's personal spokesman Larry Kamer stated  "Given the state of events, Chancellor Katehi and her family will consider their options regarding charitable donations at the conclusion of the investigation,"<ref>http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article87169732.html</ref>

====King Abdulaziz University of Saudi Arabia====
Katehi served on the board of [[King Abdulaziz University]] of Saudi Arabia.<ref name="King Abdulaziz University website">{{cite web |url= http://iab.kau.edu.sa/Content.aspx?Site_ID=975&lng=EN&cid=223645 |title= International Advisory Board: Prof. Dr. Linda Katehi    |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | website= [[King Abdulaziz University]] | accessdate= 28 April 2016 }}</ref>
