'''Australia–New Zealand relations''', also referred to as [[Trans-Tasman]] relations, are extremely close. Both countries share a [[crown colonies|British colonial heritage]] as [[antipodean]] [[Dominion#Balfour Declaration of 1926 and Statute of Westminster|Dominion]]s and [[settler colony|settler colonies]], and both are part of the wider [[Anglosphere]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/12/04/1165080875361.html |title=NZ, Australia 'should consider merger'|date=4 December 2006 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=20 March 2008 |quote=The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs [found] "While Australia and New Zealand are of course two sovereign nations, it seems to the committee that the strong ties between the two countries – the economic, cultural, migration, defence, governmental and people-to-people linkages – suggest that an even closer relationship, including the possibility of union, is both desirable and realistic..." }}</ref> New Zealand sent representatives to the [[Federation of Australia|constitutional conventions]] which led to the uniting of the six [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] but opted not to join. In the [[Boer War]] and in both world wars, [[New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand soldiers]] fought alongside [[Australian Defence Force|Australian soldiers]]. In recent years the [[Closer Economic Relations]] [[free trade agreement]] and its predecessors have inspired ever-converging [[economic integration]]. Despite some shared similarities, the cultures of [[Culture of Australia|Australia]] and [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand]] also have their own sets of differences and there are sometimes differences of opinion which some have declared as symptomatic of [[sibling rivalry]].<ref name="Time2001">{{cite news|first=Leora |last=Moldofsky |url=http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/20010430/friends.html |title=Friends, Not Family: It's time for a new maturity in the trans-Tasman relationship |work=Time |date=30 April 2001 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316110806/http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/20010430/friends.html |archivedate=16 March 2010 }}</ref> This often [[Australia–New Zealand sports rivalries|centres upon sports]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Will |last=Swanton |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/25-years-along-kiwi-bat-sees-funnier-side-of-it/2006/01/22/1137864806682.html |title=25 years along, Kiwi bat sees funnier side of it |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=23 January 2006 |accessdate=27 June 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125507/http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/25-years-along-kiwi-bat-sees-funnier-side-of-it/2006/01/22/1137864806682.html| archivedate= 15 May 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> and in commercio-economic tensions, such as those arising from the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] and those engendered by the formerly long-standing Australian ban on New Zealand apple imports.<ref name="WTO">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/30/3080039.htm |title=Australian loses NZ apple appeal |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref>

Both countries are [[constitutional monarchies]] and [[Commonwealth realm]]s–sharing the same person as the [[sovereign]] and independent [[head of state]]–with [[parliamentary democracies]] based on the [[Westminster system]]. Their only land border defines the western extent of the [[Ross Dependency]] and eastern extent of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]. They acknowledge two distinct [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] conclusively [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] by the [[Australia–New Zealand Maritime Treaty]] of 2004.

The [[microcontinent]] [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], of which present day New Zealand represents the largest unsubmerged part, probably separated from Antarctica between 130 and 85&nbsp;million years ago and then from the separate [[Australian continent|continent of Australia]] 60–85&nbsp;million years ago<ref name="Te Ara">{{cite web |author=Keith Lewis |author2=Scott D.

Zealandia and Australia together are part of the wider regions known as Oceania and [[Australasia]]. Australia, New Zealand's [[North Island]] and the northwest of the [[South Island]] are on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], with the remainder of the South Island on the [[Pacific Plate]].

The [[History of Indigenous Australians]] on their own continent is generally thought to be rich to the extent of at least 40,000–45,000 years duration, whereas [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] [[Māori people|Māori]] arrived in [[Aotearoa]]/New Zealand in several waves by means of [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] some time before 1300.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19826595.200-rat-remains-help-date-new-zealands-colonisation.html Rat remains help date New Zealand's colonisation].

[[Abel Tasman]] in two distinct voyages in the period 1642–1644 is recorded as the first person to have coastally explored regions of the respective [[landform]]s including [[Van Diemen's Land]] – later named for him as the [[Australian state]] of [[Tasmania]]. The [[first voyage of James Cook]] stands as significant for the circumnavigation of New Zealand in 1769 and as the European discovery and first ever coastal navigation of Eastern Australia [[Australian places named by James Cook|from April to August 1770]]. The European settlement of Australia and New Zealand, then referred to as the colony of [[New South Wales]], dates from the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] into [[Cadigal|Cadi]]/[[Port Jackson]] on [[Australia Day]], 1788.

New Zealand was separated from the [[Colony of New South Wales]] in 1840, at which time its [[pākehā]] population number about 2000 descended from [[Christian missionaries]], [[seal hunt|sealers]], and [[whaling|whalers]] (as opposed to mainland Australia's much larger [[penal colony]] population).<ref>[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/history/history-immigration.cfm "New Zealand – The Youngest Country"], New Zealand Tourism</ref>

[[File:Edward Gibbon Wakefield.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] had a major influence on British plans for colonisation]]
Although it is accurate to distinguish that New Zealand was never a [[penal colony]], neither were some of the Australian colonies. In particular, South Australia was founded and settled in a similar manner to New Zealand, both being influenced by the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]].<ref>Wakefield's influence on the New Zealand Company: {{cite web|title=Wakefield and the New Zealand Company |url=http://library.christchurch.org.nz/heritage/earlychristchurch/edwardgibbonwakefield.asp |work=Early Christchurch |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318210443/http://library.christchurch.org.nz/heritage/earlychristchurch/edwardgibbonwakefield.asp |archivedate=18 March 2008 |url-status=live }} and in relation to Wakefield's connection with South Australia: {{cite web|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=758&c=3249 |title=Edward Gibbon Wakefield |work=The Foundation of South Australia 1800–1851 |publisher=State Library of South Australia |accessdate=20 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730005101/http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=758&c=3249 |archivedate=30 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Both countries experienced ongoing internal conflict concerning indigenous and settler populations, although this conflict took very different forms most sharply manifested in the [[New Zealand Wars]] and [[Australian frontier wars]] respectively. Whereas Maori iwi endured the [[Musket Wars]] of the period 1807–1839 preceding the former in New Zealand, indigenous Australians have no comparable period of the experience of warfare amongst each other employing European-introduced [[military technology|modern weaponry]] either before or after [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|their own confrontations with European settler society]].<ref name="cc"/> Both countries experienced [[Australian gold rushes|nineteenth century gold rushes]] and during the nineteenth century there was extensive trade and travel between the [[Crown colony|colonies]].<ref>There were shipping connections between relatively minor ports and New Zealand, for example "the schooner ''Huia'', which carried hardwood from [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]] on the [[Northern Rivers|north coast of New South Wales]] to New Zealand ports and softwoods in the other direction until about 1940." + "Trans-Tasman passenger shipping operated as an extension of the Australian interstate services, most intensively between Sydney and [[Wellington]], but also connecting other Australian and New Zealand ports. Most of the Australian coastal shipping companies were involved in the trans-Tasman trade at some stage" per {{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ahc.gov.au/publications/linking-nation/chapter-2.html|title=Linking a Nation: Australia's Transport and Communications 1788–1970 |chapter=Chapter 2: Ports and Shipping, 1788–1970 |publisher=Australian Heritage Commission |year=2003 |isbn=0-642-23561-9 |author=Deborah Bird Rose.}} Also illustrating the point are the many wrecks of the [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]] "scattered around New Zealand, Australia and the South Pacific, but nowhere more thickly than in Tasmania and the dangerous bar harbours of Greymouth and Westport" per {{cite web|url=http://www.nzshipmarine.com/history/companies.aspx?id=8 |title=Union Steam Ship Company – History & Photos |last=McLean |first=Gavin |work=NZ Marine History |publisher=New Zealand Ship and Marine Society |accessdate=20 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621232942/http://www.nzshipmarine.com/history/companies.aspx?id=8 |archivedate=21 June 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:Fed ccl australasia.jpg|thumb|Final meeting of the Federal Council of Australasia in 1899]]
New Zealand participated as a member of the [[Federal Council of Australasia]] from 1885 and fully involved itself among the other [[Self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] in the [[Australian Federation#The 1890 conference|1890 conference]] and [[Australian Federation#The 1891 convention|1891 Convention]] leading up to [[Federation of Australia]]. Ultimately it declined to accept the invitation to join the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] resultingly formed in 1901, remaining as a [[self-governing colony]] until becoming the [[Dominion of New Zealand]] in 1907 and with other territories later constituting the [[Realm of New Zealand]] effectively as [[Independence of New Zealand|an independent country of its own]]. In the [[1908 Olympics]], the 1911 [[Festival of Empire]] and the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]] the two countries were represented at least in sporting competition as the unified entity "[[Australasia]]".

Both continued to co-operate politically in the 20th century as each sought closer relations with the United Kingdom, particularly in the area of trade. This was helped by the development of [[Refrigerated container|refrigerated shipping]], [[Agriculture in New Zealand#Pastoral farming|which allowed New Zealand in particular]] to base its economy on the export of meat and dairy – [[Agriculture in Australia#Major agricultural products|both of which Australia had in abundance]] – to Britain.

The two nations sealed the [[Canberra Pact]] in January 1944 for the purpose of successfully prosecuting war against the [[Axis Powers]] in World War II and providing for the administration of an [[armistice]] and [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|territorial trusteeship]] in its aftermath. The Agreement foreshadowed the establishment of a permanent Australia–New Zealand Secretariat, it provided for consultation in matters of common interest, it provided for the maintenance of separate military commands and for "the maximum degree of unity in the presentation ... of the views of the two countries".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/%28LookupVolNoNumber%29/7~26 |title=Australia–New Zealand Agreement of 21 January 1944 |publisher=Info.dfat.gov.au |date=21 January 1944}}</ref>

The quantity of trans-Tasman trade increased by 9% per annum from the early 1980s through to the end of 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/new_zealand/nz_country_brief.html|title=New Zealand Country Brief – January 2008|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|date=January 2008|accessdate=21 April 2008}}</ref> with the [[Closer Economic Relations]] [[free trade agreement]] of 1983 being a major turning point. This was partially a result of Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]] in the early 1970s, thus restricting the access of both countries to their biggest export market.

In the Harriet Affair of 1834, a group of British soldiers of the 50th Regiment from Australia landed in [[Taranaki]], New Zealand, to rescue the wife and children of [[John Guard|John (Jacky) Guard]] and punish the kidnappers – the first clash between Māori and British troops.

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, both countries or their colonial precursors were enthusiastic members of the [[British Empire]] and both either sent soldiers or permitted the sending of [[military volunteer]]s to the [[Mahdist War]] in the [[Sudan]], the quelling of the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the [[Second Boer War]], the First and Second World Wars and the [[Malayan Emergency]] and [[Konfrontasi]]. Independent of the sense of Empire (or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), both nations in the second half of the twentieth century otherwise provided contingents in support of United States strategic aims in the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], and [[Gulf War]]. Whereas military personnel from both countries participated in [[UNTSO]], the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], [[INTERFET]] to [[East Timor]], the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]], [[UNMIS]] to [[Sudan]], and [[2006 Tonga riots#Operation Kaliloa|more recent intervention in Tonga]] the New Zealand government [[Opposition to the 2003 Iraq War#Official condemnation|officially condemned]] the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and stood apart from Australia in refusing to contribute any combat forces. Somewhat similarly in 1982, although without speaking in condemnation, Australia found no purpose in joining with New Zealand to support the United Kingdom in the [[Falklands War]] against [[Argentina]]<ref name="cc"/> just as New Zealand had declined to join Australia in [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] or in [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]] during the 1970s.

In the First World War, the soldiers of both countries were formed into the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). Together Australia and New Zealand saw their first major military action in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], in which both suffered major casualties. For many decades the battle was seen by both countries as the moment at which they came of age as nations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1948606.stm|title=Australians march in honour of Gallipoli|work=BBC News|date=25 April 2002|first=Phil|last=Mercer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/anzac_hist.html |title=History of ANZAC Day |publisher=[[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] |first=Dr Stephen |last=Clarke |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704044001/http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/anzac_hist.html |archivedate=4 July 2007 }}</ref> It continues to be commemorated annually in both countries on [[Anzac Day]], although since the 1960s there has been [[Anzac Day#Criticisms, protests and controversies|some questioning]] of the "coming of age" idea.

World War II was a major turning point for both countries, as they realised that they could no longer rely on the protection of Britain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=George |title=Defending New Zealand |year=2001 |url=http://www.pearsoned.co.nz |origyear=1997, 1999, 2000 |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |location=Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=0-582-73940-3 |chapter=4 |page=12}}</ref> Australia was particularly struck by this realisation, as it [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|was directly targeted by the Empire of Japan]], with [[Bombing of Darwin|Darwin bombed]] and [[Attack on Broome|Broome attacked]].

This resulted in the [[ANZUS]] pact of 1951, in which Australia, [[New Zealand–United States relations|New Zealand and the United States]] agreed to defend each other in the event of enemy attack. Although no such attack occurred until, arguably, [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], Australia and New Zealand both contributed troops to the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s.

Joint defence arrangements involving both countries include the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]], [[ANZUS]], and the [[UK-USA Security Agreement]] for intelligence sharing. Since 1964, Australia, and since 2006, New Zealand have been parties to the [[ABCA Armies|ABCA interoperability arrangement]] of national defence forces. [[ANZUK]] was a tripartite force formed by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to defend the Asian Pacific region after the United Kingdom withdrew forces from the east of Suez in the early seventies. The ANZUK force was formed in 1971 and disbanded in 1974. The [[SEATO]] anti-communist defence organisation also extended membership to both countries for the duration of its existence from 1955 to 1977.

[[File:Mawson main base.jpg|thumb|Newly constructed Main Base Hut at Denison]]

The [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] 1911–1914 established radio connection back to [[Tasmania]] via [[Macquarie Island]], surveyed [[King George V Land]] and examined the [[rock formation]]s of [[Wilkes Land]]. [[Mawson's Huts]] at [[Cape Denison]] survive to the current day as habitations at the expedition's chosen base. The expedition's [[Western Base Party]] made a number of discoveries and explored into [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]] from initial stationing in [[Queen Mary Land]]. The territorially acquisitive [[BANZARE]] expedition of 1929–1931, additionally collaborating with the UK, mapped the coastline of Antarctica and discovered [[Mac Robertson Land]] and [[Princess Elizabeth Land]].

New Zealanders in Australia previously had immediate access to [[Social Security (Australia)|Australian welfare benefits]] and were sometimes characterised as [[wikt:bludger|bludgers]]. In 2001 this was described by New Zealand Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] as a "modern myth".

As part of the stricter immigration regulations in 2001, New Zealanders must also acquire permanent residency before applying for Australian citizenship. These stricter immigration requirements have led to a drop in New Zealanders acquiring Australian citizenship. By 2016, only 8.4 per cent of the 146,000 New Zealand&ndash;born migrants who arrived in Australia between 2002 and 2011 had acquired Australian citizenship. Of this number, only 3 per cent of New Zealand&ndash;born Māori had acquired Australian citizenship. The [[Victoria University of Wellington]] researcher Paul Hamer claimed that the 2001 changes was part of an Australian policy of filtering out [[Pacific Islander]] migrants who had acquired New Zealand citizenship and were perceived to be exploiting a "backdoor access" to Australia. Between 2009 and 2016, there was a 42 per cent increase in New Zealand&ndash;born prisoners in Australian prisons.<ref name="NYT NZ fury" />

Attempts by the Queensland Government to pass a law that would allow government agencies to deny support based on residency status without it being considered discriminatory were condemned by Queensland's anti-discrimination commission as an attempt to legalise state discrimination against New Zealanders, claiming it would create a "permanent second class of people".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/7957561/Anti-Kiwi-law-slated-by-Aussie-commission |publisher=[[stuff.co.nz]] |date=16 November 2012 |title='Anti-Kiwi' law slated by Aussie commission |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> Children born to Australians in New Zealand are granted New Zealand citizenship by birth as well as Australian citizenship by descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/citizenship/become-a-citizen/by-descent|title=Become an Australian citizen (by descent)|date=28 November 2018|website=Australian Immigration, Department of Home affairs}}</ref>

[[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] figures show the number of Australians at [[List of universities in New Zealand|New Zealand tertiary institutions]] almost doubled from 1,978 students in 1999 to 3,916 in 2003. In 2004 more than 2700 Australians received student loans and 1220 a student allowance. Unlike other overseas students, Australians pay the same fees for higher education as New Zealanders, and are eligible for student loans and allowances once they have lived in New Zealand for two years.

In July 2017, the Australian Government introduced the "Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189)" which allows New Zealanders who have been Australian residents for five years to apply for citizenship after 12 months. The visa also requires applicants to maintain an annual income over A$53,900 and gives New Zealanders more access to welfare services. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders are eligible for the new visa. This new visa reflected a policy shift to prioritise non-citizen New Zealanders residing in Australian over Asian migrants from overseas. According to figures from the Australian [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs Department]] obtained by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed.

New Zealand's economic ties with Australia are strong, especially since the demise of Britain as a trading partner following the latter's decision to join the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. Effective from 1 January 1983 the two countries concluded the Australia New Zealand [[Closer Economic Relations]] Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) for the purpose of allowing each country access to the other's markets.

Two-way trade between Australia and New Zealand was NZ$26.2 billion (approximately A$24.1 billion) in 2017–18, including goods and services. New Zealand's largest exports to Australia are travel and tourism, dairy products, foodstuffs, precious metals and jewellery, and machinery.

One example of a formerly longstanding trading issue unresolved by the closer economic relations was Australia's restriction of the import of [[apple]]s from New Zealand owing to fear of introducing [[fire blight]] disease. A ban on importation of New Zealand apples into Australia had been in place since 1921, following the discovery of fire blight in New Zealand in 1919. New Zealand authorities applied for re-admittance to the Australian market in 1986, 1989 and 1995, but the ban continued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/RRAT_CTTE/completed_inquiries/1999-02/apples/report/c03.pdf|title=The Proposed Importation of Fresh Apple Fruit from New Zealand: Chapter three – The Apple and Pear Industries in Australia and New Zealand |publisher=Australian Senate – Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee |date=18 July 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401104134/http://aph.gov.au/senate/committee/rrat_ctte/completed_inquiries/1999-02/apples/report/c03.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2011 }}</ref> Further talks over Australia's import restrictions on apples from New Zealand failed, and New Zealand initiated [[WTO dispute resolution]] proceedings in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/nz+take+australia+wto+over+apple+access |title=NZ to take Australia to WTO over apple access |date=20 August 2007 |publisher=New Zealand Government press release |accessdate=20 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=17580|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908020202/http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=17580|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2012|title=Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offends apple growers; Australia: Apple pie jokes not funny for growers|date=5 March 2008|publisher=Freshplaza.com ("an independent news source for companies operating in the global fruit and vegetable sector around the world") Netherlands|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> Only in 2010 did the [[WTO]] order Australia, over its sustained appeals and objections, to vary those import restrictions.<ref name="WTO"/>

==Monetary==

{{see also|History of pound sterling in Oceania|Economy of Oceania|Economic and monetary union}}

[[File:1914 Sydney Half Sovereign - St. George.jpg|thumb|1914 [[half sovereign]] from the Sydney mint]]

[[Britain's Imperial Century|Political conditions]] in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815 smoothed informal adoption of the British [[Pound Sterling]] in [[New South Wales]] with relative ease, such adoption proceeding to expand out to New Zealand and other regions of Oceania in time. Having adopted a successful [[Gold Specie Standard]] in 1821, the [[UK Government|British Government]] decided in 1825 to introduce the [[Pounds, shillings and pence|sterling coinage]] to all of its colonies as a matter of policy. From the latter half of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I, a [[monetary union]], based on the British [[gold sovereign]] existed in a part of the [[British Empire]] which included all of both countries and [[dependent territory|their dependencies]].

In 1910, Australia introduced [[Australian Pound|its own currency in the likeness of sterling currency]]. The [[Great Depression]] was the catalyst that forced more dramatic shifts in the [[exchange rates]] between the various [[Pound (currency)|pound units]], and hence the introduction of the [[New Zealand pound]] in 1933. Both national currencies had membership of the [[sterling area]] from 1939 until its effective demise in 1972. Both adjusted their [[Fixed exchange rate|peg]] to be the US dollar in 1971, with first Australia and then New Zealand having fortuitously already [[Decimalisation#Australia and New Zealand|decimalised their monetary units]] on 14 February 1966 and 10 July 1967 respectively, both replacing the pound with the dollar at a rate of £1 to $2. The Australian dollar was [[floating exchange rate|floated]] in December 1983, as subsequently also was the New Zealand dollar in March 1985.

Contemporary [[dollarisation]] by either country to the currency of the other or the more involved [[currency union]] entailing amalgamation of the [[central bank]]s and [[Regulatory economics|economic regulatory]] systems of both countries have been proposed and discussed though in no way implemented.<ref name="don">{{cite web |author=Donald T Brash |url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/speeches/0091114.html |title=The Pros and Cons of Currency Union: A Reserve Bank Perspective – An address by Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the Auckland Rotary Club (22 May 2000) |publisher=Rbnz.govt.nz |date=22 May 2000 |access-date=22 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127200452/http://rbnz.govt.nz/speeches/0091114.html |archive-date=27 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Law==

{{See also|Law of Australia|Law of New Zealand}}

Both nations adhere to secular [[common law]] [[legal system]]s acknowledging the [[rule of law]]; and the [[separation of powers]]. Like the United States and Canada, however, Australia is a [[federalism|federal]] nation with a written [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]]. New Zealand, like the United Kingdom, is a unitary state with parliamentary sovereignty. Australia lacks a treaty with its indigenous peoples, whereas New Zealand has had the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] from 1840. In acknowledgement of [[Land rights#Indigenous land rights|indigenous land rights]] including [[aboriginal title]], the [[National Native Title Tribunal]] and [[Waitangi Tribunal]] in the respective nations take similar [[jurisdiction]] and powers.

Both [[judicial power|judicial systems]] are now independent of the ultimate authority of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Whereas the [[Constitution of New Zealand]] is not one that is either [[Codification (law)|codified]] or [[Entrenchment clause|entrenched]], the [[Constitution of Australia]] has had the [[s:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] as such an entrenched codification embodying a [[written constitution]].

New Zealand [[contract law]] is now largely distinct from that of Australia due to the effect of [[Acts of Parliament#New Zealand|Acts of the New Zealand Parliament]] [[promulgation|promulgated]] since 1969.<ref>Maree Chetwin, Stephen Graw and Raymond Tiong, ''An Introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand'', 4th edition, Wellington: Brookers, 2006, p.2.</ref> Main among them is the wide [[discretion]]ary power given to New Zealand courts in granting [[Legal remedy|relief]].

In 2005 and 2006 the [[Australian House of Representatives committees#Standing Committees 2|Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee]] on Legal and Constitutional Affairs enquired into the harmonisation of legal systems within Australia, and with New Zealand, with particular reference to those differences that affect [[Section 51(i) of the Constitution of Australia|trade and commerce]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonisation of legal systems Within Australia and between Australia and New Zealand |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/HOUSE/committee/laca/harmonisation/report.htm |author=House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs |publisher=Australian House of Representatives |date=4 December 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829231201/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/harmonisation/report.htm |archivedate=29 August 2007 }}</ref> The Committee stated that the already close relationship between Australia and New Zealand should be closer still and that: {{cquote|In this era of [[globalisation]], it makes sense for Australia and New Zealand to look at moving closer together and further aligning their [[regulation|regulatory]] frameworks.}}

Key recommendations on the Australia–New Zealand relationship included:
* Establishment of a trans-Tasman [[parliamentary committee]] to monitor legal harmonisation and examine options including closer association or union;
* Pursuit of a common currency;
* Offering New Zealand Ministers full membership of Australian ministerial councils;
* Work to advance harmonisation of the two [[bank regulation|banking]] and telecommunications regulation frameworks.<ref>{{cite press |url= http://www.aph.gov.au/HOUSE/committee/laca/harmonisation/media/media004.pdf|title=Report on Legal Harmonisation Tabled |date=4 December 2006 |publisher=Peter Slipper, MP, Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee |accessdate=21 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070913180028/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/harmonisation/media/media004.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:John Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir John Hall, Premier of New Zealand 1879–1882]]From time to time the idea of joining Australia has been mooted, but has been ridiculed by some New Zealanders. When Australia's former opposition leader, [[John Hewson]], raised the issue in 2000, [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand's Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] remarked that he could "dream on".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/714471.stm |title=New Zealand scoffs at statehood idea |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2002 |accessdate=27 June 2006}}</ref> A 2001 book by Australian academic [[Bob Catley (politician)|Bob Catley]], then at the [[University of Otago]], titled ''[[Waltzing Matilda|Waltzing with Matilda]]: should New Zealand join Australia?'', was described by New Zealand political commentator [[Colin James (journalist)|Colin James]] as "a book for Australians".<ref>{{cite news |first=Colin |last=James |url=http://www.colinjames.co.nz/other_articles/Australasia_NZ_Books_Jul_01.htm |title=How not to waltz Matilda |publisher=[[Colin James (journalist)|Colin James]] |date=24 July 2001 |accessdate=27 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005233132/http://www.colinjames.co.nz/other_articles/Australasia_NZ_Books_Jul_01.htm |archive-date=5 October 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Both countries have contributed to the sporadic discussion on a [[Pacific Union]], although that proposal would include a much wider range of member-states than just Australia and New Zealand.

A result of the rejected [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 Australian republican referendum]] was that Australians retained a common head of state with New Zealand. Whereas none of [[List of political parties in New Zealand|the major political parties]] in New Zealand have a policy of encouraging [[Republicanism in New Zealand|republicanism]], the [[Australian Labor Party]] has long favoured a [[republicanism in Australia|republic]], as have some politicians in the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], although National Prime Minister [[Jim Bolger]] spoke in favour of a republic in 1994.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/bolger-sets-date-for-nz-republic-1429602.html Bolger sets date for NZ republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 March 1994</ref>

From 1923 to 1968 both nations along with the UK exercised trusteeship of [[Nauru]] pursuant to the [[Nauru Island Agreement]]. In the period from 2001 to 2007 New Zealand accepted certain boat arrival intending migrants to Australia for immigration processing as part of the [[Pacific Solution]] otherwise focused upon the detention centre commissioned at Papua New Guinea's [[Manus Island]].

The two countries were the lead participants in the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] initiated from 2003.

In early November 2017, the Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] turned down an offer by his New Zealand counterpart [[Jacinda Ardern]] to resettle 150 asylum seekers from Nauru and Manus Island in New Zealand on the grounds that Australia was pursuing a refugee resettlement deal with the United States. Australian Immigration Minister [[Peter Dutton]] also claimed that the New Zealand offer would encourage more people smugglers to travel from New Zealand to Australia. This offer coincided with Australian efforts to close down the [[Manus Regional Processing Centre]]. Dutton also warned that the proposed New Zealand offer could damage bilateral relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belot |first1=Henry |title=Malcolm Turnbull not accepting Jacinda Ardern's offer to resettle asylum seekers in NZ 'at this time' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-05/turnbull-wont-accept-nz-offer-to-resettle-refugees-at-this-time/9120028 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=6 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Carp |first1=Paul |last2=Roy |first2=Eleanor Ainge |title=New Zealand seeks deal with Australia to resettle Manus and Nauru refugees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/new-zealand-and-png-could-do-deal-on-refugees-peter-dutton-says |accessdate=19 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 November 2017}}</ref>
