'''Transparency International e.V.''' ('''TI''') is a German non-governmental organization founded in 1993. Based in [[Berlin]], its [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] purpose is to take action to combat global<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/impact|title=Our impact - Transparency International|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|website=www.transparency.org}}</ref> [[corruption]] with civil societal [[anti-corruption]] measures and to [[Crime prevention|prevent criminal activities]] arising from corruption. Its most notable publications include the [[Global Corruption Barometer]] and the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]. Transparency International has the legal status of a German registered voluntary association ''([[Eingetragener Verein]])'' and serves as an [[umbrella organization]].

==History==

Transparency International was founded in May 1993. According to political scientist Ellen Gutterman, "TI's presence in Germany, and indeed its organizational development and rise from a small operation to a prominent international [[TNGO]], benefited from the activities and personal connections of at least three key German individuals: Peter Eigen, Hansjoerg Elshorst, and Michael Wiehen".<ref name="gutterman">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2012/Gutterman2.pdf|title=The Legitimacy of Transnational NGOs: Lessons from the Experience of Transparency International in Germany and France (PDF)|journal=Paper submitted to the 84th annual conference of the Canadian Political Science Association |author=Ellen Gutterman |date=June 2012}}</ref>

In 1995, Transparency International developed the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI ranked nations on the prevalence of corruption within each country, based upon surveys of business people. The CPI was subsequently published annually. It was initially criticized for poor methodology and unfair treatment of developing nations, while also being praised for highlighting corruption and embarrassing governments.<ref name=Chaikin>{{cite book | first=David | last=Chaikin | title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=June 2009 | pages=12–13 | ISBN=0-230-61360-8}}</ref>

In 1999, Transparency International began publishing the [[Bribe Payers Index]] (BPI) which ranked nations according to the prevalence that a country's [[multinational corporations]] would offer bribes.<ref name=Chaikin/>

==Areas of work and products==
<blockquote>Transparency International is the global civil society organization leading the fight against corruption. It brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. TI's mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption.{{quote without source|date=April 2018}}</blockquote>
The organization defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain which eventually hurts everyone who depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo|title=Transparency International – What we do|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}</ref>
It develops tools for fighting corruption and works with other civil society organizations, companies and governments to implement them. Since 1995, Transparency International has issued an annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI); it also publishes a [[Global Corruption Report]], a [[Global Corruption Barometer]], and a [[Bribe Payers Index]].
In 2010, Transparency International developed a five-year strategy with six strategic priorities organized by the following categories: People, Institutions, Laws, Values, Network, Impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation/strategy_2015/1|title=2015 Strategy|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}</ref>
In 2015, Transparency International (TI) developed a five-year strategy which sets out their collective ambition for the coming years. Together against Corruption: Transparency International Strategy 2020 is a strategy by and for the Transparency International movement. This strategy is based on more than 1500 external and internal contributions addressing both the corruption environment of today and the one TI anticipates in the years ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation/strategy_2020/1|title=2020 Strategy|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}</ref>

=== Corruption Perceptions Index ===
{{Main|Corruption Perceptions Index}}
The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index – a combination of polls – drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI reflects the views of observers from around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/in_detail/|title=2012 Corruption Perceptions Index – In detail|author=Transparency International e.V.|work=transparency.org}}</ref>

The Corruption Perceptions Index has received criticism over the years. The main one stems from the difficulty in measuring corruption, which by definition happens behind the scenes. The Corruption Perceptions Index therefore needs to rely on third-party survey which have been criticized as potentially unreliable. Data can vary widely depending on the public perception of a country, the completeness of the surveys and the methodology used. The second issue is that data cannot be compared from year to year because Transparency International uses different methodologies and samples every year. This makes it difficult to evaluate the result of new policies.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |publisher=Global Integrity & UNDP |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archive-date=2011-01-31 }}</ref> The Corruption Perceptions Index authors replied to these criticisms by reminding that the Corruption Perceptions Index is meant to measure ''perception'' and not "reality". They argue that "perceptions matter in their own right, since... firms and individuals take actions based on perceptions".<ref>{{cite book|last=Uslaner|first=Eric M. |title=Corruption, inequality, and the rule of law: the bulging pocket makes the easy life|publisher=Cambridge University Press

=== Other key products ===

*The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) is a survey that asks citizens about their direct personal experience of corruption in their daily lives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=e.V |first1=Transparency International |title=Global Corruption Barometer: citizens’ voices from around the world |url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/global_corruption_barometer_citizens_voices_from_around_the_world |website=www.transparency.org |accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>

*In 2013, Transparency International published the Government Defence Anti-corruption Index with which corruption in the defence sector of 82 countries was measured.<ref>{{cite web |title=Government Defence Anti-corruption Index |publisher=Transparency International |year=2013 |url=http://government.defenceindex.org/report |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508093004/http://government.defenceindex.org/report |archive-date=2013-05-08 }}</ref> Some governments have expressed criticism towards the methodology of the report. Mark Pyman, the founder of TI's Defence & Security&nbsp;program, defended the report in an interview and stressed the importance of transparency in the military sector. The plan is to publish the index every two years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transparency is feasible |author=Mark Pyman |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first}}</ref>

== Organizational structure ==
[[Image:Transparency International Berlin.jpg|thumb|Transparency International's headquarters in [[Berlin]]]]
Transparency International consists of chapters – locally established, independent organizations – that address corruption in their respective countries. From small bribes to large-scale looting, corruption differs from country to country. As chapters are staffed with local experts they are ideally placed to determine the priorities and approaches best suited to tackling corruption in their countries. This work ranges from visiting rural communities to provide free legal support to advising their government on policy reform. Corruption does not stop at national borders. The chapters play a crucial role in shaping its collective work and realising its regional and global goals, such as Strategy 2015. Transparency International's multi-country research and advocacy initiatives are driven by the chapters.

According to its 2012 Annual Report, it is funded by western governments (with almost €5 million from the UK government) and several multinational companies, including oil companies Exxon Mobil and Shell, hedge funds KKR and Wermuth Asset Management, Deloitte and Ernst & Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/annual_report_2012|title=TI Publication - Annual Report 2012|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> Exxon Mobil itself was ranked in 2008 as the least transparent of 42 major oil and gas firms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7370685.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - Exxon 'ranks low on transparency'|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>

As far as organizational structure is concerned, one important leadership structure is their advisory council. The Advisory Council is a group of individuals with extensive experience in the areas of Transparency International's work. They come from diverse geographical, cultural and professional backgrounds. The council is appointed by the Board of Directors to advise them and to support the work of the organization as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation/advisory_council/0|title=Advisory Council|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>

==Controversies==
According to the newspaper [[Le Monde]] : "In its main surveys, Transparency International does not measure the weight of corruption in economic terms for each country. It develops a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) based on surveys conducted by private structures or other NGOs: the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], backed by the British liberal weekly newspaper [[The Economist]], the American neoconservative organization [[Freedom House]], the [[World Economic Forum]], or large corporations. (...) The IPC ignores corruption cases that concern the business world. So, the collapse of [[Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers|Lehman Brothers]] (2008) or the manipulation of the money market reference rate ([[Libor]]) by major British banks revealed in 2011 did not affect the ratings of the [[United States]] or [[United Kingdom]]." The organization also receives funding from companies that are themselves convicted of corruption offences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mondiplo.com/quien-investiga-a-los-investigadores|title=« ¿Quién investiga a los investigadores? » - Le Monde diplomatique en español|website=mondiplo.com}}</ref>

=== 2019-20 Reports of bullying and harassment by senior management and Board members ===
In August 2019 whistleblower accounts from seven current and former TI Secretariat staff emerged alleging a “toxic” workplace culture under the current Managing Director, [[Patricia Moreira]]. Reported in The Guardian, the alleged misconduct reported ranged from gagging orders in termination agreements, to bullying and harassment of critical internal voices.<ref name="Doshi">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/21/transparency-international-staff-complain-of-bullying-harassment|title=Transparency International staff complain of bullying and harassment|last=Doshi|first=Vidhi|date=2019-08-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Moreira and other senior managers were alleged to have targeted dissident staff members and bullied them toward resignation. The report cited a staff survey carried out by works council staff representatives, which found that 66% of 92 respondents had observed or experienced bullying at TI and one in five felt sexual harassment to be a problem.<ref name="Doshi"/>

Transparency International Ireland made a protected disclosure on behalf of the whistleblowers to the international board of TI in August 2019, calling for an investigation into the alleged misconduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.ie/news_events/transparency-international-ireland-statement-allegations-bullying-and-harassment-ti|title=Transparency International Ireland statement on allegations of bullying and harassment at TI Secretariat, Berlin|last=Communications|first=T.

The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung simultaneously reported that Transparency International dismissed Moreira “without giving any reasons”. The article added that under Moreira’s tenure, “dozens of employees, including high-ranking ones, have left the organisation in recent years. Even long-standing and deeply committed employees complain that TI is involved in political intrigues in which some are only interested in their own progress. For a non-governmental organization whose goal is to fight corruption around the world, and which collects millions of dollars in funding from governments and companies every year, this is a disturbing finding."<ref>[https://m.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transparency-international-die-dunklen-seiten-der-korruptionsjagd-16803895.html" Die dunklen Seiten der Korruptionsjard"], by Corinna Budras, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 June 2020</ref>

===2017 USA chapter disaccreditation===
In January 2017, the TI Secretariat confirmed that its International Board of Directors decided on 10 January 2017 to strip its US affiliate – Transparency International USA – of its accreditation as the National Chapter in the United States.<ref name="auto1"/>
The stated basis for the dis-accreditation was the board's recognition of differences in philosophies, strategies, and priorities between the former chapter and the Transparency International Movement. Elsewhere, it was reported that TI-USA came to be seen in the United States as a corporate front group, funded by multinational corporations. TI-USA's funding was provided by Bechtel Corporation, Deloitte, Google, Pfizer  ($50,000 or more), Citigroup, ExxonMobil, Fluor, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Marsh & McLennan, PepsiCo, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Raytheon, Realogy, Tyco ($25,000–$49,999), and Freeport-McMoRan and Johnson & Johnson (up to $24,999).<ref name="corporatecrimereporter.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/transparency-international-strips-us-affiliate-of-accreditation/|title=Transparency International Strips United States Affiliate of Accreditation - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=19 January 2017}}</ref> TI-USA previously awarded an annual corporate leadership award to one of its big corporate funders. In 2016, this award went to Bechtel. In April 2015 the Secretariat defended the decision by TI-USA to give [[Hillary Clinton]] its Integrity Award in 2012.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_and_the_clinton_foundation_regarding_recent_statements|title=Transparency and The Clinton Foundation: Regarding recent statements|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>

===2015 Croatia chapter disaccreditation===
Due to a "lack of confidence", TI's chapter in Croatia was disaccredited by the organization's board of directors in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_statement_on_its_former_chapter_in_croatia|title=Press release - Transparency International statement on its former chapter in Croatia|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> The previous year, several leaders of the Croatia chapter challenged the legality of the chapter president's election. The president was accused of falsifying records, [[conflicts of interest]], and arbitrarily expelling 10 chapter members who opposed the hiring of staff against the organization's rules. The Croatian government eventually revoked the president's appointment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seldi.net/fileadmin/public/PDF/Publications/RAR/SELDI_Regional_Anticorruption_Report_Final_Revised.pdf | title=Anti-Corruption Reloaded Assessment of Southeast Europe | publisher=Southeast Europe Leadership for Development and Integrity | date=2014 | editor=Ognian Shentov|editor2=Ruslan Stefanov|editor3=Boyko Todorov | isbn=978-954-477-221-5}}</ref>

===2014 Funding from Siemens===
In January 2015 it was reported that Transparency International accepted $3 million from the German engineering multinational [[Siemens]], which in 2008 paid one of the largest corporate corruption fines<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/worldbusiness/16siemens.html|title=Settling Bribery Case to Cost Siemens $1.6 Billion|first1=Eric|last1=Lichtblau|first2=Carter|last2=Dougherty|date=15 December 2008|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> in history – $1.6 billion – for bribing government officials in numerous countries. In 2014, Siemens made the donation Transparency International after pleading guilty in 2008 to bribery charges relating to widespread corrupt practices in Greece, Norway, Iraq, Vietnam, Italy, Israel, Argentina, Venezuela, China and Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-294.htm|title=Press Release: SEC Charges Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide Bribery; 2008-294; Dec. 15, 2008|website=www.SEC.gov}}</ref>
Transparency International applied for and received the funding from Siemens, even though TI's due diligence procedures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/duediligence.pdf|title=Private-Sector Donors Approval and Due Diligence Processes}}</ref> prohibit the organization from accepting money from corporations that want to "[[greenwashing|greenwash]]" their reputations by making donations to TI. "If any corporate donor is accused of having been involved in corruption, the donor can expect no protection from TI," the procedures state. Transparency International received the funding from the ''Siemens Integrity Initiative''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/about/sustainability/en/core-topics/collective-action/integrity-initiative/index.php|title=Integrity Initiative|website=www.siemens.com}}</ref> about a year after the ''Initiative'' hired former TI staffer Jana Mittermaier, raising questions of a "revolving door" that has benefited both the organization and the company.
Several of TI's national chapters also have accepted money from Siemens: $660,000 for TI USA, $600,000 for TI Italy, $450,000 for TI Bulgaria, and $230,000 for TI Mexico – each for a period of three years. "This really shows that Transparency International is not as pure as people think," a TI insider told Corporate Crime Reporter. Transparency International Managing Director at the time, [[Cobus de Swardt]], said, "We did not file an application to Siemens, we applied to the Siemens Integrity Initiative. There's a difference. We have not applied to Siemens." However, according to Siemens, the money for these grants is "provided by Siemens".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/transparency-international-siemens-revolving-door-spins-money-pipeline-flows/|title=Transparency International Siemens Revolving Door Spins, Money Pipeline Flows - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/siemens-and-the-greenwashing-of-transparency-international/|title=Transparency International and the Greenwashing of Siemens - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/siemens-donates-3-million-transparency-international/|title=Siemens Donates $3 Million to Transparency International - Corporate Crime Reporter|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>

===2013 Non-support of Edward Snowden===
At its annual members' meeting in November 2013 in Berlin, Transparency International's national chapters from Germany and Ireland proposed a resolution calling for the "end of the prosecution of [[Edward J. Snowden]]... He should be recognized as a [[whistleblower]] for his help to reveal the over-reaching and unlawful surveillance by secret services... He symbolizes the courage of numerous other whistleblowers around the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Snowden.pdf|title=Whistleblower protection of Edward Snowden|first1=TI|last1=Germany|first2=TI|last2=Ireland|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>

The final resolution that was passed by the plenary excluded any reference to Snowden, and excluded a call for "comprehensive protection on whistleblowers from all forms of retaliation". The original resolution was weakened following the intervention of the USA chapter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-mokhiber/transparency-internationa_b_4687986.html|title=Transparency International Nixes Edward Snowden|first1=Russell Mokhiber|last1=Editor|first2=Corporate Crime|last2=Reporter|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref> Five months earlier, in June 2013, representatives from Transparency International declined Snowden's request to meet him at the Moscow airport. [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] met Snowden to support his asylum request, but Transparency International refused.
