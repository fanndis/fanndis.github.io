The '''Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act''' (commonly referred to as '''Dodd–Frank''') is a [[United States]] [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal law]] that was enacted on July 21, 2010.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Rena S.|title=The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform and Consumer Protection Act : Title VII, derivatives|publisher=Library of Congress. Congressional Research Service (CRS)|year=2019|location=Washington D.C.}}</ref> The law overhauled [[financial regulation]] in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]], and it made changes affecting all federal financial regulatory agencies and almost every part of the nation's financial services industry.

Responding to widespread calls for changes to the financial regulatory system, in June 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] introduced a proposal for a "sweeping overhaul of the United States financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]". Legislation based on his proposal was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Congressman [[Barney Frank]], and in the [[United States Senate]] by Senator [[Chris Dodd]]. Most congressional support for Dodd-Frank came from members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], but three Senate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] voted for the bill, allowing it to overcome the Senate [[filibuster in the United States|filibuster]].

Dodd-Frank reorganized the financial regulatory system, eliminating the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], assigning new responsibilities to existing agencies like the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], and creating new agencies like the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB). The CFPB was charged with protecting consumers against abuses related to credit cards, mortgages, and other financial products. The act also created the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] and the [[Office of Financial Research]] to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, and gave the [[Federal Reserve]] new powers to regulate systemically important institutions. To handle the liquidation of large companies, the act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority. One provision, the [[Volcker Rule]], restricts banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments. The act also repealed the exemption from regulation for security-based [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], requiring [[credit-default swaps]] and other transactions to be cleared through either exchanges or clearinghouses. Other provisions affect issues such as [[corporate governance]], [[1256 Contract]]s, and [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]].

Dodd-Frank is generally regarded as one of the most significant laws enacted during the [[presidency of Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Guida |first1=Victoria |last2=Warmbrodt |first2=Zachary |title=Trump wounds but can't kill Obama's Wall Street rules |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/trump-obama-wall-street-rules-555048 |publisher=Politico |date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> Studies have found the Dodd–Frank Act has improved financial stability and [[consumer protection]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Financial Stability and Economic Growth|publisher=Brookings|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Baily-Klein-PPTF-1.pdf|date=October 24, 2014|access-date=August 31, 2017|postscript=none|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905033619/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Baily-Klein-PPTF-1.pdf|archive-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Financial Stability and Economic Growth |journal=RSF |date=2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=20 |doi=10.7758/RSF.2017.3.1.02 |last1=Martin Neil Baily |last2=Aaron Klein |last3=Justin Schardin |s2cid=157075377 |doi-access=free }}</ref> although there has been debate regarding its economic effects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dd4a6698-efe7-11e6-930f-061b01e23655|title=Did Dodd-Frank really hurt the US economy?|date=February 13, 2017|work=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-23|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124135544/https://www.ft.com/content/dd4a6698-efe7-11e6-930f-061b01e23655|archive-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|title=The State and Fate of Community Banking|last1=Lux|first1=Marshall|last2=Robert|first2=Greene|publisher=Harvard Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government|date=2015|access-date=January 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120070545/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|archive-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> In 2017, Federal Reserve Chairwoman [[Janet Yellen]] stated that "the balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth." Some critics have argued that the law had a negative impact on economic growth and small banks, or failed to provide adequate regulation to the financial industry. Many Republicans have called for the partial or total repeal of the law.

As the finalized bill emerged from conference, President Obama said that it included 90 percent of the reforms he had proposed.<ref>Obama B. (June 25, 2010).

White House.</ref> Major components of Obama's original proposal, listed by the order in which they appear in the "A New Foundation" outline,<ref name=ObamaProposal/> include
# The consolidation of regulatory agencies, elimination of the national thrift charter, and new oversight council to evaluate systemic risk
# Comprehensive regulation of financial markets, including increased transparency of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] (bringing them onto [[Exchange (organized market)|exchanges]])
# Consumer protection reforms including a new consumer protection agency and uniform standards for "plain vanilla" products as well as strengthened investor protection
# Tools for financial crisis, including a "resolution regime" complementing the existing [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) authority to allow for orderly winding down of bankrupt firms, and including a proposal that the Federal Reserve (the "Fed") receive authorization from the Treasury for extensions of credit in "unusual or exigent circumstances"
# Various measures aimed at increasing international standards and cooperation including proposals related to improved accounting and tightened regulation of [[credit rating agencies]]

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is categorized into 16 titles and, by one law firm's count, it requires that regulators create 243 rules, conduct 67 studies, and issue 22 periodic reports.<ref name=DavisPolkFinal>Davis Polk.

The stated aim of the legislation is

{{quote|To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end "too big to fail," to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.<ref name=THOMASWeb>{{cite web | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf | title=Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Enrolled Final Version – HR 4173) | publisher=[[THOMAS]] | access-date=July 20, 2010 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007152515/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf | archive-date=October 7, 2010 }}</ref>}}

The Act changes the existing regulatory structure, by creating a number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the [[Federal Reserve Act]], promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded [[bailout]]s of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession.<ref name=THOMASWebsummary>{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/FinancialReformSummaryAsFiled.pdf|title=Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 – Summary|publisher=111th Congress|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206115932/http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/_files/FinancialReformSummaryAsFiled.pdf|archive-date=2014-12-06|access-date=2010-04-22}}</ref> The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]], the [[Office of Financial Research]], and the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection]].

Of the existing agencies, changes are proposed, ranging from new powers to the transfer of powers in an effort to enhance the regulatory system. The institutions affected by these changes include most of the regulatory agencies currently involved in monitoring the financial system ([[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), [[Federal Reserve]] (the "Fed"), the [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC), etc.), and the final elimination of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (further described in [[#Title III – Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED|Title III—Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED]]).

As a practical matter, prior to the passage of Dodd–Frank, investment advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold himself out generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://doddfrankregistration.com/overview/ |title=Dodd–Frank SEC Registration – An Overview |publisher=Allan J. P. Rooney, P.C.|date= December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709160116/http://doddfrankregistration.com/overview/ |archive-date=July 9, 2012 }}</ref> However, the Act also shifted oversight of non-exempt investment advisers with less than $100 million in assets under management and not registered in more than 15 states to state regulators. A study published in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' in 2019 (by [https://www.bencharoenwong.info/ Ben Charoenwong] of the [[National University of Singapore]], [https://sites.google.com/site/alanpaulkwan/ Alan Kwan] at [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong University]], and [https://business.rice.edu/person/tarik-umar Tarik Umar] at [[Rice University]]) found that this switch in enforcement to state regulators increased misconduct among investment advisers by thirty to forty percent, with a bigger increase in areas with less sophisticated clients, less competition, and among advisers with more conflicts of interest, most likely because on average state regulators have less resources and enforcement capacity compared to the SEC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Charoenwong |first1=Ben |last2=Kwan |first2=Alan |last3=Umar |first3=Tarik |title=Does Regulatory Jurisdiction Affect the Quality of Investment-Adviser Regulation? |journal=American Economic Review |date=1 October 2019 |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=3681–3712 |doi=10.1257/aer.20180412 |url=https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20180412.appx }}</ref>

Certain [[non-bank financial institution]]s and their subsidiaries will be supervised by the Fed<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 161</ref> in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were a bank holding company.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} §§ 162(a),163</ref>

To the extent that the Act affects all federal financial regulatory agencies, eliminating one (the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]]) and creating two (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research) in addition to several consumer protection agencies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this legislation in many ways represents a change in the way America's financial markets will operate in the future. Few provisions of the Act became effective when the bill was signed.<ref name=schedule>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/07/15/summary-and-implementation-schedule-of-the-dodd-frank-act/ | title=Summary and Implementation Schedule of the Dodd–Frank Act | publisher=The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation | date=July 15, 2010 | access-date=July 25, 2010 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719182705/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/07/15/summary-and-implementation-schedule-of-the-dodd-frank-act/ | archive-date=July 19, 2010 }}</ref>

==Provisions==
{{Split section | Provisions of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act |date=March 2017}}

===Title I—Financial Stability===
Title I, or the "Financial Stability Act of 2010",<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 101</ref> outlines two new agencies tasked to monitor [[systemic risk]] and research the state of the economy and clarifies the comprehensive supervision of [[bank holding companies]] by the Federal Reserve.

Title I creates the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) and the [[Office of Financial Research]] (OFR) in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]]. These two agencies are designed to work closely together. The council is formed of 10 voting members, 9 of whom are federal regulators and 5 nonvoting supporting members, to encourage interagency collaboration and knowledge transfer.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 112(a)(2)</ref> The treasury secretary is chairman of the council, and the head of the Financial Research Office is appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate.

Title I introduced the ability to impose stricter regulations on certain institutions by classifying them as SIFI's ([[Systemically important financial institution#Non-bank entities|systemically important financial institutions]]); according to [[Paul Krugman]], this has resulted in institutions reducing risk to avoid such classification.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/half-a-loaf-financial-reform-edition/|quote=Should we have had a stiffer financial reform? Definitely — required capital ratios should be a lot higher than they are. But Dodd–Frank's rules — especially, I think, the prospect of being classed as a SIFI, a strategically important institution subject to tighter constraints, have had a real effect in reducing risk.|title=Half A Loaf, Financial Reform Edition|date=2016-02-03|author=Paul Krugman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823211101/https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/half-a-loaf-financial-reform-edition/|archive-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>

Under section 165d, certain institutions must prepare resolution plans (so-called living wills), the first round of which was rejected by the Federal Reserve System in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140805a.htm|title=Agencies Provide Feedback on Second Round Resolution Plans of "First-Wave" Filers: Firms required to address shortcomings in 2015 submissions|author=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|quote=Each plan, commonly known as a living will, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. The 11 firms in the first group of filers include [[Bank of America]], [[Bank of New York Mellon]], [[Barclays]], [[Citigroup]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[State Street Corp.]], and [[UBS]]. [...] The Federal Reserve Board determined that the 11 banking organizations must take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913013522/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140805a.htm|archive-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>
The process can be seen as a way to regulate and reduce [[shadow banking]] activities by banking institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rooseveltforward.org/sanders-clinton-approach-shadow-banking/|title=How Sanders and Clinton Each Approach Shadow Banking|author=Mike Konczal|date=2016-07-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002195306/http://rooseveltforward.org/sanders-clinton-approach-shadow-banking/|archive-date=2016-10-02}}</ref>

==== Financial Stability Oversight Council ====
The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, promote [[market discipline]], and respond to emerging risks in order to stabilize the United States financial system. At a minimum, it must meet quarterly.

The Council is required to report to Congress on the state of the financial system and may direct the [[Office of Financial Research]] to conduct research.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 112(a)(2)</ref> Notable powers include
# With a two-thirds vote, it may place nonbank financial companies or domestic subsidiaries of international banks under the supervision of the Federal Reserve if it appears that these companies could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 113</ref>
# Under certain circumstances, the council may provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to the primary financial regulatory agency, which the primary financial agency is obliged to implement—the council reports to Congress on the implementation or failure to implement such recommendations.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 120</ref>
# The council may require any bank or nonbank financial institution with assets over $50 billion to submit certified financial reports.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 116</ref>
# With the approval of the council, the Federal Reserve may promulgate safe harbor regulations to exempt certain types of foreign banks from regulation.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 170</ref>

====Office of Financial Research====
The Office of Financial Research is designed to support the Financial Stability Oversight Council through data collection and research. The director has [[Administrative subpoena|subpoena]] power and may require from any financial institution (bank or nonbank) any data needed to carry out the functions of the office.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 152(f)</ref> The Office can also issue guidelines to standardizing the way data is reported; constituent agencies have three years to implement data standardization guidelines.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 153</ref>

It is intended to be self-funded through the Financial Research Fund within two years of enactment, with the Federal Reserve providing funding in the initial interim period.<ref name="§ 155">{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 155</ref>

In many ways, the Office of Financial Research is to be operated without the constraints of the [[Civil service#United States|Civil Service]] system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay-scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have workforce development plans<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 156</ref> that are designed to ensure that it can attract and retain technical talent, which it is required to report about congressional committees for its first five years.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 156(b)</ref>

===Title II—Orderly Liquidation Authority===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}
[[File:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|The New York City headquarters of [[Lehman Brothers]] at the time of its collapse in 2008.]]
Before Dodd–Frank, federal laws to handle the [[liquidation]] and [[receivership]] of federally regulated banks existed for supervised banks, insured depository institutions, and securities companies by the FDIC or [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC). Dodd–Frank expanded these laws to potentially handle insurance companies and nonbank financial companies and changed these liquidation laws in certain ways.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 201</ref> Once it is determined that a financial company satisfied the criteria for liquidation, if the financial company's board of directors does not agree, provisions are made for judicial appeal.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 202</ref> Depending on the type of financial institution, different regulatory organizations may jointly or independently, by two-thirds vote, determine whether a receiver should be appointed for a financial company:<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(a)(1)</ref>
* In General—FDIC and/or the [[Federal Reserve]]
* Broker Dealers—SEC and/or the Federal Reserve
* Insurance Companies— Federal Insurance Office (part of the Treasury Department and [[#Subtitle A: Federal Insurance Office|established in this Act]]) and/or the Federal Reserve

Provided that the secretary of treasury, in consultation with the president, may also determine to appoint a receiver for a financial company.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(b)</ref> Also, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) shall review and report to Congress about the secretary's decision.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(c)(5)</ref>

When a financial institution is placed into receivership under these provisions, within 24 hours, the secretary shall report to Congress. Also, within 60 days, there shall be a report to the general public.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(c)</ref> The report on recommending to place a financial company into receivership shall contain various details on the state of the company, the impact of its default on the company, and the proposed action.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 203(a)(2)</ref>

====FDIC liquidation====
[[File:Seal of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.svg|thumb|150px|The FDIC is the liquidator for most such financial institutions as failed banks.]]
Unless otherwise stated, the FDIC is the liquidator for financial institutions who are not banking members (such as the SIPC) nor [[insurance company|insurance companies]] (such as the FDIC). In taking action under this title, the FDIC shall comply with various requirements:<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 206</ref>
* Determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company
* Ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Funds are fully paid
* Ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions
* Ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the corporation is appointed receiver)
* Ensure that the members of the board of directors (or body performing similar functions) responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company are removed, if such members have not already been removed at the time the corporation is appointed as receiver
* Not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary

====Orderly Liquidation Fund====
To the extent that the Act expanded the scope of financial firms that may be liquidated by the federal government, beyond the existing authorities of the FDIC and SIPC, there had to be an additional source of funds, independent of the FDIC's [[Deposit Insurance Fund]], used in case of a non-bank or non-security financial company's liquidation. The Orderly Liquidation Fund is to be an FDIC-managed fund, to be used by the FDIC in the event of a covered financial company's liquidation<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(1)</ref> that is not covered by FDIC or SIPC.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(8)(A)</ref>

Initially, the fund is to be capitalized over a period no shorter than five years, but no longer than 10; however, in the event the FDIC must make use of the fund before it is fully capitalized, the secretary of the treasury and the FDIC are permitted to extend the period as determined necessary.<ref name=THOMASWeb /> The method of capitalization is by collecting risk-based assessment fees on any "eligible financial company"—which is defined as ". . . any bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors." The severity of the assessment fees can be adjusted on an as-needed basis (depending on economic conditions and other similar factors), and the relative size and value of a firm is to play a role in determining the fees to be assessed.<ref name=THOMASWeb /> The eligibility of a financial company to be subject to the fees is periodically reevaluated; or, in other words, a company that does not qualify for fees in the present will be subject to the fees in the future if it crosses the 50 billion line, or become subject to Federal Reserve scrutiny.<ref name=THOMASWeb />

To the extent that a covered financial company has a negative net worth and its liquidation creates an obligation to the FDIC as its liquidator, the FDIC shall charge one or more risk-based assessment such that the obligation will be paid off within 60 months of the issuance of the obligation.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(o)(1)(B)</ref> The assessments will be charged to any bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve.

====Obligation limit and funding====
When liquidating a financial company under this title (as opposed to FDIC or SIPD) there is a maximum limit of the government's liquidation obligation, i.e., the government's obligation can not exceed<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 210(n)(6)</ref>
* 10 percent of the total consolidated assets, or
* 90 percent of the fair value of the total consolidated assets

In the event that the Fund and other sources of capital are insufficient, the FDIC is authorized to buy and sell securities on behalf of the company (or companies) in receivership to raise additional capital.<ref name=THOMASWeb /> Taxpayers shall bear no losses from liquidating any financial company under this title, and any losses shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, recovered through assessments:<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 214</ref>

The panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the chief judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates.<ref name=THOMASWeb /> If the panel concurs with the secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into [[receivership]]; if it does not concur, the secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition.<ref name=THOMASWeb /> In the event that a panel decision is appealed, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a [[writ of certiorari]] may be filed with the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]]. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.<ref name=THOMASWeb />

=== Title III—Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the Fed ===
Title III, or the "Enhancing Financial Institution Safety and Soundness Act of 2010,"<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 300</ref> is designed to streamline banking regulation. It also is intended to reduce competition and overlaps between different regulators by abolishing the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] and transferring its power over the appropriate holding companies to the board of governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]], state savings associations to the FDIC, and other thrifts to the office of the Comptroller of the Currency.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 312</ref> The thrift charter is to remain, although weakened. Additional changes include:

Title IV, or the "Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010,"<ref name="ReferenceA">{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 401</ref> requires certain previously exempt investment advisers to register as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers,'' §§1:1, 1:31–1:32, 1:35–1:39 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref> Most notably, it requires many hedge fund managers and private equity fund managers to register as advisers for the first time.<ref>Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, ''Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance'', §§3:2–3:8 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref> Also, the act increases the reporting requirements of investment advisers as well as limiting these advisers' ability to exclude information in reporting to many of the federal government agencies.

===Title V—Insurance===
Title V—Insurance is split into two subtitles: A - Federal Insurance Office, and B - State-Based Insurance Reform.

====Subtitle A—Federal Insurance Office====
Subtitle A, also called the "Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010",<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 501</ref> establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department, which is tasked with:<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 502: Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of [[title 31, United States Code]], is amended—(1) by redesignating section 312 as section 315; (2) by redesignating section 313 as section 312; and (3) by inserting: Sec 313 Federal Insurance Office</ref>
* Monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (except health insurance, some long-term care insurance, and crop insurance), including the identification of gaps in regulation of insurers that could contribute to financial crisis<ref>{{cite web |url=http://image.edistribution.pwc.com/lib/fe9a13707565017971/m/1/FS+Reg+Brief+Insurance+FIO+secure.pdf|title= Insurers: Is federal regulation coming? |website=pwc.com|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice|date= December 2013}}</ref>

====Provisions====
Title VI, or the "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010,"<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 601</ref> introduces the so-called [[Volcker Rule]] after former [[chairman of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]] by amending the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]]. With aiming to reduce the amount of speculative investments on the balance sheets of large firms, it limits banking entities to owning no more than 3 percent in a hedge fund or [[private equity fund]] of the total ownership interest.<ref name="Whitehouse-1">{{Citation|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|access-date=February 27, 2010|title=President Obama Calls for New Restrictions on Size and Scope of Financial Institutions to Rein in Excesses and Protect Taxpayers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220232336/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|archive-date=February 20, 2010}}</ref> All of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3 percent of the banking entity's Tier 1 capital. Furthermore, no bank with a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" without disclosing the relationship's full extent to the regulating entity, and ensuring that there is no [[conflict of interest]].<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 619 amends 12 U.S.C § 1841, § 13(f)</ref> "Banking entity" includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution, and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries. Also, it must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions.

{{see also|US corporate law|Corporate governance|Say on pay}}
[[File:US-SecuritiesAndExchangeCommission-Seal.svg|thumb|150px|SEC]]
Title IX, sections 901 to 991, known as the Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities,<ref name="ReferenceB">{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 901</ref> revises the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s powers and structure, as well as credit rating organizations and the relationships between customers and [[broker-dealer]]s or investment advisers. This title calls for various studies and reports from the SEC and [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO). This title contains 10 subtitles, lettered A through J.

====Subtitle A—Increasing Investor Protection====
Subtitle A contains provisions
* To prevent [[regulatory capture]] within the SEC and increase the influence of investors, the Act creates an Office of the Investor Advocate,<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 915; amending section 4 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78d}}) by adding: (g) OFFICE OF THE INVESTOR ADVOCATE.</ref> an investor advisory committee composed of 12 to 22 members who serve four-year terms,<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 911; amending Title I of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by adding Sec 39(a): investor advisory committee</ref> and an [[ombudsman]] appointed by the Office of the Investor Advocate.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 919D; amending section 4(g) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (as added by section 914) by adding: (8) OMBUDSMAN.</ref> The investor advisory committee was actually created in 2009 and, therefore, it predates the Act's passage. However, it is specifically authorized under the Act.<ref name="SkaddenCommentary"/>
* SEC is specifically authorized to issue "point-of-sale disclosure" rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest.<ref name=SkaddenCommentary/>{{rp|160–1}} This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules between 2004 and 2005.<ref>For the 2005 proposed rule, see [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/33-8544.htm Point of Sale Disclosure Requirements and Confirmation Requirements for Transactions in Mutual Funds, College Savings Plans, and Certain Other Securities, and Amendments to the Registration Form for Mutual Funds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504144743/https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/33-8544.htm |date=2017-05-04 }}, via sec.gov</ref> These proposed rules generated opposition because they were perceived as burdensome to broker–dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions; they were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and they could allow the customer to request disclosures specific to the amount of their investment. To determine the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to perform "investor testing" and to rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 912; adding to Section 19 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] ({{USC|15|77s}}) by adding (e)Evaluation of Rules or Programs</ref>

Subtitle A provides authority for the SEC to impose regulations requiring "[[fiduciary duty]]" by broker–dealers to their customers.<ref name=SkaddenCommentary/>{{rp|158}} Although the Act does not create such a duty immediately, it does authorize the SEC to establish a standard. It also requires the SEC to study the [[standards of care]] that broker–dealers and investment advisers apply to their customers and to report to Congress on the results within six months.<ref name=SkaddenCommentary/> Under the law, commission and limited product range would not violate the duty and broker–dealers would not have a continuing duty after receiving the investment advice.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 913(g); amending section 15 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78o}}) by adding at the end: (k) STANDARD OF CONDUCT</ref>

====Subtitle B—Increasing Regulatory Enforcement and Remedies====
Subtitle B gives the SEC further powers of enforcement, including a "whistleblower bounty program",<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 922; The [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{Usctc|15|2B}}) by inserting: SEC. 21F. SECURITIES WHISTLEBLOWER INCENTIVES AND PROTECTION.</ref> which is partially based upon the successful ''qui tam'' provisions of the 1986 Amendments to the False Claims Act as well as an IRS whistleblower reward program Congress created in 2006. The SEC program rewards individuals providing information resulting in an SEC enforcement action in which more than $1 million in sanctions is ordered.<ref name="Office of the Whistleblower"/> Whistleblower rewards range from 10 to 30 percent of the recovery.

====Subtitle C—Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies====
Recognizing credit ratings that credit rating agencies had issued, including [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s (NRSROs), are matters of national public interest, that credit rating agencies are critical "gatekeepers" in the debt market central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy, Congress expanded regulation of credit rating agencies.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 931(1)</ref>

Subtitle C cites findings of conflicts of interest and inaccuracies during the recent financial crisis contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the US economy as factors necessitating increased accountability and transparency by credit rating agencies.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 931(5)</ref>

Subtitle C mandates the creation by the SEC of an Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to provide oversight over NRSROs and enhanced regulation of such entities.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 932(p)</ref>

Enhanced regulations of [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s (NRSROs) include the following:
* Establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings.<ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/>
* Submit to the OCR an annual internal control report.
* Adhere to rules established by the Commission to prevent sales and marketing considerations from influencing the ratings issued by a NRSRO.
* Policies and procedures with regard to (1) certain employment transitions to avoid conflicts of interest, (2) the processing of complaints regarding NRSRO noncompliance, and (3) notification to users of identified significant errors are required.
* Compensation of the compliance officer may not be linked to the financial performance of the NRSRO.
* The duty to report to appropriate authorities credible allegations of unlawful conduct by issuers of securities.<ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/>
* The consideration of credible information about an issuer from sources other than the issuer or underwriter that is potentially significant to a rating decision.
* The Act establishes corporate governance, organizational, and management of conflict of interest guidelines. A minimum of 2 independent directors is required.<ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173"/>

Subtitle C grants the Commission some authority to either temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of an NRSRO respecting a particular class or subclass of securities if after noticing and hearing that the NRSRO lacks the resources to produce credit ratings with integrity.<ref name="USBill|111|HR|4173">{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 932</ref>  Additional key provisions of the Act are
* The Commission shall prescribe rules with respect to credit rating procedures and methodologies.
* OCR is required to conduct an examination of each NRSRO at least annually and shall produce a public inspection report.
* To facilitate transparency of credit ratings performance, the Commission shall require NRSROs to publicly disclose information on initial and revised credit ratings issued, including the credit rating methodology utilized and data relied on, to enable users to evaluate NRSROs.

Moreover, Subtitle C requires the SEC to conduct a study on strengthening the NRSRO's independence, and it recommends the organization to utilize its rule-making authority to establish guidelines preventing improper conflicts of interest arising from the performance of services unrelated to the issuance of credit ratings such as consulting, advisory, and other services.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 939C</ref> The Act requires the comptroller general of the United States to conduct a study on alternative business models for compensating NRSROs<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 939E</ref>

====Subtitle D—Improvements to the Asset-backed Securitization Process====
In Subtitle D, the term "Asset-Backed Security" is defined as a fixed-income or other security collateralized by any self-liquidating financial asset, such as a loan, lease, mortgage, allowing the owner of the asset-backed security to receive payments depending on the cash flow of the (ex.) loan. For regulation purposes, asset-backed securities include (but are not limited to)<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 941; amending section 3(a) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ({{USC|15|78c(a)}}) by adding: (77) ASSET-BACKED SECURITY</ref>
* collateralized mortgage obligation
* collateralized debt obligation (CDOs)
* collateralized bond obligation
* collateralized debt obligation of asset-backed securities
* collateralized debt obligation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs Squared)

** The representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors
** How they differ from the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities
* Require any securitizer to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase requests across all trusts aggregated by the securitizer, so that investors may identify asset originators with clear underwriting deficiencies

The SEC shall also prescribe a [[due diligence]] analysis/review of the assets underlying the security, and a disclosure of that analysis.

===Title XIV—Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act===
Title XIV, or the "Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act",<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1400</ref> whose subtitles A, B, C, and E are designated as Enumerated Consumer Law, which will be administered by the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1440</ref>  The section focuses on standardizing data collection for underwriting and imposes obligations on mortgage originators to only lend to borrowers who are likely to repay their loans.

====Subtitle A—Residential Mortgage Loan Organization Standards====
A "Residential Mortgage Originator" is defined as any person who either receives compensation for or represents to the public that they will take a residential loan application, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, or negotiate terms for a loan. A residential Mortgage Originator is not a person who provides financing to an individual for the purchase of 3 or less<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/policy-legislation/congress/Dodd-Frank-Summary-XIV-Subt-A-Ccomprehensivefinal.pdf|title=Summary of Key Provisions: Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.

For any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage originator may receive compensation that varies based on the term of the loan, other than the principal amount. In general, the mortgage originator can only receive payment from the consumer, except as provided in rules that may be established by the Board. Additionally, the mortgage originator must verify the consumer's ability to pay. A violation of the "ability to repay" standard, or a mortgage that has excessive fees or abusive terms, may be raised as a foreclosure defense by a borrower against a lender without regard to any statute of limitations. The Act bans the payment of yield spread premiums or other originator compensation that is based on the interest rate or other terms of the loans.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1403; amending section 129B of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (as added by section 1402(a)) by inserting: (c) PROHIBITION ON STEERING INCENTIVES</ref>

====Subtitle B—Minimum Standards for Mortgages====
In effect, this section of the Act establishes national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the loan originator shall make a reasonable and [[good faith effort]] based on verified and documented information that "at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including [[mortgage insurance|mortgage guarantee insurance]]), and other assessments". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a [[second mortgage]] or other subordinate loans. Income verification is mandated for residential mortgages.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1411; amending chapter 2 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1631}} et seq.) by inserting: § 129C. Minimum standards for residential mortgage loans</ref> Certain loan provisions, including prepayment penalties on some loans, and mandatory arbitration on all residential loans, are prohibited.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1414; amending section 129C of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] by inserting: (c) PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN PREPAYMENT PENALTIES</ref>

This section also defined a "Qualified Mortgage" as any residential mortgage loan that the regular periodic payments for the loan does not increase the principal balance or allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (with some exceptions), and has points and fees being less than 3% of the loan amount. The Qualified Mortgage terms are important to the extent that the loan terms plus an "Ability to Pay" presumption create a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] situation concerning certain technical provisions related to foreclosure.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1412; amending section 129C of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] by inserting: (b) PRESUMPTION OF ABILITY TO REPAY</ref>

====Subtitle C—High-Cost Mortgages====
A "High-Cost Mortgage" as well as a [[reverse mortgage]] are sometimes referred to as "certain home mortgage transactions" in the Fed's [[Regulation Z]] (the regulation used to implement various sections of the [[Truth in Lending Act]]) High-Cost Mortgage is redefined as a "consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling" (excluding reverse mortgages that are covered in separate sections), which include:<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1431; DEFINED.—Section 103(aa) of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1602(aa))}} by striking all that precedes paragraph (2) and inserting: ''(aa) HIGH-COST MORTGAGE''</ref>
* Credit Transactions secured by consumer's principal dwelling and interest rate is 6.5% more than the [[prime rate]] for comparable transactions
* subordinated (ex. [[second mortgage]]) if secured by consumer's principal dwelling and interest rate is 8.5% more than the [[prime rate]] for comparable transactions
* Points and Fees, excluding [[Mortgage Insurance]], if the transaction is:
** less than $20,000, total points and fees greater than 8% or $1000
** greater than $20,000, total points and fees greater than 6%
* under certain conditions, if the fees and points may be collected more than 36 months after loan is executed
New provisions for calculating adjustable rates as well as definitions for points and fees are also included.

When receiving a High-Cost mortgage, the consumer must obtain pre-loan counseling from a certified counselor.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639)}} by inserting: (u) PRE-LOAN COUNSELING</ref> The Act also stipulates there are additional "Requirements to Existing Residential Mortgages". The changes to existing contracts are:
* disallowing Balloon Payments<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1432; amending section 129(e) of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1639(e)}}) is amended to read as follows: (e) NO BALLOON PAYMENTS.—No high-cost mortgage may contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This subsection shall not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer.</ref>

Subtitle E concerns jumbo rules concerning escrow and settlement procedures for people who are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established [[escrow]] or impound account for the payment of taxes, [[hazard insurance]], and (if applicable) [[flood insurance]], [[mortgage insurance]], ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1461; amending chapter 2 of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] ({{USC|15|1631}} et seq.): § 129D. Escrow or impound accounts relating to certain consumer credit transactions</ref> If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer in the absence of any such account.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1462; amending section 129D of the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (as added by section 1461) by adding: (j) Disclosure Notice Required For Consumers Who Waive Escrow Services</ref> The amendments to the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a [[Mortgage servicer]] (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 1463; amending section 6 of the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974]] ({{USC|12|2605}}) by adding: (k) Servicer Prohibitions</ref>

===Legislative reaction===
Senator [[Chris Dodd]], who co-proposed the legislation, has classified the legislation as "sweeping, bold, comprehensive, [and] long overdue". In regards to the Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that "[...] I really want the Federal Reserve to get back to its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're going to go back and expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is going in the wrong way." However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of [[Ben Bernanke|Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke]], but rather that "[i]t's about putting together an architecture that works".<ref name=hpost1>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/dodds-proposed-financial_n_352235.html|title=Dodd's Banking Bill Takes The Fed Down A Notch Or Two: HELP US DIG THROUGH IT|first=Shahien|last=Nasiripour|author2=Ryan Grim|work=Huffington Post|date=November 10, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075329/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/dodds-proposed-financial_n_352235.html|archive-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

Dodd felt it would be a “huge mistake” to craft the bill under the auspices of bipartisan compromise stating “(y)ou’re given very few moments in history to make this kind of a difference, and we're trying to do that." Put another way, Dodd construed the lack of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] amendments as a sign "[...] that the bill is a strong one".<ref name=hpost1 /><ref name=wpost1>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/09/AR2009110901935.html?hpid=topnews|title=Legislation by Senator Dodd would overhaul banking regulators|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|author2=Brady Dennis|work=Washington Post|date=November 11, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115042834/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/09/AR2009110901935.html?hpid=topnews|archive-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>

[[Richard Shelby]], the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and the one who proposed the changes to the Fed governance, voiced his reasons for why he felt the changes needed to be made: "It's an obvious conflict of interest [...] It's basically a case where the banks are choosing or having a big voice in choosing their regulator.

The Dodd–Frank Act has several provisions that call upon the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to implement several new rules and regulations that will affect [[corporate governance]] issues surrounding public corporations in the United States. Many of the provisions put in place by Dodd–Frank require the SEC to implement new regulations, but intentionally do not give specifics as to when regulations should be adopted or exactly what the regulations should be.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://whoswholegal.com/news/features/article/29010/corporate-governance-reform-impact-dodd-frank-act/|title=Corporate Governance and Reform – The Impact of the Dodd–Frank Act|last=Cogut|first=Casey|date=June 2011|website=Who's Who Legal|publisher=Who's Who Legal|access-date=3 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110112354/http://whoswholegal.com/news/features/article/29010/corporate-governance-reform-impact-dodd-frank-act/|archive-date=10 November 2016}}</ref> This will allow the SEC to implement new regulations over several years and make adjustments as it analyzes the environment.<ref name=":0" /> Public companies will have to work to adopt new policies in order to adapt to the changing regulatory environment they will face over the coming years.

Section 952 of Dodd–Frank deals with independent [[compensation committee]]s as well as their advisors and legal teams.<ref name=":1" /> These provisions require the SEC to make national [[stock exchange]]s set standards for the compensation committees of publicly traded companies listed on these exchanges.<ref name=":1" /> Under these standards national stock exchanges are prohibited from listing public companies that do not have an independent compensation committee.<ref name=":3" /> To insure that compensation committees remain independent, the SEC is required to identify any areas that may create a potential conflict of interest and work to define exactly what requirements must be met for the committee to be considered independent.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> Some of the areas examined for conflicts of interest include other services provided by advisors, personal relationships between advisors and shareholders, advisor fees as a percentage of their company's revenue, and advisors' stock holdings.<ref name=":4" /> These provisions also cover advisors and legal teams serving compensation committees by requiring proxy statements to disclose any compensation consultants and include a review of each to ensure no conflicts of interest exist.<ref name=":2" /> Compensation committees are fully responsible for selecting advisors and determining their compensation.<ref name=":4" /> Final regulations covering issues surrounding compensation committees were implemented in June 2012 by the SEC and took effect in July 2012.<ref name=":1" /> Under these regulations the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and [[NASDAQ]] also added their own rules regarding the retention of committee advisors.<ref name=":5" /> These regulations were approved by the SEC in 2013 and took full effect in early 2014.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5" />

Section 953 of Dodd–Frank deals with [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay for performance]] policies to determine executive compensation.<ref name=":1" /> Provisions from this section require the SEC to make regulations regarding the disclosure of executive compensation as well as regulations on how executive compensation is determined.<ref name=":3" /> New regulations require that compensation paid to executives be directly linked to financial performance including consideration of any changes in the value of the company's stock price or value of dividends paid out.<ref name=":2" /> The compensation of executives and the financial performance justifying it are both required to be disclosed.<ref name=":4" /> In addition, regulations require that CEO compensation be disclosed alongside the median employee compensation excluding CEO compensation, along with ratios comparing levels of compensation between the two.<ref name=":4" /> Regulations regarding pay for performance were proposed by the SEC in September 2013 and were adopted in August 2015.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/08/14/sec-adopts-ceo-pay-ratio-disclosure-rule/|title=SEC Adopts CEO pay Ratio Disclosure Rule|last=Gregory|first=Holly|date=14 August 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110112340/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/08/14/sec-adopts-ceo-pay-ratio-disclosure-rule/|archive-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>

Section 954 of Dodd–Frank deals with [[clawback]] of compensation policies, which work to ensure that executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting.<ref name=":1" /> These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies.<ref name=":3" /> These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, in the case of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements.<ref name=":3" /> If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement.<ref name=":4" /> The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/10/28/the-sec-proposed-clawback-rule/|title=The SEC Proposed Clawback Rule|last=Bachelder|first=Joseph|date=28 October 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110648/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/10/28/the-sec-proposed-clawback-rule/|archive-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>

Section 955 of Dodd–Frank deals with employees' and directors' hedging practices.<ref name=":3" /> These provisions stipulate that the SEC must implement rules requiring public companies to disclose in proxy statements whether or not employees and directors of the company are permitted to hold a [[Short (finance)|short position]] on any equity shares of the company.<ref name=":3" /> This applies to both employees and directors who are compensated with company stock as well as those who are simply owners of company stock.<ref name=":4" /> The SEC proposed rules regarding hedging in February 2015.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/16/aligning-the-interests-of-company-executives-and-directors-with-shareholders/|title=Aligning the Interest of Company Executives and Directors with Shareholders|last=Aguilar|first=Luis|date=16 February 2015|website=Harvard Law School Forum|publisher=Harvard Law School|access-date=3 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110529/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/16/aligning-the-interests-of-company-executives-and-directors-with-shareholders/|archive-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>

Section 957 deals with broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with executive compensation.<ref name=":3" /> While section 951 requires say on pay and golden parachute votes from shareholders, section 957 requires national exchanges to prohibit brokers from voting on executive compensation.<ref name=":1" /> In addition, the provisions in this section prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue as determined by the SEC including the election of board members.<ref name=":3" /> This gives shareholders more influence on important issues since brokers tend to vote shares in favor of executives.<ref name=":3" /> Brokers may only vote shares if they are directly instructed to do so by shareholders associated with the shares.<ref name=":2" /> The SEC approved the listing rules set forth by the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding provisions from section 957 in September 2010.<ref name=":5" />

Additional provisions set forth by Dodd–Frank in section 972 require public companies to disclose in proxy statements reasons for why the current CEO and chairman of the board hold their positions.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The same rule applies to new appointments for CEO or [[chairman of the board]].<ref name=":2" /> Public companies must find reasons supporting their decisions to retain an existing chairman of the board or CEO or reasons for selecting new ones to keep shareholders informed.<ref name=":6" />

Provisions from Dodd–Frank found in section 922 also address [[Whistleblower|whistle blower]] protection.<ref name=":1" /> Under new regulations any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can be rewarded with substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected.<ref name=":4" /> Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars.<ref name=":4" /> These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers the right to have a jury trial if they feel they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing.<ref name=":4" /> If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees.<ref name=":4" /> This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations.<ref name=":4" /> The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.<ref name=":1" />

Section 971 of Dodd–Frank deals with proxy access and shareholders' ability to nominate candidates for director positions in public companies.<ref name=":3" /> Provisions in the section allow shareholders to use proxy materials to contact and form groups with other shareholders in order to nominate new potential directors.<ref name=":0" /> In the past, activist investors had to pay to have materials prepared and mailed to other investors in order to solicit their help on issues.<ref name=":0" /> Any shareholder group that has held at least three percent of voting shares for a period of at least three years is entitled to make director nominations.<ref name=":4" /> However, shareholder groups may not nominate more than twenty five percent of a company's board and may always nominate at least one member even if that one nomination would represent over twenty five percent of the board.<ref name=":4" /> If multiple shareholder groups make nominations then the nominations from groups with the most voting power will be considered first with additional nominations being considered up to the twenty five percent cap.<ref name=":4" />

== Impact ==
===Congressional Budget Office===
On April 21, 2010, the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] released a cost-estimate of enacting the legislation. In its introduction, the CBO briefly discussed the legislation and then went on to generally state that it is unable to assess the cost of financial crises under current law, and added that estimating the cost of similar crises under this legislation (or other proposed ideas) is equally (and inherently) difficult: "[...] CBO has not determined whether the estimated costs under the Act would be smaller or larger than the costs of alternative approaches to addressing future financial crises and the risks they pose to the economy as a whole."<ref name="cbo_costestimate1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11454/s3217.pdf|title=Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213341/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11454/s3217.pdf|archive-date=April 29, 2010}}</ref>

In terms of the impact on the federal budget, the CBO estimates that deficits would reduce between 2011–2020, in part due to the risk-based assessment fees levied to initially capitalize the Orderly Liquidation Fund; after which, a growing amount of revenue for the Fund would be derived from interest payments (which are not counted as budgetary receipts, and therefore do not affect the federal deficit, having the effect of negatively impacting budget figures related to the Fund). As such, the CBO projects that eventually the money being paid into the Fund (in the form of fees) would be exceeded by the expenses of the Fund itself.<ref name=cbo_costestimate1 />

The cost estimate also raises questions about the time-frame of capitalizing the Fund – their estimate took the projected value of fees collected for the Fund (and interest collected on the Fund) weighed against the expected expense of having to deal with corporate default(s) until 2020. Their conclusion was it would take longer than 10 years to fully capitalize the Fund (at which point they estimated it would be approximately 45 billion), although no specifics beyond that were expressed.<ref name=cbo_costestimate1 />

The projection was a $5 billion or more deficit increase in at least one of the four consecutive ten-year periods starting in 2021.<ref name=cbo_costestimate1 />

===Effects on small banks===
Associated Press reported that in response to the costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking.<ref>[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/say_goodbye_to_traditional_fre.html Say goodbye to traditional free checking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029163755/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/say_goodbye_to_traditional_fre.html |date=2010-10-29 }}, Associated Press, October 25, 2010</ref> Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations.

Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best and very likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|title=The State and Fate of Community Banking|last1=Lux|first1=Marshall|date=2015|publisher=Harvard Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government|last2=Robert|first2=Greene|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120070545/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37|archive-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>

However, the Office of Management and Budget attempts to "monetize" benefits versus costs to prove the contrary. The result is a positive relationship where benefits exceed costs: "During a 10-year period OMB reviewed 106 major regulations for which cost and benefit data were available [...] $136 billion to $651 billion in annual benefits versus $44 billion to $62 billion in annual costs" (Shapiro and Irons, 2011, p.&nbsp;8).<ref>{{cite news |id={{ProQuest|911202396}} |first1=John |last1=Irons |first2=Isaac |last2=Shapiro |date=12 April 2011 |title=Regulation, employment, and the economy: Fears of job loss are overblown |url=https://www.epi.org/publication/regulation_employment_and_the_economy_fears_of_job_loss_are_overblown/ |work=Economic Policy Institute }}</ref>

=== Scholarly views ===
According to Federal Reserve Chairwoman [[Janet Yellen]] in August 2017, "The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://econofact.org/the-dodd-frank-financial-reform|title=The Dodd–Frank Financial Reform {{!}} Econofact|date=2017-09-08|work=Econofact|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911063227/http://econofact.org/the-dodd-frank-financial-reform|archive-date=2017-09-11}}</ref>

Some experts have argued that Dodd–Frank does not protect consumers adequately and does not end [[too big to fail]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Strong Enough for Tough Stains?|date=June 25, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27gret.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=2010-06-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628152333/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27gret.html|archive-date=June 28, 2010}}</ref>

Law professor and bankruptcy expert David Skeel concluded that the law has two major themes: "government partnership with the largest Wall Street banks and financial institutions" and "a system of ad hoc interventions by regulators that are divorced from basic rule-of-law constraints". While he states that "the overall pattern of the legislation is disturbing", he also concludes that some are clearly helpful, such as the derivatives exchanges and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<ref>Skeel, David 2010.

Regarding the Republican-led rollback of some provisions of Dodd-Frank in 2018, this move from increased regulation after a crisis to deregulation during an economic boom has been a recurrent feature in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=Regulatory Cycles: Revisiting the Political Economy of Financial Crises|publisher=SSRN|date=May 1, 2016|ssrn=2772373}}</ref>

===Whistleblower-driven settlements===
The SEC's 2017 annual report on the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program stated: "Since the program’s inception, the SEC has ordered wrongdoers in enforcement matters involving whistleblower information to pay over $975 million in total monetary sanctions, including more than $671 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and interest, the majority of which has been...returned to harmed investors."  Whistleblowers receive 10–30% of this amount under the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-2017-annual-report-whistleblower-program.pdf|title=SEC-2017 Annual Report to Congress-Whistleblower Program-November 15, 2017|website=sec.gov|access-date=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414183332/https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-2017-annual-report-whistleblower-program.pdf|archive-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> A decade after it was created, the SEC whistleblower program has enabled the SEC to take enforcement actions resulting in over $2.5 billion in financial remedies and putting about $500 million in the pockets of defrauded investors. In addition, the incentives have generated more than 33,300 tips.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-than-33000-tips-25-billion-in-financial-remedies-and-500-million-in-awards-to-investors-the-secs-whistleblower-program-turns-10-years-old-today-2020-07-21 |title=More than 33,000 tips, $2.5 billion in financial remedies and $500 million in awards to investors — the SEC's whistleblower program turns 10 years old today|website=marketwatch.com|access-date=23 July 202}}</ref>

===Consumer Financial Protection Bureau activities===
The Act established the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB), which has the mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets. Then-CFPB Director Richard Cordray testified on April 5, 2017 that: "Over the past five years, we have returned almost $12 billion to 29 million consumers and imposed about $600 million in civil penalties."<ref name="consumerfinance.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-opening-statement-cfpb-director-richard-cordray-house-committee-financial-services/|title=Prepared Opening Statement of CFPB Director Richard Cordray Before the House Committee on Financial Services - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|website=consumerfinance.gov|access-date=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504224258/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-opening-statement-cfpb-director-richard-cordray-house-committee-financial-services/|archive-date=4 May 2018}}</ref> The CFPB publishes a semi-annual report on its activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/semi-annual-report-spring-2017/|title=Semi-Annual Report Spring 2017 - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|website=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|access-date=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505004424/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/semi-annual-report-spring-2017/|archive-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>
