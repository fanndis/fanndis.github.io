He was born in Berlin, the son of Jewish architect [[Ernst L. Freud]] and the grandson of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud got his first name "Lucian" from his mother in memory of the ancient writer [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]. His family moved to England in 1933 to escape the rise of [[Nazism]]. From 1942–43 he attended [[Goldsmiths College]], London. He served at sea with the British [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] during the [[Second World War]].

His early career as a painter was influenced by [[surrealism]], but by the early 1950s his often stark and alienated paintings tended towards realism.<ref>"[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/lucian-freud-1120 Lucian Freud 1922–2011]. Tate. Retrieved October 2016</ref> Freud was an intensely private and guarded man, and his paintings, completed over a 60-year career, are mostly of friends and family. They are generally sombre and thickly [[impasto]]ed, often set in unsettling interiors and urban landscapes. The works are noted for their psychological penetration and often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. Freud worked from life studies, and was known for asking for extended and punishing sittings from his models.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Roberta |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/arts/design/14freu.html |title=Lucian Freud Stripped Bare|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 December 2007 |access-date=2011-07-22}}</ref>

==Early career==
Freud briefly studied at the [[Central School of Art]] in London, and from 1939 to 1942 with greater success at [[Cedric Morris]]' [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]] in [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]], relocated in 1940 to Benton End, a house near [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]]. He also attended [[Goldsmiths' College]], part of the [[University of London]], in 1942–43. He served as a merchant seaman in an Atlantic convoy in 1941 before being invalided out of service in 1942.

In 1943, the poet and editor [[Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu]] commissioned the young artist to illustrate a book of poems by [[Nicholas Moore]] entitled ''The Glass Tower''. It was published the following year by [[Poetry London|Editions Poetry London]] and comprised, among other drawings, a stuffed zebra and a palm tree. Both subjects reappeared in ''The Painter's Room'' on display at Freud's first solo exhibition in 1944 at the [[Lefevre Gallery]]. In the summer of 1946, he travelled to Paris before continuing to Greece for several months to visit [[John Craxton]].<ref>"From late 1946 to early 1947, he and Freud painted on Poros" – [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/19/john-craxton-obituary John Craxton Guardian Obituary]</ref> In the early fifties he was a frequent visitor to Dublin where he would share [[Patrick Swift|Patrick Swift's]] studio.<ref>"He had met Freud by 1949...the acquaintance was well-developed by 1950 when we shared the ground-floor of a house in Hatch Street together. Lucian, who was staying in Ireland, used to come around in the mornings to paint, so that sometimes when I would surface around ten or eleven I would find them both at work in the studio next door." — Anthony Cronin, Patrick Swift (1927–83), IMMA Retrospective Catalogue, 1993; "Freud… came to Dublin in 1948… In September 1951 Kitty Garman wrote to her mother… She mentions Freud working on a painting in Paddy Swift's Hatch Street studio, ''Dead Cock's Head'' 1951" – [http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/gliemde/AH319-001/handouts/British%20Art,%201760-1960/Lucien%20Freud,%20Prophet%20of%20Discomfort.pdf Freud: Prophet of Discomfort] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119192212/http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/gliemde/AH319-001/handouts/British%20Art,%201760-1960/Lucien%20Freud,%20Prophet%20of%20Discomfort.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}, Mic Moroney, ''Irish Arts Review'', 2007</ref> He remained a Londoner for the rest of his life.

Freud was one of a number of figurative artists who were later characterised by artist [[R. B. Kitaj]] as a group named the "School of London".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/school-london| title = Art term: The School of London| date = April 10, 2017| access-date = July 16, 2019| publisher = tate.org}}</ref><ref>Kitaj's essay in the catalogue for ''The Human Clay'' exhibition, [[Hayward Gallery]], London, 1976.</ref> This group was a loose collection of individual artists who knew each other, some intimately, and were working in London at the same time in the figurative style. The group was active contemporaneously with the boom years of [[abstract expressionism|abstract painting]] and in contrast to [[abstract expressionism]]. Major figures in the group included Freud, Kitaj, [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], [[Robert MacBryde]], and [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]. Freud was a visiting tutor at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] of [[University College London]] from 1949 to 1954.

==Mature style==
[[File:Freud, girl-white-dog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Girl with a White Dog'', 1951–1952, [[Tate Gallery]]. Portrait of Freud's first wife, [[Kitty Garman]], the daughter of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Kathleen Garman]]]]
Freud's early paintings, which are mostly very small, are often associated with German [[Expressionism]] (an influence he tended to deny) and [[Surrealism]] in depicting people, plants and animals in unusual juxtapositions. Some very early works anticipate the varied flesh tones of his mature style, for example ''[[Cedric Morris]]'' (1940, [[National Museum of Wales]]), but after the end of the war he developed a thinly painted very precise linear style with muted colours, best known in his self-portrait ''Man with Thistle'' (1946, Tate)<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=4554&searchid=9865 Tate, ''Man with Thistle'']</ref> and a series of large-eyed portraits of his first wife, [[Kitty Garman]], such as ''Girl with a Kitten'' (1947, Tate).<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=112&searchid=9940 Tate, ''Girl with a Kitten'']</ref> These were painted with tiny [[sable]] brushes and evoke [[Early Netherlandish painting]].<ref>NPG, section (= room) I, [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=4554&searchid=9865 Tate, ''Man with Thistle'']</ref>

From the 1950s, he began to focus on portraiture, often nudes (though his first full length nude was not painted until 1966),<ref name="NPG, II">NPG, II</ref> to the almost complete exclusion of everything else, and by the middle of the decade developed a much more free style using large hog's-hair brushes, concentrating on the texture and colour of flesh, and much thicker paint, including [[impasto]]. ''Girl with a White Dog'', 1951–1952, (Tate) is an example of a transitional work in this process, sharing many characteristics with paintings before and after it, with relatively tight brushwork and a middling size and viewpoint. He would often clean his brush after each stroke when painting flesh, so that the colour remained constantly variable. He also started to paint standing up, which continued until old age, when he switched to a high chair.<ref name="NPG, II"/> The colours of non-flesh areas in these paintings are typically muted, while the flesh becomes increasingly highly and variably coloured. By about 1960, Freud had established the style that he would use, with some changes, for the rest of his career. The later portraits often use an over life-size scale, but are of mostly relatively small heads or in half-lengths. Later portraits are often much larger. In his late career he often followed a portrait by producing an [[etching]] of the subject in a different pose, drawing directly onto the plate, with the sitter in his view.<ref>NPG, "Etchings"</ref>

Freud's portraits often depict only the sitter, sometimes sprawled naked on the floor or on a bed or alternatively juxtaposed with something else, as in ''Girl With a White Dog'' (1951–52) and ''Naked Man With Rat'' (1977–78).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.artnet.com/images_US/magazine/features/kuspit/kuspit10-06-05-26.jpg|title=''Naked Man With Rat''|access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref> According to [[Edward Chaney]], "The distinctive, recumbent manner in which Freud poses so many of his sitters suggests the conscious or unconscious influence both of his grandfather's psychoanalytical couch and of the Egyptian mummy, his dreaming figures, clothed or nude, staring into space until (if ever) brought back to health and/or consciousness. The particular application of this supine pose to freaks, friends, wives, mistresses, dogs, daughters and mother alike (the latter regularly depicted after her suicide attempt and eventually, literally mummy-like in death), tends to support this hypothesis."<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], 'Freudian Egypt', ''The London Magazine'' (April/May 2006), pp. 62–69, complete refs in Chaney, Edward (2006).

Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, pp. 39–69.</ref>

The use of animals in his compositions is widespread, and often he features a pet and its owner. Other examples of portraits with both animals and people in Freud's work include ''Guy and Speck'' (1980–81), ''Eli and David'' (2005–06) and ''Double Portrait'' (1985–86).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/microsites/art_collection/home/the-collection/a-z/artworks/freud-lucian/double_portrait.html|title=UBS Art Collection: A-Z|access-date=19 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826122402/https://www.ubs.com/microsites/art_collection/home/the-collection/a-z/artworks/freud-lucian/double_portrait.html|archive-date=26 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He had a special passion for horses, having enjoyed riding at school in Dartington, where he sometimes slept in the stables.<ref>Gayford, Martin [http://apollo-magazine.co.uk/november-2006/68414/freuds-animals.thtml "Freud's Animals"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811150849/http://apollo-magazine.co.uk/november-2006/68414/freuds-animals.thtml |date=11 August 2011 }}, ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'', 2006-11-01.

Wilting houseplants feature prominently in some portraits, especially in the 1960s, and Freud also produced a number of paintings purely of plants.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=4556&searchid=9940 Tate, ''Two Plants 1977–80'']</ref> Other regular features included mattresses in earlier works, and huge piles of the [[linen]] rags with which he used to clean his brushes in later ones.<ref>NPG, VII; [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=18957&searchid=9940 Tate, ''Standing by the Rags'', 1988-9]</ref> Some portraits, especially in the 1980s, have very carefully painted views of London roofscapes seen through the studio windows.<ref>NPG, IV & 25</ref>

Freud's subjects, who needed to make a very large and uncertain commitment of their time, were often the people in his life; friends, family, fellow painters, lovers, children. He said, "The subject matter is autobiographical, it's all to do with hope and memory and sensuality and involvement, really."<ref>[http://collection.britishcouncil.org/exhibition/past/12/15249 "Lucian Freud"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203302/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/exhibition/past/12/15249 |date=29 June 2011 }}, British Council, 2009. Retrieved December 18, 2010.</ref> However the titles were mostly anonymous, and the identity of the sitter not always disclosed; the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire had a portrait of one of Freud's daughters as a baby for several years before he mentioned who the model was. In the 1970s Freud spent 4,000 hours on a series of paintings of his mother, about which art historian [[Lawrence Gowing]] observed "it is more than 300 years since a painter showed as directly and as visually his relationship with his mother. And that was Rembrandt."<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Jerene |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20070693,00.html |title=Is Lucian Freud's Relationship with Mother Odd, or Is It Art?|work=People |date=24 April 1978 |access-date=2011-07-22}}</ref>

Freud painted from life, and usually spent a great deal of time with each subject, demanding the model's presence even while working on the background of the portrait. ''Ria, Naked Portrait 2007'', a nude completed in 2007, required sixteen months of work, with the model, Ria Kirby, posing all but four evenings during that time. With each session averaging five hours, the painting took approximately 2,400 hours to complete.<ref name="MM">{{cite news|author=Martin Gayford|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3668104/Lucian-Freud-marathon-man.html |title=Gayford, Martin.

It was Freud's practice to begin a painting by first drawing in charcoal on the canvas. He then applied paint to a small area of the canvas, and gradually worked outward from that point. For a new sitter, he often started with the head as a means of "getting to know" the person, then painted the rest of the figure, eventually returning to the head as his comprehension of the model deepened.<ref name="MM"/> A section of canvas was intentionally left bare until the painting was finished.<ref name="MM"/> The finished painting is an accumulation of richly worked layers of pigment, as well as months of intense observation.<ref name="MM"/>

Freud painted fellow artists, including [[Frank Auerbach]] and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and produced a large number of portraits of the [[performance art]]ist [[Leigh Bowery]]. He also painted [[Henrietta Moraes]], a muse to many Soho artists.
