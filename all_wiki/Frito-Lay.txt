'''Frito-Lay, Inc.''' is an American [[subsidiary]] of [[PepsiCo]] that manufactures, markets, and sells [[corn chips]], [[potato chips]], and other [[snack foods]].

The primary snack food brands produced under the Frito-Lay name include [[Fritos]] corn chips, [[Cheetos]] cheese-flavored snacks; [[Doritos]] and [[Tostitos]] tortilla chips; [[Lay's]] and [[Ruffles]] potato chips; [[Rold Gold]] pretzels; and [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]] potato crisps (in the UK and Ireland). Each brand generated annual worldwide sales over $1&nbsp;billion in 2009.<ref name="largestbrands">{{cite web |title=PepsiCo, Inc. 2009 Annual Report: Financial Highlights - Largest Brands |url=http://pepsico.com/annual09/financialHigh_mega_brands.html |publisher=PepsiCo, Inc. |access-date=19 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221213844/http://pepsico.com/annual09/financialHigh_mega_brands.html|archive-date=21 December 2010}}</ref>

Frito-Lay began in the early 1930s as two separate companies, '''The Frito Company''' and '''H. W. Lay & Company''', which merged in 1961 to form Frito-Lay, Inc. Four years later in 1965, Frito-Lay, Inc. merged with the Pepsi-Cola Company, resulting in the formation of [[PepsiCo]]. Since that time, Frito-Lay has operated as a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] of PepsiCo. Through Frito-Lay, [[PepsiCo]] is the largest globally distributed snack food company, with sales of its products in 2009 comprising 40 percent of all "savory snacks" sold in the [[United States]], and 30 percent of the non-U.S. market. In 2018, Frito-Lay [[North America]] accounted for 25 percent of PepsiCo's annual sales.

==History==

===The Frito Company===
[[image:Frito Kid.jpeg|300px|thumb|left|An [[Animatronics|animatronic]] [[vending machine]] of The Frito Kid at [[Disneyland]]'s Casa De Fritos (currently Rancho Del Zocalo).]]

In 1932, [[Kansas City, Kansas]]-born Charles Elmer Doolin (1903–1959),<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53653707 www.findagrave.com]</ref> manager of the Highland Park Confectionery in [[San Antonio, Texas]], purchased a [[corn chip]] recipe, a handheld [[potato ricer]], and 19 retail accounts from a corn chip manufacturer for $100, which he borrowed from his mother. Doolin established a new corn chip business, The Frito Company, in his mother's kitchen. Doolin, with his mother and brother, produced the corn chips, now named [[Fritos]], and had a production capacity of approximately 10 pounds per day and roughly 30 cents per product. Doolin distributed the Fritos in 5¢ bags. Daily sales totaled $8 to $10 and profits averaged about $2 per day.<ref name="fritohist">{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Davia|title=The Birth of the Frito|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15377830|accessdate=18 December 2010|newspaper=National Public Radio (NPR)|date=18 October 2007|author2=Silva, Nikki}}</ref> In 1933 the production of Fritos increased from 10 pounds to nearly 100 pounds due to the development of a "hammer" press; by the end of the year, production lines were operating in [[Houston]] and [[Dallas]]. The Frito Company headquarters also moved to Dallas to capitalize on the city's central location and better availability of raw materials. In 1937 The Frito Company opened its Research and Development lab and introduced new products, including Fritos Peanut Butter Sandwiches and Fritos Peanuts, to supplement Fritos and Fritatos [[Potato chip]]s, which had been introduced in 1935.<ref name="texasmonthly">{{cite journal|title=The Frito: The venerable corn chip whose life is a Tex-Mex history lesson|journal=Texas Monthly|date=May 1982|pages=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EC4EAAAAMBAJ&q=Fritos%201933%20Dallas&pg=PA138|accessdate=20 December 2010|last1=Communications|first1=Emmis}}</ref>

In 1939, the company purchased Fluffs pork skins and incorporated the Dallas business. Frito relocated the operation from Haskell Avenue to a new facility at 2005 Wall Street. Alice Rupe, who was one of Fluffs' original six all-woman crew, was placed in charge of operations. In 1940, she was named Assistant Treasurer and Manager; in 1949 she was promoted to Treasurer.<ref>''Fritos Bandwagon Twentieth Anniversary Issue''. Dallas: The Frito Company, October 1952. Clementine Paddleford Papers, Richard L.D. & Marjorie J. Morse Department of Special Collections, K-State Libraries.</ref>

In 1941, the company opened its Western Division in [[Los Angeles]] with two sales routes, which would become the prototype for The Frito Company's distribution system. In 1945, The Frito Sales Company was established to separate sales from production activities. Expansion continued with the issue of six franchises through the Frito National Company in the same year. In 1950, Fritos were sold in all 48 states.<ref name=encfood /> The Frito Company issued its first public stock offering in 1954. At the time of Doolin's death in 1959, The Frito Company produced over 40 products, had plants in 18 cities, employed over 3,000 people, and had sales in 1958 in excess of $50&nbsp;million. By 1962, Fritos would be sold in 48 countries.<ref name="oxfordfritolay">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530796-2|pages=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&q=%22Frito-Lay%22%201958%20$50%20million&pg=PT267}}</ref>

===H.W. Lay & Company===
In 1931, [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-born salesman [[Herman Lay]] (1909–1982) sold potato chips in the Southern United States out of his car. In 1932, he began a potato chip business in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Lay was hired as a salesman for the Barrett Food Products Company, an [[Atlanta, Georgia]] manufacturer of Gardner's Potato Chips, and eventually took over Barrett's Nashville warehouse as a distributor. Lay hired his first salesman in 1934, and three years later had 25 employees and a larger manufacturing facility where he produced [[popcorn]] and peanut butter sandwich crackers.<ref name=intldirect />

A representative of the Barrett Food Company contacted Lay in 1938, offering to sell Barrett's plants in Atlanta and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to Lay for $60,000. Lay borrowed $30,000 from a bank and persuaded the Barrett Company to take the difference in preferred stock. Lay moved his headquarters to Atlanta and formed H.W. Lay & Company in 1939. He later purchased the Barrett manufacturing plant in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], along with additional plants in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; and [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. Lay retained the Gardner trademark of Barrett Food Products until 1944, when the product name was changed to [[Lay's]] Potato Chips.<ref name=crunchpotatochiphistory />

Lay expanded further in the 1950s, with the purchase of The Richmond Potato Chip Company and the Capitol Frito Corporation. By 1956, with more than 1,000 employees, plants in eight cities, and branches or warehouses in thirteen others, H.W. Lay & Company was the largest manufacturer of potato chips and snack foods in the United States.<ref name="eathistory">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F. |title=Eating History: Thirty Turning Points in the Making of American Cuisine|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14092-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1514y0UnSdQC&q=Barrett%20Food%20Company%20Lay&pg=PA129|accessdate=20 December 2010|page=129}}</ref>

===Merger forms Frito-Lay, Inc.===
In 1945, the Frito Company granted the H.W. Lay & Company an exclusive franchise to manufacture and distribute Fritos in the Southeast. The two companies worked toward national distribution and developed a close business affiliation. In September 1961, The Frito Company and H.W. Lay & Company merged to become Frito-Lay, Inc.,<ref name="comphistory">{{cite web|title=Frito-Lay History|url=http://www.fritolay.com/about-us/history.html|publisher=Frito-Lay North America, Inc.|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> combining their headquarters in Dallas, Texas. At this point, the company's annual revenues totaled $127&nbsp;million, largely generated from sales of its four main brands at the time: Fritos, Lays, Cheetos, and Ruffles.<ref name="highbeam">{{cite journal|title=Frito-Lay, Inc. Company Profile for Students|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427200107.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105061204/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427200107.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 November 2012|publisher=HighBeam Research|accessdate=20 December 2010|date=1 January 1999}}</ref>

===Division of PepsiCo, Inc.===
In February 1965, the boards of directors for Frito-Lay, Inc. and Pepsi-Cola announced a plan for the merger of the two companies. On June 8, 1965, the merger of Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola Company was approved by shareholders of both companies, and a new company called [[PepsiCo, Inc.]] was formed. At the time of the merger, Frito-Lay owned 46 manufacturing plants nationwide and had more than 150 distribution centers across the United States.<ref name="foodindwars">{{cite book|last=Mazze|first=Edward M.|title=The Food Industry Wars: Marketing Triumphs and Blunders|year=1998|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-1-56720-111-6|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mePkn5BLjLIC&q=%22Frito-Lay%22%20PepsiCo%201965&pg=PA185|author2=Michman, Ronald D.|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

The merger was pursued for multiple factors, one of which was the potential for Frito-Lay snacks to be distributed outside of its initial markets of the United States and Canada—via Pepsi-Cola's existing presence and distribution network in 108 countries at the time of the merger. International distribution of Frito-Lay products expanded shortly following the 1965 merger, and its U.S. presence grew at the same time, resulting in [[Lay's]] becoming the first potato chip brand to be sold nationwide (in all 50 U.S. states) in 1965.<ref name="firstchip">{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of Potato Chips|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/foodrelatedinventions/a/potato_chips.htm|publisher=About.com Inventors|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

Also at this time, PepsiCo had envisioned marketing Frito-Lay snacks alongside Pepsi-Cola soft drinks. In an interview with [[Forbes]] in 1968, PepsiCo CEO [[Donald M. Kendall|Donald Kendall]] summarized this by noting that "Potato chips make you thirsty; Pepsi satisfies thirst." Plans to jointly promote the soft drink and snack products were thwarted later that year, when the [[Federal Trade Commission]] ruled against it.<ref name="crunchpotatochiphistory">{{cite book|last=Burhans|first=Dirk E.|title=Crunch!: a history of the great American potato chip|year=2008|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22770-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4tqtcJGMEkC&q=%22Potato%20chips%20make%20you%20thirsty%3B%20pepsi%20satisfies%22&pg=PA60}}</ref>

====1965–1980====
Upon the formation of PepsiCo, Frito-Lay soon began efforts to expand with the development of new snack food brands in the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Doritos]] (1966), [[Funyuns]] (1969), and [[Munchos]] (1971). The most popular new Frito-Lay product launched during this era was Doritos, which initially was positioned as a more flavorful [[tortilla chip]]. At first the chip was perceived by consumers as being too bland. In response, the company re-launched Doritos in Taco, and later Nacho Cheese, flavors. The spicier composition proved successful, and Doritos quickly became the second most popular Frito-Lay product line, second only to Lay's potato chips.<ref name="encfood">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=Encyclopedia of junk food and fast food|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33527-3|pages=113–114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jIOEZ5F9fAC&q=%22Frito-Lay%22%201932&pg=PA113}}</ref>

Frito-Lay faced increased competition in the 1970s, from competing potato chip brands such as [[Pringles]], launched by [[Procter & Gamble]], now owned by [[Kellogg's]], in competition with Lay's. [[Nabisco]] and [[Standard Brands]] also expanded in the 1970s to produce potato chips, cheese curls, and pretzels, which placed added pressure across Frito-Lay's entire line of snack food brands.<ref name=crunchpotatochiphistory />

====1980–2000====
Frito-Lay acquired GrandMa's Cookies in 1980, originally founded by Foster Wheeler in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1914,<ref>"[http://www.collectorsjournal.com/columns/now-that-s-a-great-cookie/article_4f9c7012-837e-11e8-b0d4-d780f1b45072.html Now that’s a great cookie!]" by Mary Jane Lamphier, ''Collectors Journal''. 9 July 2018. Accessed 28 June 2020.</ref> which launched nationwide in the United States in 1983. In January 1978, Frito-Lay's product development group led by Jack Liczkowski completed development of [[Tostitos]], a Mexican-style tortilla chip lineup. Tostitos Traditional Flavor and Tostitos Nacho Cheese Flavor went into national distribution in the United States by 1980 and reached the sales of $140&nbsp;million, making it one of the most successful new products introduction in Frito-Lay history. Tostitos sales grew quickly, and in 1985 it had become Frito-Lay's fifth-largest brand, generating annual sales of $200&nbsp;million. Ahead of Tostitos at the time were Doritos, Lay's, Fritos, and Ruffles, each recording annual sales between $250 and $500&nbsp;million.<ref name="intldirect">{{cite book|last=Pederson|first=Jay P.|title=International Directory of Company Histories|year=2000|publisher=St James Press|isbn=978-1-55862-391-0|pages=207–208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_XXAAAAMAAJ&q=Tostitos+$500+million+1985|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> While Tostitos became a long-term success, several other new products launched in the 1980s were discontinued after lackluster results. These short lived Frito-Lay products included Stuffers pre-filled dip shells and Toppels crackers, which came pre-topped with cheese.<ref name="essentialsofmktg">{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=Charles W.|title=Essentials of Marketing|year=2008|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-0-324-65620-6|pages=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kf_O1eI0J4C&q=Stuffers%20Toppels&pg=PA44|author2=Hair, Joseph F.|author3=McDaniel, Carl|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> In the late 1980s, Frito-Lay acquired [[Smartfood]],<ref name="smartfoodinc">{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Joseph P.|title=The Snack Food That's Eating America: Smartfood popcorn|journal=Inc.

International sales began to increase significantly at this time as well, with annual revenues from sales outside of the U.S. and Canada accounting for $500&nbsp;million in 1989, contributing to total Frito-Lay sales of $3.5&nbsp;billion in the same year.<ref name=crunchpotatochiphistory /> In Canada, Frito-Lay began a partnership with [[General Foods]]-owned Hostess Food Products in 1987, before merging in 1988 to become [[Frito-Lay Canada|The Hostess Frito-Lay Company]]. 

Several new products were developed internally at Frito-Lay and launched in the 1990s, the most successful of which was [[Sun Chips]], a multi-grain chip first sold in 1991. Sun Chips, along with new Baked (instead of [[Frying|fried]]) variants of Tostitos and Lay's, represented Frito-Lay's intent to capitalize on an emerging trend among adults in the U.S., who were displaying a growing preference for healthier snack alternatives.<ref name="1998upd">{{cite news|title=Higher Sales of Snacks Boost PepsiCo Profits but Stock Drops|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=29 April 1998}}</ref> In 1994, Frito-Lay recorded annual retail sales of nearly $5&nbsp;billion, selling 8&nbsp;billion bags of chips, [[popcorn]], and [[pretzels]] during that year—outpacing competitors [[Eagle Snacks|Eagle]] (owned by [[Anheuser-Busch]]) and [[Wise Foods, Inc.|Wise]] (owned by Borden).<ref name="fl1994sales">{{cite journal|last=Gite|first=Lloyd|title=B.E.

Up until the mid-1990s, Frito-Lay was represented in PepsiCo's organizational structure as Frito-Lay, a single division of PepsiCo. This changed in 1996 when PepsiCo merged its snack food operations into what was titled the "Frito-Lay Company", made up of two subsequent divisions, ''Frito-Lay North America'' and ''Frito-Lay International''.<ref name="1996restr">{{cite journal|last=McGraw|first=Dan|title=Salting Away Big Profits: Frito-Lay Launches a Powerful Snack Attack and Crunches the Competition|journal=U.S. News & World Report|date=16 September 1996}}</ref> In 1992, Frito-Lay acquired full ownership of Hostess Food Products from General Foods, followed in 1997 by the acquisition of candied popcorn snack brand [[Cracker Jack]], and in 1998 by multiple international acquisitions and joint ventures, including [[Smith's Snackfood Company]] ([[Australia]]), as well as Savoy Brands ([[Latin America]]).<ref name="busoffood">{{cite book|last=Albala|first=Ken|title=The Business of Food: Encyclopedia of the Food and Drink Industries|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33725-3|pages=338–339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNzmOUyiFRAC&q=%22Frito-Lay%22%201932&pg=PA339|author2=Allen, Gary|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

====Recent history (2000 – present)====

In the early 1980s, PepsiCo continued to grow its Frito-Lay brands in two ways—through international expansion and acquisition. Through a joint-venture with [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]], a UK chip and snack manufacturing company, Frito-Lay increased its distribution presence in Europe. Similar joint-ventures were arranged in other regions of the world in the 2000s, including [[The Smith's Snackfood Company|Smith's]] in Australia, and [[Sabritas]] and [[Gamesa]] in Mexico. As a result of these international arrangements, some global Frito-Lay products (such as Doritos) are branded under the same name worldwide. Others maintain their original regional names. For example, [[Lay's]] chips are a similar product to [[Walkers Crisps]] in the UK<ref name="pepsicouk">{{cite web|title=Snacks Brands|url=http://www.pepsico.co.uk/brands/snacks|publisher=PepsiCo UK & Ireland|accessdate=20 December 2010}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and both share similar logo designs.

The [[Quaker Oats Company]] merged with PepsiCo in 2001, resulting in Quaker snacks products, including Chewy granola bars, Gatorade, and Quaker [[rice cakes]], becoming organized under the Frito-Lay North America operating division. This operating structure was short-lived, and in 2003, as part of a restructuring, the international operations of Frito-Lay (formerly Frito-Lay International) were brought within the PepsiCo International division, while Frito-Lay North America was maintained as its own division, comprising Frito-Lay business within the United States and Canada.<ref name="tenk">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000119312507035201/d10k.htmSEC:PepsiCo,Inc. 2006 Form 10-K]</ref><ref name="plunketts">{{cite book|title=Plunkett's Food Industry Almanac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp57s0AoS-oC&q=%22Frito-Lay%22%20PepsiCo%201965&pg=PT286|publisher=Plunkett's|accessdate=20 December 2010|page=286|format=E-Book|year=2006|isbn = 9781593920524}}</ref>

Frito-Lay continued to experiment with changes to the composition of its products, introducing Reduced Fat Lay's and Cheetos in 2002. The "Baked" product line also expanded in 2002 to include Baked Doritos.<ref name=crunchpotatochiphistory /> In 2003, Frito-Lay introduced the first products in its "Natural" line, which were made with ingredients that had been organically produced. The first of these included Organic Blue Corn Tostitos, Natural Lay's Potato Chips (seasoned with [[sea salt]]), and Natural Cheetos White Cheddar Puffs.<ref name="natural2003">{{cite journal|title=Strategy: Frito-Lay Lays Out Plans for Natural Line|journal=Brandweek|date=12 May 2003|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682644-1.html|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

A new CEO, [[Irene Rosenfeld]], was appointed in 2005. Under her management, Frito-Lay North America continued to expand its product lines with acquisitions such as Stacy's Pita Chip Company, which represented "Frito-Lay's desire to participate more broadly in the $90&nbsp;billion macrosnack category",<ref name="foodproc">{{cite news|title=PepsiCo/Frito Lay picks up pita chip purveyor|url=http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2005/567.html|accessdate=20 December 2010|newspaper=Food Processing|date=21 November 2005}}</ref> particularly involving snack foods made with more natural ingredients,<ref name="fritolayingredientchg">{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melanie|title=Why Frito-Lay's Move Towards "Clean Labels" Is Smart Marketing|url=http://www.bnet.com/blog/food-industry/why-frito-lay-8217s-move-towards-8220clean-labels-8221-is-smart-marketing/767|accessdate=20 December 2010|newspaper=Bnet|date=11 May 2010}}</ref> according to reports from within its industry at that time.<ref name="macrosnacks">{{cite news|last=Spethmann|first=Betsy|title=Frito-Lay Adds $100 Million-Plus for Online and Offline Ads|url=http://directmag.com/news/frito-lay-030205/|accessdate=20 December 2010|newspaper=Direct Magazine|date=1 March 2009}}</ref> In 2010, Frito-Lay reformulated Lay's Kettle and Lay's flavored chips into a new variant labeled as being made with all-natural ingredients.<ref name="morris1">{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Alex|title=PepsiCo: 'All-Natural' Growth|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/238261-pepsico-all-natural-growth|accessdate=20 December 2010|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|date=23 November 2010}}</ref> Sales of Lay's potato chips grew by 8% following the change to all-natural ingredients.

==Controversies and health concerns==

===Stereotyping in 1960s commercials===
In 1967, the company introduced a cartoon spokesman, the [[Frito Bandito]], which became the subject of criticism from [[Mexican-American]] groups, who expressed concerns that it portrayed a Mexican [[stereotype]]. The [[Frito Bandito]] (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]) wore a [[sombrero]] and [[bandolier]]s, had a [[handlebar moustache]], and brandished pistols. Protests from advocacy groups such as The [[National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee]] (NMAADC) prompted some initial concessions, such as the removal of the pistols and a thinning of the accent. The Frito Bandito was replaced in 1970 by The Muncha Bunch, and then again by a new cartoon called W.C. Fritos (based on [[W. C. Fields]]).<ref name=encfood />

===Genetically modified ingredients===
In the late 1990s, the use of [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) was rising as a farming practice, as it made for the growth of larger (and thus less expensive to produce) corn crops. Frito-Lay, due in part to its leverage as one of the world's largest purchasers of [[corn]], became the target of lobbying efforts from both proponents and opponents of GMOs. In late 1999, Frito-Lay asked its suppliers not to use genetically engineered corn. A similar announcement followed in early 2000, when the company asked its farmers not to grow genetically modified potatoes. Frito-Lay stated these requests were made in response to consumers' worries, and not in response to protests by the OCA, [[Greenpeace]] or other groups. A representative of [[Greenpeace]] expressed the perspective that this move was a positive step, stating, "Frito-Lay is about two-thirds of PepsiCo's sales. They realize the handwriting is on the wall and that people don't want to eat GMOs".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 2012, the policy as stated by Pepsico was:

"Global Genetically-Modified Food And Ingredient Policy

PepsiCo is dedicated to producing the highest quality, greatest tasting food and beverage products in every part of the world. PepsiCo ensures all products meet or exceed stringent safety and quality standards and uses only ingredients that are safe and approved by applicable government and regulatory authorities.
Approval of genetically-modified foods differs from country to country regarding both use and labeling. For this reason, PepsiCo adheres to all relevant regulatory requirements regarding the use of genetically-modified food crops and food ingredients within the countries it operates.
