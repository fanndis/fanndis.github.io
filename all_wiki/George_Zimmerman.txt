=== Move to Florida ===
After graduating from high school, Zimmerman moved to [[Lake Mary, Florida]], a suburb of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], where he was employed by an insurance agency. Zimmerman took classes at night to obtain a license to sell insurance. It was during this time when he became friends with Lee Ann Benjamin, a real estate agent, and her husband John Donnelly, a Sanford attorney.<ref name="Reuters prelude" /> Benjamin and Donnelly would both testify on his behalf at his trial in the death of Martin.<ref name="benjamin donnelly">{{cite news|last=Roig-Franzia |first=Manuel|title=George Zimmerman trial continues to focus on 911 call|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/george-zimmerman-trial-continues-to-focus-on-911-tape/2013/07/08/97e65f6c-e7e9-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="benjamin donn2">{{cite news|title=Judge rules defense can show Trayvon Martin died with marijuana in his system|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/08/zimmerman-defense-to-continue-presentation-monday/|publisher=Fox News|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref> According to Donnelly, in 2004 Zimmerman and an African-American friend opened a satellite office of [[Allstate Insurance]], which failed a year later.

In July 2005, Zimmerman was arrested after allegedly assaulting an undercover police officer who was attempting to arrest a friend of his at a bar. The charges were dropped after Zimmerman agreed to enter an alcohol education program. A month later in August Zimmerman's former fiancé filed a restraining order against him citing domestic violence as the cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/a-list-of-george-zimmermans-past-run-ins-with-the-law|title=A list of George Zimmerman's past run-ins with the law|date=2015-03-25|website=Associated Press|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>

=== Move to the Retreat at Twin Lakes ===
Zimmerman married Shellie Dean, a licensed [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]], in 2007. Two years later, they rented a townhouse in the Retreat at Twin Lakes in [[Sanford, Florida]]. Zimmerman had previously been employed at a car dealership and a mortgage audit firm.<ref name="Reuters prelude" /><ref name="os who" /> Zimmerman enrolled in [[Seminole State College of Florida|Seminole State College]] in 2009 and was working on an [[associate degree]] in criminal justice. In December 2011 he was allowed to participate in a school graduation ceremony, even though he was a course credit shy of his degree. He was completing that credit at the time of the shooting. Zimmerman was then employed as an insurance underwriter.<ref name="Reuters prelude" /><ref name="os who" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Robles |first=Frances|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/records-show-george-zimmerman-got-ds-in-criminal-justice-classes/1245098 |title=Records show George Zimmerman got D's in criminal justice classes |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref>

In early 2011, Zimmerman participated in a citizen forum at the Sanford City Hall to protest the beating of a black homeless man by the son of a white Sanford police officer. During the meeting, Zimmerman claimed he witnessed "disgusting behavior" while participating in a ride-along program with local police; however, the police department said later that it did not know when, if ever, Zimmerman was in that program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zimmerman publicly accused Sanford police of corruption in 2011|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/05/zimmerman-publicly-accused-sanford-police-of-corruption-in-2011-76322.html|first=Scott|last=Thuman|date=May 24, 2012|publisher=WJLA-TV|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name="miherald forum">{{cite news|author=Robles, Frances |title=George Zimmerman: In 2010, lazy Sanford police engaged in coverup |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/22/2813681/zimmerman-rode-with-cops-ripped.html |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=October 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011406/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/22/2813681/zimmerman-rode-with-cops-ripped.html |archive-date=October 5, 2013 }}</ref>

According to Zimmerman's brother Robert Jr. in 2014, in the year following the trial, Zimmerman was both homeless and jobless. Robert Jr. said that, while he believed his brother's "state of mind" was better, Zimmerman was "a very traumatized person because he has had his liberty taken away from him".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-06-07/news/os-george-zimmerman-trial-anniversary-20140607_1_trial-verdict-robert-zimmerman-jr|title=One year later, where are players in George Zimmerman trial?|date=June 7, 2014|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref>

In 2013, Zimmerman's estranged wife called 911 to report that Zimmerman had assaulted her father and was threatening her with a gun.

=== Shooting by Matthew Apperson ===
On September 9, 2014, Zimmerman was named by police in a road rage incident in which another driver, later named by police as Matthew Apperson, claimed that Zimmerman followed and threatened him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bystander-recounts-man-said-allegedly-shooting-george-zimmerman-154125973--abc-news-topstories.html |title=Zimmerman Shooting: Bystander Recounts What Man Said After Firing Gun |work=[[Yahoo!

On May 11, 2015, Apperson shot at Zimmerman while the two were driving in separate cars on a street in Lake Mary. Zimmerman was grazed by glass and metal shards when the bullet broke through his passenger-side window and was stopped by the metal window frame, causing minor facial injuries from flying glass and debris. Zimmerman flagged down a police officer and was taken to the hospital.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police: George Zimmerman involved in Florida shooting|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/11/us/florida-george-zimmerman-shooting/index.html|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=[[CNN]]|date=May 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=WESH_20150511>{{cite news|title=George Zimmerman suffers minor injuries in shooting incident, attorney says|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/george-zimmerman-involved-in-shooting-in-lake-mary-police-say/32943828|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=[[WESH]]|date=May 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Sentinel20150511>{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Jeff|last2=Allen|first2=Stephanie|title=George Zimmerman suffers facial wounds after Lake Mary shooting|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman/os-george-zimmerman-shooting-lake-mary-20150511-story.html|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=May 11, 2015}}</ref> Apperson maintained that Zimmerman was the aggressor and that Apperson acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name=WFTV201505 /><ref name=OS20150512>{{cite news|last1=Walden|first1=Tiffany|title=George Zimmerman was armed, followed before Lake Mary shooting, attorney says|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman/os-george-zimmerman-shooting-20150512-story.html|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> Zimmerman also had a gun with him at the time of the incident, but Zimmerman's attorney said that "George absolutely denies having shown it, waved, displayed, pointed it."

Light blue is a color variation for original white stars and stripes. Dark blue is a color variation for original blue box of the stars and original red stripes. The front text of the painting says "GOD / ONE NATION / with / LIBERTY and JUSTICE FOR ALL"]]
In December 2013, Zimmerman began selling paintings he had made. His first painting, of an American flag, sold for $100,099.99 on eBay in late December.<ref name=waxman>{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2014/01/24/george-zimmermans-paintings-a-critical-appraisal/ |title=George Zimmerman's Paintings: A Critical Appraisal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Olivia B. Waxman |date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref> On the auction page for the painting, Zimmerman wrote:

<blockquote>Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative way to express myself, my emotions, and the symbols that represent my experiences. My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet, and allows me to remain indoors :-)

I hope you enjoy owning this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it. Your friend, George Zimmerman.<ref name=waxman /></blockquote>

It was later reported that the American flag painting was copied without attribution from a stock image taken from [[Shutterstock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/01/george-zimmerman-painting-ap-ceast-desist.html?mid=google |title=George Zimmerman Can't Even Paint Without Getting in Trouble |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Joe Coscarelli |date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref>

In January 2014, the [[Associated Press]] and a Jacksonville, Florida photographer Rick Wilson demanded that Zimmerman halt the sale of one of his paintings because the news agency asserted it directly copied a photo owned by the AP. The photo and painting identically show Jacksonville-based prosecutor Angela Corey (whose office prosecuted Zimmerman for the shooting death of Martin) holding her thumb and fingers together. Zimmerman apparently made up the quote that he added to the painting: "I have this much respect for the American judicial system." The controversy was similar to that arising from the use of an AP photo by [[Shepard Fairey]] in his composition of the [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/24/ap-zimmerman-painting-copy/4843775/ |title=AP says Zimmerman painting is copy of AP photo |agency=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref> Led by attorney [[John Michael Phillips]], the cease and desist indeed halted the sale of this and other paintings.

In August 2015, Zimmerman began selling a limited number of prints of a painting of the [[Confederate battle flag]] in conjunction with gun seller Andy Hallinan of Florida Gun Supply, in [[Inverness, Florida]]. Hallinan is known for announcing that Muslims were not welcome at his store which was "Muslim free". Michael Walsh of [[Yahoo! News]] observed, "Zimmerman's latest painting brings together three highly controversial topics with which the nation is dealing: the deaths of young black men, the Confederate battle flag and discrimination against American Muslims."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/george-zimmerman-paints-confederate-battle-flag-to-raise-money-for--muslim-free--gun-store-171253005.html |title=George Zimmerman paints Confederate battle flag to raise money for 'Muslim-free' gun store |work=[[Yahoo! News]] |author=Michael Walsh |date=August 18, 2015 |accessdate=August 18, 2015}}</ref>

Andrew Russeth of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' appraised Zimmerman's work as likened to [[paint by number]].<ref name=waxman /> Jason Edward, a contributing editor at ''[[Art+Auction]]'', referred to the paintings as "very primitive, the sort of thing an art critic wouldn't look at twice."<ref name=waxman /> [[Christian Viveros-Fauné]], an art critic for the ''[[Village Voice]]'', has referred to Zimmerman's artistic endeavors as constituting "[[murderabilia]]".<ref name=waxman />

=== Twitter scandals ===
In late August 2015, controversy centering on Zimmerman arose when his [[Twitter]] profile picture of a [[Modern display of the Confederate flag|Confederate flag]] "backed by an American flag" (in his words) became better-known. Frequently criticized posts of his from August included one in which Zimmerman called Obama an "ignorant baboon";<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-zimmerman-barack-obama_55dfc9dee4b0aec9f352cb07 |title=George Zimmerman Calls President Obama An 'Ignorant Baboon' |last=Mazza |first=Ed |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 28, 2015 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref> one in which he posted an image of Vester Lee Flanagan, an African-American former news reporter who [[Murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward|shot and killed two ex-coworkers during a live broadcast]], and wrote, "If Obama had a son..."; and another in which Zimmerman typed, in response to people who wanted him killed, that the United States understands "how it ended for the last moron that hit me" (in reference to [[Trayvon Martin]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://national.suntimes.com/national-world-news/7/72/1721419/george-zimmerman-slams-baboon-obama-virginia-shooting/ |title=George Zimmerman slams 'baboon' Obama after Virginia shooting |last=Sutton |first=Scott |publisher=Sun Times National |date=August 27, 2015 |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829213855/http://national.suntimes.com/national-world-news/7/72/1721419/george-zimmerman-slams-baboon-obama-virginia-shooting/ |archive-date=August 29, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In September 2015, Zimmerman retweeted a photo of Martin's slain body posted by another Twitter user, who had the caption: "Z-Man is a one man army". Several days later, Zimmerman posted a letter saying that the photo in the original tweet was marked as "sensitive" and was blocked, so he retweeted it because of the text message without seeing the photo.<ref>{{cite web|title = George Zimmerman Tweets Photo Of Trayvon Martin's Body|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-zimmerman-tweets-trayvon-martins-body_560965b1e4b0dd85030846e5|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = December 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = George Zimmerman says he retweeted photo of Trayvon Martin's body by accident|url = http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/gone-viral/os-george-zimmerman-twitter-20151006-post.html|website = OrlandoSentinel.com|accessdate = December 7, 2015}}</ref>

In December 2015, Zimmerman tweeted two photos of a topless woman he claimed was his ex-girlfriend, and accused her of cheating and of the theft of his firearm and money. He included her phone number and e-mail address on his tweet. Less than two hours later, Zimmerman's [[List of people banned or suspended from Twitter|Twitter account was suspended]] by the administration of the resource, according to their policy against posting another person's private and confidential information, including e-mail addresses, phone numbers and familiar photos.<ref>{{cite web|title = George Zimmerman's Horrific Twitter Is Gone, And It Won't Be Missed|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-zimmerman-tweets_5661ef01e4b079b2818e8fbd|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = December 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = George Zimmerman suspended from Twitter after posting alleged ex's nudes|url = http://www.dailydot.com/politics/george-zimmerman-ex-nudes-revenge-porn/?tw=dd|website = The Daily Dot |accessdate = December 7, 2015}}</ref> Zimmerman's tweet included a statement against Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/george-zimmerman-posts-naked-pic-of-girlfriend-on-twitter-claims-she-slept-with-dirty-muslim/|title=Zimmerman Posts Naked Pic of Girlfriend on Twitter, Claims She Slept With 'Dirty Muslim'}}</ref>

=== Gun sale ===
On May 11, 2016, Zimmerman posted what was planned to be the auction of the firearm he used to shoot Martin. The post, in which Zimmerman wrote that the gun was "an American Firearm icon", attracted controversy. Zimmerman subsequently explained that the Justice Department had recently returned the weapon to him. He said that he had the right as owner to sell it.<ref name=GunCNN /> Zimmerman said the proceeds of the weapon would go to combating the violence against police officers by members of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement as well as "ensure the demise of [[Angela Corey]]'s persecution career and [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton's]] anti-firearm rhetoric".<ref name=adn.com>{{cite news|url=https://www.adn.com/article/20160512/george-zimmerman-auction-gun-he-used-kill-trayvon-martin|title=Listing for gun that George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin dropped from auction site|date=May 12, 2016|publisher=adn.com}}</ref> After selling the weapon, Zimmerman said that he had chosen to sell it directly as a result of Clinton "stumping around for a false campaign for the Trayvon Martin Foundation" and accused her of lying about the events of the shooting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-explains-rationale-auctioning-pistol-killed-trayvon/story?id=39330161|title=George Zimmerman Explains His Rationale for Auctioning Pistol That Killed Trayvon Martin|date=May 24, 2016|publisher=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/george-zimmerman-netted-250-000-gun-auction-article-1.2647713|title=George Zimmerman says that he will use $250G from his gun auction to fund conservative causes|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=May 24, 2016}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Zimmerman was satirized in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[World War Zimmerman]]", which premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 9, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s17e03-world-war-zimmerman |title=World War Zimmerman (Season 17, Episode 3) – Full Episode Player |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref> It parodies ''[[World War Z]]'' and the George Zimmerman murder trials.

In 2013, [[Public Policy Polling]] included Zimmerman as a potential [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential candidate in an [[Alaska]] poll testing what person the state would support in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, explained in an email that his firm had included Zimmerman because of his popularity among conservatives and curiosity as to "how he would do." In the survey, Zimmerman received 2% of support among Alaskans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/06/george-zimmerman-2016-poll_n_3713943.html|title=George Zimmerman For President?
