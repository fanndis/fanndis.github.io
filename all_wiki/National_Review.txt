'''''National Review''''' is an American semi-monthly conservative editorial magazine focusing on news and commentary pieces on political, social, and cultural affairs. The magazine was founded by the author [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] in 1955.<ref name="rperlstein"/> It is currently edited by [[Rich Lowry]].

Since its founding, the magazine has played a significant role in the development of [[conservatism in the United States]], helping to define its boundaries<ref name="rperlstein"/> and promoting [[fusionism]] while establishing itself as a leading voice on the [[American right]].<ref name="rperlstein">{{cite news|last1=Perlstein|first1=Rick|title=I thought I understood the American Right.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/magazine/i-thought-i-understood-the-american-right-trump-proved-me-wrong.html?_r=4|accessdate=June 7, 2017|work=New York Times|date=April 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/21/politics/national-review-magazine-opposes-donald-trump/index.html|title=National Review, conservative thinkers stand against Donald Trump|last=Byers|first=Dylan|website=CNN|access-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name="brooksd">{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|title=The Conservative Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/opinion/brooks-the-conservative-mind.html|accessdate=June 11, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=September 24, 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Background ===
{{see also|Conservatism in the United States}}
Before ''National Review''{{'}}s founding in 1955, the [[American right]] was a largely unorganized collection of people who shared intertwining philosophies but had little opportunity for a united public voice. They wanted to marginalize the [[antiwar]], noninterventionistic views of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]].<ref>Nash, George H. (1976, 2006). ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945''. ISI Books: Wilmington, DE, pp. 186–93.</ref>

In 1953, moderate Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was president, and many major magazines such as the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' were strongly conservative and anticommunist, as were many newspapers including the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]''. A few small-circulation conservative magazines, such as ''[[Human Events]]'' and ''[[The Freeman]]'', preceded ''National Review'' in developing [[Cold War]] Conservatism in the 1950s.<ref>Nash, ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945''. pp. 186–93.</ref>

=== Early years ===
In 1953, [[Russell Kirk]] published ''The Conservative Mind'', which traced an intellectual bloodline from [[Edmund Burke]]<ref name="autogenerated186">Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia''. ISI Books, Wilmington, DE, pp. 186–88</ref> to the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] in the early 1950s. This challenged the notion among intellectuals that no coherent conservative tradition existed in the United States.<ref name="autogenerated186"/>

[[Image:William F. Buckley, Jr. 1985.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William F. Buckley Jr.]], the founder of ''National Review'' (pictured in 1985)]]

A young [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] was greatly influenced by Kirk's concepts. Buckley had money; his father grew rich from oil fields in Mexico. He first tried to purchase ''[[Human Events]]'', but was turned down. He then met [[Willi Schlamm]], the experienced editor of ''[[The Freeman]]''; they would spend the next two years raising the $300,000 necessary to start their own weekly magazine, originally to be called ''National Weekly''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl T.|last=Bogus|title=Buckley: William F. Buckley Jr. and the Rise of American Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvGHFnwPljAC&pg=PT206|year= 2011|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]] |isbn=9781608193554}}</ref> (A magazine holding the trademark to the name prompted the change to ''National Review''.) The statement of intentions read:<ref>{{cite book|author=Gregory L. Schneider. ed.|title=Conservatism in America since 1930: a reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6hzBFw1ky8C&pg=PA195|year=2003|publisher=NYU Press|pages=195ff|isbn=9780814797990}}</ref>

<blockquote>Middle-of-the-Road, qua Middle of the Road, is politically, intellectually, and morally repugnant. We shall recommend policies for the simple reason that we consider them right (rather than “non-controversial”); and we consider them right because they are based on principles we deem right (rather than on popularity polls)... The [[New Deal]] revolution, for instance, could hardly have happened save for the cumulative impact of ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', and a few other publications, on several American college generations during the twenties and thirties.</blockquote>

=== Contributors ===
On November 19, 1955, Buckley's magazine began to take shape. Buckley assembled an eclectic group of writers: traditionalists, Catholic intellectuals, libertarians and ex-Communists. The group included: [[Russell Kirk]], [[James Burnham]], [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], and [[Willmoore Kendall]], Catholics [[L. Brent Bozell Jr.|L. Brent Bozell]] and [[Garry Wills]]. The former ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' editor [[Whittaker Chambers]], who had been a Communist spy in the 1930s and was now intensely anti-Communist, became a senior editor. In the magazine's founding statement Buckley wrote:<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback200501030730.asp Our Mission Statement], ''National Review Online'', November 19, 1955</ref>

<blockquote>The launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if ''National Review'' is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.</blockquote>

As editors and contributors, Buckley especially sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far Left, including Whittaker Chambers, [[Willi Schlamm|William Schlamm]], [[John Dos Passos]], Frank Meyer and James Burnham.<ref>John P. Diggins, "Buckley's Comrades: The Ex-Communist as Conservative," ''Dissent'' July 1975, Vol. 22 Issue 4, pp. 370–86</ref> When James Burnham became one of the original senior editors, he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant (1991) finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board (including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine's publisher [[William A. Rusher]]), and had a significant effect on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of Buckley himself.<ref>Kevin Smant, "Whither Conservatism? James Burnham and 'National Review,' 1955–1964," ''Continuity,'' 1991, Issue 15, pp. 83–97; Smant, ''Principles and Heresies: Frank S. Meyer and the Shaping of the American Conservative Movement'' (2002) pp. 33–66</ref>

=== Mission to conservatives ===
''National Review'' aimed to make conservative ideas respectable,<ref name="rperlstein"/> in an age when the dominant view of conservative thought was, as expressed by Columbia professor [[Lionel Trilling]]:<ref>[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjQ4Nzc2OTVjMWE1MzVkNWM5ZGYxZDUxNjY5YTFhYzU= Golden Days] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504005250/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjQ4Nzc2OTVjMWE1MzVkNWM5ZGYxZDUxNjY5YTFhYzU= |date=May 4, 2007 }}, ''National Review Online'', October 27, 2005.</ref>

<blockquote>[L]iberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation... the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not... express themselves in ideas but only... in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.</blockquote>

William Buckley Jr. said of the purpose of ''National Review'':

<blockquote>[''National Review''] stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it… it is out of place because, in its maturity, literate America rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation…since ideas rule the world, the ideologues, having won over the intellectual class, simply walked in and started to…run just about everything. There never was an age of conformity quite like this one, or a camaraderie quite like the Liberals’.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Buckley|first=William|title=Our Mission Statement|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/223549/our-mission-statement/william-f-buckley-jr|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=April 27, 2012|date=19 November 1955}}</ref></blockquote>

''National Review'' promoted [[Barry Goldwater]] heavily during the early 1960s. Buckley and others involved with the magazine took a major role in the "Draft Goldwater" movement in 1960 and the 1964 presidential campaign. ''National Review'' spread his vision of conservatism throughout the country.<ref>Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, eds. American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia''. (2006) pp. 601–04</ref>

The early ''National Review'' faced occasional defections from both left and right. [[Garry Wills]] broke with ''National Review'' and became a liberal commentator. Buckley's brother-in-law, [[L. Brent Bozell Jr.]] left and started the short-lived [[traditionalist Catholic]] magazine, ''[[Triumph (magazine)|Triumph]]'' in 1966.

=== Defining the boundaries of conservatism ===
{{See also|Conservatism in the United States}}
Buckley and Meyer promoted the idea of enlarging the boundaries of conservatism through [[fusionism (politics)|fusionism]], whereby different schools of conservatives, including [[libertarians]], would work together to combat what were seen as their common opponents.<ref name="rperlstein"/>

Buckley and his editors used his magazine to define the boundaries of conservatism—and to exclude people or ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. Therefore, they attacked the [[John Birch Society]], [[George Wallace]], and anti-Semites.<ref name="rperlstein"/><ref>Roger Chapman, ''Culture wars: an encyclopedia of issues, viewpoints, and voices'' (2009) vol. 1 p. 58</ref>

Buckley's goal was to increase the respectability of the conservative movement; as [[Rich Lowry]] noted: "Mr. Buckley's first great achievement was to purge the American right of its kooks. He marginalized the anti-Semites, the John Birchers, the [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]] and their sort."<ref>[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDc3ZDExYWU5MjBiMDJiN2Q2YWM4Y2U4MWYyYTY1NzI= A Personal Retrospective] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019044636/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDc3ZDExYWU5MjBiMDJiN2Q2YWM4Y2U4MWYyYTY1NzI= |date=October 19, 2006 }}, ''National Review Online'', August 9, 2004</ref>

In 1957, ''National Review'' editorialized in favor of white leadership in the South, arguing that "the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes – the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://adamgomez.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/whythesouthmustprevail-1957.pdf|title=Why the South Must Prevail|last=Buckley|first=William F.|date=August 24, 1957|work=National Review|access-date=September 16, 2017|volume=4|pages=148–49}}</ref><ref>Quoted in John B. Judis, ''William F.

In the late 1960s, the magazine denounced segregationist [[George Wallace]], who ran in Democratic primaries in 1964 and 1972 and made an independent run for president in 1968. During the 1950s, Buckley had worked to remove [[anti-Semitism]] from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for ''National Review''.<ref>Judis, ''William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives'' pp. 283–87</ref> In 1962 Buckley denounced [[Robert W. Welch Jr.]] and the [[John Birch Society]] as "far removed from common sense" and urged the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to purge itself of Welch's influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/Goldwater--the-John-Birch-Society--and-Me-11248|title=Goldwater, the John Birch Society, and Me|work=Commentary|accessdate=March 9, 2008|author=William F.

=== After Goldwater ===
After Goldwater was defeated by [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1964, Buckley and ''National Review'' continued to champion the idea of a conservative movement, which was increasingly embodied in [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan, a longtime subscriber to ''National Review'', first became politically prominent during Goldwater's campaign. ''National Review'' supported his challenge to President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 and his successful 1980 campaign.

During the 1980s ''National Review'' called for tax cuts, [[supply-side economics]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], and support for President Reagan's foreign policy against the [[Soviet Union]]. The magazine criticized the [[Welfare state]] and would support the [[Welfare reform]] proposals of the 1990s. The magazine also regularly criticized President [[Bill Clinton]]. It first embraced, then rejected, [[Pat Buchanan]] in his political campaigns. A lengthy 1996 ''National Review'' editorial called for a "movement toward" drug legalization.<ref>{{cite web |title=The War on Drugs is Lost |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/12feb96/drug.html |website=National Review |access-date=November 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001025070707/https://www.nationalreview.com/12feb96/drug.html |archive-date=October 25, 2000 |date=February 12, 1996}}</ref>

In 1985, ''National Review'' and Buckley were represented by attorney [[J. Daniel Mahoney]] during the magazine's $16 million libel suit against ''[[The Spotlight]]''.<ref name="The Washington Times; October 25, 1985">{{cite news |last=Archibald|first=George|date=October 25, 1985 |title=Jury begged not to let Buckley 'punish and destroy' Spotlight|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000100200005-7.pdf|work=The Washington Times|location=Washington, D.C.|page=3-A|access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref>

== Political views and content ==
[[Victor Davis Hanson]], a regular contributor since 2001, sees a broad spectrum of [[american conservatism|conservative]] and anti-[[Modern liberalism|liberal]] contributors:

{{quote|In other words, a wide conservative spectrum—[[Paleoconservatism|paleo-conservatives]], [[neo-conservatives]], [[tea party movement|tea-party]] enthusiasts, the deeply [[religious]] and the [[agnostic]], both [[libertarians]] and [[social conservatives]], [[free market|free-marketeers]] and the more [[protectionism|protectionist]]—characterizes ''National Review. '' The common requisite is that they present their views as a critique of prevailing [[modern liberalism|liberal orthodoxy]] but do so analytically and with decency and respect.<ref>see [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/418697/home-intellectual-populism-could-use-your-help-victor-davis-hanson Hanson, "The Home of Intellectual Populism Could Use Your Help" NRO 1 December, 2015]</ref>}}

The magazine has been described as "the bible of [[conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]]".<ref name="TitanicReshufflingDeckChairsNRCruise-NewRepublic">Hari, Johann, ''Titanic: Reshuffling the Deck Chairs on the National Review Cruise'', in ''The New Republic'', vol. 237, issue 1, July 2, 2007 (in ''MasterFile Premier'' (EbscoHost) (PDF) (subscription may be required)), p.&nbsp;31</ref> 

Daniel McAdams of the [[paleoconservative]] [[Ron Paul Institute]] contends the ''National Review'' has evolved from a publication in the William Buckley tradition of conservatism to an outlet articulating primarily [[neoconservative]] perspectives with its emphasis on using [[military action]] abroad.<ref>See [http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/neocon-watch/2016/january/06/neocons-at-national-review-stop-calling-us-neocons/ Daniel McAdams, "Neocons at National Review: 'Stop Calling Us Neocons!"] ''Ron Paul Institute'' January 6, 2016</ref>

=== Donald Trump ===
In 2015, the magazine published an editorial entitled "Against Trump," calling him a "philosophically unmoored political opportunist" and announcing its opposition to his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/donald-trump-conservative-movement-menace/|title=Against Trump - National Review|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> Since Trump's election to the presidency, the ''National Review'' editorial board has continued to criticize him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/trump-putin-meeting-finland-pathetic/|title=The Mouth That Toured - National Review|date=July 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/donald-trump-trade-bill-wto-tariff-problematic/|title=Against the Trump Trade Bill - National Review|date=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/north-korea-kim-jong-un-talks-keep-pressure-on/|title=Keep the Pressure on Kim - National Review|date=May 2, 2018}}</ref>

However, contributors to ''National Review'' and ''National Review Online'' take a variety of positions on Trump.  Lowry and Hanson support him,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/to-be-sure/565094/|title=The 'To Be Sure' Conservatives|first=Peter|last=Beinart|date=July 13, 2018}}</ref> while ''National Review'' contributors such as Ramesh Ponnuru and Jonah Goldberg have remained critical of Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectator.org/the-collapse-of-the-never-trump-conservatives/|title=The Collapse of the Never-Trump ConservativesThe American Spectator|website=spectator.org}}</ref> In a ''Washington Post'' feature on conservative magazines, T.A. Frank noted: "From the perspective of a reader, these tensions make National Review as lively as it has been in a long time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/01/25/feature/why-conservative-magazines-are-more-important-than-ever/|title=Why conservative magazines are more important than ever|website=Washington Post}}</ref>

== ''National Review Online'' ==
A popular feature of ''National Review'' is the web version of the magazine, ''National Review Online'' ("N.R.O."), which includes a digital version of the magazine, with articles updated daily by ''National Review'' writers, and conservative blogs. The on-line version is called ''N.R.O.'' to distinguish it from the paper magazine. It also features free articles, though these deviate in content from its print magazine. The site's editor is [[Charles C. W. Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/06/charles-w-cooke-named-national-review-online-editor-224428|title=Charles C. W.

Each day, the site posts new content consisting of conservative, libertarian, and neoconservative opinion articles, including some syndicated columns, and news features.

It also features two [[blogs]]:
* '''The Corner'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/|title=The Corner|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050922232245/http://corner.nationalreview.com/|archive-date=September 22, 2005}}</ref> – postings from a select group of the site's editors and affiliated writers discussing the issues of the day

[[Markos Moulitsas]], who runs the [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ''[[Daily Kos]]'' web-site, told reporters in August 2007 that he does not read conservative blogs, with the exception of those on N.R.O.: "I do like the blogs at the ''National Review''—I do think their writers are the best in the [conservative] blogosphere," he said.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0807/Markos_speaks.html "Markos speaks"], Ben Smith blog in ''The Politico'', August 2, 2007.</ref>

== National Review Institute ==
The N.R.I. works in policy development and helping establish new advocates in the conservative movement. National Review Institute was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. in 1991 to engage in policy development, public education, and advocacy that would advance the conservative principles he championed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalreviewinstitute.org/|title=National Review|publisher=National Review Institute}}</ref>

== Finances ==
As with most political opinion magazines in the United States, ''National Review'' carries little corporate advertising. The magazine stays afloat from subscription fees, donations, and black-tie fundraisers around the country. The magazine also sponsors cruises featuring ''National Review'' editors and contributors as lecturers.<ref name="TitanicReshufflingDeckChairsNRCruise-NewRepublic" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcruise.com/|title=National Review 2017 Trans-Atlantic Crossing}}</ref>

Buckley said in 2005 that the magazine had lost about $25,000,000 over 50 years.<ref>Shapiro, Gary. [http://www.nysun.com/pf.php?id=24259&v=6843329811 "An 'Encounter' With Conservative Publishing"], "Knickerbocker" column, ''[[The Sun (New York)|The New York Sun]]'', December 9, 2005.</ref>

== Presidential primary endorsements ==
''National Review'' sometimes endorses a candidate during the primary election season. Editors at ''National Review'' have said, "Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/223076/romney-president/editors|title=Nationalreview.com Romney for President|work=National Review}}</ref> This statement echoes what has come to be called "The Buckley Rule". In a 1967 interview, in which he was asked about the choice of presidential candidate, Buckley said, "The wisest choice would be the one who would win... I'd be for the most right, viable candidate who could win."<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IqwyAAAAIBAJ&dq=buckley%20rightward%20viable-candidate&pg=646%2C313367 |title= A Trip into Idea Land with Bill Buckley|accessdate=October 17, 2011|work=The Miami News|date=April 18, 1967}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

=== Barack Obama ===
{{see|Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories}}
In June 2008, six days after [[Hillary Clinton]] conceded to [[Barack Obama]] in the Democratic primary, ''National Review'' correspondent Jim Geraghty published an article encouraging the Obama campaign to release the candidate's birth certificate in order "to squash all the conspiracy theories once and for all." Geraghty's column notes that it was unlikely that Obama was born in [[Kenya]]. Attorney Loren Collins, who has tracked the origins of [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther movement]] for years, says that Geraghty may have "unwittingly shined a national spotlight on a fringe internet theory."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/20/hillary-clinton-and-birther-movement-still-no-ther/|title=No, Hillary Clinton didn't feed the birther movement|work=PolitiFact|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Geraghty's article "became fodder for cable television."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813978,00.html|title=Will Obama's Anti-Rumor Plan Work?|last=Tumulty|first=Karen|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> In a 2009 editorial, the ''National Review'' editorial board called conspiracies about Obama's citizenship "untrue," writing: "Like Bruce Springsteen, he has a lot of bad political ideas; but he was born in the U.S.A."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2009/07/born-usa-editors/|title=Born in the U.S.A. - National Review|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

One ''National Review'' article said that Obama's parents could be [[communism in the United States|communists]] because “for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958, or ’60, there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics”.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/magazine/i-thought-i-understood-the-american-right-trump-proved-me-wrong.html|title=I Thought I Understood the American Right.

As of 2018, [[Dinesh D'Souza]] was on the ''National Review'' masthead, despite stirring controversy for a number of years making inflammatory remarks and promoting conspiracy theories. D'Souza was no longer on the magazine's masthead in 2020.<ref>https://www.nationalreview.com/the-masthead/</ref> In comments that earned rebukes from ''National Review'' colleagues, D'Souza said that billionaire [[George Soros]] was a "collection boy for Hitler and the Nazis," attacked [[Roy Moore]] accuser Beverly Young Nelson, said that accusations against Roy Moore were “most likely fabricated,” and described [[Rosa Parks]] as an "overrated Democrat".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/dinesh-dsouza-national-review-parkland-shooting-survivors-racist-bigot|title=Dinesh D'Souza Mocked Shooting Survivors.

=== Climate change ===
According to Philip Bump of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''National Review'' "has regularly criticized and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/why-the-national-reviews-global-temperature-graph-is-so-misleading/|title=Why this National Review global temperature graph is so misleading|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=December 14, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> In 2015, the magazine published an intentionally deceptive graph that suggested that there was no [[climate change]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-graph-national-review_us_567054efe4b0fccee1700f96|title=This Is How Climate Change Deniers Are Tricking You|last=O'Connor|first=Lydia|date=December 15, 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/one-chart-shows-how-climate-change-deniers-are-skewing-statistics-to-fit-their-view-2015-12?r=US&IR=T|title=One chart shows how climate change deniers are skewing statistics to fit their view|work=Business Insider|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The graph set the lower and upper bounds of the chart at -10 and 110 degree Fahrenheit and zoomed out so as to obscure warming trends.<ref name=":3" />

In 2017, ''National Review'' published an article alleging that a top NOAA scientist claimed that [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] engaged in data manipulation and rushed a study based on faulty data in order to influence the Paris climate negotiations.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/no-data-manipulation-at-noaa/|title=No Data Manipulation at NOAA - FactCheck.org|date=February 9, 2017|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The article largely repeated allegations made in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' without independent verification.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://climatefeedback.org/blogosphere-amplified-daily-mails-unsupported-allegations-climate-data-manipulation-david-rose/|title=How the blogosphere spread and amplified the Daily Mail's unsupported allegations of climate data manipulation|date=March 27, 2017|work=Climate Feedback|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The scientist in question later rebuked the claims made by ''National Review'', noting that he did not accuse NOAA of data manipulation but instead raised concerns about "the way data was handled, documented and stored, raising issues of transparency and availability".<ref name=":4" />

In 2014, climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]] sued the ''National Review'' after columnist Mark Steyn accused Mann of fraud and referenced a quote from Competitive Enterprise Institute writer Rand Simberg that called Mann "the [[Jerry Sandusky]] of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theweek.com/articles/451963/national-review-doomed|title=Is National Review doomed?|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=October 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/10/28/whatever-happened-to-michael-manns-defamation-suit-2017-edition/|title=Opinion {{!}} Whatever happened to Michael Mann's defamation suit?

=== Ann Coulter 9/11 column ===
Two days after the 9/11 attacks, ''National Review'' published a column by Ann Coulter where she wrote of Muslims, "This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals directly involved in this particular terrorist attack. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren’t punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That’s war.

=== Jeffrey Epstein ===
In 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ''National Review'' was one of three news outlets (along with ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[HuffPost]]'') that had published stories written by Jeffrey Epstein's publicists.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news |last=Hsu |first=Tiffany |date=2019-07-21 |title=Jeffrey Epstein Pitched a New Narrative.

The ''National Review'' bio for Galbraith described her as a science writer. The ''National Review'' retracted the article in July 2019 with apologies and spoke of new methods being used to better filter freelance content.<ref name=":5"/>
