The '''State Opening of Parliament''' is an event which formally marks the beginning of a session of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It includes a [[speech from the throne]] known as the '''Queen's Speech''' (or the '''King's Speech'''). The State Opening is an elaborate ceremony showcasing British history, culture and contemporary politics to large crowds and television viewers.

It takes place in the [[House of Lords]] chamber on the first day of a new session, which is usually in May or June, and traditionally in November, but can occur at any time of year depending on the timing of General Elections and parliamentary session start dates. It takes place in front of both Houses of Parliament. The monarch, wearing the [[Imperial State Crown]], reads a speech that has been prepared by his or her government outlining its plans for that parliamentary year. In 1974, when two general elections were held, there were two State Openings.

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] has opened every session of Parliament since her accession, except in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] respectively. Those two sessions were opened by [[Lords Commissioners]], headed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[Geoffrey Fisher]] in 1959 and [[Michael Ramsey]] in 1963), empowered by the Queen. The [[Lord Chancellor]] ([[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Viscount Kilmuir]] in 1959 and [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Lord Dilhorne]] in 1963) read the Queen's Speech on those occasions.

==Significance==
The State Opening of Parliament is a ceremony filled with historical ritual and symbolic significance for the governance of the United Kingdom. In one place are assembled the members of all three branches of government, of which the Monarch is the authority and nominal head in each part: the [[Crown-in-Parliament]], (the Queen, together with the House of Commons and the House of Lords), constitutes the legislature; the [[King-in-Council|Queen-in-Council]], Her Majesty's Ministers (who are members of one or other House, and members of Her Majesty's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]) constitute the executive; the [[Queen-on-the-Bench]], consisting of Her Majesty's Judges, although not members of either House, are summoned to attend and represent the [[judiciary]]. Therefore, the State Opening demonstrates the governance of the United Kingdom but also the [[separation of powers]]. The importance of international relations is also represented through the presence in the Chamber of the ''[[Diplomatic corps|corps diplomatique]]''.

The ceremonial surrounding the opening of parliament can be broken down into several parts:

===Searching of the cellars===
First, the cellars of the [[Palace of Westminster]] are searched by the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] in order to prevent a modern-day [[Gunpowder Plot]]. The Plot of 1605 involved a failed attempt by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the Protestant [[James I of England|King James I]] and aristocracy. Since that year, the cellars have been searched, now largely, but not only, for ceremonial purposes. This is supervised by the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], and the Yeomen are paid for their services with a small glass of [[port wine]].

===Assembly of Peers and Commons===
The peers assemble in the House of Lords wearing their [[Robes of the British peerage|robes]]. They are joined by senior representatives of the judiciary and members of the diplomatic corps. The Commons assemble in their own chamber, wearing ordinary day dress, and begin the day, as any other, with prayers. The [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] makes his usual procession towards the Commons Chamber, accompanied by his Household, the Mace, and a [[police inspector]] who makes a traditional cry of "Hats off, strangers." This commands those in Central Lobby to remove their hats in deference to the highest-ranking commoner in the realm.

===Delivery of parliamentary hostage===
Before the monarch departs from Buckingham Palace the [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer]], [[Comptroller of the Household|Comptroller]] and [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|Vice-Chamberlain of the Queen's Household]] (all of whom are government whips) deliver ceremonial white staves to her.<ref name="SN02829">{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN02829/SN02829.pdf#page=8 |publisher=House of Commons Library |authors=Jennifer Walpole and Richard Kelly |title=The Whip’s Office |ref=SN/PC/02829 |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2020 }}</ref> The [[Lord Chamberlain]], on behalf of the monarch, keeps the '''hostage MP''' (usually the [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|Vice-Chamberlain]]) "prisoner" for the duration of the state opening, by tradition as a surety for the safe return of the monarch.

The tradition stems from the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who had a contentious relationship with Parliament and was eventually beheaded in 1649 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] between the monarchy and Parliament. A copy of Charles I's death warrant is displayed in the robing room used by the monarch as a ceremonial reminder of what can happen to a monarch who attempts to interfere with Parliament.

===Arrival of royal regalia===
Before the arrival of the sovereign, the [[Imperial State Crown]] is carried to the Palace of Westminster in its own [[Queen Alexandra's State Coach|State Coach]] from the [[Victoria Tower]], the Crown is passed by the sovereign's Bargemaster to the Comptroller of the [[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain's]] office, under the watchful eye of the [[Crown Jeweller]]. It is then carried, along with the Great [[British crown jewels#Swords|Sword of State]] and the [[Cap of Maintenance]], to be displayed in the [[Royal Gallery]]. Also brought in this procession, usually in [[King Edward VII's Town Coach]], are two [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]s, separate from the three used by parliament, to be displayed by the Sergeants-at-Arms in the Royal Procession.

=== Arrival of the Sovereign and assembly of Parliament ===
{{see also|State Procession at the UK Opening of Parliament}}

[[File:King Edward VIII opening Parliament.jpg|thumb|[[King Edward VIII]] surrounded by heralds of the [[College of Arms]] on his only State Opening of Parliament, on 3 November 1936]]

The monarch arrives at the Palace of Westminster from Buckingham Palace in a state coach (since 2014, the [[Diamond Jubilee State Coach]]), entering through the Sovereign's Entrance under the [[Victoria Tower]]; the monarch is usually accompanied by his or her consort and sometimes by other members of the royal family. Members of the armed forces line the procession route from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster. As [[God Save the Queen|the national anthem]] is played, the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] is hoisted to replace the [[Union Flag]] upon the Sovereign's entrance and remains flying whilst they are present. Then, after he or she takes on the [[Coronation of the British Monarch#Sovereign's robes|Parliament Robe of State]]<ref>Over this robe is worn the collar and George of the [[Order of the Garter]]; the George used is a larger than usual gold representation of St. George slaying a dragon and heavily set with diamonds made for George III.</ref><ref>The peers also wear their Parliament Robes, also made of crimson velvet and [[miniver]] (although the miniver is now often replaced with the much cheaper white rabbit fur). These robes are closed over the right shoulder with bands of gold lace and miniver—four for a duke; three and a half for a marquess; three for an earl or countess; two and a half for a viscount or viscountess and two for a baron or baroness.</ref> and [[Imperial State Crown]] in the Robing Chamber, the monarch proceeds through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords, usually accompanied by his or her consort and immediately preceded by the [[Earl Marshal]], and by one peer (usually the [[Leader of the House of Lords]]) carrying the [[Cap of Maintenance]] on a white rod, and another peer (generally a retired senior military officer) carrying the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Swords|Great Sword of State]], all following the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and his white stick, commonly the practical implement of ceremonial ushers, raised aloft. Once seated on the throne, the monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, instructs the House by saying, "My Lords, pray be seated"; her consort takes his seat on the throne to her left and other members of the royal family may be seated elsewhere on the dais (for instance the Prince of Wales may be seated on a chair of state on a lower portion of the dais to the monarch's right).

===Royal summons of the Commons to the Lords' chamber===
[[File:Black Rod knocking Commons door 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Sarah Clarke (Black Rod)]] knocks on the chamber door, October 2019]]
Motioned by the monarch, the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] raises his wand of office to signal to the [[Black Rod|Gentleman/Lady Usher of the Black Rod (known as Black Rod)]], who is charged with summoning the House of Commons and has been waiting in the Central Lobby. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords and a police inspector, proceeds to the Members' Lobby of the [[House of Commons]], and reaches the doors of the Commons.

[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|Leading 17th-century parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] is one of the [[Five Members]] annually commemorated]]
In 1642, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] stormed into the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the [[Five Members]], who included the celebrated English patriot and leading parliamentarian [[John Hampden]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4|pages=24–25}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A. S. Lewis (1977). "Lancashire at War: Cavaliers and Roundheads, 1642-51 : a Series of Talks Broadcast from BBC Radio Blackburn". p. 15. Dalesman</ref> Since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting.<ref name="State opening">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_81000/81909.stm "Democracy Live: Black Rod"]. BBC. Retrieved 6 August 2008</ref>

On Black Rod's approach, the Doorkeeper of the Commons orders that the doors are slammed shut against them, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch.<ref name="State opening"/> The Usher of the Black Rod then strikes with the end of their ceremonial staff (the Black Rod) three times on the closed doors of the Commons Chamber, and is then admitted. (There is a mark on the door of the Commons showing the repeated indentations made by Black Rods over the years.) The Chief Door-keeper of the House of Commons introduces Black Rod. At the bar, Black Rod bows to the Speaker before proceeding to the table, bowing again, and announcing the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons, in the following words:

<blockquote>
Mr [or Madam] Speaker, The Queen commands this honourable House [pauses to bow to both sides of the House] to attend Her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.
</blockquote>

A tradition developed in recent years for this command to be greeted with a defiant topical comment by republican-leaning Labour MP (until 2019) [[Dennis Skinner]], upon which, with some mirth, the House rises to make their way to the Lords' Chamber.<ref name="State opening"/> This customary intervention was omitted by Mr Skinner in 2015, claiming that he had "bigger fish to fry than uttering something", due to a dispute over seating with the Scottish Nationalists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/27/dennis-skinner-queens-speech-quip-fighting-scots-nats|title=Dennis Skinner explains lack of Queen's speech quip: 'I was fighting Scots Nats'|last=Gani|first=Aisha|date=2015-05-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Skinner resumed the practice in 2016, until he was unseated in 2019.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dennis-skinner-zings-queens-speech-7995683</ref> Since then the Scottish Nationalists have continued this trend due to them sharing the view of anti-monarchy with Skinner.

===Procession of the Commons===
[[File:Commons procession to Lords chamber 2019.jpg|thumb|The procession in October 2019]]
The Speaker proceeds to attend the summons at once. The Sergeant-at-Arms picks up the [[ceremonial mace]] and, with the Speaker and Black Rod, leads the Members of the House of Commons as they walk, in pairs, towards the House of Lords. By custom, the members saunter, with much discussion and joking, rather than formally process. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] followed by The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[First Secretary of State]] or another member of the government and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition usually walk side by side, leading the two lines of MPs. The Commons then arrive at the Bar of the House of Lords. The only people required to bow are the House of Commons Speaker, Commons Clerk, senior Lords official Black Rod and the Sergeant-at-Arms. No person who is not a member of the Upper House may pass the Bar unbidden when it is in session; a similar rule applies to the Commons. They remain standing at the Bar during the speech.

=== Delivery of the speech from the throne===
[[File:Thrones in the House of Lords c1902.jpg|thumb|The royal thrones, c. 1902]]

The monarch reads a prepared speech, known as the "[[Speech from the Throne]]" or the "Queen's Speech", outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech is written by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister and their cabinet members]], and reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government seeks the agreement of both [[Houses of Parliament]]. It is traditionally written on goatskin [[vellum]], and presented on bended knee for the monarch to read by the [[Lord Chancellor]], who produces the scroll from a satchel-like bag. Traditionally, rather than turning his back on the Sovereign, which might appear disrespectful, the Lord Chancellor walks backwards down the steps of the throne, continuing to face the monarch. [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Lord Irvine of Lairg]], the Lord Chancellor at the time, sought to break the custom and applied successfully for permission to turn his back on the sovereign and walk down the steps forwards. The next Lord Chancellor, [[Jack Straw]], continued the former tradition but succeeding Lords Chancellor have chosen to walk forwards.

The whole speech is addressed to "My Lords and Members of the House of Commons", with one significant exception that the monarch says specifically, "Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you", since the budget is constitutionally reserved to the Commons.

The monarch reads the entire speech in a neutral and formal tone, implying neither approval nor disapproval of the proposals of Her Government: the monarch makes constant reference to "My Government" when reading the text. After listing the main bills to be introduced during the session, the monarch states: "Other measures will be laid before you", thus leaving the government scope to introduce bills not mentioned in the speech. The monarch mentions any state visits that she intends to make and also any planned state visits of foreign heads of state to the United Kingdom during the parliamentary session. The monarch concludes the speech in saying:

<blockquote>
"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels". 
</blockquote>

Traditionally, the members of both houses of Parliament listen to the speech respectfully, neither applauding nor showing dissent towards its contents before it is debated in each house. This silence, however, was broken in 1998, when Queen Elizabeth II announced the government's plan of abolishing the right of [[hereditary peer]]s to automatically sit in the House of Lords. A few Labour members of the House of Commons cried "yes" and "hear", prompting several of the Lords to shout "no" and "shame". The Queen continued delivering her speech without any pause, ignoring the intervention. The conduct of those who interrupted the speech was strongly criticised at the time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6710000/newsid_6710100/6710121.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1 |work=BBC News | title=1998: Queen's speech to end peers | date=31 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/24/newsid_4007000/4007601.stm |work=BBC News | title=1998: Queen's speech spells end for peers | date=24 November 1998}}</ref>

===Departure of monarch===
[[File:State Opening of Parliament 2008 I (3082920424).jpg|thumb|right|The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace in the [[Irish State Coach]] via [[Whitehall]] and [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] in 2008.]]
[[File:State Opening of Parliament 2015 (17982787869).jpg|thumb|right|The return procession crossing [[Horse Guards Parade]] in 2015.]]
Following the speech, the monarch and his or her retinue leave the chamber. The monarch bows to both sides of the House of Peers and then leaves the chamber, in the reverse order of the usual procession, before the Commons bow again and return to their Chamber.

===Debate on the speech===
After the departure of the Queen from the palace, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an "Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech." But first, each House considers a bill ''[[pro forma]]'' to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the [[Select Vestries Bill]], while the Commons equivalent is the [[Outlawries Bill]]. The bills are considered for the sake of ceremony only, and do not make any actual legislative progress. For the address in reply, a chosen member moves "That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows". The following is the form used in the House of Lords and is nearly identical to that used in the House of Commons:
{{quote|Most Gracious Sovereign,

We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.<ref>Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords 
, 2.07</ref>}}

The first speech of the debate in the Commons is, by tradition, a humorous one given by a member selected in advance. The consideration of the address in reply to the Throne Speech is the occasion for a debate on the Government's agenda. The debate on the Address in Reply is spread over several days. On each day, a different topic, such as foreign affairs or finance, is considered. The debate provides an indication of the views of Parliament regarding the government's agenda.

Following this debate, a vote is taken on the Government Programme. Since the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-term Parliaments Act]], a general election is not automatically triggered if this vote is lost.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Edgington |first1=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32816450 |accessdate=9 October 2019 |work=BBC News |date=9 October 2019 |title=Queen's Speech: What is it and why is it important?}}</ref> Prior to the act, this would have been treated as a [[motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|vote of no confidence]].

=="Dressed down State Opening"==
On three occasions, in March 1974, 2017 and December 2019, the State Opening has been conducted in a "dressed-down" manner, due to the snap general elections held in those years. This form of ceremony has been marked by several changes. Most noticeably, the Queen attended in day dress, rather than the traditional ceremonial robes of state. The Imperial State Crown is carried in front of the Queen, in the same manner as the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance. Also, no carriages or coaches are used, and the Queen arrives at Westminster by car. There is no military escort in the streets for this procession. Finally, certain personages, such as Heralds and Officers of Arms, are not in attendance at the ceremony. Other than these changes, the ceremony remains largely the same.

==Double and cancelled Openings==
Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (including in wartime) the State Opening took place on an annual basis, with the following exceptions:<ref>{{cite web |title=Queens Speech: Proposers of the Loyal Address in the House of Commons since 1900 |url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04064/SN04064.pdf |website=UK Parliament |accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>

* There were two State Openings in 2019 (and no State Opening in 2018).
After 1925, the State Opening invariably took place every year (and twice in 1974) until 2010, since when the government has twice cancelled the event:

==Origins==
{{For|broader historical background|Parliament of England|Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
The Opening of Parliament<ref>Cobb, H.S., 'The Staging of Ceremonies of State in the House of Lords' in ''The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture'' London: Merrell 2000.</ref> began out of practical necessity. By the late 14th century, the manner in which the King gathered his nobles and representatives of the Commons had begun to follow an established pattern. First of all, [[Peerage of England|Peers]]' names were checked against the list of those who had been [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|summoned]], and representatives of the Commons were checked against the [[High Sheriff|sheriffs']] election returns. The Peers were robed and sat in the [[Painted Chamber]] at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]; the Commons were summoned, and stood at the Bar (threshold) of the Chamber. A speech or sermon was then given (usually by the [[Lord Chancellor]]) explaining why Parliament had been summoned, after which the Lords and Commons went separately to discuss the business in hand. The monarch normally presided, not only for the Opening but also for the deliberations which followed (unless prevented by illness or other pressing matters).

In the Tudor period, the modern structure of Parliament began to emerge, and the monarch no longer attended during normal proceedings. For this reason, the State Opening took on greater symbolic significance as an occasion for the full constitution of the State (Monarch, Lords and Commons) to be seen. In this period, the parliamentary gathering began to be preceded by an open-air State [[Procession]] (which often attracted large numbers of onlookers): the Monarch, together with Household retinue, would proceed in State from whichever royal residence was being used, first to Westminster Abbey for a service (usually a [[Votive Mass|Mass of the Holy Ghost]], prior to the Reformation), and thence on foot (accompanied by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in their robes) to the Palace of Westminster for the Opening itself.

[[File:Parliament of Henry VIII 1523.jpg|thumb|Opening of Parliament by [[Henry VIII]] at [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell]]

The Wriothesley Garter Book, a 1523 illustration by Sir [[Thomas Wriothesley]], depicts King Henry VIII seated in Parliament in that year. It shows a remarkable visual similarity between State Openings of the 16th and 21st centuries. In both cases, the monarch sits on a [[throne]] before the Cloth of Estate, crowned and wearing a crimson robe of state; at his right hand sit Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Archbishop of York]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], with arms above under a cardinal's hat, and [[William Warham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with arms above. Behind stands [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], [[Bishop of London]].<ref name="rct.uk">[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book See catalogue entry, royal collection]</ref> The [[Cap of Maintenance]] and [[Sword of State]] are borne by peers standing before the monarch on the left and right respectively; the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] stands alongside, bearing his white wand of office, near the [[Garter King of Arms]] in his [[tabard]] displaying the [[Royal arms of England|royal arms]] (Sir Thomas Wriothesley himself, the illustrator).<ref>Catalogue entry from 'Royal Treasures, A Golden Jubilee Celebration', London, 2002. per catalogue entry, royal collection [https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
</ref> Members of the Royal retinue are arrayed behind the King (top right). In the main body of the Chamber, the Bishops are seated on benches to the King's right wearing their parliamentary robes, with the Mitred Abbots behind them. The Lords Temporal are seated to the King's left and on the cross-bench, the status of peers is indicated by the number of miniver bars (white fur edged with gold oak-leaf lace) on their peerage robes: 4 for a duke, 3½ for a marquess, 3 for an earl, 2½ for a viscount, and 2 for a baron. Thus there are 2 dukes, both wearing ducal coronets, the first holding a Marshal's Baton, thus he is the [[Duke of Norfolk]], [[Earl Marshal]] of England. Sir [[William Weston (prior)|William Weston]], Prior of the [[Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]], premier baron in the roll of peers, dressed in black, sits at the end of the cross-bench.<ref name="rct.uk"/> The judges (red-robed and [[coif]]ed) are on the [[woolsack]]s in the centre (two [[Chief Justice]]s, eight judges, and four [[Serjeants-at-Law]]<ref name="rct.uk"/>), and behind them kneel the clerks (with quills and inkpots). At the bottom of the picture members of the House of Commons can be seen behind the Bar of the House, with Sir [[Thomas More]],<ref name="rct.uk"/> [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], in the centre, wearing his black and gold robe of state.

Since that time the ceremonial has evolved, but not dramatically. Mitred Abbots were removed from Parliament at the time of the Reformation. In 1679 neither the procession nor the Abbey service took place, due to fears of a [[Popish Plot]]; although the procession was subsequently restored, the service in the Abbey was not. The monarch's role in the proceedings changed over time: early on, the monarch would say some introductory words, before calling upon the Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) to address the assembly. James I, however, was accustomed to speak at greater length himself, and sometimes dispensed with the Chancellor's services as spokesman. This varying pattern continued in subsequent reigns (and during the Commonwealth, when Cromwell gave the speech), but from 1679 onwards it became the norm for the monarch alone to speak. Since then, the monarch (if present) has almost invariably given the speech, with the exception of George I (whose command of English was poor) and Victoria (after the death of Prince Albert). A dramatic change was occasioned by the destruction of the old Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834; however, the new palace was designed with the ceremony of the State Opening very much in mind,<ref>Cannadine, D., 'The Palace of Westminster as Palace of Varieties' in ''The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture'' London: Merrell 2000</ref> and the modern ceremony dates from its opening in 1852.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/archives-state-opening/ "The State Opening of Parliament - A Perspective from the Archives"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001023925/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/archives-state-opening/ |date=1 October 2015 }}, www.parliament.uk.

In 1998, adjustments were made to the ceremonial inside Parliament to shorten the proceedings. The [[herald]]s, instead of processing with the monarch, arrived at Parliament earlier and had a separate procession. The number of court officials in the procession was reduced, including one of the [[lady in waiting|ladies in waiting]] and the [[Crown Equerry]]. Also omitted were the three [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Heads of the Armed Services]], represented instead by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]. [[Gold Stick and Silver Stick|Silver Stick in Waiting]] (the Commander of the Household Cavalry) no longer processed, although Gold Stick-in-Waiting (the honorary Colonel of the Household Cavalry) retained a place.<ref>{{cite news|title=State Opening loses some pomp|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/11/98/queen_speech/216684.stm|accessdate=18 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=24 November 1998}}</ref>

Similar ceremonies are held in other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[governor-general]] or, in the case of [[States and territories of Australia|Australia's states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's provinces]], the relevant [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]] or [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]], respectively, usually delivers the speech from the throne. On occasion, the monarch may open these parliaments and deliver the speech herself. In both Australia and Canada, the last time this occurred was in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/aso/so004 |title= Opening of Parliament by the Queen |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.aph.gov.au |publisher=Parliament of Australia |access-date=7 October 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/a-visit-by-the-queen-in-1977 |title=A visit by the Queen in 1977 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.cbc.ca |publisher= CBC/Radio-Canada |access-date=7 October 2017 }}</ref> In New Zealand, the monarch last opened parliament personally in February 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=Display of royal memorabilia |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201104261/display-of-royal-memorabilia |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=29 April 2011 |quote=During her first eagerly awaited tour over the summer of 1953-4 Parliament was summoned for a special short session in January to allow her to open Parliament and deliver the Speech from the Throne.

In February 1977 she opened another special session at the same time as formally opening the Beehive (the Executive Wing). More recently she has opened Parliament in February 1986 and February 1990.}}</ref>
 
In India, the [[President of India]] opens Parliament with an address similar to the Speech from the Throne. This is also the case in Commonwealth Republics with a non-executive Presidency such as [[Malta]], Mauritius and [[Singapore]].

In the [[Netherlands]] a similar ceremony is held on the third Tuesday in September, which is called ''[[Prinsjesdag]]'' in the Netherlands. Article 65 of the constitution states that "A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government is given by or on behalf of the King before a joint session of the two Houses of the States General that is held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament." In Norway, the King is required by Article 74 of the constitution to preside over the opening of the Storting after it had been declared to be legally constituted by the president of the Storting. After he delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government's policies for the coming year, a member of the government reads the Report on the State of the Realm, an account of the government's achievements of the past year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=30059 |title=Opening of the Storting |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.royalcourt.no |publisher=Royal House of Norway |access-date=7 October 2017}}</ref>

In Sweden a similar ceremony as the British was held until 1974, when the constitution was changed. The old opening of state was in Sweden called ''Riksdagens högtidliga öppnande'' ("The solemn opening of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]") and was, as the British, full of symbolism. After the abolition of the old state opening, the opening is now held in the Riksdag but in the presence of the [[King of Sweden|monarch]] and his family. It is still the King who officially opens the parliament. After the opening of parliament the King gives a speech followed by the Prime Minister's declaration of government.

In Israel, a semi-annual ceremony, attended by the [[President of Israel|President]], opens the winter and summer sessions of the [[Knesset]]. Though in the past he was a guest sitting in the Knesset's upper deck, the President now attends the ceremony from the speaker's podium and gives his own written address regarding the upcoming session. In the first session of each legislative period of the Knesset, the President has the duty of opening the first session himself and inaugurating the temporary Knesset speaker, and then conducting the inauguration process of all of the Knesset members.

In some countries with presidential or similar systems in which the roles of [[head of state]] and head of government are merged, the chief executive's annual speech to the legislative branch is imbued with some of the ceremonial weight of a parliamentary state opening. The most well-known example is the [[State of the Union address|State of the Union Address]] in the United States. Other examples include the [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] in the Philippines, a former American dependency. These speeches differ from a State Opening in at least two respects, however: they do not in fact open the legislative session, and they are delivered by the chief executive on his or her own behalf. In Poland, the [[President of Poland]] delivers his speech to the ''[[Sejm]]'' and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] at the First Sitting of these Houses, which is similar to Speech from the Throne. It is rather a custom than a law. Most [[President of Poland|Presidents of Poland]] delivered the Speech to the [[Parliament of Poland|Parliament]]. The exception was in 2007, when President [[Lech Kaczyński]], instead of addressing the ''Sejm'', watched the First Sitting of the 6th term ''Sejm'' from the Presidential box in the Press gallery.
