'''''Bigger ''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by American [[country music]] duo [[Sugarland]]. It was released on June 8, 2018, through [[Big Machine Records]]. This is their first album in 8 years since 2010's ''[[The Incredible Machine (album)|The Incredible Machine]]'', and first on Big Machine.

==Background==
After a five-year hiatus, at the [[51st Annual Country Music Association Awards|51st Annual CMA Awards]], Bush and Nettles reunited to present Vocal Duo of the Year. Nettles mentioned all the years that Sugarland won Vocal Duo of the Year, "2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011…and well, who knows?", teasing new music from the duo. After the ceremony, the two tweeted a photo of themselves at the CMA's with the caption #StillTheSame.<ref name="Teases to New Music">{{cite web|last1=Juneau|first1=Jen|title=Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush Reunite at CMA Awards — and Tease New Music!|url=http://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-sugarland-reunion-new-music/|website=People|publisher=Time Inc.|date=November 8, 2017|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref> 
The lead single "Still the Same" was released on December 21, 2017. Sugarland announced the album, album title and track listing on April 12, 2018. One of the songs on the album, "[[Babe (Sugarland song)|Babe]]" features American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Swift wrote the song with [[Train (band)|Train]] frontman [[Patrick Monahan]] for her 2012 album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' but the song didn't release in the album. After the CMA's Swift got in touch with Sugarland, told them how excited she was that they were getting back together and mentioned she had a song for them. This is the first song Sugarland have recorded that wasn't written by Bush and Nettles.<ref name="Babe">{{cite web|last1=Juneau|first1=Jen|title=Sugarland and Taylor Swift Release Breakup Song 'Babe' — Find Out the Story Behind the Track|url=http://people.com/country/sugarland-taylor-swift-babe-collaboration/|website=People|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Bigger">{{cite web|last1=Hudak|first1=Joseph|title=Sugarland Announce New Album 'Bigger,' Taylor Swift Collaboration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/sugarland-announce-new-album-bigger-taylor-swift-collaboration-w519097|website=Rolling Stone|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[All Music]] gave it four out of five star rating saying, that the album "does indeed deliver on its titular promise to be a grand, majestic album, but emotions are not in its skyscraper sweep."<ref name="All Music">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bigger-mw0003172342|title=Bigger – Sugarland|work=[[All Music]]|publisher=All Music|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Brittany McKenna of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was positive saying, "The arrangements of ''Bigger'' are grander, the vocals more theatrical, and the themes – which occasionally veer into the political – decidedly more topical. The album takes cue from current trends while adamantly retaining the spirit that made their songs like "Stay" such massive hits. In other words, it's still a Sugarland record, but one tailor-made for our odd moment, where female voices like Nettles' are louder than ever thanks to movements like [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] and [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]] but still largely missing from country radio."<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/sugarlands-new-album-bigger-track-by-track-guide-w521208|title=Sugarland's New Album 'Bigger': Track-by-Track Guide|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=McKenna|first=Brittany|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Jermey Burchard of ''Wide Open Country'' describes the album as "their best yet", and they "are coming back into the county landscape at more creative and promising timing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wideopencountry.com/album-review-sugarlands-bigger-is-their-best-yet/|title=Album Review: Sugarland’s ‘Bigger’ is Their Best Yet|work=Wide Open Country|last=Burchard|first=Jeremy|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>
