'''Noor Hossain''' ({{lang-bn|নূর হোসেন}}; Anglicised: '''Nur Hossain''', 1961 – November 10, 1987) was a Bangladeshi activist who was killed by the [[Bangladesh Police]] on November 10, 1987, while protesting against President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] near Zero Point in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. Zero Point was later renamed Noor Hossain Square and the anniversary of his death is officially commemorated each year as [[Shaheed Noor Hossain Day|Shohid Noor Hossain Day]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|first=Steven R. |last=Weisman |title =3 Die As Police Clash With Protesters In Bangladesh |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 11, 1987 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/world/3-die-as-police-clash-with-protesters-in-bangladesh.html}}</ref><ref name=bdnews24>{{cite news|title=25 years of sacrifice for democracy |newspaper=bdnews24.com |date=November 10, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2012/11/09/25-years-of-sacrifice-for-democracy}}</ref> He is one of the most widely known martyrs of Bangladesh's pro-democracy movement.

== Early life ==
Hossain's ancestral home on his father's side was in the village of Jhatibunia, which is located in [[Mathbaria Upazila]], [[Pirojpur District]]. His father was an [[autorickshaw]] operator. His family moved to 79/1 Banagram Road, Dhaka after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Noor Hossain attended Radhasundari Primary School, which was also on Banagram Road. When he was in 8th grade at Graduate High School, Dhaka, Hossain quit school because of poverty. He was admitted to a [[Motor car|motor]] driving school and received training in driving like his father. Interested in politics, Hossain became the publicity secretary of the Banagram unit committee of [[Dhaka City]] [[Bangladesh Awami League|Joubo League]].<ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite book |last=Kader |first=Rozina |year=2012 |chapter=Hossain, Shahid Nur |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Hossain,_Shahid_Nur |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> He was neither well-off nor highly educated but he embodied the struggle of common people of the country, and has become a public symbol.<ref name=RubanaHuq />

==Dhaka Siege==

On November 10, 1987, political opponents came together for what they called a "Dhaka Siege" (Dhaka Blockade) to demand an end to the rule of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad based on violations of democracy. Although he had been in power since 1982 through a [[coup d'état]], he won the October 1987 election but opponents charged it was a fraud. The [[Awami League]] and [[Bangladesh National Party]] united in opposition against Ershad's rule.<ref name=RubanaHuq /> One opposition demand was an election of the [[Jatiya Sangsad|National Assembly]] under a non-partisan [[caretaker government]]. The rally turned violent and several leaders and protester Noor Hossain were killed under riot conditions, as well as several hundred injured at the time.<ref name=nytimes /><ref name=AFP1 /> Noor Hossain was among three [[Jubo League]] members killed at a protest rally. The other two were leaders Nurul Huda Babul and Aminul Huda Tito.<ref name=nytimes /><ref name=bdnews24 /> In the aftermath, the opposition called for a nationwide protest strike on November 11 and 12.<ref name="prothomalo">{{cite news|script-title = bn:শহীদ নূর হোসেন দিবস আজ  |language=bn |newspaper=Prothom Alo |author= Mahfuz Anam |date=November 10, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |url= http://www.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/article/367057/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%B9%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%A6-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B9%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%9C}}</ref>
Hossain is now associated in Bangladesh with anti-autocracy and pro-democracy. At the time he was shot, his body carried several slogans in white paint. He wore the slogan "Down with autocracy" ''(Sairachar nipat jak)'' on his chest, and on his back, he had written the slogan "Let Democracy Be Free" ''(Ganatantra mukti pak)''.<ref name="NewAgeObserved">{{cite news|title=Noor Hossain Day observed |newspaper=New Age (Bangladesh) |date=November 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url=http://newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2012-11-11&nid=29746#.VMpw_I5s7cc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235646/http://newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2012-11-11&nid=29746#.VMpw_I5s7cc |archivedate=December 2, 2013 }}</ref> His death raised the visibility of opposition sentiment directed against the Ershad government.
Ershad was removed from office December 6, 1990 as a result of the mass movement that grew from the Dhaka Siege.<ref name=NewAgeObserved /><ref name=bdnews24 /> After Ershad was out of office, [[Khaleda Zia]] of the BNP was elected as Bangladesh's first female Prime Minister and a year later the government established a national date to commemorate the event. It was first called "Historic November 10 observance" but the Awami League supported the phrase "Noor Hossain Day", by which it is known today.<ref name="AFP1">{{cite news|title=Autocracy dethroned, but Bangladesh ponders future of democracy |last=Qadir |publisher=[[Agence France Presse]] |date=November 11, 1991|url = http://www.tutorgigpedia.com/Ganatantra_es.html}}</ref> Ershad's [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] became part of the Awami League coalition after his removal, and later Ershad apologized for Hossain's death. The Jatiya Party does commemorate the day but refers to it as "Democracy Day" (Bengali: Ganatantra Dibash).<ref name=FE />
Noor Hossain and the square remained significant for protesters after Hossian's death in 1987 and Ershad's removal in 1990. In 1993, the Awami League led protesters to the square on the occasion of the November 10 anniversary against the BNP government, which also provoked a reaction from the police.<ref name=AFP2>{{cite news|title=Police use tear gas, batons as Bangladesh opposition demonstrates |publisher=Agence France Presse |date=November 10, 1993}}</ref>
In 1996, Ershad officially apologized for Hossain's death before parliament<ref name=AFP3>{{cite news|title=Ershad offers olive branch, calls for national reconciliation |publisher=Agence France Presse |date=August 28, 1996}}</ref> and also to Hossain's father. Ershad maintained his apology but also criticized the opposition in using Hossain as a symbol against his government. In 2012, he said, "You (the opposition) came up with dead bodies as they were needed to spark demonstrations."<ref name=FE>{{cite news|title=Corpses were needed to spark agitation: Ershad |newspaper=The Financial Express (Bangladesh) |date=November 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/index.php?ref=MjBfMTFfMTFfMTJfMV8zXzE0OTYwMQ==}}</ref>

Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] has given her own account of Hossain's death: "I remember what happened on that day. Noor Hossain was standing beside me when we took out our procession.
