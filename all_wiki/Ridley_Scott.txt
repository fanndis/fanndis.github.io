Scott went on to study at the [[Royal College of Art]] in London, contributing to college magazine ''ARK'' and helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, ''[[Boy and Bicycle]]'', starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section of ''The Duellists'' DVD). In February 1963, Scott was named in the title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programme [[Tonight (1957 TV series)|''Tonight'']]. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series ''[[Z-Cars]]'' and science fiction series ''[[Out of the Unknown]]''.

==Career==
===1970s: ''The Duellists'', ''Alien''===
''[[The Duellists]]'' (1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and won an award for Best Debut Film. ''The Duellists'' had limited commercial impact internationally. Set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it follows two French [[Hussar]] officers, D'Hubert and Feraud ([[Keith Carradine]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.<ref>Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman, Nancy Kang (2013).

Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', but after seeing ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directing ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switch [[Ellen Ripley]] from the standard male action hero to a [[Girl Power in popular culture#Female action heroes and science fiction|heroine]].<ref name="Female icon">{{cite magazine|title=Great Female Roles That Were Originally Written for Men|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/female-characters-written-for-men|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=17 December 2016}}</ref> Ripley (played by [[Sigourney Weaver]]), who appeared in the first four ''Alien'' films, would become a cinematic icon.<ref name="Female icon"/> The final scene of [[John Hurt]]'s character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.<ref name="memorable">Sources that refer to the final scene of Hurt's character in ''Alien'' as one of the most memorable in cinematic history include these:

In 1985, Scott directed ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'', a fantasy film produced by [[Arnon Milchan]]. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott cast [[Tom Cruise]] as the film's hero, Jack; [[Mia Sara]] as Princess Lili; and [[Tim Curry]] as the [[Satan]]-horned Lord of Darkness.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ridley Scott's beautiful dark twisted fantasy: the making of Legend|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/legend-ridley-scott/tom-cruise-making-of/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 November 2015}}</ref> Scott had a forest set built on the [[007 Stage]] at [[Pinewood Studios]] in Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter.<ref>Pirani, Adam (December 1985). "Ridley Scott: SF's Visual Magician". ''Starlog''. p. 64.</ref> In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire; [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score by [[Tangerine Dream]]. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Despite a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become a [[cult classic]]. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/as-snow-white-the-huntsman-hits-theaters-5-more-fractured-fairytale-movies-20120531?page=2 |title=5 Fractured Fairy Tale Movies Worth Watching After 'Snow White and the Huntsman' |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |access-date=24 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225184450/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/as-snow-white-the-huntsman-hits-theaters-5-more-fractured-fairytale-movies-20120531?page=2 |archive-date=25 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Scott made ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]'', a romantic thriller starring [[Tom Berenger]] and [[Mimi Rogers]] in 1987, and ''[[Black Rain (1989 American film)|Black Rain]]'' (1989), a police drama starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Andy García]], shot partially in Japan. Both achieved mild success at the box office. ''Black Rain'' was the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composer [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hans Zimmer career interview|url=https://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1690|agency=Empire magazine|date=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Orchestral manoeuvres in the dark |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2014-05/16/hans-zimmer-interview/viewall |magazine=GQ |date=21 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018215003/https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2014-05/16/hans-zimmer-interview/viewall |archive-date=18 October 2014 }}</ref>

=== 1990s: ''Thelma & Louise'' ===
The road film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991) starring [[Geena Davis]] as Thelma, [[Susan Sarandon]] as Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role for [[Brad Pitt]] as J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Russell Smith|title=Brad Pitt Only Does Interesting Movie Roles|date=19 October 1993|work=[[Deseret News]]|page=EV6|quote=It was in 1991, when he hitched his ride with [[Geena Davis]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] in ''Thelma & Louise,'' that Pitt's star began to twinkle in earnest.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3687795.stm |title=Brad Pitt's epic journey |date=13 May 2004 |work=BBC News |access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref> His next project, independently funded historical epic ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', was a box office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]] (French star [[Gérard Depardieu]]). Scott did not release another film for four years.

In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company, [[Scott Free Productions]], in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting with ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'' and ''[[G.I. Jane]]'', have been produced under the [[Scott Free Productions|Scott Free]] banner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studio [[Shepperton Studios]]. In 2001, Shepperton merged with [[Pinewood Studios]] to become [[The Pinewood Studios Group]], which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ridley Scott: 'I'm doing pretty good, if you think about it'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/ridley-scott-im-doing-pretty-good-if-you-think-about-it-2068888.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 October 2015}}</ref>

===2000s: ''Gladiator'', ''Black Hawk Down'', other films===
Scott's historical drama ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes.

Scott directed ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film, ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001), featuring [[Tom Hardy]] in his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives in [[Somalia]]; Scott was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.<ref name="Britannica"/> In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project, ''[[Matchstick Men]]'', adapted from the novel by [[Eric Garcia (writer)|Eric Garcia]] and starring [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Sam Rockwell]] and [[Alison Lohman]]. It received mostly positive reviews, but performed moderately at the box office.

In 2005, he made the modestly successful ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', a film about the [[Crusades]]. The film starred [[Orlando Bloom]], and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer [[Harry Gregson-Williams]].<ref name="HG Williams">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/martian-composer-creating-matt-damons-828847|title='The Martian' Composer on Creating Matt Damon's Theme, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' Plans|first=Ryan |last=Gajewski|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=3 October 2015|access-date=5 January 2016}}</ref> The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mooviees.com/9136/1804-production_notes|title=''Mooviess.com'' Kingdom of Heaven production notes|access-date=16 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112081521/http://www.mooviees.com/9136/1804-production_notes|archive-date=12 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unhappy with the theatrical version of ''Kingdom of Heaven'' (which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomofheavendvd.com|title=''Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut'' DVD official website|access-date=28 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907232309/http://www.kingdomofheavendvd.com/|archive-date=7 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The director's cut of ''Kingdom of Heaven'' has been met with critical acclaim, with ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine calling the film an "epic", adding: "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle."<ref name="Kingdom">{{cite magazine|title=Directors Cuts, the Good, the Bad, and the Unnecessary|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/special-editions-good-bad-unnecessary/|magazine=Empire|date=10 January 2015}}</ref> "This is the one that should have gone out" reflected Scott.<ref name="Kingdom"/> Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat.

Scott teamed up again with ''Gladiator'' star [[Russell Crowe]] for ''[[A Good Year]]'', based on the best-selling book by [[Peter Mayle]] about an investment banker who finds a new life in [[Provence]]. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days later [[Rupert Murdoch]], chairman of studio [[20th Century Fox]] (who backed the film) dismissed ''A Good Year'' as "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.<ref>{{cite news | title=A Good Year is a 'flop', Murdoch admits | date=16 November 2006 | url =http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1949283,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=UK | access-date=24 February 2007 }}</ref>

Scott's next film was ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', based on the story of real-life drug kingpin [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]]. Scott took over the project in early 2006, and had screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] rewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas and [[Richie Roberts]]. [[Denzel Washington]] signed on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring. The film premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and box office success, and Scott was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Golden Globe for Best Director]].<ref name="Britannica"/>

In late 2008, Scott's espionage thriller ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'', starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and Russell Crowe, opened to lukewarm ticket-sales and mixed reviews. Scott directed a revisionist adaptation of ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', which starred Russell Crowe as [[Robin Hood]] and [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Maid Marian]]. It was released in May 2010 to mixed reviews, but a respectable box-office.

Appearing in the lead role in Scott's ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', [[Russell Crowe]] commented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."<ref name="gangster">''American Gangster'' DVD, ''Fallen Empire: The Making of American Gangster'' documentary</ref> Paul M. Sammon, in his book ''Future Noir: The Making of [[Blade Runner]]'', commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Caldwell |url=http://www.brmovie.com/Articles/Sammon_Interview_11.htm |title=Paul M. Sammon interview |publisher=BRmovie.com |access-date=6 March 2010}}</ref> More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film, ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', [[Charlize Theron]] praised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.<ref name="Prometheus_Theron">{{cite news | url=http://movies.inquirer.net/3843/%E2%80%9Cprometheus%E2%80%9D-crew-on-a-mission-collision | title="Prometheus" Crew: On A Mission Collision | work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | date=29 April 2012 | access-date=7 May 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516075620/http://movies.inquirer.net/3843/%E2%80%9Cprometheus%E2%80%9D-crew-on-a-mission-collision | archive-date=16 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> When working on epics, Scott states, "there’s always the danger that the characters can get swamped" on a large canvas, before adding, "My model is [[David Lean]], whose characters never got lost in the proscenium."<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ridley-scotts-brilliant-first-film Ridley Scott's Brilliant First Film]. ''New Yorker'' (28 May 2012). Retrieved 15 June 2020</ref>

Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, with [[Girl Power in popular culture#Female action heroes and science fiction|heroines]] also a common theme.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Heroines"/><ref name="Female heroes"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800015105/bio |title=Yahoo! Movies: Ridley Scott |publisher=Yahoo! |date=30 November 1937 |access-date=6 March 2010}}</ref> His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Visual style"/> Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''Blade Runner''; the ''LA Times'' critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in ''Alien'', with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have an [[eidetic memory]], which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/ridley-scott-magic-comes-over-the-horizon-every-day/ |title=Ridley Scott: 'Magic comes over the horizon every day' &#124; Hero Complex – movies, comics, pop culture|work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 April 2012 |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and&nbsp;– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up&nbsp;– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."<ref name="gangster"/>

[[Artificial intelligence]] is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 121-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The recent book ''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'' identifies [[Alan Turing]] and [[John Searle]], a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the [[Turing test]] and the [[Chinese Room]] Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants," which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 136-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence in ''Blade Runner'', ''Alien'', and ''Prometheus''," concludes by citing the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in ''Blade Runner'' (Rutger Hauer), the android [[Ash (Alien)|Ash]] (Ian Holm) in ''Alien'', and the android [[David 8]] (Michael Fassbender) in ''Prometheus'', where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 140-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref>

==DVD format and Director's Cut==
[[File:Prince Charles Theatre showing Blade Runner.JPG|thumb|right|''Blade Runner: The Final Cut'' at [[Prince Charles Cinema]], London in 2015]]
Scott is known for his enthusiasm for the DVD format, providing [[Audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."<ref name="totalfilm"/>

Running alongside his enthusiasm for DVD, Scott is known for his use of the [[director's cut]].<ref name="Kingdom"/> The positive reaction to the ''Blade Runner'' Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including ''Legend'' and ''Kingdom of Heaven''), which have been met with great acclaim.<ref name="Kingdom"/> Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.

==Accolades==
[[File:Ridley Scott at the RCA July 2015.jpg|thumb|Sir Ridley Scott, Honorary Doctor, at the [[Royal College of Art]], July 2015]]
Scott was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[2003 New Year Honours]] for services to the British film industry.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=56797 |date=31 December 2002 |page=1 |supp=y}}</ref> He received his accolade from [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at an investiture ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 July 2003.<ref name="knighted"/> Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up in [[South Shields]], I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."<ref>{{cite news |title=Queen knights Gladiator director |work=BBC News |date=8 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3054254.stm |access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>

He has been nominated for three [[Academy Award for Directing|Academy Awards for Directing]]—''Thelma & Louise'', ''Gladiator'' and ''Black Hawk Down''—as well as a Golden Globe, BAFTA and 2 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. In 1995, Ridley and his brother [[Tony Scott|Tony]] received the [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] for [[BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award|Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema]].<ref name="Outstanding contribution"/> In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, the [[BAFTA Fellowship]], for lifetime achievement.<ref name="BAFTA Felowship"/>
