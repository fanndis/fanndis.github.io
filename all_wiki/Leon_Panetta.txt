==Political career==

===Early political career===
Panetta started in politics in 1966 as a [[legislative assistant]] to Republican [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Thomas Kuchel]], the [[United States Senate Minority Whip]] from California, whom Panetta has called "a tremendous role model".<ref>[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Panetta/panetta-con2.html "Conversation with Leon Panetta"], p. 2</ref>

In 1969 he became the assistant to [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert H. Finch]], [[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare|Secretary]] of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] under the [[Nixon administration]]. Soon thereafter he was appointed Director of the [[Office for Civil Rights]].<ref>Gizzi, John (April 28, 2011), [http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=43198 "Leon Panetta: Bipartisan in Spirit but a Liberal at Heart"], ''Human Events''</ref>

Panetta chose to enforce [[civil rights]] and equal education laws over the objection of President Nixon, who wanted enforcement to move slowly in keeping with his strategy to gain political support among Southern whites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/lawyerswholead/leon-panetta/|title=Leon Panetta Confirmed as New U.S. Secretary of Defense - Santa Clara Law}}</ref> [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]] and Assistant Secretary [[John Veneman]] supported Panetta and refused to fire him, threatening to resign if forced to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19700223&id=7PxHAAAAIBAJ&pg=3933,3477024|title=The Victoria Advocate - Google News Archive Search}}</ref> Eventually forced out of office in 1970, Panetta left Washington to work as Executive Assistant for [[John Lindsay]], the then-Republican Mayor of New York City (Lindsay would switch parties the following year.) Panetta wrote about his Nixon administration experience in his 1971 book ''Bring Us Together''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL7097839W/Bring_us_together|title=Bring us together: the Nixon team and the civil rights retreat|last1=Gall|first1=Peter|last2=E|first2=Panetta, Leon|date=1971|publisher=Lippincott|edition=[1st ed.]|location=Philadelphia}}</ref>

===U.S. House of Representatives===

====Elections====
[[File:Leon Panetta congressional photo 1977.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Congressional portrait of Panetta]]
Like Lindsay, Panetta switched to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1971, because, he said, he thought that the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] was moving away from the political center.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Leon Panetta B.S.

At the time of Panetta's first election, it also included the northern part of [[San Luis Obispo County]].)

====Tenure====
During his time in Congress, Panetta concentrated mostly on budget issues, civil rights, education, healthcare, agriculture, immigration, and environmental protection, particularly preventing oil drilling off the California coast. He wrote the [[Hunger Prevention Act]] (Public Law 100-435) of 1988 and the Fair Employment Practices Resolution. He was the author of legislation establishing the [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]],<ref name=usccb /> and legislation providing Medicare coverage for hospice care. Working with Chancellor Barry Munitz of CSU, he helped establish CSU Monterey Bay at the former Fort Ord military base.

He also attempted to form the Big Sur National Scenic Area with  Senator [[Alan Cranston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E48RAAAAIAAJ|title=The Big Sur Coast National Scenic Area Act: hearing before the Subcommittee on Parks, Recreation, and Renewable Resources of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, Ninety-sixth Congress, second session, on S. 2551 ...

It budgeted $100 million to buy land from private land owners, up to $30 million for easements and management programs, and created a state plan for a zone about {{convert|75|mile}} long and {{convert|5|mile}} wide along the [[Big Sur]] coast.

The bill was opposed by California Senator [[S. I. Hayakawa]], development interests, and Big Sur residents. Local residents mocked the plan as 'Panetta's Pave 'n' Save,' and raised a fund of more than $100,000 to lobby against the proposal.<ref name=nytimes8601>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/28/us/plan-for-big-sur-severely-restricts-development.html|title=Plan for Big Sur Severely Restricts Development|last1=Lindsey|first1=Robert|date=1986|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|last2=Times|first2=Special to the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070724/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/28/us/plan-for-big-sur-severely-restricts-development.html|archive-date=2017-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=Ward|title=Big Sur Coastline Caught Up in a Riptide on Potomac|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/15/big-sur-coastline-caught-up-in-a-riptide-on-potomac/812d46bf-1b05-42ac-aa91-eae09ac951d6/|accessdate=30 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=15 October 1980}}</ref> The legislation was blocked by Hayakawa in the Energy Committee and did not reach a vote.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://anseladams.com/ansel-adams-the-role-of-the-artist-in-the-environmental-movement/|first1=Robert|last1=Turnage|title=Ansel Adams - The Role of the Artist in the Environmental Movement|date=1980-03-04|work=Ansel Adams Gallery|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028042452/http://anseladams.com/ansel-adams-the-role-of-the-artist-in-the-environmental-movement/|archive-date=2017-10-28}}</ref><ref name=stammer>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-06/news/mn-15768_1_big-sur-coast|title=Bill Proposed to Ban New Development in Big Sur Area|last=Stammer|first=LARRY B.|date=1986-03-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201214439/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-06/news/mn-15768_1_big-sur-coast|archive-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigsurgazette.com/issues/020_March_1980.pdf|title=County Local Coastal Plan Lacks Funds|date=February 27, 1980|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201934/http://bigsurgazette.com/issues/020_March_1980.pdf|page=5|archive-date=2016-02-07|url-status=live|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>

====Budget Committee====
A member of the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Committee on the Budget]] from 1979 to 1989, and its chairman from 1989 to 1993, Panetta played a key role in the 1990 Budget Summit.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IVgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yyQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1342,4345059&dq=leon+panetta+budget+summit&hl=en "Budget Summit Opens"], by Tom Raum, Associated Press, published in ''Hendersonville Times-News'', May 16, 1990</ref><ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/735286652.html?dids=735286652:735286652&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Dec+11%2C+1992&author=Marshall+Ingwerson+Staff+writer+of+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&desc=As+Budget+Chief%2C+Panetta+May+Be+Frugal+Deficit+Foe&pqatl=google "As Budget Chief, Panetta May Be Frugal Deficit Foe"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', December 11, 1992</ref>

===Director of the Office of Management and Budget===
Though elected to a ninth term in 1992, Panetta left the House at the beginning of 1993, after President-elect Bill Clinton selected him to serve as Director of the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]]. In that role he developed the budget package that would eventually result in the balanced budget of 1998.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===White House Chief of Staff===
In 1994, President Clinton became increasingly concerned about a lack of order and focus in the White House and asked Panetta to become his new Chief of Staff, replacing [[Mack McLarty]]. According to author [[Nigel Hamilton (author)|Nigel Hamilton]], "Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clinton's first term—and the rest is history. To be a great leader, a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta, Clinton got the enforcer he deserved."<ref name="Hamilton2007">{{cite book |title=Bill Clinton: Mastering the Presidency |last=Hamilton |first=Nigel |year=2007 |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58648-516-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/billclintonmaste00hami_0 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Panetta was appointed [[White House Chief of Staff]] on July 17, 1994, and he held that position until January 20, 1997.

On January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Panetta to the post of [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref name="named DCI"/>

At the time of his selection, journalists and politicians raised concerns about Panetta's limited experience in intelligence, aside from his two-year service as a [[military intelligence]] officer in the 1960s. California Democratic Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], the Chairman of the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], expressed concerns that she was not consulted about the Panetta appointment and stated her belief that "the Agency is best-served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/23827/dianne-feinstein-not-too-pleased-with-panetta-pick |title=Dianne Feinstein Not Too Pleased With Panetta Pick « The Washington Independent |publisher=Washingtonindependent.com |accessdate=August 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121031858/http://washingtonindependent.com/23827/dianne-feinstein-not-too-pleased-with-panetta-pick |archive-date=November 21, 2010 }}</ref>

====Tenure====
[[File:Leon Panetta official portrait.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Panetta as Director of the CIA.]]
{{wikisource|Message from the Director: Interrogation Policy and Contracts}}

On February 19, 2009, Panetta was sworn in as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] by Vice President [[Joe Biden]] before an audience of CIA employees. Panetta reportedly received a "rock star welcome" from his new subordinates.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/02/19/leon-panetta-gets-a-rock-star-welcome-at-cia-headquarters-2/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Leon Panetta Gets a Rock Star Welcome at CIA Headquarters | date=February 19, 2009}}</ref>

As CIA Director, Panetta traveled extensively to intelligence outposts around the world and worked with international leaders to confront threats of [[Islamic extremism]] and [[Taliban]]. In 2010 working with the Senate Intelligence Committee, he conducted a secret review of the [[use of torture by the CIA]] ([[euphemism|euphemistically]] referred to as "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]") during the [[administration of George W. Bush]]. The review, which came to be known by 2014 as the "[[Panetta Review]]," yielded a series of memoranda that, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "cast a particularly harsh light" on the Bush-era interrogation program.<ref name="nytimes03072014">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/politics/behind-clash-between-cia-and-congress-a-secret-report-on-interrogations.html|title=Behind Clash Between C.I.A. and Congress, a Secret Report on Interrogations|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 7, 2014|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti}}</ref> The Times notes "The effort to write the exhaustive history of the C.I.A.’s detention operations was fraught from the beginning. President Obama officially ended the program... during his first week in office, in 2009. The intelligence committee announced its intention to take a hard look at the program, but there was little appetite inside the [Obama] White House to accede to the committee’s request for all classified C.I.A. cables related to it." The findings of the Panetta Review reportedly aligned with much of what the [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]]<ref name=nytimes03072014/> found in its factual accounting. Both reports were largely seen as an effort in fact-finding and prevention, but not a governmental path towards some possible project of accountability or punishment for past interrogation or torture.

Panetta supported the Obama administration's campaign of U.S. [[drone strikes in Pakistan]], which he identified as the "most effective weapon" against senior al-Qaeda leadership.<ref>"CIA Pakistan Campaign Is Working, Director Says", Mark Mazzetti and Helene Cooper, ''New York Times'', February 26, 2009, A15</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gerstein |first=Josh |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/us_world/Panetta_warns_against_politicization.html?extpar=polit |title=CIA Director Panetta Warns Against Politicization |publisher=NBC New York |accessdate=August 21, 2010}}</ref> Drone strikes increased significantly under Panetta, with as many as 50 suspected al-Qaeda militants being killed in May 2009 alone.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/world/asia/17pstan.html | work=The New York Times | title=25 Militants Are Killed In Attack In Pakistan | date=May 17, 2009 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://securitydata.newamerica.net/drones/pakistan-analysis.html|publisher=New America Foundation|title=Drone Wars Pakistan: Analysis}}</ref>

=== Secretary of Defense (2011–2013) ===

====Nomination====
[[File:Leon Panetta swearing in ceremony.jpg|right|thumb|Panetta being sworn in as Secretary of Defense.]]
On April 28, 2011, President Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as [[United States Secretary of Defense]] as a replacement for retiring Secretary [[Robert Gates]]. On June 21, 2011, the Senate confirmed Panetta in an unusual 100–0 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/galleries/pdcl/index.htm |title=U.S. Senate Periodical Press Gallery |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=December 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126173242/https://www.senate.gov/galleries/pdcl/index.htm |archive-date=November 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> He was sworn in on July 1, 2011.

====Tenure====
One of Panetta's first major acts as Defense Secretary was to jointly certify with the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] that the military was prepared to repeal "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]," which triggered final repeal after 60 days.

In August 2011, Panetta publicly warned that deeper cuts in the defense budget risked hollowing out the military and would hamper Pentagon efforts to deal with rising powers such as [[China]], [[North Korea]], and [[Iran]] and he urged Congress not to go beyond the roughly $500 billion in defense cuts required over the next decade under the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|debt reduction bill]] signed by President [[Barack Obama]]. Working with military and civilian leaders at the Department of Defense, Panetta developed a new defense strategy for the 21st century.

Funding the United States military, in the face of tightening budget constraints, became an ongoing theme of Panetta's tenure. He also warned that future service members may see changes in retirement benefits, and that the military healthcare system may need reforms, to rein in costs, while also ensuring quality care.<ref>Pincus, Walter (October 10, 2011).

Another major issue during Panetta's tenure as Defense Secretary was the Obama administration's diplomatic effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In January 2012, Panetta stated that nuclear weapons development was a "red line" that Iran would not be allowed to cross—and that the United States was keeping all options, including military ones, open to completely prevent it. He said that Iran would not be allowed to block the Straits of Hormuz.

In January 2013, shortly before his departure from the Defense Secretary post, Panetta announced that women would be allowed to enter all combat jobs in the military, citing an assessment phase in which "each branch of service will examine all its jobs and units not currently integrated and then produce a timetable for integrating them".<ref name="security.blogs.cnn.com">[http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/23/military-to-open-combat-jobs-to-women/ "Military to open combat jobs to women"].

Panetta and his wife Sylvia founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy in December 1997 and served as co-directors there until 2009, when Panetta was appointed CIA director by President Obama. He has since returned to the Institute in the role of Chairman, while his wife serves as Co-Chair and CEO, supervising the Institute's day-to-day operations. The Institute is located at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]], a campus Panetta was instrumental in creating on the site of the decommissioned [[Fort Ord]] Army base when he was a Congressman. Coincidentally, Panetta was stationed at Fort Ord in the 1960s during his service as an Army intelligence officer.

In 2014, Panetta published his memoir ''Worthy Fights'', in which he recounted his long career in public service.
