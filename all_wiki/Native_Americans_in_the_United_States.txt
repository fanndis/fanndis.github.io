'''Native Americans''', also known as '''American Indians''', '''Indigenous Americans''' and [[#Terminology differences|other terms]], are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the United States, sometimes including [[Hawaii]] and [[territories of the United States]] and sometimes limited to the mainland. There are 574 federally recognized tribes living within the US, about half of which are associated with [[Indian reservation]]s. "Native Americans" (as defined by the [[United States Census]]) are Indigenous tribes that are originally from the continental United States, plus [[Alaska Natives]]. 

Indigenous peoples of the United States who are not American Indian or Alaska Native include [[Native Hawaiians]], [[Samoans]], or [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]]. The US Census groups these peoples as "[[Pacific Islander Americans|Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander]]."

The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via [[Beringia]].<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/jacques-cinq-mars-bluefish-caves-scientific-progress-180962410/]</ref> A vast variety of peoples, societies and cultures subsequently developed.

Since the 1960s, [[Native American self-determination]] movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans, though there are still many [[Contemporary Native American issues in the United States|contemporary issues faced by Native Americans]]. Today, there are over five million Native Americans in the United States, 78% of whom live outside reservations: [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Oklahoma]] have the largest population of Native Americans in the United States. Most Native Americans live in [[rural area]]s or small-town areas.

When the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from [[White American|white]] [[settlers]]. The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as "domestic dependent nations" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]]. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.

The [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the "Indians not taxed" category established by the [[United States Constitution]], allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] protections granted to people "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny [[Native American civil rights#Voting|Native Americans voting rights]] for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].

==Background==
Since the end of the 15th century, the [[migration of Europeans to the Americas]] has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies, a process known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. As most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by [[oral tradition]]s and artwork, the first written sources of the contact were written by Europeans.<ref name="test">Calloway, Colin G. [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/native-americans-first-view-whites-shore "Native Americans First View Whites from the Shore"]. ''American Heritage'', Spring 2009. Retrieved December 29, 2011</ref>

[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]]]]
[[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] commonly classify the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]] into ten geographical regions with shared [[cultural]] traits, called cultural areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=Culture Areas Index |website=the Canadian Museum of Civilization }}</ref> Some scholars combine the Plateau and Great Basin regions into the Intermontane West, some separate Prairie peoples from Great Plains peoples, while some separate Great Lakes tribes from the Northeastern Woodlands. The ten cultural areas are as follows:
* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]
* [[Alaska natives|Subarctic]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])

At the time of the first contact, the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the proto-industrial and mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] immigrants. Some Northeastern and Southwestern cultures, in particular, were [[matrilineal]] and operated on a more collective basis than that with which Europeans were familiar. The majority of indigenous American tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe. Europeans at that time had cultures that had developed concepts of individual [[property rights]] with respect to land that were extremely different. The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence, and social disruption.

Even before the European settlement of what is now the United States, Native Americans suffered high fatalities from [[Native American disease and epidemics|contact with new European diseases]], to which they had not yet acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; the diseases were endemic to the Spanish and other Europeans, and spread by direct contact and likely through pigs that escaped from expeditions.<ref name="mann"/> [[Smallpox epidemics in the Americas|Smallpox epidemics]] are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations. William M. Denevan, noted author and Professor Emeritus of Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said on this subject in his essay "The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492"; "The decline of native American populations was rapid and severe, probably the greatest demographic disaster ever. Old World diseases were the primary killer. In many regions, particularly the tropical lowlands, populations fell by 90 percent or more in the first century after the contact. "<ref name="denevan">[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/%7Ealcoze/for398/class/pristinemyth.html William M.

Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly, ranging from William M. Denevan's 3.8 million in his 1992 work ''The Native Population of the Americas in 1492'', to 18 million in Henry F. Dobyns' ''Their Number Become Thinned'' (1983).<ref name="mann">{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/03/1491/302445/ |first = Charles C. |last = Mann|title= 1491|website =The Atlantic|date = March 2002}}</ref><ref name="denevan"/><ref name="encbrit">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357826/Native-American/273135/North-America-and-Europe-circa-1492 |title=Native American |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/their-number-become-thinned-native-american-population-dynamics-in-eastern-north-america/oclc/9392931 Henry F Dobyns, ''Their Number Become Thinned: Native American Population Dynamics in Eastern North America'', University of Tennessee Press, 1983]</ref> Henry F. Dobyns' work, being the highest single point estimate by far within the realm of professional academic research on the topic, has been criticized for being "politically motivated".<ref name="mann"/> Perhaps Dobyns' most vehement critic is David Henige, a bibliographer of Africana at the University of Wisconsin, whose ''Numbers From Nowhere'' (1998)<ref>{{cite book |last = Henige|first = David|title = Numbers from Nowhere: The American Indian Contact Population Debate|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1MJ9HPsGsrUC|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|date = 1998|isbn = 9780806130446}}</ref> is described as "a landmark in the literature of demographic fulmination".<ref name="mann"/> "Suspect in 1966, it is no less suspect nowadays," Henige wrote of Dobyns's work.

</ref> or [[forced assimilation|forced]]) became a consistent policy through American administrations. During the 19th century, the ideology of [[manifest destiny]] became integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and rising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], accommodating European-American expansion. This resulted in the [[ethnic cleansing]] of many tribes, with the brutal, forced marches coming to be known as [[The Trail of Tears]].

Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with [[sovereignty]] and [[treaty rights]] upon which federal Indian law and a federal Indian trust relationship is based.<ref name="BIA">[https://www.bia.gov/frequently-asked-questions U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Affairs], Native American Faculty and Staff Association News.

The terms used to refer to Native Americans [[Native American name controversy|have at times been controversial]]. The ways Native Americans refer to themselves vary by region and generation, with many older Native Americans self-identifying as "Indians" or "American Indians", while younger Native Americans often identify as "Indigenous" or "Aboriginal". The term "Native American" has not traditionally included [[Native Hawaiians]] or certain [[Alaskan Natives]], such as [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]], or [[Inuit]] peoples.

[[File:Peopling of America through Beringia.png|thumb|upright=1.2|This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites ([[Clovis theory]]).]]
It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first settled the Americas and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from [[Eurasia]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas over subsequent generations. Genetic evidence suggests at least three waves of migrants arrived from Asia, with the first occurring at least 15,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Reich|first1= David|display-authors=etal|date= August 16, 2012 |title= Reconstructing Native American population history|journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 488|issue=7411 |pages= 370–374 |doi= 10.1038/nature11258|pmid= 22801491 |pmc= 3615710 |bibcode= 2012Natur.488..370R}}</ref> These migrations may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago<ref>{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> and continued to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the [[Past sea level|rising sea level]] at the onset of the current [[interglacial]] period.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David M.

===Pre-Columbian era===
{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}
The pre-Columbian era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the [[Americas|American]] continents, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to European colonization during the [[early modern period]]. While technically referring to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' 1492 arrival on the continent, in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades, or even centuries, after Columbus' initial landing.

Native American cultures are not normally included in characterizations of advanced Stone Age cultures as "[[Neolithic]]," which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions. The [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archaeological periods]] used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]]' 1958&nbsp;book ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology''. They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into [[Archaeology of the Americas#Periodization|five phases]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gordon R. Willey  |author2=Philip Phillips | title=Method and Theory in American Archaeology |url=https://archive.org/details/methodtheoryinam1958will  | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1957 | isbn=978-0-226-89888-9}}</ref>

====Lithic stage====
{{Main|Lithic stage}}
Numerous [[Paleoindian]] cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the [[Great Plains]] and [[Great Lakes]] of the modern United States and [[Canada]], as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]]. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Deloria, V., Jr., (1997) ''Red Earth White Lies: Native Americans and The Myth of Scientific Fact''.</ref> Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas.

Archeological evidence at the [[Gault (archaeological site)|Gault site]] near Austin, Texas, demonstrates that [[Clovis culture|pre-Clovis]] peoples settled in Texas some 16,000—20,000 years ago. Evidence of pre-Clovis cultures have also been found in the [[Paisley Caves]] in south-central Oregon and butchered [[Mastodon|mastodon bones]] in a [[sinkhole]] near Tallahassee, Florida. More convincingly but also controversially, another pre-Clovis has been discovered at [[Monte Verde]], Chile.<ref>{{cite web|website=Smithsonian Magazine.com|title=People Were Messing Around In Texas at Least 2,500 Years Earlier Than Previously Thought|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-were-texas-3000-years-earlier-previously-thought-180969743/|date=July 28, 2018|accessdate=July 28, 2018|author=Jason Daley}}</ref>

The [[Clovis culture]], a [[megafauna]] hunting culture, is primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|B.P.]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&nbsp;BCE).<ref name="RobinsonSellet2017">{{cite book|author1=Erick Robinson|author2=Frédéric Sellet|title=Lithic Technological Organization and Paleoenvironmental Change: Global and Diachronic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nO09DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA266|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-64407-3|page=266}}</ref>

[[File:Folsom point.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[Folsom point]] for a spear]]
The [[Folsom Tradition]] was characterized by the use of [[Folsom point]]s as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of [[bison]] took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000&nbsp;BCE and 8000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Hillerman, Anthony G. (1973).

Linguists, anthropologists, and archaeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené]]-speaking peoples were the earliest ancestors of the [[Athabascan]]-speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year-round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.<ref>Leer, Jeff, Doug Hitch, & John Ritter. 2001.

====Archaic period====
{{Main|Archaic period in the Americas}}
Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] sites in present-day Louisiana and [[Florida]] at which early cultures built complexes with multiple [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of [[Neolithic Revolution]] to sustain such large villages over long periods.

The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] were of many nations and tribal affiliations, each with distinctive cultural and political identities, but they shared certain beliefs, traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Their gift-giving feast, [[potlatch]], is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate special events. These events include the raising of a [[Totem pole]] or the appointment or election of a new chief. The most famous artistic feature of the culture is the Totem pole, with carvings of animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs, legends, and notable events.

In 1634, [[Andrew White (missionary)|Fr.

Maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to St. Omer who yielded in abilities to few Europeans, when competing for the honor of being first in their class.

Through the mid-17th century the [[Beaver Wars]] were fought over the fur trade between the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Wyandot people|Hurons]], the northern [[Algonquin people|Algonquians]], and their French allies. During the war the Iroquois destroyed several large tribal confederacies, including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erielhonan|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]], and [[Shawnee]], and became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory.

In 1727, [[Ursulines|the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula]] founded [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy in New Orleans]], which is currently the oldest continuously operating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States. From the time of its foundation, it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[freedmen|free women of color]].

Between 1754 and 1763, many Native American tribes were involved in the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]]. Those involved in the [[fur trade]] tended to [[Franco-Indian alliance|ally with French]] forces against British colonial militias. The British had made fewer allies, but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories. They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned. The tribes had their own purposes, using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies. Some [[Iroquois]] who were loyal to the British, and helped them fight in the [[American Revolution]], fled north into Canada.

After European explorers reached the West Coast in the 1770s, smallpox rapidly killed at least 30% of [[West Coast of the United States|Northwest Coast]] Native Americans.

During the [[American Revolution]], the newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for the allegiance of Native American nations east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British, based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land. The first native community to [[Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778)|sign a treaty with the new United States Government]] was the [[Lenape]].

In 1779 the [[Sullivan Expedition]] was carried out during the American Revolutionary War against the British and the four allied nations of the Iroquois. [[George Washington]] gave orders that made it clear he wanted the [[Iroquois]] threat completely eliminated:

{{quote|The Expedition you are appointed to command is to be directed against the hostile tribes of the Six Nations of Indians, with their associates and adherents. The immediate objects are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements, and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible. It will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Washington|first1=George|title=From George Washington to Major General John Sullivan, 31 May 1779|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-20-02-0661|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|Founders Online, National Archives]]|date=May 31, 1779}}</ref>}}

The British made peace with the Americans in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], through which they ceded vast Native American territories to the United States without informing or consulting with the Native Americans.

====United States====
The United States was eager to expand, develop farming and settlements in new areas, and satisfy land hunger of settlers from New England and new immigrants. The national government initially sought to purchase Native American land by [[Treaties of the United States#U.S. Native American treaties|treaties]]. The states and settlers were frequently at odds with this policy.<ref>[http://www.americanrevolution.org/ind1.html Wilcomb E. Washburn, "Indians and the American Revolution"], AmericanRevolution.org, History Channel Network. Retrieved February 23, 2006.</ref>

United States policy toward Native Americans continued to evolve after the American Revolution. [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] believed that Native Americans were equals but that their society was inferior. Washington formulated a policy to encourage the "civilizing" process.<ref name="remini_reform_begins" /> Washington had a six-point plan for civilization which included:

# impartial justice toward Native Americans
# regulated buying of Native American lands
# promotion of commerce
# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society
# presidential authority to give presents
# punishing those who violated Native American rights.<ref name="eric_miller"/>

In the late 18th century, reformers, starting with Washington and Knox,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Confusion in Indian Affairs: Native Americans and Whites in the Progressive Era |first=Tom |last=Holm |url= http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exholgre.html|publisher=Utexas.edu }}</ref> supported educating native both children and adults, in efforts to "civilize" or otherwise assimilate Native Americans into the larger society (as opposed to relegating them to [[Native American reservation|reservations]]). The [[Civilization Fund Act]] of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies (mostly religious) who worked towards Native American improvement.<ref name="Jefferson_treaty_CCC">

The population of California Indians was reduced by 90% during the 19th century—from more than 200,000 in the early 19th century to approximately 15,000 at the end of the century, mostly due to disease.<ref>Pritzker, Barry M. (2000) ''A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press{{ISBN|978-0-19-513877-1}}</ref> [[Epidemics]] swept through California [[Indian Country]], such as the 1833 [[malaria]] epidemic.<ref>Pritzker, p.114</ref> The population went into decline as a result of the Spanish authorities forcing Native Californians to live in the missions where they contracted diseases from which they had little immunity. Dr. Cook estimates that 15,250 or 45% of the population decrease in the Missions was caused by disease. Two epidemics of measles, one in 1806 and the other in 1828, caused many deaths. The mortality rates were so high that the missions were constantly dependent upon new conversions. During the [[California Gold Rush]], many natives were [[California Gold Rush#Impact on Native Americans|killed]] by incoming settlers as well as by militia units financed and organized by the California government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=The California Militia and "Expeditions Against the Indians", 1850 – 1859|website=militarymuseum.org|last = Johnston-Dodds|first = Kimberly|date = September 2002}}</ref> Some scholars contend that the state financing of these militias, as well as the US government's role in other massacres in California, such as the [[Bloody Island Massacre|Bloody Island]] and [[Yontoket Massacre]]s, in which up to 400 or more natives were killed in each massacre, constitutes a campaign of [[genocide]] against the [[Indigenous peoples of California|native people of California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|editor1=Joel R.

====Westward expansion====

As American expansion continued, Native Americans resisted settlers' encroachment in several regions of the new nation (and in unorganized territories), from the Northwest to the Southeast, and then in the West, as settlers encountered the [[Plains Indians|Native American tribes]] of the [[Great Plains]]. East of the Mississippi River, an intertribal army led by [[Tecumseh]], a Shawnee chief, fought a number of engagements in the Northwest during the period 1811–12, known as [[Tecumseh's War]]. During the [[War of 1812]], Tecumseh's forces allied themselves with the British. After Tecumseh's death, the British ceased to aid the Native Americans south and west of Upper Canada and American expansion proceeded with little resistance. Conflicts in the Southeast include the [[Creek War]] and [[Seminole Wars]], both before and after the [[Indian Removal]]s of most members of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].

In the 1830s, President Andrew Jackson signed the [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]], a policy of relocating Indians from their homelands to [[Indian Territory]] and reservations in surrounding areas to open their lands for non-native settlements.<ref>The "Indian Homestead Act" of 1871 or the Dawes Act stated:

<blockquote>PROVIDED, That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.</ref></blockquote> This resulted in the [[Trail of Tears]].

The [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1851 set the precedent for modern-day Native American reservations through allocating funds to move western tribes onto reservations since there were no more lands available for relocation.

Native American nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the U.S. throughout the 19th century, through what were called generally [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]].<ref>Thornton, Russell (1990).

Expressing the frontier anti-Indian sentiment, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed the Indians were destined to vanish under the pressure of white civilization, stating in an 1886 lecture:

A [[Ghost Dance]] ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, [[South Dakota]], led to the U.S. Army's attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religious movement founded by the [[Northern Paiute]] spiritual leader [[Wovoka]] that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the [[European Americans|European American]] colonists would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]<nowiki/>ic world.<ref name="Wounded Knee"/> On December 29 at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women, and children.<ref name="Wounded Knee">{{cite web|title=Plains Humanities: Wounded Knee Massacre|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}</ref>

====Removals and reservations====
{{main|Cultural assimilation of Native Americans}}
{{Further|Indian colony|List of Indian reservations in the United States}}
{{Further|Native American reservation politics}}

In the 19th century, the incessant [[Manifest destiny|westward expansion of the United States]] incrementally compelled large numbers of Native Americans to resettle further west, often by force, almost always reluctantly. Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Treaty of Hopewell]] of 1785. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river.

As many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties. The most egregious violation, the [[Trail of Tears]], was the removal of the Cherokee by [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]] to [[Indian Territory]].<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976). ''Cherokee Sunset: A Nation Betrayed : A Narrative of Travail and Triumph, Persecution and Exile''. New York: Doubleday, p. 232.</ref> The 1864 deportation of the [[Navajos]] by the U.S. government occurred when 8,000 Navajos were forced to an internment camp in Bosque Redondo,<ref name="Jaimes"/> where, under armed guards, more than 3,500 Navajo and Mescalero Apache men, women, and children died from starvation and disease.<ref name="Jaimes">M. Annette Jaimes (1992). ''The State of Native America: Genocide, Colonization, and Resistance''. p. 34. South End Press</ref>

====Native Americans and U.S. Citizenship====
In 1817, the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S. citizens. Under Article 8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, "Upwards of 300 Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made an election to become American citizens".<ref name="us_citizenship"/><ref name="McLoughlin">

Factors establishing citizenship included:

# Issuance of Patent in [[Fee simple]]
# Adopting Habits of Civilized Life
# Minor Children

====Education====
{{main|Indian boarding schools}}
After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the government established [[Native American boarding schools]], initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?AuthorID=2616&id=7375 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718191243/http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?AuthorID=2616&id=7375 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2012 |website=authorsden.com |title=What Were Boarding Schools Like for Indian Youth? |accessdate=February 8, 2006 }}</ref> At this time, American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The boarding school experience was a total immersion in modern American society, but it could prove traumatic to children, who were forbidden to speak their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Greenland, Canada & USA|native languages]]. They were taught [[Christianity]] and not allowed to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/static/archive/news/projects/native/day2_main.html

Before the 1930s, schools on the reservations provided no schooling beyond the sixth grade. To obtain more, boarding school was usually necessary.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael C. Coleman|title=American Indian Children at School, 1850–1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmGVHh_0WaUC&pg=PR9|year=2007|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|page=9|isbn=9781604730098}}</ref> Small reservations with a few hundred people usually sent their children to nearby public schools. The "[[Indian New Deal]]" of the 1930s closed many of the [[boarding schools]], and downplayed the [[assimilationist]] goals. The Indian Division of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] operated large-scale construction projects on the reservations, building thousands of new schools and community buildings. Under the leadership of [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]] the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The BIA by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The [[Navajo]] largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system. There were now high schools on larger reservations, educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience. There were no Indian facilities for higher education.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 997329|title = Uncle Sam Develops a New Kind of Rural School|journal = The Elementary School Journal|volume = 41|issue = 3|pages = 185–194|last1 = Beatty|first1 = Willard W.|year = 1940|doi = 10.1086/457876|s2cid = 143951626}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2291885|title = The Federal Government and the Education of Indians and Eskimos|journal = The Journal of Negro Education|volume = 7|issue = 3|pages = 267–272|last1 = Beatty|first1 = Willard W.|year = 1938|doi = 10.2307/2291885}}</ref> They deemphasized textbooks, emphasized self-esteem, and started teaching [[History of Native Americans in the United States|Indian history]]. They promoted traditional arts and crafts of the sort that could be conducted on the reservations, such as making jewelry. The New Deal reformers met significant resistance from parents and teachers, and had mixed results. [[World War II]] brought younger Indians in contact with the broader society through [[military service]] and work in the munitions industries. The role of schooling was changed to focus on [[vocational education]] for jobs in urban America.<ref>Margaret Szasz, ''Education and the American Indian: The Road to Self-Determination, 1928–1973'' (1979)</ref>

Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many [[state recognized tribes in the United States|federally recognized tribes]] have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded [[Tribal colleges and universities|colleges]] at their reservations, controlled, and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.

In 1919, the United States under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] granted citizenship to all Native Americans who had served in World War I. Nearly 10,000 men had enlisted and served, a high number in relation to their population.<ref name="coolidge"/> Despite this, in many areas Native Americans faced local resistance when they tried to vote and were discriminated against with barriers to voter registration.

On June 2, 1924, U.S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924|Indian Citizenship Act]], which made all Native Americans born in the United States and its territories American citizens.

After serving as a United States Representative and being repeatedly re-elected as United States Senator from Kansas, Curtis served as [[Senate Minority Whip]] for 10 years and as [[Senate Majority Leader]] for five years. He was very influential in the Senate. In 1928 he ran as the vice-presidential candidate with [[Herbert Hoover]] for president, and served from 1929 to 1933. He was the first person with significant Native American ancestry and the first person with acknowledged non-European ancestry to be elected to either of the highest offices in the land.

American Indians today in the United States have all the rights guaranteed in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], can vote in elections, and run for political office. Controversies remain over how much the federal government has jurisdiction over tribal affairs, sovereignty, and cultural practices.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Deloria |first=Vincent |title=American Indian policy in the 20th century |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1992 |page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzWIpZBZgA0C |isbn=978-0-8061-2424-7}}</ref>

Mid-century, the [[Indian termination policy]] and the [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956]] marked a new direction for assimilating Native Americans into [[Urban Indians|urban life]].<ref>Rebecca L.

The census counted 332,000 Indians in 1930 and 334,000 in 1940, including those on and off reservations in the 48 states. Total spending on Indians averaged $38 million a year in the late 1920s, dropping to a low of $23 million in 1933, and returning to $38 million in 1940.<ref name="Census, 1951 pp 14, 306">US Bureau of the Census, ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1951'' (1951) pp 14, 306 [https://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1951-02.pdf]</ref>

</ref> Described as the first large-scale exodus of indigenous peoples from the [[Indian reservation|reservations]] since the removals of the 19th century, the men's service with the U.S. military in the international conflict was a turning point in Native American history. The overwhelming majority of Native Americans welcomed the opportunity to serve; they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40% higher than those drafted.<ref>

Their fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem, in part since the legend of the tough Native American warrior had become a part of the fabric of American historical legend. White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them "chief". The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. "The war", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, "caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity—as a result of wartime labor shortages—to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.

There were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition, many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.

====Self-determination====
{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}

Military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969–1971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.

Through the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27, 1973.<ref name="Waldron">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=August 22, 2010|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>

Indian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April, a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name="Waldron"/>

In June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist [[Leonard Peltier]] was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison for the FBI deaths.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crosson |first=Judith |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/05/appeals_court_denies_peltiers_parole_bid/ |title=Appeals court denies Peltier's parole bid |publisher=Boston.com |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref>

In 1968, the government enacted the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|Indian Civil Rights Act]]. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975, the U.S. government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians; however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December 2004)</ref>

====Tribal colleges====
{{main|Tribal colleges and universities}}

[[File:Navajo Cowboy-1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Navajo people|Navajo]] man on horseback in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]], United States]]
Navajo Community College, now called [[Diné College]], the first tribal college, was founded in Tsaile, Arizona, in 1968 and accredited in 1979. Tensions immediately arose between two philosophies: one that the tribal colleges should have the same criteria, curriculum and procedures for educational quality as mainstream colleges, the other that the faculty and curriculum should be closely adapted to the particular historical culture of the tribe. There was a great deal of turnover, exacerbated by very tight budgets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = T. | last2 = Thaxton | first2 = Lourene | year = 2007 | title = Robert A.

Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.

In addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians.

===21st century===
[[File:Byron Mallott inaugural speech.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byron Mallott]], an [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]], was the former [[Democratic party (U.S.)|Democratic]] lieutenant governor of [[Alaska]].]]
In 2009, an "apology to Native Peoples of the United States" was included in the Defense Appropriations Act. It stated that the U.S. "apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by citizens of the United States".<ref>{{cite web|last=McKinnon |first=John D. |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/12/22/us-offers-an-official-apology-to-native-americans/ |title=U.S. Offers An Official Apology to Native Americans |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301204513/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/12/22/us-offers-an-official-apology-to-native-americans/ |archivedate=March 1, 2012 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>

In 2013, jurisdiction over persons who were not tribal members under the [[Violence Against Women Act#Reauthorization|Violence Against Women Act]] was extended to Indian Country. This closed a gap which prevented arrest or prosecution by tribal police or courts of abusive partners of tribal members who were not native or from another tribe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress sends Violence Against Women Act to Obama|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 28, 2013|first1=Catalina|last1=Camia|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=VAWA victory shows that House GOP needs Democrats|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

Migration to urban areas continued to grow with 70% of Native Americans living in urban areas in 2012, up from 45% in 1970 and 8% in 1940. Urban areas with significant Native American populations include Minneapolis, Denver, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Tucson, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston, New York City, Los Angeles, and Rapid City. Many lived in poverty. Racism, unemployment, drugs and gangs were common problems which Indian social service organizations such as the [[Little Earth]] housing complex in Minneapolis attempted to address.<ref name=NYT41413 /> Grassroots efforts to support urban Indigenous populations have also taken place, as in the case of [[Bringing the Circle Together]] in Los Angeles.

==Demographics==
{{Further|Modern social statistics of Native Americans}}
{{See also|Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

The 2010 Census showed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2010, was 308.7 million.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN" /> Out of the total U.S. population, 2.9 million people, or 0.9 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native alone. In addition, 2.3 million people or another 0.7 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 5.2 million people. Thus, 1.7 percent of all people in the United States identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with one or more other races.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN" />

The definition of American Indian or Alaska Native used in the 2010 census:

<blockquote>According to Office of Management and Budget, "American Indian or Alaska Native" refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN">{{cite web|title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census|accessdate=2010-06-02|first1==Tina |last1=Norris |first2=Paula L. |last2=Vines |first3=Elizabeth M. |last3=Hoeffel|date=January 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

The 2010 census permitted respondents to self-identify as being of one or more races. Self-identification dates from the census of 1960; prior to that the race of the respondent was determined by opinion of the census taker. The option to select more than one race was introduced in 2000.<ref name="Newest Indians">{{cite news|title=The Newest Indians|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F17FD3A580C728EDDA10894DD404482|accessdate=June 2, 2012|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=August 21, 2005|author=Jack Hitt}}</ref> If American Indian or Alaska Native was selected, the form requested the individual provide the name of the "enrolled or principal tribe".

===Population since 1890===
The census counted 248,000 Native Americans in 1890, 332,000 in 1930 and 334,000 in 1940, including those on and off reservations in the 48 states. Total spending on Native Americans averaged $38 million a year in the late 1920s, dropping to a low of $23 million in 1933, and returning to $38 million in 1940.<ref name="Census, 1951 pp 14, 306"/>

===Population distribution===
[[File:Americanindiansmapcensusbureau.gif|thumb|upright=1.85|This Census Bureau map depicts the locations of differing Native American groups, including [[Indian reservations]], as of 2000. Note the concentration (blue) in modern-day [[Oklahoma]] in the South West, which was once designated as an [[Indian Territory]] before statehood in 1907.]]
78% of Native Americans live outside a reservation. Full-blood individuals are more likely to live on a reservation than mixed-blood individuals. The [[Navajo people|Navajo]], with 286,000 full-blood individuals, is the largest tribe if only full-blood individuals are counted; the Navajo are the tribe with the highest proportion of full-blood individuals, 86.3%. The [[Cherokee]] have a different history; it is the largest tribe with 819,000 individuals, and it has 284,000 full-blood individuals.<ref name=Navajo2010>{{cite news|title=Census: Native count jumps by 27 percent|url=http://navajotimes.com/news/2012/0112/012612census.php|accessdate=June 2, 2012|work=The Navajo Times|date=Jan 26, 2012|author=Cindy Yurth|agency=Tsé;yi' Bureau}}</ref>

====Urban migration====
As of 2012, 70% of Native Americans live in urban areas, up from 45% in 1970 and 8% in 1940. Urban areas with significant Native American populations include Minneapolis, Denver, Phoenix, Tucson, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston, New York City, and Los Angeles. Many live in poverty. Racism, unemployment, drugs and gangs are common problems which Indian social service organizations such as the Little Earth housing complex in Minneapolis attempt to address.<ref name=NYT41413>{{cite news|title=Quietly, Indians Reshape Cities and Reservations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/as-american-indians-move-to-cities-old-and-new-challenges-follow.html|accessdate=April 14, 2013|work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 2013|author=Timothy Williams}}</ref>

====Distribution by U.S. state====
According to 2003 [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates, a little over one-third of the 2,786,652 Native Americans in the United States live in three states: [[California]] (413,382), [[Arizona]] (294,137) and [[Oklahoma]] (279,559).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/tables/SC-EST2003-04.pdf |website=US Census.gov |title=Annual Estimates by Race Alone |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216013705/http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/tables/SC-EST2003-04.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2006 |df= }}</ref>

In 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that about 0.8% of the U.S. population was of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] or [[Alaska Native]] descent. This population is unevenly distributed across the country.<ref name="census1">{{cite web |author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GRTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-_box_head_nbr=R0203&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-format=US-30 |title=US census |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213084757/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GRTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-_box_head_nbr=R0203&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-format=US-30 |archive-date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Below, all fifty states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, are listed by the proportion of residents citing American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry, based on the [[2010 U.S. Census]].<ref>{{cite web

==Tribal sovereignty==

[[File:Indian reservations in the Continental United States.png|thumb|upright=1.85|Indian reservations in the continental United States]]
There are 573 [[List of Native American Tribal Entities|federally recognized tribal governments]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Register|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-01-29/pdf/2016-01769.pdf|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}</ref> in the United States. These tribes possess the right to form their own governments, to enforce laws (both civil and criminal) within their lands, to tax, to establish requirements for membership, to license and regulate activities, to zone, and to exclude persons from tribal territories. Limitations on tribal powers of self-government include the same limitations applicable to states; for example, neither tribes nor states have the power to make war, engage in foreign relations, or coin money (this includes paper currency).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html |website=america.gov |title=The U.S. Relationship To American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519065837/https://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html |archivedate=May 19, 2009 |df= }}</ref>

Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights point out that the U.S. federal government's claim to recognize the "sovereignty" of Native American peoples falls short, given that the United States wishes to govern Native American peoples and treat them as subject to U.S. law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html|title=Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law|last=Robertson|first=Lindsay|date=June 2001|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Such advocates contend that full respect for Native American sovereignty would require the U.S. government to deal with Native American peoples in the same manner as any other sovereign nation, handling matters related to relations with Native Americans through the Secretary of State, rather than the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. The Bureau of Indian Affairs reports on its website that its "responsibility is the administration and management of {{convert|55700000|acre|km2}} of land held in trust by the United States for American Indians, Indian tribes, and [[Alaska Natives]]".<ref>{{Cite journal

{{As of|2000}}, the largest groups in the United States by population were [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Sioux]], [[Chippewa]], [[Apache]], [[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]]. In 2000, eight of ten Americans with Native American ancestry were of mixed ancestry. It is estimated that by 2100 that figure will rise to nine out of ten.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Columbia Law Review |title=Mixing Bodies and Beliefs: The Predicament of Tribes |last = Gould|first = L.

In addition, there are a number of tribes that are [[List of State Recognized American Indian Tribal Entities|recognized by individual states]], but not by the federal government. The rights and benefits associated with [[diplomatic recognition|state recognition]] vary from state to state.

Some tribal groups have been unable to document the cultural continuity required for federal recognition. The [[Ohlone|Muwekma Ohlone]] of the San Francisco bay area are pursuing litigation in the federal court system to establish recognition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muwekma.org |title=The Muwekman Ohlone |accessdate=June 22, 2007 |website=muwekma.org}}</ref> Many of the smaller eastern tribes, long considered remnants of extinct peoples, have been trying to gain official recognition of their tribal status. Several tribes in Virginia and North Carolina have gained state recognition. Federal recognition confers some benefits, including the right to label arts and crafts as Native American and permission to apply for grants that are specifically reserved for Native Americans. But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult; to be established as a tribal group, members have to submit extensive [[genealogy|genealogical]] proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture.

In the state of [[Virginia]], Native Americans face a unique problem. Until 2017 Virginia previously had no federally recognized tribes but the state had recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.

Some historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912–1946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: "white" and "colored".

Plecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been "mongrelized" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to "[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as "colored", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as "white" or "colored". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name="home.hamptonroads.com">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |website=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103123937/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> In 2009, the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title = Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20091026175747/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146/ |archive-date = October 26, 2009|date = October 23, 2009 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch}}</ref>

To achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900. The federal government has maintained this requirement, in part because through participation on councils and committees, federally recognized tribes have been adamant about groups' satisfying the same requirements as they did.<ref name="home.hamptonroads.com"/>

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] was a very significant moment for the rights of Native Americans and other people of color. Native Americans faced racism and prejudice for hundreds of years, and this increased after the [[American Civil War]]. Native Americans, like African Americans, were subjected to the [[Jim Crow Laws]] and segregation in the [[Deep South]] especially after they were made citizens through the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924. As a body of law, Jim Crow institutionalized economic, educational, and social disadvantages for Native Americans, and other people of color living in the south.<ref name="tperd">{{cite web |last1=Perdue |first1=Theda |title=Legacy of Jim Crow for Southern Native Americans |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?302379-1/legacy-jim-crow-southern-native-americans |website=C-SPAN |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name="jimlu">{{cite book |last1=Lowery |first1=Malinda Maynor |title=Lumbee Indians in the Jim Crow South: Race, Identity, and the Making of a Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLY3XbAqDUwC|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |accessdate=27 November 2018 |pages=0–339 |date=January 1, 2010|isbn=9780807833681 }}</ref><ref name="jewolf">{{cite journal |last1=Wolfley |first1=Jeanette |title=Jim Crow, Indian Style: The Disenfranchisement of Native Americans |journal=Indian Law Review |date=1990 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=167–202 |url=http://health-equity.lib.umd.edu/567/1/JimCrowAIStyle.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |doi=10.2307/20068694 |jstor=20068694 |hdl=1903/22633 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412011616/http://health-equity.lib.umd.edu/567/1/JimCrowAIStyle.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Native American identity was especially targeted by a system that only wanted to recognize white or colored, and the government began to question the legitimacy of some tribes because they had intermarried with African Americans.<ref name="tperd"/><ref name="jimlu"/> Native Americans were also discriminated and discouraged from voting in the southern and western states.<ref name="jewolf"/>

===Native American mascots in sports===

American Indian activists in the United States and Canada have criticized the use of Native American [[mascot]]s in sports, as perpetuating stereotypes. This is considered [[cultural appropriation]].
There has been a steady decline in the number of secondary school and college teams using such names, images, and mascots. Some tribal team names have been approved by the tribe in question, such as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]]'s approving use of their name for the teams of [[Florida State University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsu.com/pages/2005/06/17/historic_vote.html|title=Florida State University thanks Seminoles for historic vote of support |publisher=Florida State University |accessdate=August 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608224336/http://www.fsu.com/pages/2005/06/17/historic_vote.html |archivedate = June 8, 2007}}</ref><ref name="teachingTolerance">{{cite web

===Historical depictions in art===
[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|thumb|''[[Secotan]] Indians' dance in North Carolina''. Watercolor by John White, 1585]]
Native Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different periods. A number of 19th- and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].

In the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965–67). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949–57) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.

For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959–1973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949–1957), ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955–1963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959–1963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the "sympathetic" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>
Like the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages. In 1996, [[Plains Cree]] actor [[Michael Greyeyes]] would play renowned Native American warrior [[Crazy Horse]] in the 1996 television film ''[[Crazy Horse (film)|Crazy Horse]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1996-07-07-9607050218-story.html|title=TNT'S 'CRAZY HORSE' IS A DUD OF A TRIBUTE|last=Critic|first=Hal Boedeker, Sentinel Television|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|language=en-US|date=07-07-1996|access-date=2020-11-30}}</ref>

In 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, presented a five-episode series "from a Native American perspective". It represented "an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project".<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the "Native American confederacy" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the U.S.-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.

===Terminology differences===
{{further|Native American name controversy}}

====Common usage in the United States====
The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the United States in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]]. In 1995, a plurality of indigenous Americans, however, preferred the term ''American Indian''<ref name="Census">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |website=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> and many [[List of federally recognized tribes|tribes]] include the word Indian in their formal title.

Criticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], a Native American activist, opposed the term ''Native American'' because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of natives. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with India but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''en Dios'' meaning "in God"<ref>Russell Means: "I am an American Indian, not a native American!" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to "En Diós" and only those non-working links to text.</ref>{{verify source|date=June 2018}} (and a near-[[homophone]] of the Spanish word for "Indians", ''indios'').

A 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name="Census" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |website=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|the Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

===Gambling industry===
[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]
{{Main|Native American gaming}}
[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry. [[Casino]]s operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to leverage to build diversified economies.<ref name="Joseph Eve">{{cite journal|author=Joseph Eve, CPAs|title=The Cost of doing Business|year=2012|origyear=2010}}</ref>{{clarify|The statement "influx of money" is not directly supported by the net percentage. A casino could have a small gross income and high "net percentage". Dollar figures are necessary or simply remove "influx of money" and say that the casinos are "highly profitable" which is supported by the net profit statement|date=September 2012}} Although many Native American tribes have casinos, the [[impact of Native American gaming]] is widely debated. Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.

===Financial services===
Numerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the [[Otoe-Missouria]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], and the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux]]. Because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch, many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help them launch these businesses and manage the regulatory issues involved.
Similar to the tribal sovereignty debates that occurred when tribes first entered the gaming industry, the tribes, states, and federal government are currently in disagreement regarding who possesses the authority to regulate these e-commerce business entities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce|ssrn=2740181|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law|date=March 2016|last1=Claw|first1=Carma|last2=Spilde|first2=Katherine A.|author2-link=Katherine Spilde|last3=Clarkson|first3=Esq}}</ref>

=== Barriers to economic development ===
Today, other than tribes successfully running casinos, many tribes struggle, as they are often located on reservations isolated from the main economic centers of the country. The estimated 2.1 million Native Americans are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups. According to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], an estimated 400,000 Native Americans reside on reservation land. While some tribes have had success with gaming, only 40% of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate [[casino]]s.<ref name="NIGA">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/index.shtml |title=NIGA: Indian Gaming Facts |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302072505/http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/index.shtml |archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}</ref> According to a 2007 survey by the [[U.S. Small Business Administration]], only 1% of Native Americans own and operate a business.<ref name="SBA">{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/December/20071221175918ABretnuH0.3369257.html|title=Number of U.S. Minority Owned Businesses Increasing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020065312/http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/December/20071221175918ABretnuH0.3369257.html|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=}}</ref>

* Lack of access to capital
* Lack of human capital (education, skills, technical expertise) and the means to develop it
* Reservations lack effective planning
* Reservations are poor in natural resources
* Reservations have natural resources, but lack sufficient control over them
* Reservations are disadvantaged by their distance from markets and the high costs of transportation[[File:(Teacher with picture cards giving English instruction to Navajo day school students.) - NARA - 295158.tif|thumb|Teacher with picture cards giving English instruction to Navajo day school students]]
* Tribes cannot persuade investors to locate on reservations because of intense competition from non-Native American communities
* The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] is inept, corrupt or uninterested in reservation development
* Tribal politicians and bureaucrats are inept or corrupt
* On-reservation factionalism destroys stability in tribal decisions
* The instability of tribal government keeps outsiders from investing. The lack of international recognition Native American tribal sovereignty weakens their political-economic legitimacy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Diane|last2=Stubben|first2=Jerry|date=Winter 1998|title=An Assessment of Native American Economic Development: Putting Culture and Sovereignty back in the Models|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=32|issue=4|pages=52–78|doi=10.1007/BF02712505|s2cid=154496567}}</ref> (Many tribes adopted constitutions by the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]] model, with two-year terms for elected positions of chief and council members deemed too short by the authors for getting things done)
* Entrepreneurial skills and experience are scarce

A major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within [[Indian reservations]]. "A general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs", was the report on Native American [[entrepreneurship]] by the [[Northwest Area Foundation]] in 2004. "Native American communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive. Consequently, experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curriculum and after-school and other community activities. This would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life".<ref name="CFED">{{cite web |url=http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/cr.php?id=4&sel=5 |title=Native Entrepreneurship: Challenges and opportunities for rural communities&nbsp;— CFED, Northwest Area Foundation December 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222151900/http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/cr.php?id=4&sel=5 |archivedate=February 22, 2013 |df= }}</ref> ''[[Rez Biz]]'' magazine addresses these issues.

=== Discourse in Native American economic development ===
Some scholars argue that the existing theories and practices of [[economic development]] are not suitable for Native American communities—given the lifestyle, economic, and cultural differences, as well as the unique history of Native American-U.S. relations.<ref name=":1" /> Little economic development research has been conducted on Native American communities. The federal government fails to consider place-based issues of American Indian poverty by generalizing the demographic.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Mathers|first=Rachel L.|date=Summer 2012|title=The Failure of State-Led Economic Development on American Indian Reservations|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&sid=30a796d5-31a2-41aa-be49-1cfaccb9901d%40sessionmgr4010&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=bth&AN=76505429|journal=Independent Review|volume=17|pages=65–80|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> In addition, the concept of economic development threatens to upend the multidimensionality of Native American culture.<ref name=":1" /> The dominance of federal government involvement in indigenous developmental activities perpetuates and exacerbates the [http://www.panya.ca/publication_salvage_paradigm_introduction.php salvage paradigm].<ref name=":1" />

=== Landownership challenges ===
Native land that is owned by individual Native Americans sometimes cannot be developed because of fractionalization. Fractionalization occurs when a landowner dies, and their land is inherited by their children, but not subdivided. This means that one parcel might be owned by 50 different individuals. A majority of those holding interest must agree to any proposal to develop the land, and establishing this consent is time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes impossible.
Another landownership issue on reservations is checkerboarding, where Tribal land is interspersed with land owned by the federal government on behalf of Natives, individually owned plots, and land owned by non-Native individuals. This prevents Tribal governments from securing plots of land large enough for economic development or agricultural uses.<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/Community-Investments-Fall-2013-Native-Communities.pdf</ref>
Because reservation land is owned “in trust” by the federal government, individuals living on reservations cannot build equity in their homes. This bars Native Americans from getting loans, as there is nothing that a bank can collect if the loan is not paid. Past efforts to encourage landownership (such as the Dawes Act) resulted in a net loss of Tribal land. After they were familiarized with their [[Smallholding|smallholder status]], Native American landowners were lifted of trust restrictions and their land would get transferred back to them, contingent on a transactional fee to the federal government. The transfer fee discouraged Native American land ownership, with 65% of tribal owned land being sold to non-Native Americans by the 1920s.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Van Winkle|first=Tony N.|date=Fall 2018|title=American Indian Landowners, Leasemen, and Bureaucrats: Property, Paper, and the Poli-Technics of Dispossession in Southwestern Oklahoma|url=|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=42|issue=4|pages=508–533|doi=10.5250/amerindiquar.42.4.0508|s2cid=166125100}}</ref> Activists against property rights point to historical evidence of communal ownership of land and resources by tribes.

=== Land ownership and bureaucratic challenges in historical context ===
State-level efforts such as the [[Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act]] were attempts to contain tribal land in Native American hands. However, more bureaucratic decisions only expanded the size of the bureaucracy. The knowledge disconnect between the decision-making bureaucracy and Native American stakeholders resulted in ineffective development efforts.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

Traditional Native American entrepreneurship does not prioritize [[profit maximization]], rather, business transactions must have align with their social and cultural values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Colbourne|first=Rick|date=April 2017|title=An Understanding of Native American Entrepreneurship|journal=Small Enterprise Research|volume=24|pages=49–61|doi=10.1080/13215906.2017.1289856|s2cid=157839233}}</ref> In response to indigenous business philosophy, the federal government created policies that aimed to formalize their business practices, which undermined the Native American status quo.<ref name=":3" /> Additionally, legal disputes interfered with tribal land leasing, which were settled with the verdict against [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crepelle|first=Adam|date=2018|title=Tribal Lending and Tribal Sovereignty|url=https://lawreviewdrake.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/crepelle-final.pdf|journal=Drake Law Review|volume=66|pages=|via=}}</ref>

Often, bureaucratic overseers of development are far removed from Native American communities, and lack the knowledge and understanding to develop plans or make resource allocation decisions.<ref name=":2" /> The top-down heavy involvement in developmental operations corrupts bureaucrats into further self-serving agenda. Such incidences include fabricated reports that exaggerate results.<ref name=":2" />

=== Geographic poverty ===
While Native American urban poverty is attributed to hiring and workplace discrimination in a heterogeneous setting,<ref name=":0" /> reservation and trust land poverty rates are endogenous to deserted opportunities in isolated regions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitney Mauer|first=K.|date=September 2017|title=Indian Country Poverty: Place-Based Poverty on American Indian Territories, 2006–10.|journal=Rural Sociology|volume=82|issue=3|pages=473–498|doi=10.1111/ruso.12130}}</ref>

==Society, language, and culture==
{{Main|Native American cultures of the United States}}
[[File:Warm Springs.jpg|thumb|Three Native American women in Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Wasco County, Oregon. (1902)]]
The culture of Pre-Columbian North America is usually defined by the concept of the culture area, namely a geographical region where shared cultural traits occur. The northwest culture area, for example shared common traits such as salmon fishing, woodworking, and large villages or towns and a hierarchical social structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Native-American|title=Native American – History, Art, Culture, & Facts}}</ref>

Though cultural features, language, clothing, and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another, there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes. Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by [[clan]]s.<ref name="Morgan1907">{{Cite book

European colonization of the Americas had a major impact on Native American cultures through what is known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and Eurasia (the [[Old World]]) in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].<ref name = "history">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163–188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11986330 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref> The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American cultures through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',<ref>Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45–46</ref> whereby European values of private land ownership, the family, and division of labor, led to conflict, appropriation of traditional communal lands and changed how the indigenous tribes practiced slavery.<ref>Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref>

The impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their ways of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains – HORSE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>

The Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the Native Americans' cultures, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. Horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth by many tribes.

In the early years, as Native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.

===Ethno-linguistic classification===
[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Pre-contact: distribution of North American language families, including northern Mexico]]
{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}

The [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dené]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] families are the largest in terms of number of languages. Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95 million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5 million speakers of [[Nahuatl]]); Na-Dené comes in second with approximately 200,000 speakers (nearly 180,000 of these are speakers of [[Navajo language|Navajo]]), and Algic in third with about 180,000 speakers (mainly [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]). Na-Dené and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Dené spans from Alaska and western Canada through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America. Two large (super-) family proposals, [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], look particularly promising. However, even after decades of research, a large number of families remain.

To counteract a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where an Indigenous American language is the medium of instruction. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] initiated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved raising new fluent speakers of the [[Cherokee language]] from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home.<ref>{{cite web| title = Native Now : Language: Cherokee| website = We Shall Remain – American Experience – PBS| accessdate = April 9, 2014| year = 2008| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/native_now/language_cherokee}}</ref> This plan was part of an ambitious goal that, in 50 years, will result in 80% or more of the Cherokee people being fluent in the language.<ref name=preservation/> The [[Cherokee Preservation Foundation]] has invested $3 million in opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used.<ref name=preservation>{{cite web|title=Cherokee Language Revitalization |website=Cherokee Preservation Foundation |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |year=2014 |url=http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070520/http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}</ref> Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the [[Qualla Boundary]] focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to [[fifth grade]], developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.<ref name="kpep">Kituwah Preservation & Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012.

Historical diets of Native Americans differed dramatically region to region. Different peoples might have relied more heavily on agriculture, horticulture, hunting, fishing, or gathering of wild plants and fungi. Tribes developed diets best suited to their environments.

[[Iñupiat]], [[Yupiit]], [[Unangan]], and fellow [[Alaska Natives]] fished, hunted, and harvested wild plants, but did not rely on agriculture. Coastal peoples relied more heavily on sea mammals, fish, and fish eggs, while inland peoples hunted [[caribou]] and [[moose]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and Office of Research and Development |title=Mercury study report to Congress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoDFgHQ_TqUC&q=Alaska%20Native%20diet%20caribou%20sea%20mammals&pg=RA2-SA4-PA44 |publisher=US EPA |pages=4–44 |date=December 1997|isbn=9781428903722 }}</ref> Alaskan Natives prepared and preserved dried and smoked meat and fish.

The [[Sonoran desert]] region including parts of [[Arizona]] and [[California]], part of a region known as [[Aridoamerica]], relied heavily on the [[tepary bean]] (''[[Phaseolus acutifolius]]'') as a staple crop. This and other desert crops, [[mesquite]] bead pods, ''tunas'' ([[Opuntia ficus-indica|prickly pear]] fruit), cholla buds, [[saguaro]] cactus fruit, and acorns are being actively promoted today by [[Tohono O'odham Community Action]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoover |first1=Elizabeth |title=Tohono O'odham Community Action (TOCA), Sells AZ |url=https://gardenwarriorsgoodseeds.com/2014/09/17/toho-oodham-community-action-toca-sells-az/ |date=17 September 2014}}</ref> In the Southwest, some communities developed [[irrigation]] techniques while others, such as the [[Hopi]] dry-farmed. They filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area's frequent [[droughts]].

[[Maize]] or [[corn]], first cultivated in what is now [[Mexico]] was traded north into Aridoamerica and [[Oasisamerica]], [[Southwestern United States|southwest]]. From there, maize cultivation spread throughout the [[Great Plains]] and [[Eastern Woodlands]] by 200 CE. Native farmers practiced [[Polyculture|polycropping]] maize, beans, and squash; these crops are known as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]. The beans would replace the [[nitrogen]], which the maize leached from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing.

The [[Gender roles in agriculture|agriculture gender roles]] of the Native Americans varied from region to region. In the Southwest area, men prepared the soil with [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]]. The women were in charge of [[planting]], [[weeding]], and [[harvesting]] the crops. In most other regions, the women were in charge of most agriculture, including clearing the land. Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields.

[[Europeans]] in the eastern part of the continent observed that Native Americans cleared large areas for cropland. Their fields in [[New England]] sometimes covered hundreds of acres. Colonists in [[Virginia]] noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans.<ref name="Krech">{{Cite book |last=Krech III |first=Shepard |title=The ecological Indian: myth and history |publisher=W.

Early farmers commonly used tools such as the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[Sledgehammer|maul]], and [[dibber]]. The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting; then it was used for weeding. The first versions were made out of [[wood]] and [[stone]]. When the settlers brought [[iron]], Native Americans switched to iron hoes and [[hatchets]]. The dibber was a digging stick, used to plant the seed. Once the plants were harvested, women prepared the produce for eating. They used the maul to grind the corn into mash. It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/agriculture-american-indians? |website=Answers.com |title=American Indian Agriculture |accessdate=February 8, 2008}}</ref>

Native American religious practices, beliefs, and philosophies differ widely across tribes. These [[spirituality|spiritualities]], practices, beliefs, and philosophies may accompany adherence to another faith, or can represent a person's primary religious, faith, spiritual or philosophical identity. Much Native American spirituality exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself.

Cultural spiritual, philosophical, and faith ways differ from tribe to tribe and person to person. Some tribes include the use of sacred leaves and herbs such as tobacco, [[Hierochloe odorata|sweetgrass]] or [[Leucophyllum|sage]]. Many Plains tribes have [[sweatlodge]] ceremonies, though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes. Fasting, singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people, and sometimes [[Native American music|drumming]] are also common.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levine |first1=Victoria Lindsay |title=Native American Music |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Native-American-music |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Midewiwin|Midewiwin Lodge]] is a medicine society inspired by the oral history and prophesies of the [[Ojibwa]] (Chippewa) and related tribes.

Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the [[Native American Church]]. It is a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from [[Christianity]]. Its main rite is the [[peyote]] ceremony. Prior to 1890, traditional religious beliefs included [[Wakan Tanka]]. In the American Southwest, especially [[New Mexico]], a syncretism between the [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common; the religious drums, chants, and dances of the [[Pueblo people]] are regularly part of [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]'s [[Saint Francis Cathedral]].<ref>[http://www.csp.org/communities/docs/fikes-nac_history.html A Brief History of the Native American Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821191748/http://www.csp.org/communities/docs/fikes-nac_history.html |date=August 21, 2007 }} by Jay Fikes. Retrieved February 22, 2006.</ref> Native American-Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States. (e.g., the National [[Kateri Tekakwitha]] Shrine in [[Fonda, New York]], and the [[National Shrine of the North American Martyrs]] in [[Auriesville, New York]]).

The [[eagle feather law]] (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain [[eagle]] feathers for religious or spiritual use. The law does not allow Native Americans to give eagle feathers to non-Native Americans.

===Gender roles===
{{Main|Gender roles among the indigenous peoples of North America|Clan Mother|Matriarchy|Matrilineality|Two-Spirit}}

[[File:Doctor.susan.la.flesche.picotte.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dr. [[Susan La Flesche Picotte]] was the first Native American woman to become a [[physician]] in the United States.]]
[[File:Explorer Sacagawea .jpg|thumb|right|[[Sacagawea]], a Lemhi Shoshone woman, traveled with her infant to help explorers [[Lewis & Clark Expedition|Lewis & Clark]] reach the Pacific Ocean.]]

Gender roles are differentiated in many Native American tribes. Many Natives have retained traditional expectations of sexuality and gender, and continue to do so in contemporary life despite continued and on-going colonial pressures.<ref name=Estrada>{{cite journal|last=Estrada|first=Gabriel|title=''Two Spirits'', ''Nádleeh'', and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=167–190 |doi=10.17953/aicr.35.4.x500172017344j30|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/318264790/Two-Spirits-Nadleeh-and-Navajo-LGBTQ2-Gaze-pdf}}</ref>

Whether a particular tribe is predominantly [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] or [[patrilineal]], often both sexes have some degree of decision-making power within the tribe. Many Nations, such as the [[Haudenosaunee]] Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes, have matrilineal or [[Clan Mother]] systems, in which property and hereditary leadership are controlled by and passed through the maternal lines.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Katsithawi |title=Gender Roles among the Iroquois |url=https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/tlc/publications/native-circle/native-circle-2003/ashley-thomas3.pdf}}</ref> In these Nations, the children are considered to belong to the mother's clan. In [[Cherokee people|Cherokee]] culture, women own the family property. When traditional young women marry, their husbands may join them in their mother's household.

Matrilineal structures enable young women to have assistance in childbirth and rearing, and protect them in case of conflicts between the couple. If a couple separates or the man dies, the woman has her family to assist her. In matrilineal cultures the mother's brothers are usually the leading male figures in her children's lives; fathers have no standing in their wife and children's clan, as they still belong to their own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions pass through the mother's line and chiefs have historically been selected on recommendation of women elders, who could also disapprove of a chief.<ref name=Thomas/>

In the [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Ponca]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]], hereditary leadership passes through the male line, and children are considered to belong to the father and his [[clan]]. In patrilineal tribes, if a woman marries a non-Native, she is no longer considered part of the tribe, and her children are considered to share the ethnicity and culture of their father.<ref name="TrueLogan">[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society'', Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed August 25, 2011</ref>

In patriarchal tribes, gender roles tend to be rigid. Men have historically hunted, traded and made war while, as life-givers, women have primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe). Women usually gather and cultivate plants, use plants and herbs to treat illnesses, care for the young and the elderly, make all the clothing and instruments, and process and cure meat and skins from the game. Some mothers use [[cradleboard]]s to carry an infant while working or traveling.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030302141755/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_013100_gender.htm Beatrice Medicine], "Gender", ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', February 9, 2006.</ref> In matriarchal and egalitarian nations, the gender roles are usually not so clear-cut, and are even less so in the modern era.<ref name=Estrada/>

At least several dozen tribes allowed [[polygyny]] to sisters, with procedural and economic limits.<ref name="Morgan1907"/>

Native American ball sports, sometimes referred to as [[lacrosse]], stickball, or baggataway, were often used to settle disputes, rather than going to war, as a civil way to settle potential conflict. The [[Choctaw]] called it ''isitoboli'' ("Little Brother of War");<ref name="choctaw_stickball">

The game is played with one or two rackets or sticks and one ball. The object of the game is to land the ball in the opposing team's goal (either a single post or net) to score and to prevent the opposing team from scoring on your goal. The game involves as few as 20 or as many as 300 players with no height or weight restrictions and no protective gear. The goals could be from around {{convert|200|ft}} apart to about {{convert|2|mi}}; in lacrosse the field is {{convert|110|yd}}.

====Individual sports====
[[Chunkey]] was a game that consisted of a stone-shaped disk that was about 1–2&nbsp;inches in diameter. The disk was thrown down a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. The disk would roll down the corridor, and players would throw wooden shafts at the moving disk. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it.

====U.S. Olympics====
[[Jim Thorpe]], a [[Sauk and Fox]] Native American, was an all-round athlete playing football and baseball in the early 20th century. Future President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] injured his knee while trying to tackle the young Thorpe. In a 1961 speech, Eisenhower recalled Thorpe: "Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe.

[[Louis Tewanima]], [[Hopi people]], was an American two-time Olympic distance runner and silver medalist in the 10,000 meter run in 1912. He ran for the Carlisle Indian School where he was a teammate of Jim Thorpe. His silver medal in 1912 remained the best U.S. achievement in this event until another Indian, Billy Mills, won the gold medal in 1964. Tewanima also competed at the 1908 Olympics, where he finished in ninth place in the marathon.[1]

[[Ellison Brown]], of the [[Narragansett people]] from Rhode Island, better known as "Tarzan" Brown, won two Boston Marathons (1936, 1939) and competed on the United States Olympic team in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany, but did not finish due to injury. He qualified for the 1940 Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland, but the games were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II.

[[Billy Mills]], a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] officer, won the gold medal in the 10,000 meter run at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]]. He was the only American ever to win the Olympic gold in this event. An unknown before the Olympics, Mills finished second in the U.S. Olympic trials.

[[Billy Kidd]], part [[Abenaki]] from [[Vermont]], became the first American male to medal in [[alpine skiing]] in the Olympics, taking silver at age 20 in the [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] in the [[Alpine skiing at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964 Winter Olympics]] at [[Innsbruck, Austria|Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].

Traditional Native American music is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Native American music often includes [[drum]]ming or the playing of rattles or other percussion instruments but little other instrumentation. [[Native American flute|Flutes]] and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]]). The tuning of modern flutes is typically [[pentatonic]].

Performers with Native American parentage have occasionally appeared in American popular music such as [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]] (members are also of Mexican descent), and [[CocoRosie]]. Some, such as [[John Trudell]], have used music to comment on life in Native America. Other musicians such as [[R. Carlos Nakai]], [[Joanne Shenandoah]] and [[Robert "Tree" Cody]] integrate traditional sounds with modern sounds in instrumental recordings, whereas the music by artist [[Charles Littleleaf]] is derived from ancestral heritage as well as nature. A variety of small and medium-sized recording companies offer an abundance of recent music by Native American performers young and old, ranging from pow-wow drum music to hard-driving rock-and-roll and rap. In the International world of ballet dancing [[Maria Tallchief]] was considered America's first major [[prima ballerina]],<ref name=SunTimes_obit>{{cite news|title=American prima ballerina Maria Tallchief dies at 88|author=Hedy Weiss|date=April 12, 2013|work=Chicago Sun Times|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/19439381-421/american-prima-ballerina-maria-tallchief-dies-at-88.html|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> and was the first person of Native American descent to hold the rank.<ref name=TIME_obit>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/04/12/the-silent-song-of-maria-tallchief-americas-prima-ballerina-1925-2013/|title=The Silent Song of Maria Tallchief: America's Prima Ballerina (1925–2013)|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 12, 2013|author=Howard Chua-Eoan|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> along with her sister [[Marjorie Tallchief]] both became star ballerinas.

The most widely practiced public musical form among Native Americans in the United States is that of the [[pow-wow]]. At pow-wows, such as the annual [[Gathering of Nations]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], members of drum groups sit in a circle around a large drum. Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass-dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs. Most indigenous communities in the United States also maintain traditional songs and ceremonies, some of which are shared and practiced exclusively within the community.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Bierhosrt, John |title=A Cry from the Earth: Music of North American Indians |publisher=Ancient City Press |year=1992}}</ref>

The [[Iroquois]], living around the [[Great Lakes]] and extending east and north, used strings or belts called ''[[wampum]]'' that served a dual function: the knots and beaded designs mnemonically chronicled tribal stories and legends, and further served as a medium of exchange and a unit of measure.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world, often achieved by ceremonial acts, usually incorporating [[sandpainting]]. For the Navajo the sand painting is not merely a representational object, but a dynamic spiritual entity with a life of its own, which helped the patient at the centre of the ceremony re-establish a connection with the life force.

European impact was immediate, widespread, and profound already during the early years of colonization and the creation of the countries which currently exist in the Americas.

As European-American women started working independently at missions and Indian schools in the western states, there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with Native American men. For instance, [[Charles Eastman]], a man of European and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] origin whose father sent both his sons to [[Dartmouth College]], got his medical degree at [[Boston University]] and returned to the West to practice. He married [[Elaine Goodale]], whom he met in South Dakota. He was the grandson of [[Seth Eastman]], a military officer from Maine, and a chief's daughter. Goodale was a young European-American teacher from Massachusetts and a reformer, who was appointed as the U.S. superintendent of Native American education for the reservations in the Dakota Territory. They had six children together.

===European enslavement===
{{main|Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Slavery among Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America, but none exploited slave labor on a large scale. Most Native American tribes did not barter captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.<ref name="laubchap1">{{cite journal |last1=Lauber |first1=Almon Wheeler |title=Indian Slavery in Colonial Times Within the Present Limits of the United States Chapter 1: Enslavement by the Indians Themselves |date=1913 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=25–48 |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |issn= }}</ref> When Europeans arrived as [[colonists]] in North America, Native Americans changed their practice of [[slavery]] dramatically. Native Americans began selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the "sugar islands". The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo. Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist because vital statistics and census reports were at best infrequent.<ref name="laub">Lauber (1913), "The Number of Indian Slaves" [Ch.

Slaves became a caste of people who were foreign to the English (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians. The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705:

{{quote|All servants imported and brought into the Country&nbsp;... who were not Christians in their native Country&nbsp;... shall be accounted and be slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion&nbsp;... shall be held to be real estate. If any slave resists his master&nbsp;... correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction&nbsp;... the master shall be free of all punishment&nbsp;... as if such accident never happened.|Virginia General Assembly declaration, 1705<ref name="pbsafna">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html |title=The Terrible Transformation:From Indentured Servitude to Racial Slavery |accessdate=2010-01-07 |year=2009 |publisher=PBS}}</ref>}}

The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1750. It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection. Even after the Indian Slave Trade ended in 1750 the enslavement of Native Americans continued in the west, and also in the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] mostly through kidnappings.<ref name="ism">{{cite book |title=Race and the Cherokee Nation |chapter=Indian Slavery and Memory: Interracial sex from the slaves' perspective |first=Fay A. |last=Yarbrough |year=2008 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=112–123}}</ref><ref>Castillo, E.D. 1998.

While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves, they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died.

===Admixture and genetics===
[[File:Creeks in Oklahoma.png|thumb|Members of the Creek (Muscogee) Nation in [[Oklahoma]] around 1877; they include men with some European and African ancestry.<ref>Charles Hudson, ''The Southeastern Indians'', 1976, p. 479.</ref>]]

Intertribal mixing was common among many Native American tribes prior to European contact, as they would adopt captives taken in warfare. Individuals often had ancestry from more than one tribe, particularly after tribes lost so many members from disease in the colonial era and after.<ref name="accessgenealogy1"/> Bands or entire tribes occasionally split or merged to form more viable groups in reaction to the pressures of climate, disease and warfare.<ref name="eurekalert.org">[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/uoia-ycs071508.php "Y chromosome study sheds light on Athapaskan migration to southwest US"], ''Eureka Alert'', Department of Energy Public Newslist</ref>

A number of tribes traditionally adopted [[prisoners of war|captives]] into their group to replace members who had been captured or killed in battle. Such captives were from rival tribes and later were taken from raids on European settlements. Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves, and others owned slaves of their own. Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture, reflecting years of intermarriage between Native American women and European men, often seen as advantageous to both sides.<ref name="eurekalert.org"/> A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans have occurred.

In recent years, genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African-American population. The literary and history scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], had experts on his TV programs who discussed African-American ancestry. They stated that 5% of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry, or the equivalent to one great-grandparent, which may represent more than one distant ancestor. A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of Native American admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20–21.</ref> More recent genetic testing research of 2015, have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. Though DNA testing is limited these studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2–82.1% [[West African people|West African]], 16.7%–29% [[Europe]]an, and 0.8–2% Native American genetic ancestry, with large variation between individuals.<ref name="Bryc2009">{{cite journal|author1=Katarzyna Bryc |author2=Adam Auton |author3=Matthew R.

In ''Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science'', Kim Tallbear states that a person, "… could have up to two Native American grandparents and show no sign of Native American ancestry. For example, a genetic male could have a maternal grandfather (from whom he did not inherit his Y chromosome) and a paternal grandmother (from whom he did not inherit his mtDNA) who were descended from Native American founders, but mtDNA and Y-chromosome analyses would not detect them."<ref name="TallBear 31–66"/>

Native American identity has historically been based on culture, not just biology, as many American Indian peoples adopted captives from their enemies and assimilated them into their tribes. The Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) notes that:

<blockquote>"Native American markers" are not found solely among Native Americans. While they occur more frequently among Native Americans, they are also found in people in other parts of the world.<ref name="bldl2">{{cite web |url=http://www.weyanoke.org/historyculture/hc-DNAandIndianAncestry.html |title=Can DNA Determine Who is American Indian? |author=Kim TallBear, Associate, Red Nation Consulting |accessdate=2009-10-27 |year=2008 |publisher=The WEYANOKE Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724191733/http://www.weyanoke.org/historyculture/hc-DNAandIndianAncestry.html |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

Geneticists state:

<blockquote>Not all Native Americans have been tested; especially with the large number of deaths due to disease such as [[smallpox]], it is unlikely that Native Americans only have the genetic markers they have identified [so far], even when their maternal or paternal bloodline does not include a [known] non-Native American.<ref name="hur">{{cite news |url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908 |title=Deep Roots and Tangled Branches |author=Troy Duster |accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |work=Chronicle of Higher Education |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726082531/http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |author-link=Troy Duster }}</ref><ref name="bldl1">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071018145955.htm|title=Genetic Ancestral Testing Cannot Deliver On Its Promise, Study Warns|author=ScienceDaily|accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |website=ScienceDaily}}</ref></blockquote>

===Tribal membership===
{{Further|Cherokee freedmen controversy}}
To receive tribal services, a Native American must be a certified (or enrolled) member of a federally recognized tribal organization. Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members. Among tribes, qualification for enrollment may be based upon a required percentage of Native American "blood" (or the "[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]") of an individual seeking recognition, or documented descent from an ancestor on the [[Dawes Rolls]] or other registers. But, the federal government has its own standards related to who qualifies for services available to certified Native Americans. For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe ''and'' to be of at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card issued by the federal government.

Some tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing of individuals' applying for membership, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Karen |title=Ancestry in a Drop of Blood |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/30/science/sci-indiandna30 |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |work=LA TImes |date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex. Federally recognized tribes do not accept genetic-ancestry results as appropriate documentation for enrollment and do not advise applicants to submit such documentation.<ref name="TallBear 31–66"/>

Tribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls, resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in Cherokee culture for years.

===Increased self-identification===
Since the [[2000 United States Census]], people may identify as being of more than one race.<ref name="2010 Census AMAN" /> Since the 1960s, the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census, the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to "ethnic shifting" or "ethnic shopping"; they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible.

The author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:

{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians 'trying to come home.' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum—measuring racial purity by blood—into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name="Newest Indians"/>}}

The journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that identifying with Native American culture may be a result of a person's increased interest in [[genealogy]], the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of Native American ancestors in the distant past. There are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe. Different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership; in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll, seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government; and there are individuals who are 100% Native American but, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:

{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond. The whole situation, some say, is ripe for misinterpretation, confusion and, ultimately, exploitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diverseeducation.com/article/6918/|title=Ethnic Fraud|last=|first=|date=January 25, 2007|website=diverseeducation|access-date=}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

===Genetics===
{{Main|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
{{see also|Y-DNA haplogroups in Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
The [[genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] primarily focuses on [[human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups]] and [[human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups]]. "Y-DNA" is passed solely along the [[patrilineal]] line, from father to son, while "mtDNA" is passed down the [[matrilineal]] line, from mother to offspring of both sexes. Neither [[Genetic recombination|recombines]], and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.<ref name="nomenclature">{{cite journal |year=2002 |title=A Nomenclature System for the Tree of Human Y-Chromosomal Binary Haplogroups |pages=339–348 |volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1101/gr.217602 |last1=Consortium |first1=T.

All five haplogroups have been identified by researchers as “prehistoric Native North American samples,” and it is commonly asserted that the majority of living Native Americans possess one of the common five mtDNA haplogroup markers.<ref name="TallBear 31–66"/>
