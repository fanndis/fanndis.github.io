'''''The Secret''''' is a 2006 Australian-American [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[documentary film]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrohdKlFfkE |title="The Secret Banned Edition" Creative Commons License |publisher=Youtube.com |date=13 August 2013 |access-date=2 October 2013}}</ref>  consisting of a series of interviews designed to demonstrate the [[New Thought]] claim that everything one wants or needs can be satisfied by believing in an outcome, repeatedly thinking about it, and maintaining positive emotional states to "attract" the desired outcome.

The film and the subsequent publication of the [[The Secret (book)|book of the same name]] attracted interest from media figures such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Larry King]]. It has also received a great deal of controversy and criticism for its claims, and has been parodied in TV shows.

== Synopsis ==
''The Secret'', described as a [[self-help]] film,<ref name="la_times">{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Karin |title=''Self-help gone nutty'' |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=13 February 2007 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-klein13feb13,0,3953992.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |access-date=13 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221030456/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-klein13feb13,0,3953992.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |archive-date=21 February 2007 }}</ref><ref name="newsweek">{{cite news | last = Adler | first = Jerry | title = ''Decoding The Secret'' | work = Newsweek | date = 5 March 2007
| url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/36603 | access-date = 8 May 2008}}</ref> uses a [[Documentary film|documentary]] format to present a concept titled "[[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]]". As described in the film, the "Law of Attraction" hypothesis<ref>American Heritage Dictionary</ref> posits that feelings and thoughts can attract events, feelings, and experiences, from the workings of the cosmos to interactions among individuals in their physical, emotional, and professional affairs. The film also suggests that there has been a strong tendency by those in positions of power to keep this central principle hidden from the public.

== Teachers of the law of attraction ==
The film includes interviews with individuals who describe themselves as professionals and authors in the fields of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], [[psychology]], [[metaphysics]], coaching, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[finance]], [[feng shui]], [[medicine]], and [[personal development]], who are called "secret teachers". Some of them, on their websites, promote the film and their connection to it. A few of the persons' brief appearances do not speak of the "law of attraction" in their interviews, so their support of the concepts is assumed by viewers.

People who focus on the law of attraction who are interviewed in the film and have later been featured on prominent American TV shows are John Assaraf,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/john-assaraf/|title=John Assaraf Neurogym Review & Brain-A-Thon Host|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Michael Beckwith]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/michael-bernard-beckwith/|title=Michael Beckwith - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> John Demartini,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/dr-john-demartini/|title=Dr. John DeMartini - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Robert (Bob) Proctor|Bob Proctor]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/bob-proctor/|title=Bob Proctor - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Jack Canfield]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/jack-canfield/|title=Jack Canfield: Success Principles Review|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> [[James Arthur Ray]], [[Joseph Vitale (author)|Joseph Vitale]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/joe-vitale/|title=Joe Vitale - Law Of Attraction Practitioner Certification Review|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=18 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Lisa Nichols, Marie Diamond, and [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]].

==Foundations in New Thought ideas==
The authors of ''The Secret'' cite the [[New Thought]] movement which began in the late 18th century as the historical basis for their ideas.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news

The New Thought book ''[[The Science of Getting Rich]]'' by [[Wallace Wattles]], the source Rhonda Byrne cites as inspiration for the film, was preceded by numerous other New Thought books, including the 1906 book ''Thought Vibration or the law of attraction in the Thought World'' by [[William Walker Atkinson]],<ref name="thought_vibration">{{cite book| last = Atkinson| first = William Walker| title = Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World| year = 1906| publisher = Cornerstone| isbn = 978-1-56459-660-4}} (Out of copyright, [http://website.lineone.net/~cornerstone2/tvib.htm published on the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605113713/http://website.lineone.net/~cornerstone2/tvib.htm#6 |date=5 June 2007 }})</ref> editor of ''New Thought magazine''. Other New Thought books Byrne is purported to have read include self-help authors like Prentice Mulford's 19th-century'' Thoughts Are Things;'' and Robert Collier's ''Secret of the Ages'' from 1926.<ref name="new_york_times" />

=== Portrayal of ideas preceding the New Thought movement ===
''The Secret'' website cites the [[Emerald Tablet]], said to be written by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (purportedly a "secret teacher"), as... one of the most important historical documents known to mankind".<ref name="past_teachers">{{cite web| title = The secret teachers| publisher = TS Production LLC| year = 2006| url = http://www.thesecret.tv/pastteachers.html| access-date = 6 June 2007| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616091747/http://thesecret.tv/pastteachers.html| archive-date = 16 June 2007}} — page at official website of ''The Secret'' film.</ref> Byrne posits that the earliest trace of "the secret" occurred in the Emerald Tablet,<ref name="QPIX_news">{{cite news

Betsy Chasse, one of the producers, directors, and screenwriters for ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' interviewed Paul Harrington, the co-producer of ''The Secret.'' In the interview, Harrington gave this description of Byrne's production methods: "We used the law of attraction during the making of the program. We went very unconventional, in terms of scheduling and budgeting. We allowed things to come to us... We just had faith that things would come to us."<ref name="bleeping_herald" />

Channel Nine, after viewing the completed film, chose to not broadcast it. A new contract was negotiated with all DVD sales going to Byrne's companies (Prime Time and The Secret LLC). In hindsight, Len Downs of Channel Nine commented, "we looked at it and we didn't deem it as having broad, mass appeal". The film was eventually broadcast by Channel Nine at 10:30 pm on Saturday, 3 February 2007.<ref name="the_age" /> Downs reported that "it didn't do all that well".<ref name="newsweek" /> The film was sold on DVD and also broadcast online through [[streaming media]].

Choosing to package the film's theme as a "secret" has been called an important component of the film's popularity. Donavin Bennes, a buyer who specializes in [[metaphysics]] for [[Borders Group|Borders Books]], stated "We all want to be in on a secret. But to present it as ''the'' secret, that was brilliant." ''<ref name="newsweek" />''

=== Marketing campaign ===
The movie was advertised on the Internet using "tease" advertising and [[viral marketing]]; techniques in which the specific details of ''The Secret'' were not revealed. Additionally, Prime Time Productions granted written permission to individuals or companies, via application at the official site, to provide free screenings of the film to public audiences. Optionally, the DVD could be sold at these screenings.

Several critics wrote about the Secret in relation to [[self-help]] in general. Julie Mason, of the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', wrote that word of mouth about the film spread through [[Pilates]] classes, "get-rich-quick websites" and personal-motivation blogs.<ref name="ottawa_citizen">{{cite news| last = Mason| first = Julie| title = ''The secrets of the secret''| newspaper = Ottawa Citizen| date = 4 February 2007| url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/citizensweekly/story.html?id=59f86670-db12-4731-a656-1fc0d43a950d| access-date = 10 May 2007| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011202922/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/citizensweekly/story.html?id=59f86670-db12-4731-a656-1fc0d43a950d| archive-date = 11 October 2007}}</ref> Jane Lampman, of the ''[[The Christian Science Monitor|Christian Science Monitor]]'', described ''The Secret'' as a brand promoting ''Secret''-related teachers, seminars  and retreats.<ref name="monitor" /> According to Jill Culora, of the ''[[New York Post]]'', fans of ''The Secret'' have posted on a wide range of blogs and Web forums accounts of how shifting from negative to positive thoughts made big improvements in their lives.<ref name="new_york_post">{{cite news|last=Culora |first=Jill |title=''A 'secret' Oprah Craze Hits New Yorkers'' |newspaper=New York Post |date=4 March 2007 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042007/news/regionalnews/a_secret_oprah_craze_hits_new_yorkers_regionalnews_jill_culora.htm?page=0 |access-date=10 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929170308/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042007/news/regionalnews/a_secret_oprah_craze_hits_new_yorkers_regionalnews_jill_culora.htm?page=0 |archive-date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

In 2007, ''The Secret'' was reportedly being discussed in "e-mails, in chat rooms, around office cubicles, [and] on blind dates".<ref name="new_york_post" /> It is recognized as having a broad and varied impact on culture.<ref name="new_york_post" />

American TV host [[Oprah Winfrey]] is a proponent of the film and later the book. On [[The Larry King Show]] she said that the message of ''The Secret'' is the message she's been trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zm3-exDWIg|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> Author [[Rhonda Byrne]] was later invited to her show along people who vow by ''The Secret''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/_75|title=Discovering The Secret|access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref>

Some critics were bothered by the film's focus on questionable wealth enhancement, including promises that the universe will give you material goods "like having the universe as your catalog."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1573136,00.html|title=The Secret of Success|date=28 December 2006|author=Jeffrey Ressner|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|access-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>

According to a March 2007 issue of ''Skeptical Inquirer'', the central idea of the film "has [no] basis in scientific reality", despite invoking scientific concepts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/|title=Secrets and Lies|work=csicop.org|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref>

[[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] former champion [[Conor McGregor]] claims ''The Secret'' played a role in his rise to fame. McGregor has said his first reaction on watching the DVD version was: “This is bullshit — but then something clicked for me.” He and girlfriend Dee Devlin, who manages his finances, started focusing on small things they wanted, such as a parking space closest to the doors of a local shopping centre. He said: “We would be driving to the shop and  visualising the exact car park space. And then we’d be able to get it every time.”
They then began  visualizing wealth, fame and championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/26/conor-mcgregors-rise-from-failed-plumber-to-shocking-superstar/|title=Conor McGregor: 'The Secret' changed my life|first1=Oliver|last1=Harvey|first2=The|last2=Sun|date=26 July 2017|access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref>

== Releases ==
Paul Harrington, the producer for the film, reported that broadcast TV—instead of the Internet—was initially planned as the medium for the first release:

{{quote|...we had as our vision to go out to the whole world in 24 hours on television. It was a grand vision, which we weren't able to pull off for various reasons. We were trying to force, to control the "how" of the universe, when what we were supposed to do was just focus on the vision...<ref name="bleeping_herald" />}}

=== Release dates ===
''The Secret'' premiere was broadcast through the Internet on 23 March 2006 using Vividas technology. It is still available either on a pay-per-view basis via [[streaming media]] (or on DVD at the official site for the film).  A new extended edition of ''The Secret'' was released to the public on 1 October 2006. The Australian television premiere was on [[Nine Network]] on Saturday, 3 February 2007.<ref name="the_age" />
