==="Merck" name legal dispute===
In 191 of 193 countries, the original Merck company, the [[Merck Group]] of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada, the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt), its legal name here says ''Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany'', and instead of "Merck Group", the "EMD Group" name is used. In the United States and Canada, Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme) and its legal name says here ''Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA''.

In 2015 the [[Merck Group]] adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck".<ref name="Bloomberg14">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-10/a-tale-of-two-mercks-as-protesters-take-on-wrong-company|title=A Tale of Two Mercks as Protesters Take On Wrong Company|website=Bloomberg|first1=Allison|last1=Connolly|first2=Makiko|last2=Kitamura|date=February 10, 2014|access-date=May 28, 2019|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the [[High Court of Justice]] in the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.<ref name=":3">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merckkgaa-name-idUSKCN0UT239/|title=Fight over Merck name sees German firm win in British court|website=Reuters|date=January 15, 2016|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref> The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/merck-kgaa-announces-favorable-english-court-ruling-on-name-use-20160115-00359#ixzz41CPkGqNI|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com}}</ref>

In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and [[cybersquatting]]. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “''all monetary gains, profits, and advantages''” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.<ref name="genengnews.com"/>

In 2020, in the course of litigation of Merck against MSD in Switzerland, the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] ruled that MSD's use of the "Merck" brand in its global websites could, absent [[geotargeting]] mechanisms, have "commercial effect" in Switzerland and could therefore violate Merck's rights (if any) to the "Merck" brand in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Judgment 4A_335/2019 of 29 April 2020|url=http://relevancy.bger.ch/php/aza/http/index.php?highlight_docid=aza://aza://29-04-2020-4A_335-2019&lang=de&zoom=&type=show_document|access-date=2020-07-07|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court}}</ref>

The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Abnormal_Development_-_Rubella_Virus |title=Rubella |access-date=2014-09-22 }}</ref> Hilleman also developed the first [[Hepatitis B vaccine]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_100763 | title=1981-Hepatitis B: First Subunit Viral Vaccine in U.S.}}</ref> and the first [[varicella vaccine]], for chickenpox.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_100763 | title=3/17/1995-Chickenpox Vaccine Licensed}}</ref>

====Thiazide anti-hypertensives====
The thiazide diuretics were developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of [[Merck and Co.]] in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beyer KH |title=Chlorothiazide.

====First statin====
Merck scientists also developed [[lovastatin]], the first drug of the [[statin]] class.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merck.com/about/our-history/home.html |title=Merck History |access-date=2014-09-22 }}</ref> It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.

====Antibacterials====
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at [[Rutgers University]] in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kingston W |title=Streptomycin, Schatz v.

In 1985 Merck received approval for [[imipenem]], the first member of the [[carbapenem]] class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/133.full.pdf+html |title=Diagnosis and Management of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infection in Adults and Children: Guidelines by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/HAP.pdf }}</ref>

====Vioxx====
In 1999, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as [[rofecoxib]]), a Merck product for treating [[arthritis]]. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme [[cyclooxygenase-2]]. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs such as [[naproxen]], which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fries JF, Miller SR, Spitz PW, Williams CA, Hubert HB, Bloch DA |title=Toward an epidemiology of gastropathy associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=96 |issue=2 Pt 2 Suppl |pages=647–55 | date=February 1989 |pmid=2909442 |doi= 10.1016/S0016-5085(89)80061-7}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}} Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-05-02|title=Shocker!

Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with [[Vioxx]] use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=reported|first1=This article was|last2=Berenson|first2=written by Alex|last3=Harris|first3=Gardiner|last4=Meier|first4=Barry|last5=Pollack|first5=Andrew|date=2004-11-14|title=Despite Warnings, Drug Giant Took Long Path to Vioxx Recall|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/business/despite-warnings-drug-giant-took-long-path-to-vioxx-recall.html|access-date=2020-09-13|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a [[clinical trial]] it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.<ref>[http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf Finance.senate.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029135457/http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf |date=October 29, 2004 }}</ref> On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999–2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular [[COX-2 inhibitor]] [[Celebrex]], an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaithianathan R, Hockey PM, Moore TJ, Bates DW |title=Iatrogenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors in the US population: findings from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey |journal=Drug Saf |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=335–43 |year=2009 |pmid=19388724 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200932040-00007|s2cid=41806262 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}}

About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.<ref name="NYT">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30drug.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin Courts Reject Two Major Vioxx Verdicts], ''[[The New York Times]], May 30, 2008</ref> In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/business/09cnd-merck.html | work=The New York Times | title=Merck Agrees to Pay $4.85 Billion in Vioxx Claims | date=November 9, 2007}}</ref> The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.officialvioxxsettlement.com/documents/Description%20of%20Settlement.pdf | work=Vioxx MDL Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee Official Vioxx Settlement | title=Description of Settlement Agreement | date=November 9, 2007}}</ref> The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.<ref name="NYT2"/> In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.<ref name="NYT"/>

Merck has refused to consider compensation for Vioxx victims and their families outside the US. This is particularly true in the UK where there are at least 400 victims and the legal protection afforded to the victims and their families is particularly weak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10425|title=How Merck Made a Killing|last=Giles|first=J.|date=November 2008|website=Healthy Scepticism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027220130/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10425|archive-date=October 27, 2008}} [http://www.healthyskepticism.org/global/library/item/14482 Alt URL]</ref>

According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited". "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon [[academic freedom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/drug-company-drew-up-doctor-hit-list/story-fna7dq6e-1225693586492 |title=Vioxx maker Merck and Co drew up doctor hit list |last=Rout |first=Milanda |work=The Australian |date=April 1, 2009 |access-date=2009-04-26}}</ref>

On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote [[Vioxx]].<ref>[http://ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=842595&r=1 Arizona gets $2.3 Million from Vioxx Settlement] [[KTAR-FM|92.3 KTAR]] Retrieved May 19, 2008</ref> All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/business/21vioxx.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin Merck Agrees to Settlement Over Vioxx Ads], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 20, 2008</ref>

====Mectizan====
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with [[UNICEF]] to donate its new drug [[Mectizan]] to "all that need it for as long as needed"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/merck-pia.html |title=Stories of UNICEF in Action|work=UNICEF USA |access-date=3 July 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426154146/http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/merck-pia.html |archive-date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> in an effort to combat [[onchocerciasis]], also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the [[World Health Organization]] had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the [[Black Fly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2005/Ivermectin/History.htm |title=Ivermectin History |publisher=Stanford.edu |date=February 24, 1981 |access-date=2012-06-05}}</ref> However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110830090427/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol17no1/171heal1.htm Onchocerciasis: Africa's victory over river blindness], Africa Recovery, Vol. 17 No. 1 (May 2003), p. 6</ref> and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and African countries.<ref name="Mectizan Donation Program">{{cite web|url=http://www.mectizan.org/history|title=History|access-date=3 July 2015}}</ref>

More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing, and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.<ref name="Mectizan Donation Program"/>

====Fosamax====
Fosamax ([[alendronate]]) is a [[bisphosphonate]] used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of The North American Menopause Society |journal=Menopause |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=25–54; quiz 55–6 |year=2010 |pmid=20061894 |doi=10.1097/gme.0b013e3181c617e6 |last1=<!-- &Na --> |s2cid=7980731 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hauk L |title=ACOG releases practice bulletin on osteoporosis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=269–75 | date=August 2013 |pmid=23944732 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Compston J, Bowring C, Cooper A, etal |title=Diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and older men in the UK: National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) update 2013 |journal=Maturitas |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=392–6 | date=August 2013 |pmid=23810490 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.05.013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aace.com/files/osteo-guidelines-2010.pdf }}</ref>

In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials.

==Society and culture==

===Patient assistance programs===
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/corporate/2006_0526.html "Merck to Create New Patient Assistance Program for Vaccines"] Retrieved May 20, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916195646/http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/corporate/2006_0526.html |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref> Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.<ref>[http://patientassistance.com/programs.html?pharmaname=merck+%26+co&medication=&submit=Search "Patient Assistance&nbsp;– Available Prescription Assistance Programs From Merck & Co."] Retrieved May 20, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.merck.com/responsibility/pap-information.html Merck Patient Assistance Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727152434/http://www.merck.com/responsibility/pap-information.html |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref>

Following the merger with Schering Plough in 2009, Merck started laying off workers, cutting around 36,450 jobs between 2010 and 2015.<ref name=Fierce2015>{{cite news|last1=Staton|first1=Tracy|title=Merck tallies 36,000 job cuts in 5 years of restructuring|url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/corporate/merck-tallies-36-000-job-cuts-5-years-of-restructuring|work=FiercePharma|date=August 13, 2015|language=en}}</ref> During that time the company sold its consumer health business to Bayer and narrowed the company's focus to immunology, vaccines, diabetes, emerging markets and medicines used in hospitals, like certain antibiotics.<ref name=Fierce2015/>

===Sham medical journal===
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid [[Elsevier]] an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the ''[[Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine]]''. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.<ref>{{cite news |author= Singer N |title= Merck paid for medical 'journal' without disclosure |work= The New York Times |date=May 13, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/14vioxxside.html |access-date=2009-06-17}}</ref> In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".<ref>{{cite press release | title = Statement from Michael Hansen, CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Regarding Australia Based Sponsored Journal Practices Between 2000 and 2005 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = May 7, 2009 | url = https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/clinical-solutions/statement-from-michael-hansen,-ceo-of-elseviers-health-sciences-division,-regarding-australia-based-sponsored-journal-practices-between-2000-and-2005 | access-date = May 28, 2019 | quote = It has recently come to my attention that from 2000 to 2005, our Australia office published a series of sponsored article compilation publications, on behalf of pharmaceutical clients, that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures.

===Hilleman Laboratories===
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the [[Hilleman Laboratories]], an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low-cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/merck-jv-plans-show-jj-sanofi-low-cost-cholera-vax/2014-06-19 |title=Fierce Biotech: Merck JV plans to show up J&J, Sanofi with low-cost cholera vaccine |access-date=2015-02-07 }}</ref>

===Medicaid overbilling===
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the [[False Claims Act]].<ref name="wapo"/> They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to [[Medicaid]] and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/February/08_civ_094.html |title=Merck to Pay More than $650 Million to Resolve Claims of Fraudulent Price Reporting and Kickbacks|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=February 7, 2008 |access-date=2012-06-05}}</ref> On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines.

===Environmental record===
Merck & Co. once used [[methylene chloride]], an animal carcinogen on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/01/00155.pdf|title=P2ric.org Is For Sale|website=infohouse.p2ric.org}}</ref>

In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by {{convert|680000|lb|abbr=on}} a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/016bcfb1deb9fecd85256aca005d74df/e96f05f182d3254b852570d8005e1207!OpenDocument |title=U.S. settles $1.8 million pollution case with Merck and Monsanto &#124; US EPA |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |access-date=2012-06-05}}</ref>
