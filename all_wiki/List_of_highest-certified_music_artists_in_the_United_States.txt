{{short description|List of top 100 RIAA-certified album artists and top 50 RIAA-certified digital single artists}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2019}}
This is the list of the '''highest-certified music artists in the United States''' based on [[Music certification|certifications]] of albums and digital singles (but not physical singles) by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |title='Top Artists' By Certifications|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> [[RIAA certification]]s are based on wholesale shipments rather than retail sales. Since 2016, the RIAA album certification has also included on-demand audio/video streams (1,500 streams = 1 [[album equivalent unit|album unit]]) and track sale equivalent (10 track sales = 1 album unit).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6859551/riaa-streaming-gold-platinum-certification-methodology|title=RIAA Accepts Streams for Gold and Platinum Certifications|website=billboard.com|accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref> Additionally, awards are only presented if and when a record company applies for certification. Therefore, the total certified units for a given artist may be incomplete or out of date.

The RIAA began its certifications in 1958, therefore, popular artists from earlier eras are generally not represented on this list. {{As of|2020|12|01|df=US}}, [[The Beatles]] are the act with highest-certified albums, [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] is the act with the highest-certified digital singles, and [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Eminem]] are the only acts in the top 30 of both lists.<!--

When ranking artists who debuted in the 2000s or later, [[Taylor Swift]] is the highest certified on the albums list, and also holds the third-place spot on the singles list, making her the overall highest certified act amongst 21st-century musicians.

As of 2020-12-01:
Act, album#, single#
Michael Jackson, 7, 26
Mariah Carey, 13, 31
Eminem, 29, 4
Taylor Swift, 31, 2
Tim McGraw, 42, 43
Chesney, 61, 44
Linkin Park, 64, 49
Adele, 66, 42   
Drake, 81, 1
