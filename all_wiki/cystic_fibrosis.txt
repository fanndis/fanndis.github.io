<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Cystic fibrosis''' ('''CF''') is a [[genetic disorder]] that affects mostly the [[lung]]s, but also the [[pancreas]], [[liver]], [[kidney]]s, and [[intestine]].<ref name=O2009/><ref name=CF2012/> Long-term issues include [[Shortness of breath|difficulty breathing]] and coughing up [[sputum|mucus]] as a result of frequent [[pneumonia|lung infections]].<ref name=O2009/> Other signs and [[symptom]]s may include [[Sinusitis|sinus infections]], [[failure to thrive|poor growth]], [[Steatorrhea|fatty stool]], [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers and toes, and [[infertility]] in most males.<ref name=O2009/> Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.<ref name=O2009/>

<!-- Cause and mechanism and diagnosis -->
CF is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner.<ref name=O2009/> It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the [[gene]] for the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (CFTR) protein.<ref name=O2009/> Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly healthy.<ref name="Mas2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Massie J, Delatycki MB | title = Cystic fibrosis carrier screening | journal = Paediatric Respiratory Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 270–5 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23466339 | doi = 10.1016/j.prrv.2012.12.002 }}</ref> CFTR is involved in the production of sweat, [[digestion|digestive]] fluids, and mucus.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cTZAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA351|title=Molecular Diagnostics: Fundamentals, Methods and Clinical Applications|vauthors=Buckingham L|publisher=F.A.

The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.<ref name="pmid15339250" />

In rare cases, cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a [[Coagulopathy|coagulation disorder]]. [[Vitamin K]] is normally absorbed from [[breast milk]], formula, and later, solid foods. This absorption is impaired in some CF patients. Young children are especially sensitive to vitamin K malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta, leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin K from dietary sources after birth. Because clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X are vitamin K–dependent, low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems. Consequently, when a child presents with unexplained bruising, a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether an underlying disease is present.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Reaves J, Wallace G|date=2010|title=Unexplained bruising: weighing the pros and cons of possible causes|url=https://www.pediatricsconsultantlive.com/vitamin-d-insufficiency/unexplained-bruising-weighing-pros-and-cons-possible-causes|journal=Consultant for Pediatricians|volume=9|pages=201–2}}</ref>

In the early stages, incessant coughing, copious [[phlegm]] production, and decreased ability to exercise are common. Many of these symptoms occur when [[bacteria]] that normally inhabit the thick mucus grow out of control and cause pneumonia.

In later stages, changes in the architecture of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways ([[bronchiectasis]]), further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other signs include coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]), high [[blood pressure]] in the lung ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), [[heart failure]], difficulties getting enough [[oxygen]] to the body ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] machines or [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilators]].<ref name="Rowe" /> ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients.<ref name=kumar2007/> The most common infection involves bacterial strain [[mutation]] to form a [[biofilm]]-forming and sustaining mucoid strain on the lung [[epithelium]], which can result in downstream mechanisms that progress the infection.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson PA | title = Novel understandings of host cell mechanisms involved in chronic lung infection: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cystic fibrotic lung | journal = Journal of Infection and Public Health | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–246 | date = 2019 | pmid = 30459101 | doi = 10.1016/j.jiph.2018.10.014 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung diseases.

Among these is [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], in which the body's response to the common [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'' complex, a group of bacteria related to [[tuberculosis]], which can cause lung damage and do not respond to common antibiotics.<ref name="pmid16266669">{{cite journal | vauthors = Girón RM, Domingo D, Buendía B, Antón E, Ruiz-Velasco LM, Ancochea J | title = [Nontuberculous mycobacteria in patients with cystic fibrosis] | language = es | journal = Archivos de Bronconeumologia | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 560–5 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16266669 | doi = 10.1016/S1579-2129(06)60283-8 }}</ref> People with CF are susceptible to getting a [[pneumothorax]].<ref name="Amin2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Amin R, Noone PG, Ratjen F | title = Chemical pleurodesis versus surgical intervention for persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD007481 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235645 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007481.pub3 | pmc = 7208277 }}</ref>

Mucus in the [[paranasal sinus]]es is equally thick and may also cause blockage of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and [[headache]]s.

Cardiorespiratory complications are the most common causes of death (about 80%) in patients at most CF centers in the United States.<ref name=kumar2007/>

===Gastrointestinal===
Prior to prenatal and [[newborn screening]], cystic fibrosis was often diagnosed when a newborn infant failed to pass feces ([[meconium]]), which may completely block the [[small intestine|intestines]] and cause serious illness. This condition, called [[meconium ileus]], occurs in 5–10%<ref name=kumar2007/> of newborns with CF. In addition, protrusion of internal [[rectum|rectal]] membranes ([[rectal prolapse]]) is more common, occurring in as many as 10% of children with CF,<ref name=kumar2007/> and it is caused by increased fecal volume, [[malnutrition]], and [[Valsalva maneuver|increased intra–abdominal pressure]] due to coughing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulczycki LL, Shwachman H | title = Studies in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas; occurrence of rectal prolapse | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 259 | issue = 9 | pages = 409–12 | date = August 1958 | pmid = 13578072 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM195808282590901 }}</ref>

The thick mucus seen in the lungs has a counterpart in thickened secretions from the [[pancreas]], an organ responsible for providing [[Pancreatic juice|digestive juices]] that help break down food. These secretions block the [[exocrine]] movement of the digestive enzymes into the [[duodenum]] and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation ([[pancreatitis]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohn JA, Friedman KJ, Noone PG, Knowles MR, Silverman LM, Jowell PS | title = Relation between mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene and idiopathic pancreatitis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 339 | issue = 10 | pages = 653–8 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9725922 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199809033391002 }}</ref> The [[pancreatic duct]]s are totally plugged in more advanced cases, usually seen in older children or adolescents.<ref name=kumar2007/> This causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis.<ref name=kumar2007/>

The lack of digestive enzymes leads to difficulty absorbing nutrients with their subsequent excretion in the feces, a disorder known as [[malabsorption]], which leads to malnutrition and poor growth and development because of calorie loss. Resultant [[hypoproteinemia]] may be severe enough to cause generalized edema.<ref name=kumar2007/> Individuals with CF also have difficulties absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], and [[vitamin K|K]].<ref name="Assis2016"/>

In addition to the pancreas problems, people with CF experience more [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|heartburn]],<ref name="Assis2016"/> intestinal blockage by [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]], and [[constipation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Malfroot A, Dab I | title = New insights on gastro-oesophageal reflux in cystic fibrosis by longitudinal follow up | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 66 | issue = 11 | pages = 1339–45 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1755649 | pmc = 1793275 | doi = 10.1136/adc.66.11.1339 }}</ref> Older individuals with CF may develop [[distal intestinal obstruction syndrome]] when thickened feces cause intestinal blockage.<ref name="Assis2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assis DN, Freedman SD | title = Gastrointestinal Disorders in Cystic Fibrosis | journal = Clinics in Chest Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–18 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26857772 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccm.2015.11.004 | type = Review }}</ref>

[[Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]] occurs in the majority (85% to 90%) of patients with CF.<ref name=kumar2007/> It is mainly associated with "severe" CFTR mutations, where both alleles are completely nonfunctional (e.g. [[ΔF508]]/ΔF508).<ref name=kumar2007/> It occurs in 10% to 15% of patients with one "severe" and one "mild" CFTR mutation where little CFTR activity still occurs, or where two "mild" CFTR mutations exist.<ref name=kumar2007/> In these milder cases, sufficient pancreatic exocrine function is still present so that enzyme supplementation is not required.<ref name=kumar2007/> Usually, no other GI complications occur in pancreas-sufficient phenotypes, and in general, such individuals usually have excellent growth and development.<ref name=kumar2007/> Despite this, idiopathic [[chronic pancreatitis]] can occur in a subset of pancreas-sufficient individuals with CF, and is associated with recurrent abdominal pain and life-threatening complications.<ref name=kumar2007/>

Thickened secretions also may cause liver problems in patients with CF. [[Bile]] secreted by the liver to aid in digestion may block the [[bile duct]]s, leading to liver damage. Impaired digestion or absorption of lipids can result in [[steatorrhea]]. Over time, this can lead to scarring and nodularity ([[cirrhosis]]). The liver fails to rid the blood of toxins and does not make important proteins, such as those responsible for [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams SG, Westaby D, Tanner MS, Mowat AP | title = Liver and biliary problems in cystic fibrosis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 877–92 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1458306 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a072583 }}</ref><ref name="liver">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colombo C, Russo MC, Zazzeron L, Romano G | s2cid = 27836468 | title = Liver disease in cystic fibrosis | journal = Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | volume = 43 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S49-55 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16819402 | doi = 10.1097/01.mpg.0000226390.02355.52 }}</ref> Liver disease is the third-most common cause of death associated with CF.<ref name=kumar2007/>

===Endocrine===
The pancreas contains the [[islets of Langerhans]], which are responsible for making [[insulin]], a hormone that helps regulate blood [[glucose]].

==Causes==
[[File:autorecessive.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Cystic fibrosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance]]
CF is caused by a mutation in the [[gene]] [[CFTR (gene)|cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (''CFTR''). The most common mutation, [[ΔF508]], is a deletion ([[delta (letter)#Mathematics and the Sciences|Δ]] signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] (F) at the 508th position on the protein.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guimbellot J, Sharma J, Rowe SM | title = Toward inclusive therapy with CFTR modulators: Progress and challenges | journal = Pediatric Pulmonology | volume = 52 | issue = S48 | pages = S4–S14 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28881097 | pmc = 6208153 | doi = 10.1002/ppul.23773 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma J, Keeling KM, Rowe SM | title = Pharmacological approaches for targeting cystic fibrosis nonsense mutations | journal = European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 200 | pages = 112436 | date = August 2020 | pmid = 32512483 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112436 | pmc = 7384597 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523420304074 }}</ref> This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70%<ref name=kumar2007/>) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the [[United States]]; however, over 1500 other mutations  can produce CF.<ref name="prevalence">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobadilla JL, Macek M, Fine JP, Farrell PM | title = Cystic fibrosis: a worldwide analysis of CFTR mutations--correlation with incidence data and application to screening | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 575–606 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12007216 | doi = 10.1002/humu.10041 }}</ref> Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the ''CFTR'' gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an [[Autosomal recessive disorder#Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans|autosomal recessive disease]].<ref name=Lancet2016/>

The ''CFTR'' gene, found at the q31.2 [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of [[chromosome 7]], is 230,000 [[base pair]]s long, and creates a protein that is 1,480 [[amino acid]]s long. More specifically, the location is between base pair 117,120,016 and 117,308,718 on the long arm of chromosome 7, region 3, band 1, subband 2, represented as 7q31.2. Structurally, the ''CFTR'' is a type of gene known as an [[ATP-binding cassette transporter genes|ABC gene]]. The product of this gene (the CFTR protein) is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. This protein possesses two [[ATP hydrolysis|ATP-hydrolyzing]] [[Structural domain|domains]], which allows the protein to use energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. It also contains two domains comprising six [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory [[binding site]] on the protein allows activation by [[phosphorylation]], mainly by [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]].<ref name="Rowe" /> The [[C-terminal end|carboxyl terminal]] of the protein is anchored to the [[cytoskeleton]] by a [[PDZ (biology)|PDZ]] domain interaction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Short DB, Trotter KW, Reczek D, Kreda SM, Bretscher A, Boucher RC, Stutts MJ, Milgram SL | display-authors = 6 | title = An apical PDZ protein anchors the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the cytoskeleton | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 31 | pages = 19797–801 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9677412 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.31.19797 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The majority of CFTR in the lung's passages is produced by rare ion-transporting cells that regulate mucus properties.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Travaglini KJ, Krasnow MA | title = Profile of an unknown airway cell | journal = Nature | volume = 560 | issue = 7718 | pages = 313–314 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30097657 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-018-05813-7 | bibcode = 2018Natur.560..313T | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In addition, the evidence is increasing that genetic modifiers besides ''CFTR'' modulate the frequency and severity of the disease. One example is [[mannan-binding lectin]], which is involved in [[innate immunity]] by facilitating [[phagocytosis]] of microorganisms. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in one or both mannan-binding lectin alleles that result in lower circulating levels of the protein are associated with a threefold higher risk of end-stage lung disease, as well as an increased burden of chronic bacterial infections.<ref name=kumar2007/>

===Carriers ===
Up to one in 25 individuals of Northern European ancestry is considered a [[genetic carrier]]. The disease appears only when two of these carriers have children, as each pregnancy between them has a 25% chance of producing a child with the disease. Although only about one of every 3,000 white newborns has CF,  more than 900 mutations of the gene that causes CF are known. Current tests look for the most common mutations.<ref name="Edwards">{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards QT, Seibert D, Macri C, Covington C, Tilghman J | s2cid = 7644129 | title = Assessing ethnicity in preconception counseling: genetics--what nurse practitioners need to know | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 472–80 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15617360 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2004.tb00426.x }}</ref>

The mutations screened by the test vary according to a person's ethnic group or by the occurrence of CF already in the family. More than 10 million Americans, including one in 25 white Americans, are carriers of one mutation of the CF gene. CF is present in other races, though not as frequently as in white individuals. About one in 46 Hispanic Americans, one in 65 African Americans, and one in 90 Asian Americans carry a mutation of the CF gene.<ref name="Edwards"/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:CFTR Protein Panels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The CFTR protein is a channel protein that controls the flow of H<sub>2</sub>O and Cl<sup>−</sup> ions in and out of cells inside the lungs. When the CFTR protein is working correctly, ions freely flow in and out of the cells. However, when the CFTR protein is malfunctioning, these ions cannot flow out of the cell due to a blocked channel. This causes cystic fibrosis, characterized by the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs.]]
[[File:Cysticfibrosis01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4]]
Several mutations in the ''CFTR'' gene can occur, and different mutations cause different defects in the CFTR protein, sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease. These protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function. [[ΔF508|ΔF508-CFTR]], which occurs in >90% of patients in the U.S., creates a protein that does not [[Protein folding|fold]] normally and is not appropriately transported to the cell membrane, resulting in its degradation.

Other mutations result in proteins that are too short (truncated) because [[Translation (genetics)|production]] is ended prematurely. Other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy (in the form of ATP) normally, do not allow chloride, iodide, and thiocyanate to cross the membrane appropriately,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Childers M, Eckel G, Himmel A, Caldwell J | title = A new model of cystic fibrosis pathology: lack of transport of glutathione and its thiocyanate conjugates | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–12 | date = 2007 | pmid = 16934416 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.06.020 }}</ref> and degrade at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced.<ref name="Rowe" />

The protein created by this gene is anchored to the [[cell membrane|outer membrane]] of cells in the [[sweat gland]]s, lungs, pancreas, and all other remaining exocrine glands in the body. 
The protein spans this membrane and acts as a [[Ion channel|channel]] connecting the inner part of the cell ([[cytoplasm]]) to the [[extracellular fluid|surrounding fluid]]. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halide anions from inside to outside of the cell; however, in the sweat ducts, it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat duct into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not resorb ions in sweat ducts, chloride and thiocyanate<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Y, Szép S, Lu Z | title = The antioxidant role of thiocyanate in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and other inflammation-related diseases | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 48 | pages = 20515–9 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19918082 | pmc = 2777967 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0911412106 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10620515X }}</ref> released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin.

Most of the damage in CF is due to blockage of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick feces, etc. Several theories have been posited on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects. The most current theory suggests that defective ion transport leads to dehydration in the airway epithelia, thickening mucus. In airway epithelial cells, the cilia exist in between the cell's apical surface and mucus in a layer known as airway surface liquid (ASL). The flow of ions from the cell and into this layer is determined by ion channels such as CFTR. CFTR not only allows chloride ions to be drawn from the cell and into the ASL, but it also regulates another channel called ENac, which allows sodium ions to leave the ASL and enter the respiratory epithelium. CFTR normally inhibits this channel, but if the CFTR is defective, then sodium flows freely from the ASL and into the cell.

As water follows sodium, the depth of ASL will be depleted and the cilia will be left in the mucous layer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verkman AS, Song Y, Thiagarajah JR | s2cid = 11790119 | title = Role of airway surface liquid and submucosal glands in cystic fibrosis lung disease | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

The presence of the same CFTR proteins in the pancreatic duct and sweat glands in the skin also cause symptoms in these systems.

===Chronic infections===
The lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis are colonized and infected by bacteria from an early age. These bacteria, which often spread among individuals with CF, thrive in the altered mucus, which collects in the small airways of the lungs. This mucus leads to the formation of bacterial microenvironments known as [[biofilm]]s that are difficult for immune cells and antibiotics to penetrate. Viscous secretions and persistent respiratory infections repeatedly damage the lung by gradually remodeling the airways, which makes infection even more difficult to eradicate.<ref name="Saiman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Saiman L | title = Microbiology of early CF lung disease | journal = Paediatric Respiratory Reviews | volume = 5 Suppl A | issue = Suppl A | pages = S367-9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14980298 | doi = 10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6 }}</ref>

Over time, both the types of bacteria and their individual characteristics change in individuals with CF. In the initial stage, common bacteria such as ''S. aureus'' and ''H. influenzae'' colonize and infect the lungs.<ref name=kumar2007/> Eventually, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' (and sometimes ''[[Burkholderia cepacia complex|Burkholderia cepacia]]'') dominates. By 18 years of age, 80% of patients with classic CF harbor ''P. aeruginosa'', and 3.5% harbor ''B. cepacia''.<ref name=kumar2007/> Once within the lungs, these bacteria adapt to the environment and develop [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to commonly used antibiotics. ''Pseudomonas'' can develop special characteristics that allow the formation of large colonies, known as "mucoid" ''Pseudomonas'', which are rarely seen in people who do not have CF.<ref name="Saiman" /> Scientific evidence suggests the [[interleukin 17]] pathway plays a key role in resistance and modulation of the inflammatory response during ''P. aeruginosa'' infection in CF.<ref name="Lorè">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorè NI, Cigana C, Riva C, De Fino I, Nonis A, Spagnuolo L, Sipione B, Cariani L, Girelli D, Rossi G, Basso V, Colombo C, Mondino A, Bragonzi A | display-authors = 6 | title = IL-17A impairs host tolerance during airway chronic infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 25937 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27189736 | pmc = 4870500 | doi = 10.1038/srep25937 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...625937L }}</ref> In particular, interleukin 17-mediated immunity plays a double-edged activity during chronic airways infection; on one side, it contributes to the control of ''P. aeruginosa'' burden, while on the other, it propagates exacerbated pulmonary neutrophilia and tissue remodeling.<ref name="Lorè" />

Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations<ref name=kumar2007/>) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating ([[pilocarpine]]). To deliver the medication through the skin, [[iontophoresis]] is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts of them in their sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and [[hypothiocyanite]] in their saliva<ref name="MinarowskiSands2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Minarowski Ł, Sands D, Minarowska A, Karwowska A, Sulewska A, Gacko M, Chyczewska E | title = Thiocyanate concentration in saliva of cystic fibrosis patients | journal = Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–6 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18519245 | doi = 10.2478/v10042-008-0037-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and mucus (Banfi et al.).

People with CF may be listed in a [[disease registry]] that allows researchers and doctors to track health results and identify candidates for clinical trials.<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Freudenheim M |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22cyst.html|title=Tool in Cystic Fibrosis Fight: A Registry|date=22 Dec 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=21 Dec 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524095423/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22cyst.html|archive-date=24 May 2013|pages=D1}}</ref>

===Prenatal===
Women who are [[pregnant]] or couples planning a pregnancy can have themselves tested for the ''CFTR'' gene mutations to determine the risk that their child will be born with CF. Testing is typically performed first on one or both parents and, if the risk of CF is high, testing on the fetus is performed. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends all people thinking of becoming pregnant be tested to see if they are a carrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Genetics/Carrier-Screening-in-the-Age-of-Genomic-Medicine|title=Carrier Screening in the Age of Genomic Medicine|date=2017|website=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225052721/http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Genetics/Carrier-Screening-in-the-Age-of-Genomic-Medicine|archive-date=25 February 2017|access-date=22 Feb 2020}}</ref>

Because development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the ''CFTR'' gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that parent is a ''CFTR'' gene mutation carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result from more than a thousand different mutations.<ref name="Lancet2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Elborn JS | s2cid = 20948144 | title = Cystic fibrosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10059 | pages = 2519–2531 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27140670 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00576-6 }}</ref> {{as of|2016}}, typically only the most common mutations are tested for, such as ΔF508<ref name=Lancet2016/> Most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations.

During pregnancy, testing can be performed on the placenta ([[chorionic villus sampling]]) or the fluid around the fetus ([[amniocentesis]]). However, chorionic villus sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and amniocentesis of one in 200;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabor A, Philip J, Madsen M, Bang J, Obel EB, Nørgaard-Pedersen B | s2cid = 31237495 | title = Randomised controlled trial of genetic amniocentesis in 4606 low-risk women | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8493 | pages = 1287–93 | date = June 1986 | pmid = 2423826 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(86)91218-3 }}</ref> a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddleman KA, Malone FD, Sullivan L, Dukes K, Berkowitz RL, Kharbutli Y, Porter TF, Luthy DA, Comstock CH, Saade GR, Klugman S, Dugoff L, Craigo SD, Timor-Tritsch IE, Carr SR, Wolfe HM, D'Alton ME | s2cid = 19081825 | display-authors = 6 | title = Pregnancy loss rates after midtrimester amniocentesis | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 1067–72 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17077226 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000240135.13594.07 }}</ref>

Economically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when comparing [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age around 40 years, after which NC, prenatal testing, and abortion have higher economic benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis LB, Champion SJ, Fair SO, Baker VL, Garber AM | title = A cost-benefit analysis of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 1793–804 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19439290 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.053 }}</ref>

==Management==
While no cures for CF are known, several treatment methods are used. The management of CF has improved significantly over the past 70 years. While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Recent advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that individuals with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of [[respiratory tract infection|airway infection]], and encouragement of good nutrition and an active lifestyle. [[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] as a management of CF continues throughout a person's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life. At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function. Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the [[reproductive organs]] (including [[assisted reproductive technology]]), and psychological support.<ref name="Davies"/>

The most consistent aspect of therapy in CF is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining [[quality of life]]. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]], [[inhalation|inhaled]], and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. These therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming. [[Oxygen therapy]] at home is recommended in those with significant low oxygen levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayes D, Wilson KC, Krivchenia K, Hawkins SM, Balfour-Lynn IM, Gozal D, Panitch HB, Splaingard ML, Rhein LM, Kurland G, Abman SH, Hoffman TM, Carroll CL, Cataletto ME, Tumin D, Oren E, Martin RJ, Baker J, Porta GR, Kaley D, Gettys A, Deterding RR | display-authors = 6 | title = Home Oxygen Therapy for Children.

===Antibiotics===
Many people with CF are on one or more antibiotics at all times, even when healthy, to [[prophylactic]]ally suppress infection. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen, and are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the person's past response. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent [[Heparin lock|IV]] such as a [[peripherally inserted central catheter]]  or [[Port-a-Cath]]. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as [[tobramycin]], [[colistin]], and [[aztreonam]] is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pai VB, Nahata MC | title = Efficacy and safety of aerosolized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis | journal = Pediatric Pulmonology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–27 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11568993 | doi = 10.1002/ppul.1125 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Westerman EM, Le Brun PP, Touw DJ, Frijlink HW, Heijerman HG | title = Effect of nebulized colistin sulphate and colistin sulphomethate on lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis: a pilot study | journal = Journal of Cystic Fibrosis | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–8 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15463883 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcf.2003.12.005 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCoy KS, Quittner AL, Oermann CM, Gibson RL, Retsch-Bogart GZ, Montgomery AB | title = Inhaled aztreonam lysine for chronic airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 178 | issue = 9 | pages = 921–8 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18658109 | pmc = 2577727 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200712-1804OC }}</ref> Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection, but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance, tinnitus, and changes in the voice.<ref name="pmid21412868">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan G, Singh M, Dwan K | title = Inhaled antibiotics for long-term therapy in cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001021 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21412868 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001021.pub2 }}</ref> Inhaled [[levofloxacin]] may be used to treat ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002789/human_med_001846.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124|title=Quinsair (levofloxacin)|website=European Medicines Agency|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226220044/http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages%2Fmedicines%2Fhuman%2Fmedicines%2F002789%2Fhuman_med_001846.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124|archive-date=26 December 2016|access-date=26 Dec 2016}}</ref> The early management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is easier and better, using nebulised antibiotics with or without oral antibiotics may sustain its eradication up to two years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langton Hewer SC, Smyth AR | title = Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = CD004197 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28440853 | pmc = 6478104 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004197.pub5 | url = http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/31685/1/Langton%20Hewer%20Cochrane%202014%20Pseudomonas%20eradication.pdf }}</ref> When choosing antibiotics to treat CF patients with lung infections caused by ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in people with cystic fibrosis, it is still unclear whether the choice of antibiotics should be based on the results of testing antibiotics separately (one at a time) or in combination with each other.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith S, Ratjen F, Remmington T, Waters V | title = Combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing for acute exacerbations in chronic infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | pages = CD006961 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32412092 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006961.pub5 | pmc = 7387858 }}</ref>

For people with [[vitamin E]] deficiency and cystic fibrosis, there is evidence that vitamin E supplementation may improve vitamin E levels, although it is still uncertain what effect supplementation has on vitamin E‐specific deficiency disorders or on lung function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Okebukola PO, Kansra S, Barrett J | title = Vitamin E supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | pages = CD009422 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32892350 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4 | url = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32892350 }}</ref>

===Procedures===
Several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. One technique good for short-term airway clearance is [[Pulmonary hygiene#Conventional Chest physiotherapy|chest physiotherapy]] where a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to loosen up secretions. This "percussive effect" can be administered also through specific devices that use [[chest wall oscillation]] or [[intrapulmonary percussive ventilator]]. Other methods such as [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]], and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.<ref name=War2015/>

Another technique is positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy that consists of providing a back pressure to the airways during expiration. This effect is provided by devices that consists of a mask or a mouthpiece in which a resistance is applied only on the expiration phase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McIlwaine M, Button B, Nevitt SJ | title = Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | issue = 11 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31774149 | pmc = 6953327 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5 }}</ref> Operating principles of this technique seems to be the increase of gas pressure behind mucus through collateral ventilation along with a temporary increase in functional residual capacity preventing the early collapse of small airways during exhalation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen JB, Qvist J, Kann T | title = Recruiting collapsed lung through collateral channels with positive end-expiratory pressure | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Respiratory Diseases | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 260–6 | date = October 1979 | pmid = 392747 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Groth S, Stafanger G, Dirksen H, Andersen JB, Falk M, Kelstrup M | title = Positive expiratory pressure (PEP-mask) physiotherapy improves ventilation and reduces volume of trapped gas in cystic fibrosis | journal = Bulletin Européen de Physiopathologie Respiratoire | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–43 | date = July 1985 | pmid = 3899222 }}</ref>

As lung disease worsens, mechanical breathing support may become necessary. Individuals with CF may need to wear special masks at night to help push air into their lungs. These machines, known as [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BiPAP) ventilators, help prevent low blood oxygen levels during sleep. Non-invasive ventilators may be used during physical therapy to improve sputum clearance.<ref name="Moran2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moran F, Bradley JM, Piper AJ | title = Non-invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD002769 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28218802 | pmc = 6464053 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5 }}</ref> It is not known if this type of therapy has an impact on pulmonary exacerbations or disease progression.<ref name="Moran2017" />  It is not&nbsp;known what role non-invasive ventilation therapy has for improving exercise capacity in people with cystic fibrosis.<ref name="Moran2017" /> However, the authors noted that "non‐invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moran F, Bradley JM, Piper AJ | title = Non-invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD002769 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28218802 | pmc = 6464053 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5 }}</ref> During severe illness, a tube may be placed in the throat (a procedure known as a [[tracheostomy]]) to enable breathing supported by a ventilator.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tracheostomy Why it's used | publisher = NHS | url = https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tracheostomy/why-its-done/ | access-date = 10 May 2020}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Some lung infections require surgical removal of the infected part of the lung.

===Transplantation===
Lung transplantation may become necessary for individuals with CF as lung function and [[Exercise intolerance|exercise tolerance]] decline. Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung might contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung. A pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time to alleviate liver disease and/or diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fridell JA, Vianna R, Kwo PY, Howenstine M, Sannuti A, Molleston JP, Pescovitz MD, Tector AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Simultaneous liver and pancreas transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis | journal = Transplantation Proceedings | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 3567–9 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16298663 | doi = 10.1016/j.transproceed.2005.09.091 }}</ref> Lung transplantation is considered when lung function declines to the point where assistance from mechanical devices is required or someone's survival is threatened.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belkin RA, Henig NR, Singer LG, Chaparro C, Rubenstein RC, Xie SX, Yee JY, Kotloff RM, Lipson DA, Bunin GR | display-authors = 6 | title = Risk factors for death of patients with cystic fibrosis awaiting lung transplantation | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 173 | issue = 6 | pages = 659–66 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16387803 | pmc = 2662949 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200410-1369OC }}</ref> According to [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|Merck Manual]], "bilateral lung transplantation for severe lung disease is becoming more routine and more successful with experience and improved techniques.

Newborns with intestinal obstruction typically require surgery, whereas adults with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome typically do not.

So far, no large-scale research involving the incidence of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[coronary heart disease]] in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely because the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.

Sinus infections are treated by prolonged courses of antibiotics. The development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, and over time reduce the person's sense of smell.

Female infertility may be overcome by [[in vitro fertilisation|assisted reproduction]] technology, particularly [[embryo transfer]] techniques.

==History==
{{See also|List of people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis}}
[[File:Dorothy Hansine Andersen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dorothy Hansine Andersen]] first described cystic fibrosis in 1938.]]

CF is supposed to have appeared about 3,000 BC because of migration of peoples, gene mutations, and new conditions in nourishment.<ref name= Bosch/> Although the entire clinical spectrum of CF was not recognized until the 1930s, certain aspects of CF were identified much earlier. Indeed, literature from Germany and Switzerland in the 18th century warned "''Wehe dem Kind, das beim Kuß auf die Stirn salzig schmeckt, es ist verhext und muss bald sterben''" or "Woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon must die", recognizing the association between the salt loss in CF and illness.<ref name= "Bosch">{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch R | title = On the History of Cystic Fibrosis | journal = Acta Universitatis Carolinae. Medica | volume = 36 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 13–5 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2130674 }}</ref>

In the 19th century, [[Carl von Rokitansky]] described a case of fetal death with [[meconium peritonitis]], a complication of meconium ileus associated with CF. Meconium ileus was first described in 1905 by [[Karl Landsteiner]].<ref name="Bosch" /> In 1936, [[Guido Fanconi]] described a connection between [[celiac disease]], cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and [[bronchiectasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fanconi G, Uehlinger E, Knauer C  | year = 1936 | title = Das coeliakiesyndrom bei angeborener zysticher pankreasfibromatose und bronchiektasien | journal = Wien. Med. WSCHR | volume = 86 | pages = 753–6 }}</ref>

In 1938, [[Dorothy Hansine Andersen]] published an article, "Cystic Fibrosis of the Pancreas and Its Relation to Celiac Disease: a Clinical and Pathological Study", in the ''[[American Journal of Diseases of Children]]''. She was the first to describe the characteristic cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and to correlate it with the lung and intestinal disease prominent in CF.<ref name="andersen" /> She also first hypothesized that CF was a recessive disease and first used pancreatic enzyme replacement to treat affected children.

The first linkage between CF and another marker (Paroxonase) was found in 1985 by [[Hans Eiberg]], indicating that only one locus exists for CF. In 1988, the first mutation for CF, [[Delta-F508|ΔF508]] was discovered by [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], [[Lap-Chee Tsui]], and [[John R. Riordan]] on the seventh chromosome. Subsequent research has found over 1,000 different mutations that cause CF.

Because mutations in the ''CFTR'' gene are typically small, [[classical genetics]] techniques had been unable to accurately pinpoint the mutated gene.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riordan JR, Rommens JM, Kerem B, Alon N, Rozmahel R, Grzelczak Z, Zielenski J, Lok S, Plavsic N, Chou JL | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: cloning and characterization of complementary DNA | journal = Science | volume = 245 | issue = 4922 | pages = 1066–73 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2475911 | doi = 10.1126/science.2475911 | bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1066R }}</ref> Using protein markers, [[gene linkage|gene-linkage]] studies were able to map the mutation to chromosome 7.

===Gene therapy===
[[Gene therapy]] has been explored as a potential cure for CF. Results from clinical trials have shown limited success {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, and using gene therapy as routine therapy is not suggested.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee TW, Southern KW, Perry LA, Penny-Dimri JC, Aslam AA | title = Topical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene replacement for cystic fibrosis-related lung disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD005599 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27314455 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5 | veditors = Southern KW }}</ref> A small study published in 2015 found a small benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alton EW, Armstrong DK, Ashby D, Bayfield KJ, Bilton D, Bloomfield EV, Boyd AC, Brand J, Buchan R, Calcedo R, Carvelli P, Chan M, Cheng SH, Collie DD, Cunningham S, Davidson HE, Davies G, Davies JC, Davies LA, Dewar MH, Doherty A, Donovan J, Dwyer NS, Elgmati HI, Featherstone RF, Gavino J, Gea-Sorli S, Geddes DM, Gibson JS, Gill DR, Greening AP, Griesenbach U, Hansell DM, Harman K, Higgins TE, Hodges SL, Hyde SC, Hyndman L, Innes JA, Jacob J, Jones N, Keogh BF, Limberis MP, Lloyd-Evans P, Maclean AW, Manvell MC, McCormick D, McGovern M, McLachlan G, Meng C, Montero MA, Milligan H, Moyce LJ, Murray GD, Nicholson AG, Osadolor T, Parra-Leiton J, Porteous DJ, Pringle IA, Punch EK, Pytel KM, Quittner AL, Rivellini G, Saunders CJ, Scheule RK, Sheard S, Simmonds NJ, Smith K, Smith SN, Soussi N, Soussi S, Spearing EJ, Stevenson BJ, Sumner-Jones SG, Turkkila M, Ureta RP, Waller MD, Wasowicz MY, Wilson JM, Wolstenholme-Hogg P | display-authors = 6 | title = Repeated nebulisation of non-viral CFTR gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial | journal = The Lancet.

The focus of much CF gene therapy research is aimed at trying to place a normal copy of the ''CFTR'' gene into affected cells. Transferring the normal ''CFTR'' gene into the affected epithelium cells would result in the production of functional CFTR protein in all target cells, without adverse reactions or an inflammation response. To prevent the lung manifestations of CF, only 5–10% the normal amount of CFTR gene expression is needed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramalho AS, Beck S, Meyer M, Penque D, Cutting GR, Amaral MD | s2cid = 8714332 | title = Five percent of normal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mRNA ameliorates the severity of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 619–27 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12397022 | doi = 10.1165/rcmb.2001-0004oc }}</ref> Multiple approaches have been tested for gene transfer, such as liposomes and viral vectors in animal models and clinical trials.

===Gene modulators===
A number of small molecules that aim at compensating various mutations of the ''CFTR'' gene are under development. CFTR [[Gene modulation|modulator therapies]] have been used in place of other types of genetic therapies. These therapies focus on the expression of a genetic mutation instead of the mutated gene itself. Modulators are split into two classes: potentiators and correctors. Potentiators act on the CFTR ion channels that are embedded in the cell membrane, and these types of drugs help open up the channel to allow transmembrane flow. Correctors are meant to assist in the transportation of nascent proteins, a protein that is formed by ribosomes before it is morphed into a specific shape, to the cell surface to be implemented into the cell membrane.<ref name=Ram2019>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramsey BW, Downey GP, Goss CH | title = Update in Cystic Fibrosis 2018 | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 199 | issue = 10 | pages = 1188–1194 | date = May 2019 | pmid = 30917288 | pmc = 6519861 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.201902-0310UP | id = {{proquest|2230820891}} }}</ref>

Most target the transcription stage of genetic expression. One approach has been to try and develop medication that get the ribosome to overcome the [[stop codon]] and produce a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF results from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target [[nonsense mutation]]s such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid [[glycine]] in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome a premature stop codon by inserting a random amino acid, thereby allowing expression of a full-length protein. Future research for these modulators is focused on the cellular targets that can be effected by a change in a gene's expression. Otherwise, genetic therapy will be used as a treatment when modulator therapies do not work given that 10% of people with cystic fibrosis are not affected by these drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dietz HC | s2cid = 5809127 | title = New therapeutic approaches to mendelian disorders | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 9 | pages = 852–63 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20818846 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0907180 }} Free full text</ref>
