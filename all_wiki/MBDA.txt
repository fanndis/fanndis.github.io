The consolidation of Europe's missile companies began in 1996, when parts of [[Matra|Matra Defence]] and [[BAe Dynamics]] merged their missile activities to form Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD). Matra BAe Dynamics represented half of Matra Hautes Technologies' missile business; the other half was Matra Missiles, which became [[Aérospatiale-Matra|Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles]] (AMM). Then, Matra group merged with [[Aérospatiale]] in 1999. In 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra became part of EADS (now [[Airbus]]). {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1998, [[GEC-Marconi|GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems]] and {{ill|Alenia Difesa|it}} combined their missile and radar activities to form [[Alenia Marconi Systems]] (AMS). In 1999 GEC-Marconi (renamed [[Marconi Electronic Systems]]) was sold to British Aerospace and became part of the merged company, BAE Systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://moneyweek.com/417068/30-november-1999-bae-systems-formed-in-7-7bn-merger |title=30 November 1999: BAE Systems formed in £7.7bn merger |last=Judge |first=Ben |date=30 November 2015 |website=moneyweek.com |publisher=Dennis Publishing Ltd |access-date=2020-05-10 |quote=On this day in 1999 British Aerospace merged with Marconi Electronic Systems to form BAE Systems, Europe's biggest defence company and the third biggest in the world.}}</ref>

In December 2001, MBD (including AMM) and the Missile and Missile Systems activities of AMS merged, creating MBDA.<ref>{{cite news|title=EADS, BAE and Finmeccanica Complete MBDA Merger|work=Defense Daily International |date=2001-12-21 }}</ref> In June 2005, [[MBDA Deutschland GmbH|LFK]], a unit of Airbus Defence and Security Systems, agreed to be merged into MBDA. On 1 March 2006, LFK became MBDA Germany. ON 9 May 2012, the LFK-Lenkflugkörpersysteme GmbH became [[MBDA Deutschland GmbH]]. Since February 2002, MBDA has owned 40% of [[Inmize]] Sistemas S.L., a Spanish company which was formed to integrate the experience and technology of the major Spanish defence companies in the guided weapons sector. As AMS had R&D assets located in California, MBDA also managed to acquire development and production facilities in the United States, choosing to operate in the country as a wholly owned subsidiary, called MBDA Inc.<ref name="mbdainc" /> In December 2011, MBDA Inc acquired the [[GBU-44/B Viper Strike|Viper Strike]] activity of [[Northrop Grumman]] in Huntsville, Alabama.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mbda-systems.com/press-releases/mbda-purchases-northrop-grummans-viper-strike-munitions/ |title = MBDA purchases Northrop Grumman's Viper Strike munitions business}}</ref>
