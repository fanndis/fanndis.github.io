==Plot==
Two 14-year-old boys in the [[DeWitt, Arkansas]] area, Ellis and Neckbone, have found a boat stuck high in a tree on a small island in the [[Mississippi River]]. They want to claim it for themselves but discover someone is living in it. They meet the occupant, a strange man named Mud, who claims to have grown up nearby. He tells the boys that he needs food and promises to give them the boat if they help him while he stays on the island.

The boys return with food and ask Mud why he is hiding out; he says he is waiting for his old girlfriend, Juniper, whom he describes as beautiful with [[nightingale]] tattoos on her hands. They later spot her grocery shopping in town. Ellis falls for an older high-school girl named May Pearl.

Ellis learns from his father that his parents are heading for divorce. This threatens their old river [[houseboat]]: if no longer used as a residence by the owner, it will be removed by the River Authority. Later, Ellis and his mother are stopped at a police roadblock; he learns that Mud is a fugitive but tells the police that he has not seen him. Ellis and Neckbone rush back to Mud and ask why the police are hunting him. Mud explains that he killed a man who had gotten Juniper pregnant and pushed her down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose the child. The boys decide to help Mud in exchange for his pistol.

Mud sends Ellis to Tom Blankenship, an older father figure from his childhood, for help. Tom lives across the river from Ellis and agrees to come talk to Mud but is disturbed to hear that Mud is in trouble over Juniper again and refuses to help. After his plea for help is rejected by Tom, Mud gives the boys a note for Juniper. They find her motel room where another man - the brother of the man Mud killed - is abusing her. Ellis charges at the man but is quickly overpowered. Neckbone and Ellis tell Mud about the man. Mud realizes that the family of the man he killed has arrived to kill him.

King (the father of the man Mud murdered) and his surviving son Carver, along with a handful of bounty hunters, stake out Juniper's motel and have paid off officers in local and state police.

Stealing machine parts and an outboard motor from junkyards, the boys help Mud repair the boat. They develop a plan to reunite Juniper with Mud, but after agreeing to meet the boys at her hotel to bring her to him, she doesn't show and instead heads to a bar and flirts with other men. Ellis and Neckbone tell Mud about it and that Juniper didn't want to come.

Ellis brings a note from Mud to Juniper, telling her it's over between them. Although she says she understands, Juniper tells Ellis that Mud is a born liar and she's sick of running away with him. Ellis is dejected, not only because he thought he was helping a couple in love, but furthered by May Pearl's rejection of him in front of her friends and not returning his phone calls.

Upon returning to the island, Ellis angrily calls Mud a liar, says he used the boys to do what he was afraid to do, and turned them into thieves. Running away, Ellis falls into a pit containing [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouths]] and is bitten. Mud jumps in and rescues Ellis. Mud races to get the unconscious Ellis to a clinic on the mainland. Recognizing Mud as the wanted man, one of the hospital employees calls the police who, in turn, tip off Carver.

Mud manages to get back to the island where he and Neckbone get the repaired boat into the water. As they agreed before, Mud gives Neckbone a [[M1911 pistol|Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol]] but without ammunition. Mud wants to say good-bye to Ellis, so Neckbone takes him to the houseboat where he is recovering. While Mud is in Ellis' room, Carver and his posse arrive and start shooting. Tom fires from his boat using his old [[sniper rifle]], killing several attackers from across the river. Mud saves Ellis and tries to get away but is shot as he dives into the river. The police arrive and find all the posse members dead. One trooper calls King to tell him that his other son is now dead. The morning after the shootout, Tom disappears. 

Ellis's parents separate. He and his mother move to an apartment in town and their houseboat is demolished, while his father gets a new job far away. He tells Ellis to take care of his mother as he departs. Ellis sees some attractive older teenage girls in his new neighborhood and smiles. He is uncertain of Mud's fate, but still believes he was protecting Juniper.

Mud is revealed to be alive and recovering on the repaired boat driven by Tom. Many days have passed, and the film ends with them looking ahead at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], and south of that, the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

==Production==
[[Jeff Nichols]] wrote and directed ''Mud'', which was fully financed by Everest Entertainment and produced by Everest and FilmNation Entertainment.<ref name="mcnary">{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | title=Lionsgate, Roadside warm 'Mud' for U.S. | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 16, 2012 }}</ref> Nichols came up with the concept for the film in the 1990s. While still a student, Nichols began developing the story, inspired by [[Mark Twain]]'s works, including the 1876 novel ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer|Tom Sawyer]]''. He also sought to reflect the theme of love: "I wanted to capture a point in my life in high school when I had crushes on girls and it totally broke my heart and it was devastating. I wanted to try and bottle that excitement and that pain and that intensity of being in love and being a teenager."<ref name="mcnary" />

Nichols always had McConaughey in mind, after seeing him in ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/01/21/sundance-matthew-mcconaughey-mud/|title=Sundance 2013: The Rebirth of Matthew McConaughey|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last= Labrecque|first= Jeff|date=January 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="leffler">{{cite journal | last=Leffler | first=Rebecca | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-2012-matthew-mcconaughey-reese-witherspoon-jeff-nichols-mud-329891 | title=Cannes 2012: Jeff Nichols' 'Mud' Slides Into Competition with Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=May 26, 2012 }}</ref> In May 2011, [[Chris Pine]] was first in talks for the lead role.<ref>{{cite news | last=Zeitchik | first=Steven | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/05/jeff-nichols-take-shelter-memento-chris-nolan-pine.html | title=Cannes 2011: Cannes director and 'Memento' producer will collaborate on new film, possibly with Chris Pine | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 15, 2011 }}</ref> McConaughey was cast as Mud the following August and was joined by [[Reese Witherspoon]].<ref name="abrams">{{cite journal | last1=Abrams | first1=Rachel | last2=Sneider | first2=Jeff | title=Thesps wrestle in 'Mud' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 8, 2011 }}</ref> Witherspoon was at the same agency as Nichols, so he was able to approach her for the role of Juniper.<ref name="leffler" />

''Mud''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s cinematographer Adam Stone used a [[Steadicam]] for filming. Stone, who was also cinematographer for Nichols's previous films ''[[Shotgun Stories]]'' and ''[[Take Shelter]]'', said, "If you look at ''Shotgun Stories'', the camera is fairly moored. With ''Take Shelter'', we had a lot more dolly work. In ''Mud'', the camera never really sits still. The locations were either super-remote or really small and cramped, so the Steadicam was the only thing that could get in there."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Debruge | first=Peter | title=10 Cinematographers to Watch: Adam Stone | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 14, 2012 }}</ref> The film was shot on [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[List of motion picture film stocks#VISION3 color negative .28ECN-2 process 2007.E2.80.93present.29|VISION3]] [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] stocks in the [[anamorphic format]] with [[Panavision]] [[anamorphic format#Origination|G-Series]] lenses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Getting Dirty: ''Mud'' embraces authenticity of locations |url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Publications/InCamera/Getting_Dirty_Mud_embraces_authenticity_of_locations.htm |work=[[Eastman Kodak|Kodak InCamera Magazine]] |date=November 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

He said the [[Mississippi River]] in ''Mud'' was "a mythic backdrop... in which old values struggle against stronger modern forces in the world".<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Chang | first1=Justin | last2=Debruge | first2=Peter | title=Cannes conclusions; Variety crix debate whether U.S. pics lived up to potential and what titles stood out at fest | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 29, 2012 }}</ref>
