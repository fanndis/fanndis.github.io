==History==
[[File:Maybelline ad 1920.png|thumb|left|1920 ad for Maybelline.]]
The Maybelline Company was founded in Chicago by [[Thomas Lyle Williams]] in 1915. Williams noticed his older sister Mabel applying a mixture of [[Vaseline]] and coal dust to her eyelashes to give them a darker, fuller look. He adapted it with a chemistry set and produced a product sold locally called Lash-Brow-Ine. Williams renamed his eye beautifier Maybelline in her honor. In 1917, the company produced Maybelline Cake [[Mascara]], "the first modern eye cosmetic for everyday use," and Ultra Lash, the first mass-market automatic, in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Skin Maybelline|url=http://www.cosmeticsandskin.com/companies/maybelline.php|publisher=Cosmetics and skin|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>

In 1967, the company was sold by Williams to Plough Inc. (now Schering-Plough) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The entire cosmetic production facility was moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] over one weekend. In 1975, the company moved to [[Little Rock]], Arkansas, where it is still located. In 1990, [[Schering-Plough]] sold Maybelline to a New York investment firm, [[Wasserstein Perella & Co.]] Maybelline’s headquarters remained in Memphis until its acquisition by [[L'Oréal]] in 1996. Its headquarters was then moved to New York City in 1996 and its factory to [[Brooklyn]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/25880439/Maybelline-India-Strategy |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-02 |archive-date=2010-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509012957/http://www.scribd.com/doc/25880439/Maybelline-India-Strategy |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

Maybelline received a boost when the company hired [[Lynda Carter]] as the company's beauty fashion coordinator after her [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|television series]] ended; she also appeared in several of its television and print advertisements. [[Josie Maran]], [[Miranda Kerr]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Melina Kanakaredes]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Siti Nurhaliza]], [[Fasha Sandha]], [[Sheetal Mallar]], [[Julia Stegner]], [[Jessica White]] and [[Kristin Davis]] have endorsed Maybelline products. The current faces of Maybelline are [[Adriana Lima]], [[Christy Turlington]], [[Charlotte Kemp Muhl]], [[Emily DiDonato]], [[Beatriz Shantal]], [[Jourdan Dunn]], [[Gigi Hadid]],<ref>[http://models.com/Work/maybelline-maybelline-contract-ss-12 Maybelline Contracts SS12]. ''models.com''. Retrieved 2012-07-19.</ref> [[Liza Soberano]] and [[Urassaya Sperbund]]. In 1991, the company adopted its advertising [[slogan]] ''“Maybelline, Maybelline Ooh La La”''<ref>Lowe and Partners (STUART ELLIOTT September 5, 1991 - [https://www.nytimes.com/keyword/maybelline © 2011 The New York Times Company] ) [Retrieved 2012-01-10]</ref> which was used until 2001 when the tagline changed to "(Maybe she’s born with it'') Maybe it’s Maybelline”'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rollwithcarol.com/maybelline-unveils-new-tagline-make-it-happen/|title=Maybelline Unveils New Tagline - Make It Happen!|date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>

==Criticism==
There is reasonable evidence that Maybelline products were tested on animals.<ref>[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] - 501 Front St. - Norfolk, VA. 23510 - 757-622-PETA (7382)
