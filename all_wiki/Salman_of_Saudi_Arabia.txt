'''Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud''' ([[Arabic]]: '''سلمان بن عبد العزیز آل '''سعود ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Salmān ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Su‘ūd}}'', <small>[[Najdi Arabic]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA-ar|sælˈmæːn ben ˈʕæbd ælʕæˈziːz ʔæːl sæˈʕuːd|}}; born 31 December 1935) has been the [[King of Saudi Arabia]] and [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] since 23 January 2015.

He was the deputy governor of [[Riyadh Province|Riyadh]] and later the governor of Riyadh for 48 years from 1963 to 2011. He was then appointed Minister of Defense. He was also named the [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia]] in 2012 following the death of his brother [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]. Salman became King in 2015 following the death of his half-brother, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]]. Following the death of his half-brother [[Mutaib bin Abdulaziz]] in December 2019, he is the oldest surviving son of [[Ibn Saud]].

His major initiatives as king include the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi intervention]] in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)|Yemeni Civil War]], [[Saudi Vision 2030]], and a 2017 decree allowing Saudi women to drive. His son, Crown Prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]], is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Saudi Arabia and has led many reforms within the country, as well as engendering a number of controversies, including the [[2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge|2017 arrest of members of the Saudi royal family]] and the [[Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi|killing of Jamal Khashoggi]].

King Salman also undertook several foreign tours while he was governor. In 1974, he visited [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]] to strengthen Saudi Arabia's relationship with those nations. During his visit to [[Montreal]], Canada in 1991, he inaugurated a gallery. In 1996, he was received in the [[Élysée Palace]] in [[Paris]] by the then-French president [[Jacques Chirac]]. The same year he toured [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to give donations to the Muslim citizens of the country. Being a part of an Asian tour in 1998, Salman visited [[Pakistan]], [[Japan]], [[Brunei]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cafiero|first1=Giorgio|last2=Karasik|first2=Theodore|year=2017|title=King Salman's Return to Brunei Two Decades Later|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-50995-9|journal=IndraStra Global|issue=3|page=5}}</ref> and [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|title=الجولات الخارجية لسلمان.. دعم للعلاقات وتعزيز للرؤية السعودية|url=http://www.al-madina.com/node/386509|work=Al Madina|access-date=14 February 2015}}</ref>

According to the ''Washington Post'', Saudi journalist the late [[Jamal Khashoggi]] "criticized Prince Salman, then governor of Riyadh and head of the Saudi committee for support to the [[mujahideen|Afghan mujahideen]], for unwisely funding [[Salafism|Salafist]] extremist groups that were undermining the war [in Afghanistan against the Soviets]."<ref name="ignatius">{{cite news |title=Jamal Khashoggi's long road to the doors of the Saudi Consulate |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/jamal-khashoggis-long-road-to-the-doors-of-the-saudi-consulate/2018/10/12/b461d6f4-ce1a-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html?noredirect=on |work=The Washington Post |date=12 October 2018}}</ref>

Under Salman, Riyadh became one of the richest cities in the Middle East and an important place for trade and commerce. There were also infrastructural advances including schools, universities and sports stadiums.<ref name="Aawsat"/> About the province, he said:

<blockquote>Every village or town in the Riyadh Region is dear to me, and holds a special place in my heart&nbsp;... I witnessed every step taken by the city of Riyadh, and for this reason it is difficult for me to think about being far away from Riyadh.<ref name="Aawsat"/> </blockquote>

It is speculated that he was placed in the immediate line of succession due to his personal qualities. First, he has a conciliatory and diplomatic nature. He headed the family council, called The Descendants' Council (''Majlis al Uthra'' in Arabic), that was established by King Fahd in 2000 to solve family matters, reach consensus and try to avoid any publicly embarrassing behaviour by some family members.<ref name=tk2712>{{cite web|last=Kapoor|first=Talal|title=Nayif's Passing – The Family Regroups|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=88025|work=Datarabia|access-date=7 July 2012|date=2 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=ata>{{cite journal|author=Amir Taheri|title=Saudi Arabia: Change Begins within the Family|journal=The Journal of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy|year=2012|volume=34|issue=3|pages=138–143|doi=10.1080/10803920.2012.686725|s2cid=154850947}}</ref> Second, Salman belongs to the "middle generation" in the royal family; therefore, he could develop close ties with both generations socially and culturally.

Salman continued the policy of [[Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain|military intervention in Bahrain]], to try to crush the [[Bahrain uprising]].

On 23 January 2015, Salman, aged 79, inherited the throne after his half-brother Abdullah died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 90. The new king issued a statement which read "His Highness Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and all members of the family and the nation mourn [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who passed away at exactly 1 am this morning."

After coming to power, Salman reshuffled the cabinet on 30 January 2015. Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan was made the [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah|intelligence chief]]. [[Prince Bandar bin Sultan]] was removed from his post in the [[Saudi National Security Council|security council]] and the adviser to the monarch was also removed as were the former monarch's sons [[Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud|Turki]] as governor of [[Riyadh]] and [[Mishaal bin Abdullah Al Saud|Mishaal]] as governor of [[Mecca]].

===Early reforms===
One of the first things the King and his son, [[Mohammad bin Salman]], did was to streamline the government bureaucracy. On the death of King Abdullah, there were as many as eleven government secretariats, and all of these were abolished and reconstituted as only two, the [[Council of Political and Security Affairs (Saudi Arabia)|Council of Political and Security Affairs]] (CPSA), headed by Deputy Crown prince [[Mohammed bin Nayef]], and the [[Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)|Council for Economic and Development Affairs]] (CEDA), headed by the Secretary-General of the Royal Court, Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who were given free rein to completely reorganize the government<ref>[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/mohammad-bin-nayef-takes-leading-role-in-saudi-arabia-1.1458374 Mohammad bin Nayef takes leading role in Saudi Arabia] ''Gulf News''. 17 February 2015.

===Yemen military intervention===

In March 2015, the king ordered the bombing of Yemen and [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.<ref>"[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/26/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-airstrikes/ Saudi-led coalition strikes rebels in Yemen, inflaming tensions in region]".
