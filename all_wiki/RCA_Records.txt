'''RCA Records''' (formerly legally traded as the '''RCA Records Label''')<ref>{{cite web |url=https://contracts.onecle.com/artistdirect/rca.collab.1996.11.15.shtml |title=Agreement – RCA Records Label and Artist Direct LLC – Sample Contracts and Business Forms |website=Contracts.onecle.com |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> is an American [[record label]] owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Corporation of America]]. It is one of Sony Music's four flagship labels, alongside RCA's former long-time rival [[Columbia Records]]; also [[Arista Records]], and [[Epic Records]]. The label has released multiple genres of music, including [[pop music|pop]], [[classical music|classical]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[afrobeat music|afrobeat]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Blues music|blues]], [[Jazz music|jazz]], and [[country music|country]].

It was fully acquired by [[Bertelsmann]] in 1986, making it a part of [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (BMG); however, RCA Records became a part of [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]], a merger between BMG and Sony Music, in 2004, and was acquired by the latter in 2008, after the dissolution of Sony BMG and the restructuring of Sony Music. It is the second-oldest record label in American history, after sister label [[Columbia Records]].

==History==
{{for|the label's history before 1929|Victor Talking Machine Company}}

[[File:RCA Records logo.svg|thumb|left|103px|Classic RCA logo, first retired in 1968; revived in 1987 until 2015]]

In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America ([[RCA]]) purchased the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], then the world's largest manufacturer of [[phonograph]]s (including the famous "[[Victor Talking Machine Company#The Victrola and other products|Victrola]]") and [[Gramophone record|phonograph records]] (in [[British English]], "gramophone records"). The company then became '''RCA Victor'''. In absorbing Victor, RCA acquired the [[New World]] rights to the famous [[Nipper]]/"[[His Master's Voice]]" [[trademark]].
In 1931, RCA Victor's British affiliate the [[Gramophone Company]] merged with the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] to form [[EMI]]. This gave RCA head [[David Sarnoff]] a seat on the EMI board.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanjek |first1=Russell |title=American Popular Music and Its Business: The First Four Hundred Years ... |date=July 28, 1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=9780195043112 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzVesnkLEtUC&q=%22david+sarnoff%22%2B+emi+%2B+board&pg=PA119 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

In September 1931, RCA Victor introduced the first 33⅓ rpm records sold to the public, calling them "Program Transcriptions". These used a shallower and more closely spaced implementation of the large "standard groove" found on contemporary 78 rpm records, rather than the "microgroove" used for post-World War II 33⅓ rpm "[[LP record|LP]]" (long play) records. The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edward |first1=David |title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931–33) |url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html |website=bsnpubs.com |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

During the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the "dime store labels" ([[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], etc.). The first was the short-lived "Timely Tunes" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. [[Bluebird Records]] was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for [[Montgomery Ward]] label during the 1930s.

Besides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for [[independent record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality Go Together at RCA Records |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22rca+custom%22%2B+leading&pg=PA26 |website=via Google |publisher=Billboard (archived ad) |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |date=October 6, 1958}}</ref> RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for [[The Reader's Digest Association]].

RCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |title=RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (19501976) |first=Ron |last=Penndorf |work=RECOLLECTIONS: Fine Vintage LPs and Journal of Recorded Music |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111011131/http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===World War II era===
During World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate [[JVC]] were severed. JVC's record company is known today as [[Victor Entertainment]] and still retains the [[Nipper]]/[[His Master's Voice]] trademark for use in Japan.

From 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] [[1942–44 musicians' strike|recording ban]]. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. However, RCA Victor lost the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when [[Columbia Records]] settled with the union before RCA, [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.

===The post-war 1940s===
[[File:Down Yonder.jpg|thumb|right|Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of [[World War II]] until 1954]]
In the spring of 1946, "RCA Victor" replaced "Victor" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] micro-grooved [[vinylite]] record, marketed simply as the "45". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.<ref>{{Citation|title=McCullers, Carson, (Mrs Carson Smith McCullers), (19 Feb. 1917–29 Sept. 1967), Author|date=2007-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u50658|work=Who Was Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2020-11-29}}</ref> By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33⅓&nbsp;rpm microgroove vinyl "[[LP record|LP]]" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival [[Columbia Records]] in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on "midnight blue" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was "PeeWee the Piccolo" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Indiana University|first=Indiana Geological and Water Survey|date=2019-02-04|title=Waters of Indiana|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14434/ijes.v1i0.26753|journal=Indiana Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=1|doi=10.14434/ijes.v1i0.26753|issn=2642-1550}}</ref> The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty [[shellac]] compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dawson, Jim and |first1=Propes, Steve |title=45 Rpm: The History, Heroes and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0879307579 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiA-6xfdqC0C&q=rca+45+rpm+record+player+1949&pg=PA24 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

RCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78&nbsp;rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some "[[extended play]]" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] disc featuring [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave]]'' and [[Ketèlbey]]'s ''[[In a Persian Market]]''. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]], which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive "side breaks", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78&nbsp;rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc "album" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.

===The 1950s===
Finally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein |publisher=Musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 7, 1950 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of ''[[Gaîté Parisienne]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]], played by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], which had actually been recorded in [[Boston]]'s [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix "LPM". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix "LSC". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix "LSP". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973.

In the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: [[Groove Records|Groove]], [[Vik Records|Vik]] and "X".

The edition of ''Billboard'' magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label “X”; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label "X" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an [[R&B]] specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/labelX.html |title=Label "X" |year=2005 |first=JC |last=Marion |journal=Jamm Upp |volume=2 |issue=36}}</ref> the Vik label was discontinued the following year.

From the label's beginnings in 1902, and intensifying through the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in direct competition with [[Columbia Records]]. A number of recordings were made with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of [[acoustic recording]]s, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the [[Symphony of the Air]]. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under contracts.

On October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of [[George Enescu]]'s ''[[Romanian Rhapsodies (Enescu)#Rhapsody No. 1 in A major|Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1]]'' and the waltz from [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with [[Pierre Monteux]] conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Charles Münch]], in a performance of ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and [[Guido Cantelli]] respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under [[Fritz Reiner]]. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30&nbsp;inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300–3 one-half inch machine, running at 15&nbsp;inches per second (which was later increased to 30&nbsp;inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the "Living Stereo" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.<ref>''The History of Living Stereo'', RCA Victor liner notes</ref> Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building [[Webster Hall]] into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.

In September 1954, RCA Victor introduced "Gruve-Gard" where the center and edge of a record are thicker
than the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clint |last=Hough |url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/60trivia/60trivia.htm |title=Bringing on back the good times |publisher=Sixties City |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.

In 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of [[Elvis Presley]] from [[Sun Records]] for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956.

Effective in 1957, EMI/HMV ended its 55-year association with RCA Victor, after EMI's acquisition of [[Capitol Records]] in 1955.<ref name="Inc.1956">{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |date=17 March 1956 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=14– |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name="MartinHornsby1994">{{cite book |author1=Sir George Martin |author2=Jeremy Hornsby |title=All You Need Is Ears: The Inside Personal Story of the Genius who Created The Beatles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yoio9MewhcC&pg=PA84 |date=15 October 1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-11482-4 |pages=84– }}</ref> Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in the Western Hemisphere; RCA Victor began distributing its recordings through [[Decca Records]] in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights to in the U.K.
RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=325592 |publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |title=Trade Mark Details as at 13 November 2012: Case details for Trade Mark 325592 |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite magazine |title=British RCA to Cut Decca Ltd.

RCA Victor issued several spoken word albums in the 1950s and 60s, notably the soundtracks of the films ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=37444 |title=Richard III (1955) – Soundtrack details |publisher=SoundtrackCollector.com |date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Taming_Of_The_Shrew_The_Various_Artists__5870576 |title=Taming Of The Shrew, The &nbsp;– Various Artists : Read reviews and compare prices at Ciao.co.uk |publisher=Cd.ciao.co.uk |date=July 26, 1999 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref> as well as complete versions of the [[National Theatre of Great Britain]] stage productions of ''[[Othello]]'' (starring [[Laurence Olivier]]) and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (starring [[Maggie Smith]], who also played Desdemona in the Olivier ''Othello''). None of these albums have appeared on compact disc, but the films of ''Richard III'', ''A Man For All Seasons'', ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and the filmed version of Olivier's ''Othello'' have all been issued on DVD.

===The 1960s===
In 1960, RCA Victor announced the Compact 33 double extended play and singles; these were 7 inch records, which played at 33 1/3 rpm. In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megocollector.com/elvis-presley/33-rpm-7-elvis-presley/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-33-record/ |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact 33 Record |publisher=Megocollector.com |date= December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 1963, RCA Victor introduced [[Dynagroove]] which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970.

In September 1965, RCA and [[Learjet|Lear Jet Corp.]] teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges ([[Stereo 8]]) which were first used in the 1966 line of [[Ford]] automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.)

In 1968, the [[RCA Corporation]] modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters 'RCA' in block, modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, 'Victor' now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark was seen only on the album covers of [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975–76).

In late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as [[Dynaflex (RCA)|Dynaflex]]. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Dynaflex – RCA's 1970s ultra-thin vinyl |url=http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2008/01/dynaflex---rcas-1970s-ultra-th.php |website=www.currybet.net |publisher=Martin Belam |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

===The 1970s===
[[File:RCA Records, Harry Nilsson - Nilsson Schmilsson.jpg|thumb|right|Platinum record of album ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'', featuring the 1968–75 Orange RCA Victor label]]
In April 1970, RCA Records announced the first [[quadraphonic]] 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges ("Quad-8", later called just Q8). RCA began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became "Quadradisc". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a ±1&nbsp;db frequency response out to 50&nbsp;kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30&nbsp;kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4–4–4 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4–2–4 matrix system. The [[Warner Music Group]] labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for [[matrix decoder#Dolby MP matrix encoding (2:4)|Dolby encoding]] (same as [[Peter Scheiber]]'s original matrix system) and released on CD. This included [[Charles Gerhardt (conductor)|Charles Gerhardt]]'s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], [[Max Steiner]], [[Franz Waxman]], and others, performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and recorded in London's [[Kingsway Hall]].

In order to publish music in Japan, RCA collaborated with the Victor Company of Japan's publishing wing Victor Musical Industries Inc. in 1975 to found Japanese record label RVC.<ref>{{Cite web|title=RVC Corporation|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/40355-RVC-Corporation|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref>

Beginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, [[RCA Victrola|Victrola]], [[RCA Red Seal|Red Seal]] and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as [[T-shirts]], posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks.

===The 1980s===
In 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International.<ref name="bertelsmann.com">{{citation |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media}}</ref> The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by [[General Electric]] (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann. The company was renamed [[BMG Music]] for Bertelsmann Music Group.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22rca+records%22+%2B+%22general+electric%22&pg=PP1 |title=RCA Deal Gives Bertelsmann Multinational Label Ranking |first=Mike |last=Hennessey |authorlink=Mike Hennessey |journal=Billboard |volume=98 |issue=3B |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=September 20, 1986 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> BMG revived the old RCA "lightning bolt" logo that was retired in 1968 to differentiate RCA Records from the other RCA divisions, which GE either liquidated, sold, or closed. BMG also revived the "RCA Victor" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.

During the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to "overpriced deals" with pop stars including [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and [[Jive Records]], whose roster included [[Schooly D]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].

By the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' sold more than three million albums, and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]'', composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million. Among the most successful acts for RCA Records during the 1980s were the [[Eurythmics]], [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], [[Joshua Perahia]], [[Rick Astley]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Juice Newton]], and [[Bucks Fizz]].<ref name="LA Times 1980s">{{cite news |last1=Knoedelselder, Jr. |first1=William |title=Rap On RCA Records: The Original U.S. Record Company Is Back In Groove |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-18/business/fi-3214_1_rca-records |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 1998}}</ref><ref name="RCA Hit Men">{{cite book |last1=Dannen |first1=Frederic |title=Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business |date=July 2, 1991 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679730613 |page=260 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oa97Z7pOWPYC&q=Bob+Buziak++President+of+RCA+Records+US+1986&pg=PA260 |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref>

===The 1990s===
In August 1990 Buziak was replaced by [[Joe Galante]], who had been the president of RCA Records Nashville division. The roster was cut once again and the A&R department was restructured. Along with the launch of BNA Records and the expansion of the urban music division, these initiatives would prove to be positive, but RCA was unsuccessful under Galante, ranking 10th in market share in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |last1=New York Times staff |title=New Chief at RCA Records |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/09/business/new-chief-at-rca-records.html |accessdate=August 15, 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 9, 1990}}</ref><ref name="Newman Billboard">{{cite magazine |last1=Newman |first1=Melinda |title=Novik Knows the Score in RCA's New Talent Drive |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRAEAAAAMBAJ&q=dave+novik+rca+1992&pg=PA10 |accessdate=August 15, 2015 |magazine=Billboard|date=November 28, 1992}}</ref><ref name="Jamieson billboard">{{cite magazine |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Don |title=Jamieson Named RCA President After 7 Month Search|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AsEAAAAMBAJ&q=RCA+records+galante+1995+market+share&pg=PA4-IA1 |accessdate=August 15, 2015 |magazine=Billboard |date=April 8, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Haring |first1=Bruce |title=RCA prexy gives Nipper something to bark about |url=https://variety.com/1993/music/news/rca-prexy-gives-nipper-something-to-bark-about-106821/|accessdate=August 15, 2015 |magazine=Variety |date=May 13, 1993}}</ref> Galante returned to head the Nashville division and was replaced in March 1995 by the president of RCA Records Canada, Bob Jamieson.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Chuck |title=Company Town: BMG Names Insider to Head RCA Records |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-28/business/fi-47871_1_rca-records |accessdate=August 16, 2015 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 28, 1995}}</ref> Jamieson overhauled RCA, eliminating a layer of middle management and retooling the label's marketing department. The A&R department was again restructured and the artist roster cut.

By the close of the decade, RCA Records had undergone what ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described as a "remarkable turnaround" with the success of artists including [[Britney Spears]], [[The Dave Matthews Band]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[The Verve Pipe]], [[Robyn]], [[SWV]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[NSYNC]], and [[Foo Fighters]]. A distribution deal with [[Loud Records]] yielded hit records from urban artists including [[Big Punisher]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Mobb Deep]].<ref name="Retooled RCA">{{cite magazine |last1=Baumgartner |first1=Bradley |title=Retooled RCA Is Once Again A Hitmaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQ4EAAAAMBAJ&q=Billboard+RCA+jamieson+rovner&pg=PA86 |accessdate=August 16, 2015 |magazine=Billboard |date=May 23, 1998}}</ref>

===The 2000s===
In 2002, BMG fully acquired [[J Records]], which it had founded in 2000 as a joint venture with [[Clive Davis]].

[[Legacy Recordings]], Sony Music Entertainment's catalog division, reissues classic albums for RCA.

In April 2008, former Zomba Label Group president and CEO [[Barry Weiss]] was appointed chairman of the BMG Label Group, and Davis was named chief creative officer of Sony BMG worldwide. In October, Sony acquired BMG's 50% ownership and the [[BMG Label Group]] was merged with the Jive Label Group to establish the [[RCA/Jive Label Group]].

In May 2011, [[Doug Morris]] was appointed chairman of [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment]]. Focused on A&R, Morris named J/RCA A&R president [[Peter Edge]] chairman and CEO of RCA Music Group.

==Broadway and Hollywood==
RCA Victor has produced several notable Broadway cast albums, among them the original Broadway recordings of ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'', the [[Mary Martin]] ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Damn Yankees (musical)|Damn Yankees]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at [[Lincoln Center]], such as the 1966 revivals of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', the 1987 revival of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and the 1998 Broadway revivals of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star [[Ethel Merman]], who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American [[Decca Records]] contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by [[Dinah Shore]]. RCA Victor was also responsible for the [[film soundtrack]] albums of ''Damn Yankees'', ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (1963 film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The album made from the 1965 hit [[Julie Andrews]] film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', made by [[Colgems Records]], was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.

Similarly, RCA Victor also made several [[Studio recording|studio cast recording]] albums, including a [[Lerner and Loewe]] series with [[Jan Peerce]], [[Jane Powell]], and [[Robert Merrill]], as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', with its 1952 revival leads, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of ''Show Boat'', one with Robert Merrill, [[Patrice Munsel]], and [[Rise Stevens]] in 1956, and the other with [[Howard Keel]], [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]] in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these ''Show Boat'' albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.

In 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new [[Masterworks Broadway Records]]. All of these recordings are now on [[Masterworks Broadway Records]], which has remastered and reissued many of these albums.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Kelly Clarkson===
In the summer of 2007, [[Kelly Clarkson]] and Clive Davis, then head of [[Sony BMG]], feuded publicly regarding the direction of her album ''[[My December]]'', the follow-up to Clarkson's multi-platinum album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. Clarkson wrote the songs on ''My December'', "showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on "polished, radio-friendly songs". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007. It has since been certified platinum.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524077/kelly-clarkson-worth-american-idol-contract |title=Now Free From Her Idol Contract, What's Kelly Clarkson Worth? |magazine=Billboard |date=April 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Benjamin |first=Jeff |url=http://www.fuse.tv/2015/03/kelly-clarkson-kept-it-so-real-best-moments |title=9 Times Kelly Clarkson Kept it Real |publisher=Fuse |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Du Lac |first1=J.

===Avril Lavigne===

===Kenny Rogers===
After [[Kenny Rogers]] left the label, he accused RCA for trying to ruin his career.

===Other notable events===
[[File:Rachmaninoff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s studio master recordings were believed destroyed in the demolition of RCA Victor's Camden warehouse]]
In the early 1920s, Victor was slow about getting deeply involved in recording and marketing black jazz and vocal blues. By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bennie Moten]], [[Duke Ellington]] and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 "Hot Dance" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 "race" ([[race records]]) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elvispresleymuseum.com/RCA_Victor.html |title=RCA Victor |work=elvispresleymuseum |access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] warehouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/label/rca_victor |title=Label: RCA Victor |publisher=RateyourMusic.com}}</ref> This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by [[Enrico Caruso]]; why [[Rachmaninoff]]'s apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a ''Time'' magazine article.
