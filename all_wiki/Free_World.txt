More broadly, it has also been used{{by whom?|date=September 2020}} to refer to all [[Communist state| non-communist]] countries. It has traditionally primarily been used{{by whom?|date=September 2020}} to refer to the countries allied and aligned with the [[United States of America | United States]] and to those affiliated with international organizations such as the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and the [[European Union]] (EU). Critics have pointed out the contradiction between the use of the term and the fact of its being applied to all NATO members - even at times when some of them were ruled by military dictatorships (such as [[Turkish coup d'état |Turkey]], [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974 |Greece]], and [[Estado Novo (Portugal) |Portugal]]) as well as to various anti-Communist dictatorial regimes closely allied to the US.

==Origins==
{{See also|Allies of World War II|Participants in World War II}}
During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] viewed themselves as opposing the oppression and [[fascism]] of the [[Axis powers]], thus making them "free". Following the end of World War II, the [[Cold War]] conception of the "Free World" included only anti-communist states as being "free", particularly capitalist states which were said to have [[free speech]], a [[freedom of the press|free press]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

In World War II, the term ''free world'' was used to refer to the nations fighting against the Axis Powers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Masur |first=Salim |title=Churchill's lessons for a modern world |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=29 May 2010 |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/salim_mansur/2010/05/28/14176341.html |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> During World War II the term ''free countries'' was used to identify the western allies. During the Cold War, the term referred to the allies of the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In both cases, the term was used for propaganda purposes.

During the Cold War, many neutral countries, either those in what is considered the [[Third World]], or those having no formal alliance with either the United States or the [[Soviet Union]], viewed the claim of "Free World" leadership by the United States as grandiose and illegitimate.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wills |first=Garry |title=Bully of the Free World |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |date=March–April 1999 |pages=50–59 |doi=10.2307/20049208|jstor=20049208 }}</ref> The phrase has also been used in an ironically negative manner, usually in an anti-US context, by those who do not approve of either [[United States foreign policy]] or despise the United States as a whole.

One of the earliest uses of the term ''Free World'' as a politically significant term occurs in [[Frank Capra|Frank Capra's]] World War II [[propaganda film]] series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. In ''[[Prelude to War]]'', the first film of that series, the "free world" is portrayed as a white planet, directly contrasted with the black planet called the "slave world". The film depicts the free world as the Western Hemisphere, led by the United States and Western Europe, and the slave world as the Eastern Hemisphere, dominated by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

==21st century usage==
While "Free World" had its origins in the [[Cold War]], the phrase is still occasionally used after the end of the Cold War and during the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Left Alone by Its Owner, Reddit Soars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/business/media/reddit-thrives-after-advance-publications-let-it-sink-or-swim.html | work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-09-02 |quote=If the leader of the free world stops by to answer questions from your users, you're probably doing O.K. |accessdate=2012-09-02}}</ref> [[Samuel P. Huntington]] said the term has been replaced by the concept of the [[international community]], which, he argued, "has become the euphemistic collective noun (replacing "the Free World") to give global legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States and other Western powers."<ref>Huntington, Samuel P. The Clash of Civilizations, 72 Foreign Aff. 22 (1992–1993)</ref>

==Leadership of the Free World==

===United States===
[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, 1989 official portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[George H. W. Bush]], the [[President of the United States]] during the [[Fall of Communism]], was widely described in American media as the "Leader of the Free World."{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} After Bush's presidency the term largely fell out of use.]]
The "Leader of the Free World" was a [[colloquialism]], first used during the Cold War, to describe either the [[United States]] or, more commonly, the [[President of the United States]]. The term when used in this context suggested that the United States was the principal democratic [[superpower]], and the US president was by extension the leader of the world's democratic states, i.e. the "Free World".

{{quote box
 |quote  = But remember, we have differences with our allies all over the world. They are family differences, and sometimes they are acute, but, by and large, the reason we call in the "free world" is because each nation in it wants to remain independent under its own government and not under some dictatorial form of government.

The phrase has its origin in the 1940s during the [[Second World War]], especially through the [[anti-fascist]] [[Free World (magazine)|''Free World'' magazine]] and the US [[propaganda film]] series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. At this time, the term was criticized for including the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), which critics saw as a totalitarian dictatorship. However, the term became more widely used against the USSR and its allies during the 1950s in the [[Cold War]] era, when the US depicted a foreign policy based on a struggle between "a democratic alliance and a communist realm set on world domination", according to ''[[The Atlantic]]''.<ref name="The Atlantic Trump">Tierney, Dominic (January 24, 2017). [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/trump-free-world-leader/514232/ "What Does It Mean That Trump Is 'Leader of the Free World'?"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]''.</ref> The term here was criticised again for including right-wing dictatorships such as [[Francoist Spain]], and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in the [[21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party]] that "the so-called free world constitutes the kingdom of the dollar".<ref name="The Atlantic Trump" /><ref name="Safire2008">William Safire. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA265 Safire's Political Dictionary]''. Oxford University Press; 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534334-2}}. p. 265.</ref>

Although in decline after the mid-1970s,<ref name="The Atlantic Trump" /> the term was heavily referenced in US foreign policy up until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991. After the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]] the term has largely fallen out of use, in part for  its usage in rhetoric critical of US policy.<ref>{{cite book |title=To Lead the Free World |author=John Fousek |year=2000 |publisher=UNC Press Books |page=130 |isbn=0-8078-2525-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGGGt-ui9sgC&pg=PA130}}</ref>

Terms implying a leadership role in the "free world" later came to be used for other persons, places, or nations.

===European Union=== 
In 2010, upon an address to the [[plenary chamber]] of the [[European Parliament]], US Vice President [[Joe Biden]], stated that [[Brussels]] had a "legitimate claim" to the title of "capital of the free world", normally a title reserved for Washington. He added that Brussels is a "great city which boasts 1,000 years of history and serves as capital of Belgium, the home of the [[European Union]] and the [[NATO headquarters|headquarters]] of [[NATO]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/justice/30025|title=Biden sweet-talks MEPs on anti-terrorism deal|access-date=2017-05-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/washdc_20100506.html|title=2010 News from Washington|agency=Embassy of the United States Bosnia & Herzegovina|website=sarajevo.usembassy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216192220/http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/washdc_20100506.html|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
