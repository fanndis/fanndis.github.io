{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face, speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.<ref>''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}</ref> However, due to the evolution of public speaking, it is modernly viewed as any form of speaking (formally and informally) between an audience and the speaker.  Traditionally, public speaking was considered to be a part of the art of persuasion. The act can accomplish particular purposes including to inform, to persuade, and to entertain. Additionally, differing methods, structures, and rules can be utilized according to the speaking situation.

Public speaking was developed in Rome and Greece. Prominent thinkers from these lands influenced the development and evolutionary history of public speaking. Currently, technology continues to transform the art of public speaking through newly available technology such as videoconferencing, multimedia presentations, and other nontraditional forms.

==Uses==
Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or encouraging people. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain.  Knowing when public speaking is most effective and how it is done properly are key to understanding the importance of it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McCornack and Ortiz |first=Steven and Joseph |title=Choices & Connections: An Introduction to Communication |year=2017}}</ref>

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world. In fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.<ref>Schreiber, Lisa.

Although there is evidence of public speech training in ancient [[Egypt]],<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Womack |first1=Morris M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obsSAQAAMAAJ&q=egypt |title=Speech for Foreign Students |last2=Bernstein |first2=Elinor |date=1990 |publisher=C.C.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks. |access-date=June 12, 2017}}</ref> the first known piece<ref>Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref> on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from [[ancient Greece]]. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one who first recorded the teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who were notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]  developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

===Rome===

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking was seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

==Historical speeches==
{{see also|List of speeches}}

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied years after their delivery. Among these examples are:
*[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BC addressing those who died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]
*Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863
*Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]"
*Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.<ref>German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.</ref>

==Women and public speaking==
{{Tone|section|date=December 2018}}
{{globalize|section|date=August 2020}}
Between 18th and 19th century USA, women were publicly banned from speaking in the courtroom, the senate floor, and the pulpit.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Mankiller |first=Wilma Pearl |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618001828 |title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History |year=1998 |isbn=978-0585068473 |url-access=registration}}</ref>{{Pages needed|date=December 2018}} It was also deemed improper for a woman to be heard in a public setting.

==Techniques and trainings==

Effective public speaking can be developed by joining a club such as [[Australian Rostrum|Rostrum]], [[Toastmasters International]], [[Association of Speakers Clubs]] (ASC), or [[Speaking Circles]], in which members are assigned exercises to improve their speaking skills. Members learn by observation and practice, and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions followed by new public speaking exercises. These include:
* Oratory
* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]
* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])
* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice
* Speaking notes, pitches
* Using [[humor]]
* Developing a relationship with the audience
* "Show of Hands Method" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)
* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery
* Effective Introduction
*Efforts to Reach Hearts
*Effective use of questions
The new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Glossophobia==
{{see also|Glossophobia}}
A common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, "stage fright"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason= Ungrammatical sentence}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking |title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic? |last=Black |first=Rosemary |date=2018-06-04 |website=psycom.net |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>

==Modern==

===Technology===
[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]
New technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,<ref>[[TED (conference)]]</ref> which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gallo |first=Carmine |title=Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1466837270}}</ref> These audiences can be watching from all around the world. [[YouTube]] is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves. Audiences are able to watch these videos for all types of purposes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anderson |first=Chris |title=TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2016}}</ref>

Multimedia presentations can contain different video clips, sound effects, animation, laser pointers, remote control clickers and endless bullet points.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ridgley |first=Stanley K. |title=The Complete Guide to Business School Presenting: What your professors don't tell you... What you absolutely must know |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012}}</ref>  All adding to the presentation and evolving our traditional views of public speaking.

Public speakers may use [[audience response systems]]. For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].

These new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.

===Telecommunication===
[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

===Notable modern theorists===
*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"
