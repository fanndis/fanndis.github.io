'''''Maclean's''''' is a Canadian [[news magazine]] that was founded in 1905, reporting on Canadian issues such as politics, pop culture, and current events. Its founder, publisher [[John Bayne Maclean]], established the magazine to provide a uniquely Canadian perspective on current affairs and to "entertain but also inspire its readers". Its publisher since 1994 (after acquiring Maclean-Hunter Publishing), [[Rogers Media]] announced in September 2016 that ''Maclean's'' would become a monthly beginning January 2017, while continuing to produce a weekly issue on the Texture app.<ref name="rogers.com">{{cite press|url=https://about.rogers.com/cnwposts/rogers-media-unveils-new-magazine-content-strategy/|title=Rogers Media Unveils New Magazine Content Strategy{{snd}} About Rogers|publisher=}}</ref>
In 2019, the magazine was bought by its current publisher, [[St. Joseph Communications]].<ref name=sjctgam>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-toronto-life-owner-st-joseph-communications-to-buy-rogers-magazines/ "Toronto Life owner St. Joseph Communications to buy Rogers magazines"].

==History==
''The Business Magazine'' was founded in October 1905 by then 43-year-old publisher and entrepreneur [[lieutenant colonel|Lt.-Col.]] [[John Bayne Maclean]], who wrote the magazine's aim was not "merely to entertain but also to inspire its readers". It was renamed ''The Busy Man's Magazine'' in December 1905, and began providing "uniquely Canadian perspective" on varied topics such as immigration, national defence, home life, women's suffrage, and fiction. Maclean renamed the magazine after himself in 1911, dropping the previous title as too evocative of a business magazine for what had become a general interest publication.<ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/about-macleans/macleans-the-first-100-years/ Maclean's: The First 100 Years] Aston, S. and Ferguson, S. ''Maclean's''</ref>

Maclean hired [[Thomas B. Costain]] as editor in 1914. Costain invigorated the magazine's coverage of the [[First World War]], running first-person accounts of life on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and critiques of Canada's war effort that came into conflict with wartime censorship regulations. Costain was ordered to remove an article by Maclean himself as it was too critical of war policy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Costain encouraged literary pieces and artistic expressions and ran fiction by [[Robert W. Service]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], and [[O. Henry]]; commentary by [[Stephen Leacock]] and illustrations by [[C. W. Jefferys]], [[F. S. Coburn]], and several [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] members, including [[A. J. Casson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[J. E. H. MacDonald]].<ref>Aston, Suzy and Ferguson, Sue.

In 1919, the magazine moved from monthly to fortnightly publication and ran an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] of the drug trade by [[Emily Murphy]]. In 1925 the circulation of the magazine was 82,013 copies.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Mary|last=Vipond|title=Canadian Nationalism and the Plight of Canadian Magazines in the 1920s|journal=The Canadian Historical Review|date=March 1977|volume=58|issue=1|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/570471/pdf|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> Costain left the magazine to become a novelist and was replaced by [[J. Vernon Mackenzie]] who remained at the helm until 1926. During his tenure, ''Maclean's'' achieved national stature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

After Mackenzie, [[H. Napier Moore]] became the new editor. An Englishman, he saw the magazine as an expression of Canada's role in the [[British Empire]]. Moore ultimately became a figurehead with the day-to-day running of the magazine falling to managing editor [[W. Arthur Irwin]], a Canadian nationalist, who saw the magazine as an exercise in nation-building, giving it a mandate to promote national pride. Under Irwin's influence, the magazine's covers promoted Canadian scenery and imagery. The magazine also sponsored an annual short story contest on Canadian themes and acquired a sports department. Irwin was also responsible for orienting the magazine towards both small and big "L" [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberalism]].

During the [[Second World War]], ''Maclean's'' ran an overseas edition for Canadian troops serving abroad. By the time of its final run in 1946, the "bantam" edition had a circulation of 800,000. ''Maclean's'' war coverage featured war photography by [[Yousuf Karsh]], later an internationally acclaimed portrait photographer, and articles by war correspondents John Clare and [[Lionel Shapiro]].

Irwin officially replaced Moore as editor in 1945, and reoriented the magazine by building it around news features written by a new stable of writers that included [[Pierre Berton]], [[W. O. Mitchell]], [[Scott Young (writer)|Scott Young]], [[Ralph Allen (journalist)|Ralph Allen]], and [[Blair Fraser]].

Allen became editor upon Irwin's acceptance of a diplomatic posting in 1950. This era of the magazine was noted for its articles on the Canadian landscape and profiles of town and city life. The feature article, "Canada's North", by [[Pierre Berton]], promoted a new national interest in the Arctic. Prominent writers during this period included [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]], [[Peter Gzowski]], [[Peter C. Newman]], [[Trent Frayne]], [[June Callwood]], [[McKenzie Porter]], [[Robert Thomas Allen]] and [[Christina McCall]]. Exposés in the 1950s challenged the criminal justice system, explored [[LSD]], and [[artificial insemination]].

''Maclean's'' published an editorial the day after the [[1957 Canadian federal election|1957 federal election]] announcing the predictable re-election of the [[Louis St. Laurent|St. Laurent]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. Written before the election results were known, Allen failed to anticipate the upset election of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] under [[John Diefenbaker]].

The magazine struggled to compete with television in the 1960s by increasing its international coverage and attempting to keep up with the [[sexual revolution]] through a succession of editors including Gzowski and [[Charles Templeton]]. Templeton quit after a short time at the helm due to his frustration with interference by the publishing company, [[Maclean-Hunter]].

In 1961, ''Maclean's'' began publishing a French-language edition, ''Le Magazine Maclean'', which survived until 1976, when the edition was absorbed by ''[[L'actualité]]''.

Peter C. Newman became editor in 1971, and attempted to revive the magazine by publishing feature articles by writers such as [[Barbara Frum]] and [[Michael Enright (broadcaster)|Michael Enright]], and poetry by [[Irving Layton]]. [[Walter Stewart (journalist)|Walter Stewart]], correspondent and eventually [[managing editor]] during this period, often clashed with Newman. In 1975 Newman brought in columnist [[Allan Fotheringham]]. Fotheringham made famous ''The Back Page'', where he wrote for 27 years. Readers would go to read the Back Page first and then proceed to read the magazine from back to front.

Under Newman, the magazine switched from being a monthly general interest publication to a bi-weekly news magazine in 1975, and to a weekly newsmagazine three years later. The magazine opened news bureaus across the country and international bureaus in London, England, and Washington, D.C..{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1982, when Newman retired, his managing editor, Kevin Doyle, became editor-in-chief. Doyle, a former reporter for ''The Canadian Press'' in Ottawa and a New York-based writer for ''Newsweek'', expanded coverage of news and opened a Moscow bureau. On his watch the magazine published the first of yearly annual polls by Allan Gregg on the Canadian condition and the controversial university ranking issue, which became an annual mini-franchise for the magazine. At its peak, the magazine had 2.3&nbsp;million weekly readers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/kevin-doyle-macleans-chief-raised-the-bar-for-canadian-journalism/article24950800/|title=Kevin Doyle: Maclean’s chief raised the bar for Canadian journalism|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/remembering-macleans-editor-kevin-doyle-1943-2015/|title=Remembering Maclean's editor Kevin Doyle, 1943-2015|website=www.macleans.ca}}</ref>

When Doyle left ''Maclean's'' in 1993, publisher Brian Segal appointed Robert Lewis as editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/former-macleans-editor-robert-lewis-named-new-canadian-journalism-foundation-chair-508301231.html|title=Former Maclean's editor Robert Lewis named new Canadian Journalism Foundation chair|website=www.newswire.ca|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}</ref> The managing editor under Doyle, Lewis had opened the magazine's Ottawa bureau in 1975 when it became a newsmagazine.

===21st century===
In 2001, [[Anthony Wilson-Smith]] became the 15th editor in the magazine's history. He left the post at the end of February 2005 and was replaced by [[Kenneth Whyte]], who also served as the magazine's publisher. The magazine was owned by the [[Rogers Communications]] conglomerate since Rogers acquired [[Maclean-Hunter]], the former publisher, in 1994 until 2019.<ref>[http://www.rogerspublishing.ca/about_us/company_profile.shtml Company Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228160435/http://www.rogerspublishing.ca/about_us/company_profile.shtml |date=December 28, 2013 }} rogerspublishing.ca</ref>

Whyte, who previously edited ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]'', brought a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] focus to the magazine, bringing in conservative columnist [[Mark Steyn]], hiring [[Andrew Coyne]] away from the ''Post'', and rehiring [[Barbara Amiel]]. He also added a comedy feature by former [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] strategist Scott Feschuk, and a column by [[Andrew Potter]], who previously wrote for left-leaning periodicals.

The magazine has 15 editions in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=K. Acheson|author2=C.

Rogers Communications announced in September 2016 that due to falling print ad revenue the magazine is to change its printing schedule from weekly to monthly beginning in January 2017 although it will continue to offer weekly digital editions via Rogers' ''Texture'' digital bundle.<ref name="thestar.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/09/30/rogers-to-stop-print-editions-of-four-magazines.html|title=Maclean’s among magazines hit by Rogers media overhaul |website=thestar.com}}</ref>

On September 26, 2010, Quebec [[Premier]], [[Jean Charest]], wrote a letter to the editor of ''Maclean's'' condemning the magazine's "twisted form of journalism and ignorance", calling it "[[sensationalist]]", "far from serious", "simplistic", and "offensive", saying the editor "discredited" the magazine.<ref name=hamilton/><ref name=charest>Raw Document: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/read-jean-charests-letter-to-macleans-magazine/article1735452/?from=1735380 Read Jean Charest's letter to Maclean's magazine.] ''The Globe and Mail''.

September 29, 2010. Retrieved December 22, 2010</ref> In an example of the [[law of unintended consequences]], the controversy has had an unexpected benefit for the [[Quebec Liberal Party|Quebec Liberal]] Government: [[Opposition (parliamentary)|The Opposition]] in the [[Quebec National Assembly]] had been demanding that Premier Charest create "a public inquiry into allegations of corruption and collusion in Quebec's construction industry".<ref name=hamilton/> However, seeing the ''Maclean's'' article as an attack from outside the province, an attack from English Canada, and "with their [Quebec's] acute sensitivity to criticism coming from outside the province, many in the province's media and political classes have shifted their attention from the Premier to the mischievous Toronto-based magazine".<ref name=hamilton/> Thus, his letter to the editor of ''Maclean's'' posits Charest as "the defender of Quebecers in their 400-year struggle to preserve their culture and language. His letter demands that Maclean's apologize for publishing 'a simplistic and offensive thesis that Quebecers are genetically incapable of acting with integrity'."<ref name=hamilton/>

In an editorial dated September 29, 2010, the magazine refused to back away from its position vis-à-vis corruption in Quebec.<ref name=hamilton/> In the English-language magazine's bilingual editorial, the editorial board says that Charest's response to the ''Maclean's'' article was an attempt to "implicate ordinary citizens in a scandal created by [its] politicians.

''[[Macleans|Maclean's]]''. September 29, 2010. Retrieved January 4, 2011</ref> Notwithstanding this assertion, ''Maclean's'' acknowledged "that neither its cover story nor an accompanying column provided empirical evidence that Quebec is more corrupt than other provinces".<ref name=hamilton/> This is not, however, a retreat from its contention that Quebec is the most corrupt province, given that the editorial board goes further, saying <blockquote>It's true that we lack a statistical database to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Quebec is an outlier among the provinces. But that does not mean we are required to suspend all judgment in the face of a preponderance of evidence—scandal after scandal at every level of government in the province, all of them involving not just one or two bad actors but [[systemic corruption]].<ref name=editorial/></blockquote> ''Maclean's'' editors also note that "none of our critics has mounted a credible case that any other province better deserves the title of worst in class".<ref name=editorial/> Moreover, not all opinion in Quebec runs contrary to ''Maclean's'' position. The French-language ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', the province's leading broadsheet, wrote that "[''Maclean's''] claim that Quebec has a higher number of scandals is 'undeniable'."<ref name=editorial/> Rhéal Séguin, writing in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', notes that the English-language ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', however, is of the opposite opinion, editorializing that "Maclean's is wrong. It didn't come close to making its case."<ref name=seguin/>

Despite the steadfast position of ''Maclean's'' editorial board, the magazine's publisher has issued a qualified apology. On September 30, 2010, referring to the controversy, [[Brian Segal]], the president of [[Rogers Communications#Publishing|Rogers Publishing]], apologized for "any offence that the cover may have caused", saying the province "is an important market for the company and we look forward to participating in the dynamic growth of the province and its citizens".<ref>"[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/30/c6718.html Rogers Publishing comments on the recent issue of Maclean's Magazine]", ''[[Canada Newswire]]''.

==''Guide to Canadian Universities''==

The ''Maclean's Guide to Canadian Universities'' is published annually in March. It is also known as ''Maclean's University Guide''. It includes information from the Maclean's University Rankings, an issue of the magazine proper that is published annually in November, primarily for students in their last year of high school and entering their first year in Canadian universities. Both the ''Guide'' and the rankings issue feature articles discussing [[Canadian universities]] and ranking them by order of quality. The rankings focus on taking a measure of the "undergraduate experience",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/865429/maclean-s-unveils-its-21st-annual-university-rankings|title=Maclean's – Maclean's unveils its 21st annual University Rankings|work=newswire.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/our-18th-annual-rankings/|title=Maclean's 2008 University Rankings – Macleans.ca|first=Mary|last=Dwyer|work=Maclean's}}</ref><ref name="macleans.ca">{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20031106_133202_2948 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205234751/http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20031106_133202_2948 |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> comparing universities in three peer groupings: Primarily Undergraduate, Comprehensive, and Medical Doctoral.

Schools in the Primarily Undergraduate category are largely focused on undergraduate education, with relatively few graduate programs. Comprehensives have a significant amount of research activity and a wide range of graduate and undergraduate programs, including professional degrees. Medical Doctoral institutions have a broad range of PhD programs and research, as well as medical schools.

In early 2006, ''Maclean's'' announced that in June 2006, it would be introducing a new annual issue called the University Student Issue. The issue would feature the results of a survey of recent university graduates from each Canadian university. However, many universities, such as the [[University of Calgary]], [[McMaster University]], and the [[University of Toronto]], refused to take part in this exercise. The three institutions stated that they questioned the "magazine's ability to conduct a survey that would be rigorous and provide accurate and useful information to students and their parents".<ref>"[http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3960 Universities opt out of Maclean's graduate survey]", ''McMaster Daily News''. April 19, 2006. Retrieved May 6, 2009</ref> In response, ''Maclean's'' sought the results of two university-commissioned student surveys: the Canadian Undergraduate Survey Consortium (CUSC) and the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).<ref>Farran, Sandy.

For the November 2006 University Rankings issue, 22 Canadian universities refused to provide information directly to ''Maclean's''. To rank those universities, the magazine relied on data it collected itself, as well as data drawn from third party sources such as [[Statistics Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Among the universities that refused to provide information directly to ''Maclean's'' in the fall of 2006 were: [[University of British Columbia]], [[University of Toronto]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[McMaster University]], [[University of New Brunswick]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Université du Québec|Université du Québec network]], [[Simon Fraser University]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Lethbridge]], [[Ryerson University]], [[Université de Montréal]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[York University]], [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Lakehead University]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[Carleton University]], and [[University of Windsor]]. The withholding of data served as a means of voicing the universities' displeasure with the methodology used to determine the ''Maclean's'' ranking.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/11-universities-bail-out-of-maclean-s-survey-1.570771 11 universities bail out of Maclean's survey].

The University Rankings Issue contains a compilation of different charts and lists judging the different aspects of universities in different categories. The three main areas listed in chart form in the University Rankings Issue as at November 3, 2006, are: the overall rankings themselves, the university student surveys, and the magazine's "national reputational rankings" of the schools.

The National Reputational Rankings, like the main university rankings, are broken into three subcategories: medical doctoral, comprehensive, and primarily undergraduate and are based on opinions of the quality of the universities. The quality opinions gathered were contributed by secondary school principals, guidance counsellors, organization and company heads, and recruiters. The results of the reputational rankings are included in the main university rankings, and account for 16% of a university's total ranking score.
