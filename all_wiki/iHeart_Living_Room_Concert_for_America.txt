The '''iHeart Living Room Concert for America''' was a concert special held on March 29, 2020 by [[iHeartMedia]] in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; to provide relief and support to the public in an effort to combat the spread of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] virus. The special aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and was simulcast across their [[Fox Corporation#Assets|sister cable networks]], along with a number of [[iHeartRadio]] broadcast [[radio station]]s and within its mobile app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9345995/iheart-living-room-concert-for-america-recap|title=iHeart Living Room Concert For America: Here&#39;s What Happened|date=March 29, 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref>

==Overview==
The concert was hosted by [[Elton John]], and it served as a partial replacement for the original timeslot for the [[2020 iHeartRadio Music Awards]], which was initially delayed to a later date and later cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=MyOhMy>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9345919/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-my-oh-my-concert-for-america|title=Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes Perform &#39;My Oh My&#39; at Concert for America|date=2020-03-29|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9438948/2020-iheartradio-music-awards-cancelled|title=iHeartRadio Music Awards Canceled For 2020 -- But Winners Will Still Be Announced|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Grein|first=Paul|date=August 24, 2020|accessdate=September 2, 2020}}</ref> It also served as a benefit for [[Feeding America]] and the First Responders Children's Foundation.<ref name=NY>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-elton-john-iheart-living-room-concert-benefit-20200329-2zrto2ab2jbnbk76ttiq7jrohi-story.html|title=How to catch Sunday’s iHeart Living Room concert hosted by Elton John|first=Theresa|last=Braine|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref> The entire production utilized [[videotelephony|video conferencing and video apps]] from each artist and band who appeared to compile the special.

John, himself, volunteered to host the special, despite not having a piano in his [[Los Angeles]] home. Originally, Fox and iHeart were in talks with an undisclosed comedian to host the special, but it fell through.<ref name=ConcertSecrets />

It initially saw donations of nearly $8 million (and counting) raised for the charities.<ref name=viewergood /> This was credited from not only numerous fan contributions, but also $500,000 from corporate partner [[Procter & Gamble]], which Fox matched, and also additional funds raised by Fox employees and corporate partner [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].<ref name=viewergood /> It was later reported that special eventually raised more $10 million for the charities as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/03/29/elton-john-living-room-concert-features-mariah-carey-others-home/2937777001/|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|title=Elton John's 'Living Room Concert for America' performance will re-air on Fox this Monday|publisher=USA Today|date=2020-04-03|accessdate=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/elton-john-living-room-coronavirus-concert-benefit-encore/|title=Elton John's Living Room Coronavirus Benefit Concert Raises $10 Million, to Reair on Fox Monday|first=Amanda|last=Bell|publisher=TV Guide|date=2020-04-05|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>
