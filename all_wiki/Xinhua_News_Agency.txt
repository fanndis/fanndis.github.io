Xinhua operates more than 170 foreign [[news bureau|bureaux]] worldwide and maintains 31 bureaux in China—one for each [[Administrative divisions of China|province]], [[Administrative divisions of China|autonomous region]] and [[Administrative divisions of China|directly administered municipality]]  plus a [[People's Liberation Army|military bureau]]. Xinhua is a major channel for the distribution of [[news]] related to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and Chinese central government and its headquarters in [[Beijing]] are strategically located close to the central government's headquarters at [[Zhongnanhai]].

The news agency has faced criticism of spreading pro-CCP propaganda, as well as spreading [[disinformation]] about people or movements critical of the CCP, such as the [[2019-2020 Hong Kong protests]].

Xinhua is a publisher as well as a news agency—it owns more than 20 [[newspaper]]s and a dozen [[magazine]]s and it publishes in several languages, besides Chinese, including English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Japanese and Korean.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Scholars have noted that Xinhua tailors its pro-CCP message to the nuances of each audience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brazys|first=Samuel|last2=Dukalskis|first2=Alexander|date=October 2020|title=China’s Message Machine|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/766184|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=Volume 31}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Red China News Agency building.png|thumb|Building of Red China News Agency in 1937]]
{{Politics of China |expanded = Publicity }}
The predecessor to Xinhua was the Red China News Agency ({{zh |t = 紅色中華通訊社 |p = Hóngsè Zhōnghuá Tōngxùnshè |labels = no }}), founded in November 1931 as the Chinese [[Communist-controlled China (1927–1949)|Soviet Zone]] of [[Ruijin]], Jiangxi province. It mostly republished news from its rival [[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] (CNA) for party and army officials. The agency got its name of Xinhua in November 1935, at the end of the [[Long March]] which relocated the Communists from [[Jiangxi]] to [[Shaanxi]]. By the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, Xinhua's ''[[Reference News]]'' not only translated CNA news from the [[Kuomintang]], but also international news from agencies like [[TASS]] and [[Havas]]. Xinhua first started using [[letterpress printing]] in 1940.<ref name="Xia">{{cite book |title = A Discourse Analysis of News Translation in China |first = Liang |last = Xia |publisher = Routledge |year = 2019 |pages = 26–27 }}</ref>

During the [[Pacific War]] the agency developed overseas broadcasting capabilities and established its first overseas branches.<ref name="pares" /> It began broadcasting to foreign countries in English from 1944. In 1949, Xinhua followed a subscription model instead of its previous limited distribution model.<ref name="Xia" /> In the direct aftermath of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the agency represented the [[People's Republic of China]] in countries and territories [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|with which it had no diplomatic representation]], such as [[British Hong Kong]].<ref name="pares">Pares, Susan. (2005). A political and economic dictionary of East Asia. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-258-9}}</ref> In 1956, Xinhua began reporting on anti-Marxist and other opinions critical of the party. In 1957, Xinhua switched from a journal format to a newspaper format.<ref name="Xia" />

The agency was described by media scholars as the "eyes and tongue" of the Party, observing what is important for the masses and passing on the information.<ref>Malek, Abbas & Kavoori, Ananadam. (1999). The global dynamics of news: studies in international news coverage and news agenda. p.&nbsp;346. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|978-1-56750-462-0}}.</ref> A former Xinhua director, Zheng Tao, noted that the agency was a bridge between the Party, the government and the people, communicating both the demands of the people and the policies of the Party.<ref>Markham, James. (1967) Voices of the Red Giants. Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.</ref> ''People's Daily'', for example, uses Xinhua material for about a quarter of its stories.

In 2018, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] ordered the state-run Xinhua to register as [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|foreign agents]] to combat Chinese [[propaganda]] operations among other activities.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-has-ordered-key-chinese-state-media-firms-to-register-as-foreign-agents-1537296756 |title = Justice Department Has Ordered Key Chinese State Media Firms to Register as Foreign Agents |website = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date = September 18, 2018 |access-date = September 21, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190418152242/https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-has-ordered-key-chinese-state-media-firms-to-register-as-foreign-agents-1537296756 |archive-date = April 18, 2019 |url-status = live }}</ref>

== Reach ==
Xinhua delivers its news across the world in eight languages: Chinese, English, Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and Japanese, as well as news pictures and other kinds of news. It has made contracts to exchange news and news pictures with more than eighty foreign news agencies or political news departments. Xinhua is also responsible for handling, and in some cases, censoring reports from foreign media destined for release in China.<ref>[[Charles Glasser]]. (2009). International Libel and Privacy Handbook: A Global Reference for Journalists, Publishers, Webmasters, and Lawyers. Bloomberg Press. {{ISBN|978-1-57660-324-6}}</ref> By 2010, the agency had begun converging its news and electronic media coverage and increasing its English coverage through its wire service. The same year, Xinhua acquired commercial real estate on New York's Times Square and started an English-language satellite news network.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704334604575339281420753918 |journal = The Wall Street Journal |first = Anton |last = Troianovski |title = China Agency Nears Times Square |date = June 30, 2010 |access-date = August 8, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171010123512/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704334604575339281420753918 |archive-date = October 10, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>

=== Internal media ===
The [[Internal media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese media's internal publication system]], in which certain journals are published exclusively for government and party officials, provides information and analysis which are not generally available to the public. The State values these internal reports because they contain much of China's most sensitive, controversial, and high-quality [[investigative journalism]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mattis|first=Peter|date=August 18, 2015|title=A Guide to Chinese Intelligence Operations|work=War on the Rocks|url=https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/a-guide-to-chinese-intelligence-operations/|access-date=October 27, 2020}}</ref>

Xinhua produces reports for the "internal" journals. Informed observers note that journalists generally like to write for the internal publications because they can write less polemical and more comprehensive stories without making the omissions of unwelcome details commonly made in the media directed to the general public. The internal reports, written from a large number of countries, typically consist of in-depth analyses of international situations and domestic attitudes towards regional issues and perceptions of China.<ref name=lamp>Lampton, David (2001). The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy in the Era of Reform, 1978–2000: 1978–2000. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-4056-2}}</ref>

The Chinese government's internal media publication system follows a strict hierarchical pattern designed to facilitate party control. A publication called ''Reference News''—which includes translated articles from abroad as well as news and commentary by Xinhua reporters—is delivered by Xinhua personnel, rather than by the national mail system, to officials at the working level and above. A three-to-ten-page report called Internal Reference (''Neibu Cankao'') is distributed to officials at the ministerial level and higher. One example was the first reports on the [[SARS]] outbreak by Xinhua which only government officials were allowed to see.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', "[http://www.economist.com/node/16379897 Chinese whispers: Not believing what they read in the papers, China's leaders commission their own ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012072309/http://www.economist.com/node/16379897 |date=October 12, 2010 }}", June 19, 2010, p. 43.</ref> The most classified Xinhua internal reports are issued to the top dozen or so party and government officials.<ref>[http://news.sohu.com/20130123/n364379833.shtml 解密中国特色的“内参”：直抵政治局 能量巨大] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128190557/http://news.sohu.com/20130123/n364379833.shtml |date=January 28, 2018 }}.

== Headquarters and regional sectors ==
[[File:Xinhua News Agency Dar es Salaam Bureau.jpg|thumb|left|Bureau in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]].]]
The Xinhua headquarters is located in [[Beijing]], strategically located in close proximity to Zhongnanhai, which houses the headquarters of the CCP, the General Secretary, and the State Council. The Xinhua News Agency established its first overseas affiliate in 1947 in London, with Samuel Chinque as publisher. Now it distributes its news in Asia, Middle East, Latin America, Africa through more than 150 affiliates,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/10584609.2011.572487|title = From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978|journal = Political Communication|volume = 28|issue = 3|pages = 377–393|year = 2011|last1 = Hong|first1 = Junhao|s2cid = 143208781}}</ref> with regional headquarters in [[Hong Kong]], [[Moscow]], [[Cairo]], [[Brussels]], [[New York City]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Nairobi]], plus a [[United Nations]] bureau.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Hong Kong ===
Xinhua's branch in Hong Kong was not just a press office, but served as the [[de facto embassy|''de facto'' embassy]] of the PRC in the territory when it was under [[British Hong Kong|British administration]]. It was named a news agency under the special historic conditions before the territory's sovereignty was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transferred from Britain to China]], because the People's Republic did not recognise British sovereignty over the colony, and could not set up a consulate on what it considered to be its soil.<ref>[http://www.hkjournal.org/archive/2011_fall/5.htm The Long History of United Front Activity in Hong Kong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129012715/http://hkjournal.org/archive/2011_fall/5.htm |date=January 29, 2016 }}, ''Hong Kong Journal'', Cindy Yik-yi Chu, July 2011</ref>

Despite its unofficial status, the directors of the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch included high-ranking former diplomats such as [[Zhou Nan]], former Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, who later negotiated the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on the future of Hong Kong.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1533506/poet-diplomat-zhou-nan-takes-aim-occupy-central 'Poet diplomat' Zhou Nan takes aim at Occupy Central] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022163834/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1533506/poet-diplomat-zhou-nan-takes-aim-occupy-central |date=October 22, 2015 }}, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', June 16, 2014</ref> His predecessor, [[Xu Jiatun]], was also vice-chairman of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee]], before fleeing to the [[United States]] in response to the military crackdown on the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]], where he went into exile.<ref name=":1" /><ref>[http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/02/22/Chinas-ex-proxy-in-Hong-Kong-fired-for-betrayal/7866667198800/ China's ex-proxy in Hong Kong fired for 'betrayal'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510090726/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/02/22/Chinas-ex-proxy-in-Hong-Kong-fired-for-betrayal/7866667198800/ |date=May 10, 2017 }}, ''[[UPI]]'', February 22, 1991</ref>

== Criticisms and controversies ==
=== Overview ===
==== Political bias, censorship, and disinformation ====
In 2005, [[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters Sans Frontieres]] called Xinhua "The World's Biggest Propaganda Machine", pointing out that Xinhua's president held the rank of a minister in the government. The report further stated that the news agency was “at the heart of censorship and disinformation put in place” by the government.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2005-09-30|title=Xinhua: the world's biggest propaganda agency|url=https://rsf.org/en/reports/xinhua-worlds-biggest-propaganda-agency|access-date=2020-06-15|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/xinhua-china-s-news-agency-and-propaganda-tool/story-fI5Wdbm6IBRqm2BIquzg9K.html|title=Xinhua, China's news agency and 'propaganda tool'|date=2016-07-25|work=www.hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817123723/http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/xinhua-china-s-news-agency-and-propaganda-tool/story-fI5Wdbm6IBRqm2BIquzg9K.html|archive-date=August 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview with the [[Times of India]], then Xinhua president Tian Congming affirmed the problem of "historical setbacks and popular perceptions".<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-09-28/edit-page/27989156_1_india-and-china-xinhua-countries Q&A: 'Our credibility is doubted to a certain degree'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023143558/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-09-28/edit-page/27989156_1_india-and-china-xinhua-countries |date=October 23, 2012 }}, [[Times of India]], September 28, 2007.</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' criticized Xinhua as "being best known for its blind spots" regarding controversial news in China, although the article acknowledges that "Xinhua's spin diminishes when the news doesn't involve China".<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/03/is-china-s-xinhua-the-future-of-journalism.html |title = Is China's Xinhua the Future of Journalism? |author = Fish, Isaac Stone |author2 = Dokoupil, Tony |date = September 3, 2010 |access-date = September 5, 2010 |work = Newsweek |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100904121459/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/03/is-china-s-xinhua-the-future-of-journalism.html |archive-date = September 4, 2010 |url-status = live }}</ref>

During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Xinhua was slow to release reports of the incident to the public. However, its reporting in the aftermath of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] was seen as more transparent and credible as Xinhua journalists operated more freely.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200805/s2247472.htm?tab=latest Quake coverage 'testing China's media credibility'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604102224/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200805/s2247472.htm?tab=latest |date=June 4, 2009 }}, [[Radio Australia]], May 16, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.newser.com/story/27382/quake-moves-xinhua-past-propaganda.html Quake Moves Xinhua Past Propaganda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122042541/http://www.newser.com/story/27382/quake-moves-xinhua-past-propaganda.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}, Newser, May 13, 2008</ref> After the [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire]], cognizant of Xinhua's "tardy" reporting in contrast to bloggers, China announced the investment of 20 billion yuan to Xinhua.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} The vice president of the CCP's [[China International Publishing Group]] commented on this, saying that quantity of media exposure would not necessarily help perceptions of China.

==== 1968 industrial espionage allegations ====
During the [[May 68]] events in France, Xinhua and PRC embassy press office staff were accused of exploiting civil unrest to undertake [[industrial espionage]] at French factories.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Faligot|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rverDwAAQBAJ|title=Chinese Spies: From Chairman Mao to Xi Jinping|date=May 2019|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-1-78738-096-7|pages=192, 276|language=en|oclc=1099591263|author-link=Roger Faligot}}</ref>

==== 1989 student movement ====
Xinhua staff struggled to find the "right line" to use in covering the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]]. Although more cautious than ''People's Daily'' in its treatment of sensitive topics during that period – such as how to commemorate reformist Communist Party leader [[Hu Yaobang]]'s April 1989 death and then ongoing demonstrations in Beijing and elsewhere – Xinhua gave some favorable coverage to demonstrators and intellectuals supportive of the movement. Conflict between journalists and top editors over the censorship of stories about the Tiananmen Square crackdown lasted for several days after the military's dispersal of demonstrators on June 4, with some journalists going on strike and demonstrating inside the agency's Beijing headquarters. Government oversight of the media increased after the protests – top editors at the agency's bureaux in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were replaced with appointees who were [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing]].<ref>Li, Jinquan & Lee, Chin-Chuan.

{{See also|Stereotypes of South Asians}}
During the [[2017 China–India border standoff]], Xinhua's English-language [[new media]] program ''The Spark'' released a [[satirical]] video named the "Seven Sins of [[India]]" on August 16, 2017, where presenter Di'er Wang spoke of Indians having "thick skin" and "pretending to sleep" on the matter of the border dispute. Wang went on to claim India was physically threatening [[Bhutan]], and compared India to a "robber who breaks into a house and does not leave".  An actor in the video portraying "India" with a [[turban]], [[beard]] and accent sparked allegations of [[Cultural racism|racism]] and [[anti-Indian sentiment]]. The video has received strong backlash on Twitter as well as from Indian and Western media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/indiachina-border-dispute-bizarre-video-mocks-new-delhi-with-racist-stereotype/news-story/d3599532ebd57586a6625c9cb9ca1bb5|title=7 Sins of India: China's bizarre video attack over border dispute|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906143213/http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/indiachina-border-dispute-bizarre-video-mocks-new-delhi-with-racist-stereotype/news-story/d3599532ebd57586a6625c9cb9ca1bb5|archive-date=September 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/chinese-media-mocks-india-with-racist-video-on-doklam-standoff/1/1027600.html|title=Chinese media mocks India with racist video on Doklam standoff|access-date=2017-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910212113/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/chinese-media-mocks-india-with-racist-video-on-doklam-standoff/1/1027600.html|archive-date=September 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shanghaiist.com/2017/08/17/india-seven-sins.php|title=WATCH: Xinhua attacks India with racist propaganda video on Doklam border dispute|last=Linder|first=Alex|website=Shanghaiist|access-date=2017-08-17|date=August 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820103413/http://shanghaiist.com/2017/08/17/india-seven-sins.php|archive-date=August 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/chinese-media-xinhua-mocks-indians-and-pm-narendra-modis-policies-in-racist-video.html|title=Chinese media Xinhua mocks Indians and PM Narendra Modi's policies in racist video|last=Chandran|first=Nyshka|date=2017-08-17|access-date=2017-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817122438/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/chinese-media-xinhua-mocks-indians-and-pm-narendra-modis-policies-in-racist-video.html|archive-date=August 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/chinese-media-xinhua-mocks-indians-and-pm-narendra-modis-policies-in-racist-video.html|title=Chinese media Xinhua mocks Indians and PM Narendra Modi's policies in racist video|first=Nyshka|last=Chandran|date=August 17, 2017|website=www.cnbc.com|access-date=September 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817122438/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/chinese-media-xinhua-mocks-indians-and-pm-narendra-modis-policies-in-racist-video.html|archive-date=August 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an investigative report on social media promotions, alleging that the US-based company Devumi was providing "[[Twitter]] followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online." The article goes on to allege an unnamed Xinhua editor was among the many celebrities and organizations implicated in a transaction with Devumi, in which the company boosted the news agency's English-language Twitter account with followers and retweets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html|title=The Follower Factory|website=New York Times|date=January 27, 2018|access-date=January 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128063031/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html|archive-date=January 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Cooperation with Associated Press ====
In November 2018,  Xinhua News Agency and the [[Associated Press]] (AP) of the United States signed an memorandum of understanding to expand cooperation with the U.S. news service, which worried some lawmakers in the US congress, demanding AP to release the text of its memorandum of understanding with Xinhua. In response, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said to the ''Washington Post'' that AP's agreement with Xinhua is to allow it to operate inside China and has no bearing on AP's independence. Xinhua has no access to AP's sensitive information and no influence over AP's editorial products.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rogin |first1=Josh |title=Congress demands answers on AP's relationship with Chinese state media |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/24/congress-demands-answers-aps-relationship-with-chinese-state-media/ |access-date=December 27, 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=December 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226133434/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/24/congress-demands-answers-aps-relationship-with-chinese-state-media/ |archive-date=December 26, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
