'''Henry Louis''' "'''Skip'''" '''Gates Jr.''' (born September 16, 1950) is an American [[literary critic]], [[teacher]], [[historian]], [[filmmaker]] and [[public intellectual]] who serves as the [[Alphonse Fletcher]] University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at [[Harvard University]]. He rediscovered the earliest African-American novels, long forgotten, and has published extensively on appreciating [[African-American literature]] as part of the [[Western canon]].

In addition to producing and hosting previous series on the history and genealogy of prominent American figures, since 2012 Gates has been host of the television series ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'' on [[PBS]]. It combines the work of expert researchers in genealogy, history, and genetics historic research to tell guests about their ancestors' lives and histories.

==Early life and education==
Gates was born in [[Keyser, West Virginia]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/06/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|title=Henry the first|author=[[Maya Jaggi]]|work=The Guardian|date=July 6, 2002|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> to Henry Louis Gates Sr. (c.1913–2010) and his wife Pauline Augusta (Coleman) Gates (1916–1987). He grew up in neighboring [[Piedmont, West Virginia|Piedmont]]. His father worked in a paper mill and moonlighted as a janitor, while his mother cleaned houses, as described in his memoir ''Colored People'' (1994).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Louis-Gates-Jr|title=Henry Louis Gates, Jr. – Biography, Books, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

Gates learned through research that his family is descended in part from the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]].<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzWnSM7TxNE|title=African American Lives The Past Is Another Country 2 4of4 – YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-09-21}}</ref> He has also learned that he has 50% European ancestry, including Irish forebears; he was surprised his European ancestry turned out to be so substantial. Having grown up in an African-American community, however, he identifies as black. He has learned that he is also connected to the [[multiracial]] West Virginia community of [[Chestnut Ridge people]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Finding Your Roots: Decoding Our Past Through DNA|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/decoding-past-dna-full-episode/12882/|website=PBS.org|publisher=Public Broadcasting System}}</ref>

At the age of 14, Gates was injured playing [[touch football (American)|touch football]], fracturing the [[ball and socket joint]] of his hip, resulting in a [[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]. The injury was misdiagnosed by a physician, who told Gates' mother that his problem was psychosomatic. When the physical damage finally healed, his right leg was two inches shorter than his left. Because of the injury, Gates now uses a cane when he walks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/20/society|title=The biggest brother: interview with Henry Louis Gates, black America's foremost intellectual|work=[[The Observer]]|last=O'Hagan|first=Sean|date=July 20, 2003|accessdate=July 25, 2009|location=London}}</ref><ref name="Gale">''[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/gates_h.htm Contemporary Black Biography]''.

Gates graduated from Piedmont High School in 1968 and attended [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University]] before transferring to [[Yale University]], from which he graduated ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a degree in history.<ref>[https://twitter.com/PhiBetaKappa/status/1128747148206538753 Phi Beta Kappa on Twitter], May 15, 2019.</ref> The first African American to be awarded an [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] Fellowship, Gates sailed on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' for England and [[University of Cambridge]], where he studied [[English literature]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] and earned his PhD.

==Personal life==
Gates married Sharon Lynn Adams in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvwc.edu/lib/wv_authors/authors/a_gates.htm|title=West Virginia Weslesyan College biography|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726122601/http://www.wvwc.edu/lib/wv_authors/authors/a_gates.htm|archivedate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> They had two daughters together before they divorced in 1999.<ref>Adam Begley, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/magazine/black-studies-new-star-henry-louis-gates-jr.html?pagewanted=all "Black Studies' New Star: Henry Louis Gates Jr."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 1, 1990.</ref> 

==Career==
After a month at [[Yale Law School]], Gates withdrew from the program. In October 1975 he was hired by Charles Davis as a secretary in the Afro-American Studies department at Yale. In July 1976, Gates was promoted to the post of Lecturer in Afro-American Studies, with the understanding that he would be promoted to assistant professor upon completion of his doctoral [[dissertation]]. Jointly appointed to assistant professorships in English and Afro-American Studies in 1979, Gates was promoted to associate professor in 1984. While at Yale, Gates guided [[Jodie Foster]], who majored in [[African-American Literature]] there, writing her [[thesis]] on writer [[Toni Morrison]].

In 1984, Gates was recruited by [[Cornell University]] with an offer of [[tenure]]; Gates asked Yale if they would match Cornell's offer, but they declined.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ambinder|first1=Marc J.|title=Yale Afro-Am Chair Resigns After Remarks of Yale Pres.|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/2/14/yale-afro-am-chair-resigns-after-remarks/?page=single|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=February 14, 2000}}</ref> Gates moved to Cornell in 1985, where he taught until 1989.

Following a two-year stay at [[Duke University]], he was recruited to [[Harvard University]] in 1991. At Harvard, Gates teaches undergraduate and graduate courses as the Alphonse Fletcher [[Harvard University Professor|University Professor]], an endowed chair he was appointed to in 2006, and as a professor of English.<ref name="hacp">{{cite web|author=History of American Civilization Program|title=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~amciv/faculty/gates.shtml|publisher=Harvard University|year=2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724062711/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~amciv/faculty/gates.shtml|archivedate=July 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, he is the Director of the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research.

As a literary theorist and [[literary criticism|critic]], Gates has combined literary techniques of [[deconstruction]] with native African literary traditions; he draws on [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[semiotics]] to analyze texts and assess matters of [[identity politics]]. As a black intellectual and public figure, Gates has been an outspoken critic of the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] literary canon. He has insisted that [[African-American literature|black literature]] must be evaluated by the aesthetic criteria of its culture of origin, not criteria imported from Western or European cultural traditions that express a "tone deafness to the black cultural voice" and result in "intellectual racism".<ref name="Gale"/> In his major scholarly work, ''[[The Signifying Monkey]],'' a [[American Book Awards|1989 American Book Award winner]], Gates expressed what might constitute an [[African-American culture|African-American cultural aesthetic]]. The work extended application of the concept of "[[signifyin']]" to analysis of African-American works. "Signifyin'" refers to the significance of words that is based on context, and is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. His work has rooted African-American literary criticism in the African-American vernacular tradition.<ref>Napier, Winston, ed. ''African American Literary Theory: A Reader.'' NYU Press, 2000. pp. 6–7.</ref>

While Gates has stressed the need for greater recognition of black literature and black culture, he does not advocate a "separatist" black canon. Rather, he works for greater recognition of black works and their integration into a larger, [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] canon. He has affirmed the value of the Western tradition, but has envisioned a more inclusive canon of diverse works sharing common cultural connections: 
<blockquote>"Every black American text must confess to a complex ancestry, one high and low (that is, literary and vernacular) but also one white and black ... there can be no doubt that white texts inform and influence black texts (and ''vice versa''), so that a thoroughly integrated canon of American literature is not only politically sound, it is intellectually sound as well."<ref name="Gale"/></blockquote>

Gates has argued that a separatist, [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] education perpetuates racist stereotypes. He maintains that it is "ridiculous" to think that only blacks should be scholars of [[African literature|African]] and African-American literature. He argues, "It can't be real as a subject if you have to look like the subject to be an expert in the subject,<ref name="ref01">{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/gates/interview.html|title=Henry Louis Gates Jr. Interview|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|author=Bruce Cole|year=2002|accessdate=January 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209194003/http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/gates/interview.html|archivedate=December 9, 2006|df=mdy-all }}</ref> adding, "It's as ridiculous as if someone said I couldn't appreciate [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] because I'm not [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]. I think it's vulgar and racist whether it comes out of a black mouth or a white mouth."<ref>Clarke, Breena, and Susan Tifft, "A 'Race Man' Argues for a Broader Curriculum: Henry Louis Gates Jr. Wants W. E. B. DuBois, Wole Soyinka and Phyllis Wheatley on the Nation's Reading Lists, As Well As Western Classics like Milton and Shakespeare", ''Time'': 137(16). April 22, 1991: 16.</ref>

As a mediator between those advocating separatism and those believing in a [[Western canon]], Gates has been criticized by both. Some critics suggest that adding black literature will diminish the value of the Western canon, while separatists say that Gates is too accommodating to the dominant white culture in his advocacy of integration of the canon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Gates has been criticized by [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Molefi Kete Asante]] and the controversial [[Maulana Karenga]], each of whom has been questioned by others in academia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asante.net/articles/|title= Papers by Molefi Asante|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africawithin.com/clarke/clarke_response.htm|title= Papers by John Henrik Clarke|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref><ref name="asante.net">Molefi Kete Asante, [http://www.asante.net/articles/44/where-is-the-white-professor-located/ "Henry Louis Gates is Wrong about African Involvement in the Slave Trade"], Asante.net, May 6, 2010.</ref>

As a literary historian committed to the preservation and study of historical texts, Gates has been integral to the Black Periodical Literature Project, a digital archive of black newspapers and magazines created with financial assistance from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute]]|title=Black Periodical Literature Project|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~du_bois/research_projects/black_periodical_literature_project.html|publisher=Harvard University|year=2008|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref> To build Harvard's visual, documentary, and literary archives of African-American texts, Gates arranged for the purchase of ''The Image of the Black in Western Art,'' a collection assembled by [[Dominique de Ménil]] in [[Houston]].

As a result of research as a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]], Gates discovered ''[[Our Nig]]'', written by [[Harriet E. Wilson]] in 1859, and thought to be the first novel written in the United States by an African American. Later, he acquired and authenticated the manuscript of ''[[The Bondwoman's Narrative]]'' by [[Hannah Crafts]], a novel from the same period that scholars believe may have been written as early as 1853; if so, it would have precedence as the first-known novel written in the United States by an African American. (Note: ''[[Clotel]]'' (1853) is recognized as the first novel published by an African-American author, but [[William Wells Brown]] wrote and published it in London.) ''The Bondwoman's Narrative'' was first published in 2002 and became a bestseller.

As a prominent black intellectual, Gates has concentrated on building academic institutions to study [[African-American culture|black culture]]. Additionally, he has worked to bring about social, educational, and intellectual equality for black Americans. His writing includes pieces in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that defend [[Hip hop music|rap]] music, and an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that criticizes black youth culture for glorifying basketball over education. In 1992, he received a [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award]] for his social commentary in ''The New York Times.'' Gates's prominence has led to his being called as a witness on behalf of the controversial Florida rap group [[2 Live Crew]] in an [[obscenity]] case. He argued that the material, which the government charged was profane, had important roots in [[African-American Vernacular English]], games, and literary traditions, and should be protected.

Asked by [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Chairman Bruce Cole to describe his work, Gates responded: "I would say I'm a literary critic. That's the first descriptor that comes to mind. After that I would say I was a teacher. Both would be just as important."<ref name="ref01"/> After his 2003 NEH lecture, Gates published in the same year a book entitled ''The Trials of [[Phillis Wheatley]],'' about the early African-American poet.

==Other activities==
In 1995 Gates presented a program in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Great Railway Journeys]]'' (produced in association with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]). The program documents a 3,000-mile journey Gates took through [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]], with his then-wife Sharon Adams and daughters Liza and Meggie Gates. This trip came 25 years after Gates worked at a hospital in [[Kilimatinde]] near [[Dodoma]], [[Tanzania]], as a 19-year-old pre-medical student at [[Yale University]].<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rg2 Great Railway Journeys]". BBC. Retrieved February 6, 2010.</ref>

In September 1995, Gates read a five-part abridgement (by [[Margaret Busby]]) of his memoir ''Colored People'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/a35eeb381ee44dbca6165166ca036c81 "Coloured People"], ''Radio Times'', Issue 3739, September 14, 1995, p. 121.</ref>

Gates was the host and co-producer of ''[[African American Lives]]'' (2006) and ''[[African American Lives 2]]'' (2008) in which the lineage of more than a dozen notable African Americans was traced using [[genealogy|genealogical]] and historic resources, as well as [[genealogical DNA test]]ing. In the first series, Gates learned that he has 50% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ancestry]]<ref name=10Percenter>[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/the-10-percenter/?_r=0 "The 10 Percenter"], ''The New York Times'', October 13, 2011.</ref> and 50% African ancestry.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/138601410/what-it-means-to-be-black-in-latin-america "What It Means to Be Black in Latin America"], NPR Books, January 27, 2011.</ref> He had known of some European ancestry but was surprised to learn the high proportion; he also learned that he was descended from John Redman, a mulatto veteran in New England of the American Revolutionary War. Gates has joined the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. In the series, he discussed findings with guests about their complex ancestries.

In the second season, Gates learned that he is part of a genetic subgroup possibly descended from or related to the fourth-century Irish king [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]]. He also learned that one of his African ancestors includes a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] man who was trafficked to America from [[Ouidah]] in present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. The two series demonstrated the many strands of ancestry, cultural heritage and history among African Americans.

Gates hosted ''[[Faces of America]]'', a four-part series presented by PBS in 2010. This program examined the genealogy of 12 North Americans of diverse ancestry: [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]], [[Mario Batali]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Louise Erdrich]], [[Malcolm Gladwell]], [[Eva Longoria]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Mike Nichols]], [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], [[Mehmet Oz]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Kristi Yamaguchi]].

Since 1995, Gates has been the jury chair for the [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]], which honors written works that contribute to society's understanding of racism and the diversity of human culture. Gates was an Anisfield-Wolf prize winner in 1989 for ''The Schomburg Library of Women Writers''.

Since 2012 he has hosted a [[PBS]] TV series, called ''[[Finding Your Roots|Finding Your Roots&nbsp;– with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]''.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/ ''Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.''], PBS.</ref> The second season of the series, featuring 30 prominent guests across 10 episodes, with Gates as the narrator, interviewer, and genealogical investigator, aired on PBS in fall 2014. The show's third season was postponed after it was discovered that actor [[Ben Affleck]] had persuaded Gates to omit information about his slave-owning ancestors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11546891/Ben-Afflecks-slave-owning-ancestor-censored-from-genealogy-show.html|title=Ben Affleck's slave-owning ancestor 'censored' from genealogy show|work=The Telegraph|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ben-affleck-demanded-pbs-suppress-his-slave-owning-ancestry/|title=Ben Affleck Demanded PBS Suppress His Slave-Owning Ancestry|publisher=Mediaite|date=2015-04-18|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Koblin>{{cite news|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=Citing Ben Affleck's 'Improper Influence,' PBS Suspends 'Finding Your Roots'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/business/media/citing-ben-afflecks-improper-influence-pbs-suspends-finding-your-roots.html|accessdate=June 25, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2015}}</ref> ''Finding Your Roots'' resumed in January 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-finding-your-roots-pbs-return-20151019-story.html|title=PBS' 'Finding Your Roots' returning in January after Ben Affleck controversy|accessdate=February 11, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=February 11, 2016}}</ref>

Gates's critically acclaimed six-part PBS documentary series, ''[[The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross]],'' traced 500 years of African-American history to the second inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]]. Gates wrote, executive produced, and hosted the series, which earned the 2013 [[Peabody Award]] and a [[NAACP Image Award]].

=="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game" op-ed==
In 2010, Gates wrote an op-ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that discussed the role played by Africans in the slave trade.<ref>Henry Louis Gates Jr. (April 23, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all "Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. A27.</ref> Gates' op-ed begins and ends with the observation that it is very difficult to decide whether or not to give reparations to the descendants of American slaves, whether they should receive compensation for their ancestors' unpaid labor and lack of rights. Gates also notes that it is equally difficult to decide who should get such reparations and who should pay them, as slavery was legal under the laws of the colonies and the United States. In an article for ''[[Newsweek]]'', journalist [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] reported on the reaction to Gates' article:

{{quote|The enemy of individuality is [[groupthink]], Gates says, and here he holds everyone accountable. Recently, he has enraged many of his colleagues in the [[African-American studies]] field—especially those campaigning for government [[reparations for slavery]]—by insistently reminding them, as he did in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] last year, that the folks who captured and sold blacks into slavery in the first place were also Africans, working for profit. "People wanted to kill me, man," Gates says of the reaction to that op-ed. "Black people were so angry at me. But we need to get some distance from the binary opposition we were raised in: evil white people and good black people. The world just isn't like that."}}

The Letters page of ''The New York Times'' of April 25, 2010, featured criticism and examination of Gates's views in response to his op-ed. [[Eric Foner]], professor of history at [[Columbia University]], considered Gates's emphasis on there being "little discussion" of African involvement in the slave trade to be unfounded, stating that "today, virtually every history of slavery and every American history textbook includes this information". Author [[Herb Boyd]], who teaches African and African-American history at the College of New Rochelle and [[City College of New York|City College]], [[City University of New York|CUNY]], argued that despite the complicity of African monarchs in the Atlantic slave trade, the United States "was the greatest beneficiary, and thus should be the main compensator". Lolita Buckner Inniss, a professor at the [[Cleveland-Marshall College of Law]], argued that notwithstanding African involvement as "abductors", it was Western slave-owners, as "captors", that perpetuated the practice even after the import trade was banned. "Up until that recent piece, people would have thought of him as someone who took a cautious and nuanced approach to questions like reparations." Gates has such an eminent reputation, she said, and "so much gravitas. Many of us were troubled."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/opinion/l26slavery.html|title=Africa's Role in the U.S. Slave Trade|date=April 25, 2010|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>Miller, L.

==Cambridge arrest==
{{Main|Henry Louis Gates arrest controversy}}
On July 16, 2009, Gates returned home to his residence in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] near [[Harvard Square]] following a trip to China, only to find the front door jammed. His taxi driver attempted to help him gain entrance. A passerby called police reporting a possible break-in after reporting to 911 "an individual" forcing the front door open. A [[Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts)|Cambridge police]] officer was dispatched. The confrontation resulted in Gates being arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Prosecutors later dropped the charges.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/22/charge-dropped-against-black-harvard-scholar/?page=all "Charge dropped against Harvard scholar"], ''The Washington Times'', July 22, 2009.</ref> 

The incident spurred a politically charged exchange of views about [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] throughout the United States. The arrest attracted national attention after U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] declared that the Cambridge police "acted stupidly" in arresting the 59-year-old Gates. Obama and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] eventually extended an invitation to Gates and the Cambridge officer who was involved to share a beer with them on the White House lawn, which they accepted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Neary|first=Lynn|title=Black And Blue: Police And Minorities|work=[[Talk of the Nation]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 23, 2009|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106928434|accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref>
