==Structure==
DGS is governed by the Council of the Diocesan Girls' School, a group of administrators who ensure that the school is well-managed and adheres to DGS's School Mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chsc.hk/ssp2016/sch_detail1.php?lang_id=1&sch_id=3|title=SSP Profiles 2016/2017|website=Chsc.hk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> Having run as a grant-aided school since it was founded, the school commenced operation in the [[Direct Subsidy Scheme|DSS]] mode starting with Secondary One classes in September 2005.  It uses English as the medium of instruction, and has always been ranked as the top secondary school in Hong Kong, with students known to be high achievers in academics, music and sports etc.  DGS accounts for a total of 43 winners of the [[Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards]], ranking first among all the secondary schools in Hong Kong, and outnumbering the combined number of winners of the next two schools.  The school is also a member of the [[G20 Schools]] group. It has a "feeder" primary school known as Diocesan Girls' Junior School ("DGJS"),<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr08-09/english/fc/pwsc/papers/p08-66e.pdf |title=ITEM FOR PUBLIC WORKS SUBCOMMITTEE OF FINANCE COMMITTEE |website=Legco.gov.hk |accessdate=2017-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bbs.szhome.com/0-0-detail-158037492-0-0-1.html|title=香港拔萃小学：香港拔萃女小面試 3000童爭100學位 被指是今年最难考的小学 - 家在深圳|website=bbs.szhome.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> which is currently led by Mrs Annie Lee.

==History==

===Pre-war===

DGS was originally named the [[Diocesan Native Female Training School]] in 1860, when it was founded at Bonham Road and Eastern Street <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.edu.hk/development/redevelopment/history.htm|title=DIOCESAN GIRLS' SCHOOL|website=Dgs.edu.hk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tItEAQAAMAAJ&q=Society+for+the+Promotion+of+Female+Education+in+the+Far+East&pg=PA197|title=The Directory & Chronicle for China, Japan, Corea, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, Malay States, Sian, Netherlands India, Borneo, the Philippines, &c: With which are Incorporated "The China Directory" and "The Hong Kong List for the Far East" ...|date=23 May 1877|publisher=Hongkong daily Press office|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> in [[Hong Kong Island]]. The school set up by Lady Lydia Smith, the wife of [[George Smith (Bishop of Victoria)]] ({{zh|t=施美夫|labels=no}}), who was the First Bishop of Victoria sent by the [[Society for Promotion of Female Education in the East]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkiyYcYq--sC&q=Diocesan+Girls%27+School+motto&pg=PA9|title=China Bound and Unbound: History in the Making - An Early Returnee's Account|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9789622091719}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historysocietyf00eastgoog#page/n12/mode/2up|title=History of the Society for promoting female education in the East|website=archive.org|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/institutions/female_education_society.htm|title=UCL Bloomsbury Project|website=Ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrxAAQAAMAAJ&q=Society+for+the+Promotion+of+Female+Education+in+the+Far+East&pg=PA362|title=The China Review, Or, Notes and Queries on the Far East|date=23 May 1891|publisher=國家圖書館出版社|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> a sub-society of the [[London Missionary Society]]. At first, it admitted only girls. In 1866 it was renamed '''Diocesan Female School'''. Because of financial problems, the school had to restrict its services solely to [[orphan]]s and destitute girls. In 1869, it became the '''Diocesan Home and Orphanage'''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98-miRI2yAwC&q=Diocesan+Girls%27+School+redevelopment&pg=PA397|title=To Serve and to Lead: History of the Diocesan Boys' School in Hong Kong|first1=Yee Wang|last1=Fung|first2=Mo Wah Moira|last2=Chan-Yeung|date=1 November 2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9789622099982}}</ref> and accepted boys as well.

DGS first received government financial assistance in 1878 and was placed under the grant-in-aid scheme, officially establishing itself as a girls' school<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyfPeYnp3-oC&q=Diocesan+Girls%27+School+redevelopment&pg=PA64|title=Streets: Exploring Kowloon|first=Jason|last=Wordie|date=23 May 2017|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9789622098138}}</ref> The boys would continue their education at the newly founded [[Diocesan Boys' School]].<ref name="dgs.edu.hk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.edu.hk/index.php/school-profile/school-history|title=School History|website=Dgs.edu.hk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>

In 1913, the school finally moved to its present site in 1 Jordan Road, [[Kowloon]], formerly a rice [[paddy field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gwulo.com/atom/20069|title=DGS Diocesan Girls School - Gwulo: Old Hong Kong|website=gwulo.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> In the 1920s, the school motto, ''Daily Giving Service'', was adopted. During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in the [[Second World War]], the school was taken over as headquarters of the Japanese [[Kempeitai]] until it was re-opened in September 1945 by Ms. Gibbins, then headmistress, who was interned at [[Stanley Prison|Stanley camp]] during the occupation.  Immediately upon her release, she hurried back to reclaim the school premises despite difficulty in crossing the harbour, thus saving the building from being looted.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpob5oHe7kIC&q=diocesan+girls%27+school+hong+kong+war&pg=PA164|title=Dispersal and Renewal: Hong Kong University During the War Years|first1=Clifford|last1=Matthews|first2=Oswald|last2=Cheung|date=1 October 1998|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9789622094727}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.edu.hk/|title=Diocesan Girls' School|website=Dgs.edu.hk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, Piloted to Serve, 2012.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gwulo.com/comment/11428#15/22.3070/114.1730/Map_by_ESRI-Markers/100|title=Diocesan Girls School [1913- ] - Gwulo: Old Hong Kong|website=gwulo.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yelp.com/biz/%E6%8B%94%E8%90%83%E5%A5%B3%E6%9B%B8%E9%99%A2-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF-2|title=Diocesan Girls' School - Jordan - Hong Kong|website=Yelp|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>

===Post war===

In the 1950s, with the closure of the adjacent town-gas depot, the School was able to expand. The old Edwardian edifice was pulled down, and three school blocks were constructed to accommodate the enlarged student body. The school embarked on a large scale school expansion project, and two extension blocks were opened respectively in 1993 and 1996.<ref>[http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/28797A]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=oai%5C:hub.hku.hk%5C:10722%5C/28797|title=Redevelopment of Diocesan Girls' School|first=Pi, Tsui-man|last=Angelina.|date=23 May 1996|journal=OATD: Open Access Theses and Dissertations|accessdate=23 May 2017|doi=10.5353/th_b3198302 }}</ref> The new phase of expansion had been completed and was opened officially on 12 January 2007.

In 2005, DGS joined the [[Direct Subsidy Scheme]], so as to enhance the facilities to meet the demand of increased number of classes. In site redevelopment has been chosen against the use of a new site provided by the [[Education Bureau]], based on costs considerations. The new school was designed by an award-winning architect,{{Who|date=June 2012}} and the preliminary designs was reviewed and polished by a group of alumni. A fund-raising campaign was launched in 2008 for the redevelopment of the old school campus, which targets on HKD 380 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.edu.hk/development/redevelopment/plan.htm|title=DIOCESAN GIRLS' SCHOOL|website=Dgs.edu.hk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMON47tWGp4C&q=Diocesan+Girls%27+School+redevelopment&pg=PA139|title=Ten out of Ten - My Hong Kong|date=23 May 2017|publisher=PPP Company Ltd|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9789889979584}}</ref> In 2009, the classes in DGS were temporarily relocated to 101 Castle Peak Road, [[Sham Shui Po]],<ref name="dgs.edu.hk"/> whereas DGJS was moved to [[Tseung Kwan O]] during the reconstruction. In September 2011, the school returned to 1 Jordan Road upon completion of the new campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mt.sohu.com/20161116/n473381174.shtml|title=当一所学校全部是女学霸...香港精英摇篮之拔萃女书院-搜狐|website=Mt.sohu.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.360doc.com/content/14/1009/20/19204025_415606583.shtml|title=访问香港拔萃女书院（二）|website=360doc.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>
