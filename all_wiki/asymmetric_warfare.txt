{{short description|War between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly}}
'''Asymmetric warfare''' (or '''asymmetric engagement''') is [[war]] between [[belligerent]]s whose relative military power differs significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly. This is typically a war between a [[Standing army|standing, professional army]] and an [[insurgency]] or [[resistance movement]] [[militia]]s who often have status of [[unlawful combatant]]s.

''Asymmetric warfare'' can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and, in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of [[unconventional warfare]], the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality of their forces and equipment.<ref>{{Cite journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607224951/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/Parameters/Articles/04spring/tomes.pdf |url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/Parameters/Articles/04spring/tomes.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-07|title=Relearning Counterinsurgency Warfare|first=Robert|last=Tomes|journal=Parameters|date=Spring 2004}}</ref> Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.sipri.org/files/RR/SIPRIRR23.pdf|last=Stepanova|first=E|title=2008 Terrorism in asymmetrical conflict: SIPRI Report 23|publisher=Oxford Univ.

The term is also frequently used to describe what is also called "[[guerrilla warfare]]", "[[insurgency]]", "[[counterinsurgency]]", "[[rebellion]]", "[[terrorism]]", and "[[counterterrorism]]", essentially violent conflict between a formal military and an informal, less equipped and supported, undermanned but resilient and motivated opponent. Asymmetric warfare is a form of [[irregular warfare]].

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Definition and differences==
The popularity of the term dates from [[Andrew J. R. Mack]]'s 1975 article "Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars" in ''[[World Politics]]'', in which "asymmetric" referred simply to a significant disparity in power between opposing actors in a conflict. "Power", in this sense, is broadly understood to mean material power, such as a large army, sophisticated weapons, an advanced economy, and so on. Mack's analysis was largely ignored in its day, but the end of the [[Cold War]] sparked renewed interest among academics. By the late 1990s, new research building on Mack's insights was beginning to mature, and, after 2004, the [[U.S. military]] began once again seriously to consider the problems associated with asymmetric warfare.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Discussion since 2004 has been complicated by the tendency of academic and military communities to use the term in different ways, and by its close association with [[guerrilla warfare]], [[insurgency]], [[terrorism]], [[counterinsurgency]], and [[counterterrorism]]. Military authors tend to use the term "asymmetric" to refer to the indirect nature of the strategies many weak actors adopt, or even to the nature of the adversary itself (e.g., "asymmetric adversaries can be expected to ...") rather than to the correlation of forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Academic authors tend to focus on explaining two puzzles in asymmetric conflict. First, if "power" determines victory in conflict, then why would weaker actors decide to fight stronger actors? Key explanations include:

Second, if "power", as conventionally understood, conduces to victory in war, then how is the victory of the "weak" over the "strong" explained? Key explanations include:
# Strategic interaction;
# Willingness of the weak to suffer more or bear higher costs;
# External support of weak actors;
# Reluctance to escalate violence on the part of strong actors;
# Internal group dynamics;<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Anomalously Slow Attrition Times for Asymmetric Populations with Internal Group Dynamics|last=Zhao|journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=103 |issue=14|pages=148701 |date=2 October 2009|display-authors=etal|arxiv=0910.1622|bibcode=2009PhRvL.103n8701Z|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.148701|pmid=19905607}}</ref>

Asymmetric conflicts include both interstate and [[civil war]]s, and over the past two hundred years have generally been won by strong actors. Since 1950, however, weak actors have won a majority of all asymmetric conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arreguín-Toft|first=Ivan|title=How the weak win wars: A theory of asymmetric conflict|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci211z/2.2/Arreguin-Toft%20IS%202001.pdf|access-date=2012-09-17}}</ref>

==Strategic basis==
In most [[conventional warfare]], the belligerents deploy forces of a similar type and the outcome can be predicted by the quantity of the opposing forces or by their quality, for example better [[command and control]] of their forces (c2). There are times where this is not true because the composition or strategy of the forces makes it impossible for either side to close in battle with the other. An example of this is the standoff between the continental land forces of the [[French Army]] and the maritime forces of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Navy]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] during the [[Campaigns of 1801 in the French Revolutionary Wars|campaigns of 1801]], "I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea",<ref>{{Cite book|last=Andidora|first=Ronald|title=Iron Admirals: Naval Leadership in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2000|isbn=978-0-313-31266-3|url=https://archive.org/details/ironadmiralsnava00andi|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironadmiralsnava00andi/page/3 3]|access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref> and a confrontation that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] described as that between the elephant and the whale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=Men of Honor: Trafalgar and the making of the English Hero|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|isbn=978-0-00-719209-0|page=73}}</ref>

==Tactical basis==
[[File:Home-made explosives packed in oil drums being dealt with by EOD Operator. MOD 45159058.jpg|thumb|Oil-drum roadside IED removed from culvert in 1984]]
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The tactical success of asymmetric warfare is dependent on at least some of the following assumptions:

* One side can have a technological advantage which outweighs the numerical advantage of the enemy; the decisive [[English longbow]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]] is an example.<ref>Rogers, Clifford (1998). "The Efficacy of the English Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries" (PDF). War in History. 5 (2): 233–242.</ref><ref>Sumption, Jonathan (1990). The Hundred Years War 1: Trial by Battle. London: Faber & Faber.</ref>
* Technological superiority usually is cancelled by more vulnerable infrastructure which can be targeted with devastating results. Destruction of multiple electric lines, roads or water supply systems in highly populated areas could have devastating effects on economy and morale, while the weaker side may not have these structures at all.
* Training and tactics as well as technology can prove decisive and allow a smaller force to overcome a much larger one. For example, for several centuries the Greek [[hoplite]]'s (heavy infantry) use of [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] made them far superior to their enemies. The [[Battle of Thermopylae]], which also involved good [[#Use of terrain|use of terrain]], is a well-known example.<ref>Holland, Tom (2006). Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West. p. 285–287</ref>
* If the inferior power is in a position of self-defense; i.e., under attack or [[Military occupation|occupation]], it ''may'' be possible to use unconventional tactics, such as [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] and selective battles in which the superior power is weaker, as an effective means of harassment without violating the [[laws of war]]. Perhaps the classical historical examples of this doctrine may be found in the [[American Revolutionary War]], movements in [[World War II]], such as the [[French Resistance]] and [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s. Against democratic aggressor nations, this strategy can be used to play on the electorate's patience with the conflict (as in the [[Vietnam War]], and others since) provoking [[protest]]s, and consequent disputes among elected legislators.
* If the inferior power is in an aggressive position, however, and/or turns to tactics prohibited by the laws of war (''[[jus in bello]]''), its success depends on the superior power's refraining from like tactics. For example, the [[law of land warfare]] prohibits the use of a [[flag of truce]] or clearly marked medical vehicles as cover for an attack or [[ambush]], but an asymmetric combatant using this prohibited tactic to its advantage depends on the superior power's obedience to the corresponding law. Similarly, laws of warfare prohibit combatants from using civilian [[Human settlement|settlements]], populations or facilities as [[military base]]s, but when an inferior power uses this tactic, it depends on the premise that the superior power will respect the law that the other is violating, and will not attack that civilian target, or if they do the propaganda advantage will outweigh the material loss.

===Terrorism===
There are two different viewpoints on the relationship between asymmetric warfare and [[terrorism]]. In the modern context, asymmetric warfare is increasingly considered a component of [[fourth generation warfare]]. When practiced outside the [[laws of war]], it is often defined as [[terrorism]], though rarely by its practitioners or their supporters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040221200111/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/asymmetric.cfm Reshaping the military for asymmetric warfare] ''Center for Defense Information'' [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120707163956/http%3A//www%2Ecdi%2Eorg/terrorism/asymmetric%2Ecfm Archived copy] at the [[Library of Congress]] (July 7, 2012).</ref>
The other view is that asymmetric warfare does not coincide with terrorism.

==Use of terrain==
Terrain that limits mobility, such as forests and mountains, can be used as a [[force multiplier]] by the smaller force and as a force inhibitor against the larger force, especially one operating far from its [[Military logistics|logistical base]]. Such terrain is called ''difficult terrain''. [[Urban warfare|Urban]] areas, though generally having good transport access, provide innumerable ready-made defensible positions with easy escape routes, and can also become difficult terrain if prolonged combat fills the streets with rubble.

{{quote|The contour of the land is an aid to the army; sizing up opponents to determine victory, assessing dangers and distance. "Those who do battle without knowing these will lose."|[[Sun Tzu]]|''[[The Art of War]]''}}

{{quote|The guerrillas must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea.|[[Mao Zedong]].}}

An early example of terrain advantage is the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], 480&nbsp;BC, where the narrow terrain of a defile was used to funnel the Persian forces, who were numerically superior, to a point where they could not use their size as an advantage.

In 12th century, irregulars known as the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] were successful in the [[Nizari Ismaili state]]. The "state" consisted of [[List of Ismaili castles|fortresses]] (such as the [[Alamut Castle]]) built on strategic hilltops and highlands with difficult access, surrounded by hostile lands. The Assassins developed tactics to eliminate high-value targets that posed a threat to their security, including the [[Crusaders]].

In the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Francis Marion]], known as the "Swamp Fox", took advantage of irregular tactics, interior lines, and the wilderness of colonial [[South Carolina]] to stymie larger British regular forces.<ref>William Dobein James, "A Sketch of the Life of Brig. Gen. Francis Marion" (1821)</ref>

[[Yugoslav Partisans]], starting as small detachments around mountain villages in 1941, fought the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and other Axis occupation forces, successfully taking advantage of the rough terrain to survive despite their small numbers. Over the next four years, they slowly forced their enemies back, recovering population centers and resources, eventually growing into the regular [[Yugoslav Army]].

==Role of civilians==
Civilians could play an important role in determining the outcome of an asymmetric war. In such conflicts, when it is easy for insurgents to quickly assimilate into the population after an attack, tips on timing or location of insurgent activity can greatly undermine the resistance. An information-centric framework,<ref name="Berman">{{Cite journal|title=The Empiricists' Insurgency|journal = Annual Review of Political Science|volume = 18|pages = 443–464|last1=Berman|first1=Eli|last2=Matanock|first2=Aila M.|date=2015-05-11|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-082312-124553}}</ref> in which civilians are seen primarily as sources of strategic information rather than resources, provides a paradigm to better understand the dynamics of such conflicts where civilian information-sharing is important. The framework assumes that:
# The consequential action of noncombatants (civilians) is information sharing, rather than supplying resources, recruits, or shelter to combatants.
# Information can be shared anonymously, without endangering the civilian who relays it.
Given the additional assumption that the larger or dominant force is the government, the framework suggests the following implications:
# Civilians receive services from both government and rebel force as an incentive to share valuable information.
# Rebel violence can be reduced if government provides services.
# Provision of security and services are complementary in reducing violence.
# Civilian casualties reduce civilian support to the perpetrating group.
# Provision of information is strongly correlated with the level of anonymity that can be ensured.

A survey of empirical literature on conflict,<ref name="Berman"/> does not provide conclusive evidence on the aforementioned claims. But the framework provides a starting point to further explore the role of civilian information sharing in asymmetric warfares.

==War by proxy==
Where asymmetric warfare is carried out (generally covertly) by allegedly non-governmental actors who are connected to or sympathetic to a particular nation's (the "state actor's") interest, it may be deemed ''[[war by proxy]].'' This is typically done to give ''[[deniability]]'' to the state actor. The deniability can be important to keep the state actor from being tainted by the actions, to allow the state actor to negotiate in apparent good faith by claiming they are not responsible for the actions of parties who are merely sympathizers, or to avoid being accused of [[belligerent|belligerent actions]] or [[war crime]]s. If proof emerges of the true extent of the state actor's involvement, this strategy can backfire; for example see [[Iran-contra]] and [[Philip Agee]].

==Examples==

===American Revolutionary War===
From its initiation, the [[American Revolutionary War]] was, necessarily, a showcase for asymmetric techniques. In the 1920s, [[Harold Murdock]] of [[Boston]] attempted to solve the puzzle of the first shots fired on [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington Green]], and came to the suspicion that the few score militia men who gathered before sunrise to await the arrival of hundreds of well-prepared British soldiers were sent specifically to provoke an incident which could be used for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/harold-murdock%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9C-nineteenth-april-1775%E2%80%9D|title=Harold Murdock's "The Nineteenth Of April 1775"|access-date=2015-08-05}}</ref> The return of the British force to Boston following the search operations at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]] was subject to constant [[skirmisher|skirmishing]], using [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] forces gathered from communities all along the route, making maximum use of the terrain (particularly trees and stone field walls) to overcome the limitations of their weapons – [[musket]]s with an effective range of only about 50–70 metres. Throughout the war, skirmishing tactics against British troops on the move continued to be a key factor in the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots']] success; however, they may also have encouraged the occasional incidents, particularly in the later stages, where British troops used alleged surrender violations as a justification for killing large numbers of captives (e.g., [[Waxhaw Massacre|Waxhaw]] and [[Battle of Groton Heights|Groton Heights]]).

Another feature of the long march from Concord was the urban warfare technique of using buildings along the route as additional cover for [[sniper]]s. When revolutionary forces forced their way into [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and used waterfront buildings as cover for shots at British vessels out in the river, the response of destruction of those buildings was ingeniously used to the advantage of the rebels, who encouraged the spread of fire throughout the largely [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] town, and spread propaganda blaming it on the British. Shortly afterwards they destroyed the remaining houses, on the grounds that they might provide cover for British soldiers. British forces never adopted a popular response to partisan-style asymmetric warfare—retribution massacres of groups selected on a semi-random basis from the population at large.

The rebels also adopted a form of asymmetric [[sea warfare]], by using small, fast vessels to avoid the [[Royal Navy]], and capturing or sinking large numbers of merchant ships; however the British responded by issuing [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] permitting private armed vessels to undertake reciprocal attacks on enemy shipping. [[John Paul Jones]] became notorious in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] for his expedition from France in the little sloop of war ''[[USS Ranger (1777)|Ranger]]'' in April 1778, during which, in addition to his attacks on merchant shipping, he made two landings on British soil. The effect of these raids, particularly when coupled with his capture of the Royal Navy's {{HMS|Drake|1777|6}} – the first such success in British waters, but not Jones's last – was to force the British government to increase resources for coastal defence, and to create a climate of fear among the British public which was subsequently fed by press reports of his preparations for the 1779 ''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]'' mission.

From 1776, the conflict turned increasingly into a proxy war on behalf of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]], following a strategy proposed in the 1760s but initially resisted by the idealistic young [[King Louis XVI]], who came to the throne at the age of 19 a few months before Lexington. France also encouraged proxy wars against the British in [[India]], but ultimately drove Great Britain to the brink of defeat by [[Anglo-French War (1778–83)|entering the war(s) directly]], on several fronts throughout the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bicheno|first=Hugh|title=Rebels & Redcoats|year=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-715625-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2014}}

===American Civil War===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2014}}
The [[American Civil War]] saw the rise of asymmetric warfare in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]], and in particular on the US Western Territorial Border after the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854]] opened the territories to voting on the expansion of slavery beyond the [[Missouri Compromise]] lines. Political implications of this broken 1820s compromise were nothing less than the potential expansion of slavery all across the North American continent, including the northern reaches of the [[Mexican Cession|annexed Mexican territories]] to California and Oregon. So the stakes were high and it caused a flood of immigration to the border: some to grab land and expand slavery west, others to grab land and vote down the expansion of slavery. The pro-slavery land grabbers began asymmetric violent attacks against the more pacifist abolitionists who had settled [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and other territorial towns for suppressing slavery. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], the abolitionist, travelled to [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]] in the [[Kansas Territory]] expressly to foment retaliatory attacks back against the pro-slavery guerrillas who, by 1858, had twice ransacked both Lawrence and Osawatomie (where one of Brown's sons was shot dead).

The abolitionists would not return the attacks and Brown theorized that a violent spark set off on "the Border" would be a way to finally ignite his long hoped-for slave rebellion.<ref>{{cite episode |author=Rapley, Rob (Writer, Producer, Director) |year=2012 |network=PBS |series=The American Experience |season=24 |number=9, 10, 11 |title=The Abolitionists |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/abolitionists/player/ |transcript=Transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/abolitionists-transcript/ |access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref>{{Time needed|date=October 2014}} Brown had broad-sworded slave owners at Potawatomi Creek, so the bloody civilian violence was initially symmetrical; however, once the American Civil War ignited in 1861, and when the state of Missouri voted overwhelmingly not to secede from the Union, the pro-slavers on the MO-KS border were driven either south to Arkansas and Texas, or underground—where they became guerrilla fighters and "Bushwhackers" living in the brushy ravines throughout northwest Missouri across the (now) state line from Kansas. The bloody "Border War" lasted all during the Civil War (and long after with guerrilla partisans like the James brothers cynically robbing and murdering, aided and abetted by lingering lost-causers<ref>T.J. Stiles, "Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War", 2002</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2014}}). Tragically the Western Border War was an asymmetric war: pro-slavery guerrillas and paramilitary partisans on the pro-Confederate side attacking pro-Union townspeople and commissioned Union military units; with the Union army trying to keep both in check: blocking Kansans and pro-Union Missourians from organizing militarily against the marauding Bushwhackers.

The worst act of domestic terror in US history came in August 1863 when paramilitary guerrillas amassed 350 strong and rode all night 50 miles across eastern Kansas to the abolitionist stronghold of Lawrence (a political target) and destroyed the town, gunning down 150 civilians. The Confederate officer whose company had joined [[Quantrill's Raiders]] that day witnessed the civilian slaughter and forbade his soldiers from joining in the carnage. The commissioned officer refused to participate in Quantrill's asymmetric warfare on civilians.<ref>Border War Sesquicentennial proceedings at Lawrence, Kan., August 2013</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Philippine–American War===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between the [[United States]] and [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Filipino revolutionaries]]. Estimates of the Filipino forces vary between 100,000 and 1,000,000, with tens of thousands of [[auxiliaries]].<ref name="Deady2005p55">{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=55}}</ref> Lack of weapons and ammunition was a significant impediment to the Filipinos, so most of the forces were only armed with [[Bolo knife|bolo knives]], bows and arrows, spears and other primitive weapons that, in practice, proved vastly inferior to U.S. firepower.
[[File:Philippine Revolutionary Army Rifles.jpg|thumb|Remnants of rifles used by Filipino soldiers during the War on display at Clark Museum.]]

The goal, or end-state, sought by the [[First Philippine Republic]] was a sovereign, independent, socially stable Philippines led by the ''ilustrado'' (intellectual) [[oligarchy]].<ref name=Deady2005p57>{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=57}}</ref> Local chieftains, landowners, and businessmen were the ''[[principalía|principales]]'' who controlled local politics. The war was strongest when ''illustrados'', ''principales'', and peasants were unified in opposition to annexation.<ref name=Deady2005p57 /> The peasants, who provided the bulk of guerrilla manpower, had interests different from their ''illustrado'' leaders and the ''principales'' of their villages.<ref name=Deady2005p57 /> Coupled with the ethnic and geographic fragmentation, unity was a daunting task. The challenge for [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] and his generals was to sustain unified Filipino public opposition; this was the revolutionaries' strategic [[Center of gravity (military)|center of gravity]].<ref name=Deady2005p57 /> The Filipino operational center of gravity was the ability to sustain its force of 100,000 irregulars in the field.<ref name=Deady2005p58>{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=58}}</ref> The Filipino general [[Francisco Macabulos]] described the Filipinos' war aim as, "not to vanquish the U.S. Army but to inflict on them constant losses." They initially sought to use conventional tactics and an increasing toll of U.S. casualties to contribute to McKinley's defeat in the 1900 presidential election.<ref name=Deady2005p58 /> Their hope was that as president the avowedly [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] future [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of state]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] would withdraw from the Philippines.<ref name=Deady2005p58 /> They pursued this short-term goal with [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] better suited to a protracted struggle.<ref name=Deady2005p58 /> While targeting [[William McKinley|McKinley]] motivated the revolutionaries in the short term, his victory demoralized them and convinced many undecided Filipinos that the United States would not depart precipitously.<ref name=Deady2005p58 /> For most of 1899, the revolutionary leadership had viewed guerrilla warfare strategically only as a tactical option of final recourse, not as a means of operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation. On November 13, 1899, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] decreed that guerrilla war would henceforth be the strategy. This made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. In fact, during just the first four months of the guerrilla war, the Americans had nearly 500 casualties. The Philippine Revolutionary Army began staging bloody ambushes and raids, such as the guerrilla victories at Paye, Catubig, Makahambus, Pulang Lupa, Balangiga and Mabitac. At first, it even seemed as if the Filipinos would fight the Americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw. This was even considered by President McKinley at the beginning of the phase. The shift to guerrilla warfare drove the US Army to adopt counter-insurgency tactics. Civilians were given identification and forced into concentration camps with a publicly announced deadline after which all persons found outside of camps without identification would be shot on sight. Thousands of civilians died in these camps due to poor conditions.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===20th century===

====Second Boer War====
Asymmetric warfare featured prominently during the [[Second Boer War]]. After an initial phase, which was fought by both sides as a conventional war, the British captured [[Johannesburg]], the Boers' largest city, and captured the capitals of the two [[Boer Republics]]. The British then expected the Boers to accept peace as dictated by the victors in the traditional European way. However instead of capitulating, the Boers fought a protracted [[guerrilla war]]. 20,000-30,000{{Ambiguous|date = January 2015}} Boer guerrillas were only defeated after the British brought to bear 450,000 troops, about ten times as many as were used in the [[Conventional warfare|conventional]] phase of the war. During this phase the British introduced [[internment]] in [[concentration camp]]s for the Boer civilian population and also implemented a [[scorched earth]] policy. Later, the British began using [[blockhouses]] built within [[machine gun]] range of one another and flanked by [[barbed wire]] to slow the Boers' movement across the countryside and block paths to valuable targets. Such tactics eventually evolved into today's [[counter insurgency]] tactics.

The Boer commando raids deep into the [[Cape Colony]], which were organized and commanded by [[Jan Smuts]], resonated throughout the century as the British adopted and adapted the tactics first used against them by the Boers.

====World War I====
* [[Lawrence of Arabia]] and British support for the [[Arab Revolt|Arab uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans were the stronger power, the Arabs the weaker.
* [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|invasion of Serbia]], August 1914. Austria-Hungary was the stronger power, Serbia the weaker.
* [[German Empire|Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]], August 1914. Germany was the stronger power, Belgium the weaker.

====Between the World Wars====
* [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] led resistance in [[Morocco]] from 1920 to 1924 against [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonial armies ten times as strong as the guerilla force, led by General [[Philippe Pétain]].
* [[TIGR]], the first [[anti-fascist]] national-defensive organization in [[Europe]], fought against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in [[northeast Italy]].
* Anglo-Irish War ([[Irish War of Independence]]) fought between the Irish Republican Army and the [[Black and Tans]]/[[Auxiliaries]]. Lloyd George (British Prime Minister at the time) attempted to persuade other nations that it was not a war by refusing to use the army and using the Black and Tans instead but the conflict was conducted as an asymmetric guerrilla war and was registered as a war with the League of Nations by the Irish Free State.

====World War II====
* [[Philippine resistance against Japan]]&nbsp;– During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] in World War II, there was an extensive Philippine resistance movement, which opposed the Japanese with active underground and guerrilla activity that increased over the years.
[[File:Molotov cocktails prepared in advance by protesters. Euromaidan Protests.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[molotov cocktail]]s]]
* [[Winter War]]&nbsp;– [[Finland]] was invaded by the much larger [[mechanized military unit]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]. Although the Soviets captured 8% of Finland, they suffered enormous casualties versus much lower losses for the Finns. Soviet vehicles were confined to narrow forest roads by terrain and snow, while the Finns used [[Ski warfare|ski tactics]] around them unseen through the trees. They cut the advancing Soviet column into what they called [[Pocket (military)#Motti|motti]] (a cubic metre of firewood), and then destroyed the cut off sections one by one. Many of the Soviets were shot by snipers, had their throats cut from behind, or froze to death due to inadequate clothing and lack of camouflage and shelter. The Finns also devised a petrol bomb they called the [[Molotov cocktail]] to destroy Soviet tanks.
* [[Soviet partisans]]&nbsp;– resistance movement which fought in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German occupied parts of the Soviet Union]].
* [[Warsaw Uprising]]&nbsp;– [[Poland]] (Home Army, [[Armia Krajowa]]) rose up against the [[German occupation of Poland|German occupation]].
* [[German occupation of Yugoslavia|Germany's occupation of Yugoslavia]], 1941–45 (Germany vs. [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and [[Draža Mihailović|Mihailović's]] [[Chetniks]]).

=====Britain=====

=====United States=====
*[[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS)

===After World War II===
* [[First Indochina War]] (1946-1954) and [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-1962); both against France
* The [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1953-1958 became a template of asymmetric warfare.<ref>

====Cold War (1947-1991) ====
The end of [[World War II]] established the two most powerful victors, the [[United States of America]] (United States, or just the U.S.) and the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR, or just the Soviet Union) as the two dominant world [[superpower]]s.

=====Cold War examples of proxy wars=====
{{see also|proxy war}}

In Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, the [[Viet Minh]], [[Viet Cong|NLF]] and other insurgencies engaged in asymmetrical guerrilla warfare with [[French Fourth Republic|France]], at first, then, later, the United States during the period of the [[Vietnam War]] (1955-1975).

The war between the [[mujahideen]] and the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan War]] of 1979 to 1989, though claimed as a source of the term "asymmetric warfare",<ref>Chris Bray, ''The Media and GI Joe'', in ''Reason'' (Feb 2002)</ref> occurred years after Mack wrote of "asymmetric conflict". (Note that the term "asymmetric warfare" became well known in the West only in the 1990s.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>) The aid given by the [[Operation Cyclone|U.S.]] to the mujahadeen during the war was only covert at the tactical level; the [[Reagan Administration]] told the world that it was helping the "freedom-loving people of Afghanistan".

===Post-Cold War===
The [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] (1999) during [[Kosovo War]] of 1998–1999, which pitted NATO airpower against the Yugoslav armed forces, exemplifies international conflict with asymmetry in weapons and strategy/tactics.<ref>

====United States Irregular Warfare Annex====
In October 2019 at a Workshop at [[RAND]], Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Mick Mulroy]] publicly rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex (IWA) to the [[National Defense Strategy]] of 2018. He explained that [[irregular warfare]] included [[counter-insurgency]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[unconventional warfare]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[sabotage]] and [[subversion]], as well as stabilization and information operations. It had traditionally been perceived as a predominately counterterrorism (CT) effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but that under the IWA the skills will be applied to all areas of military competition.  These included competition against global powers competitors like China and Russia as well as rogue states like North Korea and Iran.<ref name="al-monitor.com">{{Cite web | url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/10/pentagon-irregular-tactics-counter-iran-military.html |title = Pentagon turns to irregular tactics to counter Iran|date = 2019-10-17}}</ref> Mulroy said that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with "aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW", to be competitive across these priorities. He also explained that under the IWA, both special operations and conventional forces would play a key role.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rand.org/nsrd/news/2019/10/dasd-mulroy.html |title = NSRD Hosts Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy}}</ref><ref name="al-monitor.com"/>

====Israel/Palestine====
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|ongoing conflict]] between [[Israel]] and some [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] organizations (such as [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]) is a classic case of asymmetric warfare. Israel has a powerful army, air force and navy, while the Palestinian organisations have no access to large-scale military equipment with which to conduct operations;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lavie|first=Smadar|url=https://www.academia.edu/38988706|title=Gaza 2014 and Mizrahi Feminism - PoLAR 42(1):85-109|language=en}}</ref> instead, they utilize asymmetric tactics, such as: knife attacks, small gunfights, cross-border sniping, rocket attacks,<ref name="upi.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/05/06/Hamas-claims-responsibility-for-attack/UPI-59801241613436/|title=Hamas claims responsibility for attack|date=6 May 2009|access-date=2009-05-06}}</ref> and [[suicide bombing]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Rory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/01/israelandthepalestinians.international|title=Death toll in Arab-Israeli conflict fell in 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 January 2008|access-date=2008-02-18|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lavie|first=Smadar|url=https://www.academia.edu/37051595|title=Wrapped in the Flag of Israel: Mizrahi Single Mothers and Bureaucratic Torture -- Revised Edition with a New Afterword|language=en}}</ref>

====Sri Lanka====
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], which raged on and off from 1983 to 2009, between the Sri Lankan government and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) saw large-scale asymmetric warfare. The war started as an insurgency and progressed to a large-scale conflict with the mixture of guerrilla and conventional warfare, seeing the LTTE use [[suicide bombing]] (male/female & child suicide bombers) both on and off battlefield mainly targeting innocent civilians; use of explosive-filled boats for suicide attacks on military shipping; and use of light aircraft targeting military installations.

====Kashmir====

[[Pakistan]] and India claim territorial rights to [[Kashmir]], where both have engaged in proxy wars on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite news|title=A brief history of the Kashmir conflict|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html|access-date=2017-11-21|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017|date=24 Sep 2001}}</ref>

====Iraq====
[[File:Cougar Hit By IED.jpg|thumb|This [[Cougar (MRAP)|Cougar]] in Al Anbar, Iraq, was hit by a directed charge IED approximately 300–500&nbsp;lbs in size.]]
The victory by the US-led coalition forces in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], demonstrated that training, tactics and technology can provide overwhelming victories in the field of battle during modern conventional warfare. After [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime was removed from power, the Iraq campaign moved into a different type of asymmetric warfare where the coalition's use of superior conventional warfare training, tactics and technology was of much less use against continued opposition from the various partisan groups operating inside Iraq.

====Syria====
{{peacock|section|date=September 2015}}
Much of the 2012–present [[Syrian Civil War]] has been fought asymmetrically. The [[Syrian National Coalition]] along with the [[Mujahideen]] and [[Kurdish Democratic Union Party]], have been engaging with the forces of the Syrian government through asymmetric means. The conflict has seen large-scale asymmetric warfare across the country, with the forces opposed to the government unable to engage symmetrically with the Syrian government and resorting instead to other asymmetric tactics such as suicide bombings<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20205432 | work=BBC News | title=Several killed in Syria car bombings | date=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57475297/syrian-rebels-emboldened-after-assassinations/ | work=CBS News | title=Syrian rebels emboldened after assassinations | date=19 July 2012}}</ref> and targeted assassinations.
