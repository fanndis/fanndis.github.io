''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' published an essay on ''Homecoming'' by American screenwriter, producer, and actress [[Lena Waithe]], where she wrote'':''<blockquote>I think it's easy for audiences to think of this as just another concert film. We've seen iconic concert films before... But this is different. This concert is seen through the eyes of the performer. And her approach is poetic, breathtaking, exhausting, painstakingly particular, and even though it's meticulous, she still allows room for there to be rough edges... What's most impressive about her directorial style is how unafraid she is to go from rough to smooth in a matter of seconds. It's as if she's jumping double Dutch. Flipping back and forth between the loud, vibrant colors of her and her dancers performing on stage to grainy images of her quiet life at home with her family, beautifully captured in black and white... She does the thing our icons before her weren't able to do — she holds onto her humanness for dear life... ''Homecoming'' is a tribute to blackness. It's a seance. It's a resurrection of all the ancestors that sat at Woolworth counters and demanded to be served. It's a love letter to historically black colleges and universities... Every cut, every music cue, every glance, every image is a chance to make history. And she does.</blockquote>— [[Lena Waithe]], "Why Beyoncé's ''Homecoming'' Isn't "Just Another Concert Film"", ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lena-waithe-why-beyonces-homecoming-isnt-just-concert-film-1232629|title=Lena Waithe: Why Beyoncé's 'Homecoming' Isn't "Just Another Concert Film" (Guest Column)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref>

[[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]] creative director [[Olivier Rousteing]] revealed that designing the costumes for ''Homecoming'' was "the biggest challenge of my life". Rousteing described Beyoncé as a visionary, saying "She really is an inspiration — she wants to share a vision with you, and there are never any limits." Stylist Marni Senofonte agreed, saying "The preparation for this particular show was so much more intense than anything we've ever done"; approximately 60 looks were created for Beyoncé, while 1000 pieces were created for the final design of the cast's costumes. Rousteing spoke on Beyoncé's opening costume, saying "It was true couture, all handmade with stones and crystals. We wanted to create something truly iconic, something that instantly felt forever and timeless and historic. The pressure was really high, but in the end she was this Egyptian goddess and looked amazing."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/olivier-rousteing-homecoming-costume-team-talk-working-beyonce-1232282|title=How Olivier Rousteing and the 'Homecoming' Costume Team Created 60 Different Looks for Beyonce|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref> Upon seeing himself in the ''Homecoming'' film, Rousteing remarked "I [had] tears and goosebumps." Other clients have approached Balmain to make pieces that recall the aesthetic of ''Homecoming'', which he has refused. Rousteing said "The strength of Beyoncé is whatever she does, a lot of people are inspired by her. [But] when you do one thing for Beyoncé, no one can have the same thing."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/beyonce-netflix-homecoming-coachella-outfits-emmys-interview|title=Tibetan Monks Secretly Inspired Beyoncé's Coachella Wardrobe|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>

Music director Derek Dixie called working on ''Homecoming'' a "blessing", adding that being nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] means that "I've kind of accomplished something for the home team and family." Dixie also said "It was just months and months of prep work, making it sound authentic. She has tons and tons of classic records that when putting the show together, you have to maintain the classic feel of the record but make it feel like you're in a stadium at homecoming."<ref>{{Cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/08/27/arts/ap-us-emmywatch-beyoncs-music-director.html|title=Beyoncé's Music Director on Emmy Nod : 'It Feels Good'|date=August 27, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 30, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Ric Lipson of Stufish, who designed the pyramidal stage for ''Homecoming'', said "we've never really won — or been nominated for even — a prestigious thing like the Emmys. We all knew this was going to be something special, but I don't think anyone realized how special." Lipson described the work on ''Homecoming'' as "a great challenge", since he needed to fulfil Beyoncé's vision "which was to evoke the aesthetic and energy of American historic black colleges, yet still look like a work of art." Stufish designed dozens of pyramid structures for the stage, with the final design "literally pushing the boundaries of what the festival would allow."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2019-08-23/beyonce-homecoming-coachella-stage-design-pyramid|title=Beyoncé's 'Homecoming' Coachella pyramid merges art and flash|date=August 23, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref> This stage was also displayed at the 2019 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' calls "a living piece of Beychella history".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-coachella-beyonce-art-20190414-story.html|title=Beyoncé is gone but not forgotten at Coachella|date=April 14, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> The runway that was added to the stage for Beyoncé's performance was subsequently added as a permanent fixture for the 2019 festival.

On March 16, 2020, Jasmyn Lawson [[Twitter|tweeted]] an invitation to a global rewatch of the film due to [[COVID-19 pandemic]] restricting most to their homes.

The party, using the pseudonym #HOMEcoming, a playful take on the name given the situation, garnered over 500,000 tweets and trended at #1 worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://etcanada.com/news/610983/beyonce-retweets-fan-who-organized-a-homecoming-viewing-party-generating-500000-tweets/|title=Beyonce Retweets Fan Who Organized A 'Homecoming' Viewing Party, Generating 500,000 Tweets|date=March 18, 2020|website=ET Canada|language=en-US|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>
