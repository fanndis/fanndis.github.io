==Publication==
The work is of the "campaign book" genre.<ref name=slow/><ref name=deplore/> As ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it, "Candidates often release hurriedly-written books during their campaigns, often aimed at spreading their message and attracting publicity, rather than topping the best-seller charts."<ref name=slow/>

Announcement of the book was first made on August 4, 2016.<ref name=pub>{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/71103-s-s-to-publish-clinton-kaine-campaign-book.html |title=S&S to Publish Clinton/Kaine Campaign Book |first=John |last=Maher |date=August 4, 2016 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> The publisher, Simon & Schuster, had put out all five of Clinton's previous books.<ref name=pub/> In part, publication of the book was intended to highlight what the authors saw as the policy richness of [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Clinton's 2016 campaign]], and the Clinton-Kaine team's readiness to assume office, in contrast to [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's 2016 campaign]], which was seen by writers for [[CNN]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as comparatively "policy-light".<ref name =left >{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/hillary-clinton-book-democratic-party-leftward-shift/index.html |title=Hillary Clinton's new book underscores Democratic Party's leftward shift since 1992 |first=Edward Mejia |last=Davis |date=September 2, 2016 |newspaper=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name = deplore/>

Upon its release, which with its September 6 publication date came later in the election cycle than usual for books of this ilk, Clinton told reporters that the book was intended to be "our blueprint for America's future. We wanted voters to be able to find, in one easy place, all of the various plans and policies that I've been talking about throughout this campaign."<ref name= slow /> Kaine emphasized that the book had a positive message about the country's future, unlike what he said was the pessimistic vision put forth by Trump's 2015 book ''[[Crippled America]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://whdh.com/news/politics/kaine-says-trumps-view-of-america-is-elitist/ |title=Kaine says Trump's view of America is elitist |newspaper=[[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] |first=Kimberly |last=Bookman |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> The campaign chose the slogan and title "Stronger Together" from 85 possibilities;<ref name="tumulty20170118">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-came-up-with-make-america-great-again/2017/01/17/fb6acf5e-dbf7-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html |title=How Donald Trump came up with 'Make America Great Again' |last=Tumulty |first=Karen |date=2017-01-18 |newspaper=The Washington Post |author-link=Karen Tumulty}}</ref> it was used on the campaign aircraft,<ref name=plane>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-plane.html |title=Hillary Clinton unveils new plane, and lets journalists on board |first=Amy |last=Chozick |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 5, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> campaign bus, and in a series of policy speeches.<ref name=slow/>

==Critical reaction==
[[Amazon.com]] user reviews of the book became an immediate battleground between Clinton opponents and sympathizers, with Amazon staff removing large numbers of negative reviews that were judged the work of [[Internet trolls]].<ref name=troll>{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/137171/no-amazon-didnt-fix-reviews-hillary-clinton-tim-kaines-book-stronger-together |title=No, Amazon didn't "fix" the reviews of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine's book Stronger Together |first=Alex |last=Shephard |newspaper=[[The New Republic]] |date=September 26, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref>

Critical reaction to the book has been largely negative.<ref name =awful>{{cite news|url=http://m.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2016/0919/Are-all-campaign-books-awful-Clinton-s-certainly-doesn-t-buck-the-trend |title=Are all campaign books awful? Clinton's certainly doesn't buck the trend |first=Husna |last=Haq |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=September 19, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Carlos Lozada (journalist)|Carlos Lozada]], the nonfiction [[book review|book critic]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote: "By the time I finished this book, I resented its existence. [... It] is a self-confessed cut-and-paste job of campaign fact sheets, speeches and op-eds. That sets rather modest expectations. Yet, even by that standard, and the low bar for candidates' campaign books overall, 'Stronger Together' is an embarrassment,  sloppy, repetitive, dutiful and boring."<ref name=deplore>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2016/09/16/the-new-clintonkaine-campaign-book-is-just-deplorable/ |title=Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have written a deplorable campaign book |date=September 16, 2016 |first=Carlos |last=Lozada |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> The review ended with a plea against the "campaign book genre" as a whole.<ref name=deplore/>

Alex Shephard, a news editor at ''[[The New Republic]]'', wrote that: "It is a very bad book and there is absolutely no reason for it to exist. Sixteen dollars for a glorified platform is preposterous when you can get all of the information in the book—most of which means next to nothing—for free online. It begins vacuously (its first two sentences are: 'It has been said that America is great because America is good. We agree.') and doesn't get better from there."<ref name=troll/>

Anna Silman, a writer on culture for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, said that the book can be characterized by "its Serif-heavy font, kitschy imagery, and [...] absence of good taste".<ref name=by>{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/did-elena-ferrante-write-hillary-clintons-book.html |title=Did Elena Ferrante Write Hillary Clinton's New Book? |first=Anna |last=Silman |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=August 5, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> A headline in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' read, "Are all campaign books awful? Clinton's certainly doesn't buck the trend".<ref name=awful/>

Politics reporter Evan Halper of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was less caustic, saying of the volume, "the minutiae is the point. The political aim of the book is less to be a gripping page turner than to make the case that Donald Trump doesn't even have the material to publish such a book if he were so inclined."<ref name=aims>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-new-clinton-book-aims-less-to-turn-1473171028-htmlstory.html |title=Hillary Clinton's new book aims less to turn pages than to make a political point |first=Evan |last=Halper |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 6, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref>

Writing for [[CNN]], senior producer Edward Mejia Davis compared the book to a similar effort by [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]], ''Putting People First: How We Can All Change America'', put out during [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|their 1992 campaign]].<ref name =left/> Davis concluded that the comparison revealed a leftward drift in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the intervening 24 years.<ref name=left />

==Sales==
Although both Clinton and Kaine promoted the new work in their campaign rallies, the book's initial sales were quite modest, selling fewer than 3,000 copies in its first week of availability.<ref name=slow>{{cite news |last=Chozick |first=Amy |date=September 14, 2016 |title=Sales of Hillary Clinton's New Book Are Off to a Slow Start|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/clinton-book-stronger-together.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref>  The ''Times'' said the figure "firmly makes the book what the publishing industry would consider a flop."<ref name =slow/>

Any proceeds from the book were slated to go to charity.<ref name=slow/><ref name=plane/>
