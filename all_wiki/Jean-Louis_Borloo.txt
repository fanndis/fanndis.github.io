He also was [[Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of the Economy, Finance and Employment]] in 2007 and [[Ministry of Ecology|Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea]] from 2007 until 2010 under President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].<ref>''A Directory of World Leaders & Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments: 2008–2009 Edition.'' Rockville, MD: Arc Manor, 2008. 154.</ref>

==Early life==
Borloo gained his [[Baccalauréat]] in 1969, in the Philosophy stream. In 1972 he took a first degree in Law and Philosophy at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]], in 1974 a further degree in History and Economics at [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|Paris X Nanterre]], and in 1976 an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] at [[HEC Paris]].<ref>[http://www.hec.fr/newsletter/7/pages/people1.html HEC alumni figure among New Cabinet Faces]</ref>

== Political career ==
Of [[Picardy|Picard]] origin, Borloo began his career as a lawyer in the 1980s. He became president of the [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes Football Club]] in 1986. In 1989, he was elected mayor of [[Valenciennes]] as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]], winning over 76 per cent of the vote.

In the June 1989 [[1989 European Parliament election in France|European elections]], Borloo was elected to the [[European Parliament]] as the second candidate on [[Simone Veil]]'s list. He held this seat until his election as regional councillor for the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] in 1992.

Borloo was elected to the [[French National Assembly]] as a [[Miscellaneous Right]] candidate representing the [[Nord's 21st constituency]] in [[1993 French legislative election|1993]]. Joining the caucus of the [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]], he was re-elected in [[1997 French legislative election|1997]], two years after his re-election as Mayor of Valenciennes.

He was a founding member of [[Ecology Generation]] in 1990, but he later joined the [[Union for French Democracy]] led by [[François Bayrou]]. However, in 2002 he joined the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], associated with the new [[Union for a Popular Movement]]. He was co-president of the Radical Party alongside [[André Rossinot]] between 2005 and 2007, when he became sole President of the party.

It was on the Radical-UMP ticket that Borloo was re-elected as a deputy in [[2002 French legislative election|2002]] and [[2007 French legislative election|2007]]. He was Minister for the City and Urban Renewal in the [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] governments between 2002 and 2004, Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Cohesion under Raffarin between 2004 and 2005, and finally Minister for Employment, Social Cohesion and Housing in the [[Dominique de Villepin]] government between 2005 and 2007. In that role, he introduced a five-year plan of [[social cohesion]], which was centered around three axes: [[equal opportunity]], housing and employment.

On 21 July 2005 Borloo married news anchorwoman [[Béatrice Schönberg]] at [[Rueil-Malmaison]], Hauts-de-Seine.

From 18 May to 19 June 2007, he was [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy and Finance]] in the [[François Fillon]] cabinet. Between 19 June 2007 and November 2010, he was the French [[Minister of the Environment (France)|minister of State for Energy, Ecology and Sustainable Development]]. In this capacity, he was a major player in the 2007–2008 ''[[Grenelle Environnement|Grenelle de l'environnement]]''. He quit the government allegedly after being passed over for premiership in a cabinet reshuffle.<ref>{{cite news|title= Centrists attack Sarkozy’s shift to right|work=Financial TImes |author=Ben Hall|date=15 November 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e6221fbc-f0e9-11df-bf4b-00144feab49a.html#axzz1JYpdLj6z|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>

In April 2011, Borloo left the UMP in protest at Sarkozy's rightward swing. He announced plans to set up a "republican, ecologist, and social alliance", with a view to becoming a candidate in the 2012 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|title= Centrists defect over Sarkozy swerve right|work=Financial TImes |author=Peggy Hollinger|date=8 April 2011|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a32ff88e-6216-11e0-8ee4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1JYpdLj6z|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> However, he decided not to run as President of France.

In September 2012, he created the [[Union of Democrats and Independents]] (UDI), trying to unify all the Centrist parties, while the UDI still allies with the UMP.

Despite being a leader in the UDI, Borloo was not involved in the 2014 local elections, mentioning health reasons, such as frontal acute [[pneumonia]] and [[sepsis]]. On 6 April 2014, Borloo announced in a letter to the executives of the UDI that he would resign immediately from "every political term and position" due to his health concerns.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}
