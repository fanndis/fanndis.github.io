Gyllenhaal's sister, actress Maggie, is married to actor [[Peter Sarsgaard]], Gyllenhaal's co-star in ''Jarhead'' and ''Rendition''. In December 2006, Gyllenhaal and his sister escaped a fire that destroyed Manka's Inverness Lodge, a famed lodge and restaurant in [[Inverness, California]], at which they were vacationing. The Gyllenhaals were among a dozen or so guests who fled after the fire, sparked by a falling tree, broke out at about 3 a.m. Co-owner and celebrity chef Daniel DeLong said the pair were supportive despite having to brave the wind and cold. "Jake was helping me pull things out of the fire" DeLong said.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 29, 2006|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gyllenhaals-forced-flee-fire-at-147873|title=Gyllenhaals forced to flee fire at lodge|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052623/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gyllenhaals-forced-flee-fire-at-147873|archive-date=July 31, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
