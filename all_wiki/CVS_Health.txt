'''CVS Health''' (previously '''CVS Corporation''' and '''CVS Caremark Corporation''') is an American healthcare company that owns [[CVS Pharmacy]], a [[retail]] pharmacy chain; [[CVS Caremark]], a [[Pharmacy benefit management|pharmacy benefits manager]]; [[Aetna]], a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company's headquarter is in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]].

Consumer Value Stores (CVS) was founded in 1963 by three partners: brothers Stanley and Sidney Goldstein and Ralph Hoagland, who grew the venture from a parent company, Mark Steven, Inc., that helped retailers manage their health and beauty aid product lines.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/538094/acronyms-and-initialisms-spelled-out |title= 50 Acronyms and Initialisms All Spelled Out |date= May 8, 2018 |first= Madeline |last= Raynor |publisher= [[Mental Floss]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://cvshealth.com/about/company-history |title= History |publisher= CVS Health }}</ref> The business began as a chain of health and beauty aid stores, but within several years, pharmacies were added. To facilitate growth and expansion, the company joined the [[Melville Corporation]], which managed a string of retail businesses. Following a period of growth in the 1980s and 1990s, CVS Corporation spun off from Melville in 1996, becoming a standalone company trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as {{NYSE link|CVS}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CVS Corporation History|url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/cvs-corporation-history/ |accessdate = 2016-10-20}}</ref>

It later completed a merger with the [[pharmacy benefit management]] company Caremark Rx in 2007, and was renamed CVS Caremark Corporation. The company was renamed CVS Health in 2014, following its decision to remove tobacco products from CVS Pharmacy store shelves. CVS Health's assets include [[CVS Pharmacy]], [[CVS Caremark]], CVS Specialty, and the [[retail clinic]] [[MinuteClinic]].

In 2020, it ranked 5th<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/cvs-health|title=CVS Health|website=[[Fortune 500]]|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> on the [[Fortune 500]] and 13th on the [[Fortune Global 500]] list with $194.58{{nbsp}}billion in annual revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/global500/2019/cvs-health|title=CVS Health|website=Fortune Global 500|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> In December 2017, CVS agreed to acquire [[Aetna]] for $69{{nbsp}}billion<ref name="WP Johnson">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/03/cvs-agrees-to-buy-aetna-in-69-billion-deal-that-could-shake-up-health-care-industry/|title=CVS agrees to buy Aetna in $69{{nbsp}}billion deal that could shake up health-care industry, people familiar with the deal said|first=Carolyn Y.|last=Johnson|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 3, 2017|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NYT Michael">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/business/dealbook/cvs-is-said-to-agree-to-buy-aetna-reshaping-health-care-industry.html|title=CVS Is Said to Agree to Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care Industry|first=Michael J.|last=de la Merced|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 3, 2017|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health-idUSKBN1DX0NC|title=CVS Health to acquire Aetna for $69 billion in year's largest acquisition|date=2017-12-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> and completed the acquisition in November 2018.<ref name="Pharmacy Times 2018">{{cite web | title=CVS Finalizes Acquisition of Aetna and Looks to the Future | website=Pharmacy Times | date=November 28, 2018 | url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/cvs-finalizes-acquisition-of-aetna-and-looks-to-the-future | access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref> Legal issues related to the merger were resolved in September 2019.<ref name="Martin 2019">{{cite web | last=Martin | first=Ken | title=CVS purchase of Aetna gets final approval | website=Fox Business | date=September 5, 2019 | url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/healthcare/cvs-purchase-of-aetna-gets-final-approval | access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>

Caremark was established by James M. Sweeney in 1979, as Home Health Care of America (HHCA), incorporated in Delaware, with corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. The first office was opened in Beachwood, Ohio, with four employees, in conjunction with Ezra Steiger, of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Steiger's Hyperalimentation Team worked closely to provide supplies at home for their [[Parenteral nutrition|parenteral therapy]] patients.  Satellite offices were subsequently opened in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, and Irvine.  HHCA changed its name to Caremark in 1985. In 1987, Caremark was acquired by [[Baxter International]]. In 1991, when Caremark was [[Baxter International]]'s home infusion subsidiary, Caremark was accused by the United States government of "paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service".<ref name="chicagotribune_1995">{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-06-19/business/9506190063_1_baxter-international-million-settlement-bear-stearns | title=Caremark Wounds Not Deep Penalty Could Have Been More Damaging | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=June 19, 1995 | accessdate=October 17, 2015 | author=Yates, Ronald E.}}</ref> Caremark was fined $160{{nbsp}}million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."<ref name="chicagotribune_1995" /> In 1992, Baxter spun off Caremark as a public company. Caremark sold its home infusion service and successfully branched out to four units, "a physician practice management unit, a prescription benefits management unit, a disease state management service aimed at treating high-cost, chronic diseases and an international division."<ref name="chicagotribune_1995" /> In 1996, Caremark merged with [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], based MedPartners/Mullikin, Inc., with the combined company being called MedPartners, Inc. In 1998, MedPartners changed its name to [[Caremark Rx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/caremark-rx-inc |title=Hoover's Profile: Caremark Pharmacy Services |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref>

On September 3, 2014, it was announced that CVS, as of midnight on Tuesday September 2, 2014, will no longer sell tobacco at all of its 7,700 locations nationwide, which is a month earlier than previously planned. The company also announced that it would change its corporate name to CVS Health, in order to reflect "its broader health care commitment", and also a desire to change the future health of Americans, although all retail stores will continue to be called "CVS/pharmacy".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Japsen |first1=Bruce |title=CVS Stops Tobacco Sales Today, Changes Name To Reflect New Era|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2014/09/03/cvs-stops-tobacco-sales-today-changes-name-to-reflect-new-era/ |work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Donnel|first1=Jayne|last2=Ungar|first2=Laura|title=CVS stops selling tobacco, offers quit-smoking programs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/03/cvs-steps-selling-tobacco-changes-name/14967821/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name="NBC News">{{cite web|title=CVS Stops Tobacco Sales Sooner Than Planned, Changes Name|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/cvs-stops-tobacco-sales-sooner-planned-changes-name-n194481|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref>

===Elensys===
In 1998, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that CVS Corporation appeared to be sharing [[prescription drug]] information with the [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], Massachusetts, based marketing company, Elensys. According to the ''Post'', Elensys received information on specific prescription drugs that individual CVS customers had purchased and used this information to send targeted direct mailings urging customers to renew prescriptions and promoting other products in which they might be interested. CVS and Elensys argued that there were no privacy issues because Elensys was acting solely as a [[independent contractor|contractor]] to CVS, and because the purpose of the mailings was to educate consumers. CVS claimed that it never shared customers' [[medical history|medical histories]] with Elensys (despite the Washington Post's indirect evidence that they had). George D. Lundberg, editor of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', called the practice "a gross invasion" of [[privacy]]. Following a firestorm of criticism and complaints by consumers, CVS discontinued the relationship with Elensys, and moved the practice in-house.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Rhode Island Senate corruption case===
In 2008, two former CVS executives, John R. "Jack" Kramer and Carlos Ortiz, were charged with 20 counts of mail fraud, bribery and conspiracy in relation to Operation Dollar Bill, a probe of corruption in the Rhode Island General Assembly. Kramer and Ortiz hired former State Senator John Celona, who currently is serving 2Â½ years on corruption charges involving CVS and other companies, as a media consultant for $12,000 a year. Celona was known for walking out on a pharmacy choice vote in the state senate while on the CVS payroll. Despite originally claiming CVS never bought any favors in his own trial, he testified against Kramer and Ortiz as the prosecution's star witness. On May 31, 2008, Kramer and Ortiz were acquitted on all counts. One juror went on the record as saying "My perception living in Rhode Island all my life is, 'Yeah, this probably did go on', but I didn't see any proof beyond a reasonable doubt that CVS did this."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/CVS_TRIAL_31_05-31-08_6QABEJK_v23.349c5ed.html |newspaper=Providence Journal |date=May 31, 2008 |title=Kramer, Ortiz innocent}}</ref>

On May 4, 2010, CVS Caremark Corp. announced that its business practices were being investigated by a group of 24 states, along with the District of Columbia and Los Angeles County.

Other pharmacy customers in Florida averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011, noted that "approximately every third car that came through the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone". According to the DEA, a pharmacist at that location stated to investigators that "her customers often requested certain brands of oxycodone using street slang", an indicator that the drugs were being diverted and not used for legitimate pain management. In response, CVS in a statement issued February 17 in response to opioid trafficking questions from ''[[USA Today]]'' said the company is committed to working with the DEA and had taken "significant actions to ensure appropriate dispensing of painkillers in Florida".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-02-27/painkiller-abuse-DEA/53275844/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=2012-02-27}}</ref>

===Opioid crisis===
In September 2016, Massachusetts Attorney General [[Maura Healey]] announced a $795,000 settlement where CVS agrees to check a state database before filling the prescription for addictive [[opioids]] and other controlled substances. The settlement resolves previous allegations that the drugstore chain failed to provide pharmacists with access to the state of Massachusetts Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP).<ref>{{cite news |last=Swasey |first=Benjamin |last2=Newsroom |first2=Staff |url=http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2016/09/01/cvs-healey-opioids-settlement |title=In Settlement With Mass., CVS Agrees To Strengthen Policies Around Dispensing Opioids |work=WBUR-FM |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-02 }}</ref>

=== CFI lawsuit for consumer fraud ===
In July 2018, the [[Center for Inquiry]] filed a lawsuit against CVS for consumer fraud over its sale of homeopathic medicines. According to Nicholas Little, CFI's Vice President and General Counsel: "Homeopathy is a total sham, and CVS knows it. Yet the company persists in deceiving its customers about the effectiveness of homeopathic products. Homeopathics are shelved right alongside scientifically-proven medicines, under the same signs for cold and flu, pain relief, sleep aids, and so on. If you search for 'flu treatment' on their website, it even suggests homeopathics to you, CVS is making no distinction between those products that have been vetted and tested by science, and those that are nothing but snake oil." The filing in part contends that apart from being a waste of money, choosing homeopathic treatments to the exclusion of evidence-based medicines can result in worsened or prolonged symptoms, and in some cases, even death.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=CENTER FOR INQUIRY SUES CVS FOR FRAUD OVER SALE OF HOMEOPATHIC FAKE MEDICINE |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/press_releases/cfi-sues-cvs/ |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=July 9, 2018 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>
