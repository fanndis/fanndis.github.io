A '''think tank''', or '''policy institute''', is a [[research institute]] that performs [[research]] and [[advocacy]] concerning topics such as [[social policy]], [[political strategy]], [[economics]], [[military]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]. Most think tanks are [[non-governmental organizations]], but some are semi-autonomous agencies within government or are associated with particular political parties or businesses. Think-tank funding often includes a combination of millionaire donations and individual contributions, with many also accepting government grants.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=McGann|first1=James G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEsr4yEGZEsC&pg=PA51|title=Think Tanks and Civil Societies: Catalysts for Ideas and Action|last2=Weaver|first2=Robert Kent|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3989-1|pages=51|language=en}}</ref>

Think tanks publish articles, studies or even draft legislation on particular matters of policy or society. This information is then readily used by governments, businesses, media organizations, social movements or other interest groups as part of their goals.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Frank|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAbOBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|title=Handbook of Public Policy Analysis: Theory, Politics, and Methods|last2=Miller|first2=Gerald J.|date=2006-12-21|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-1700-7|pages=149–157|language=en|chapter=Public Policy Analysis and Think Tanks, by Diane Stone}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Selee|first=Andrew Dan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25iBPUBkSVwC&pg=PA41|title=What Should Think Tanks Do?: A Strategic Guide to Policy Impact|date=2013-07-31|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-8929-5|pages=41|language=en}}</ref> Think tanks range from those associated with highly academic or scholarly activities to those that are overtly ideological and pushing for particular policy, with widely differing quality of research among them.

== History ==

According to historian [[Jacob Soll]], the term "think tank" is modern, but "it can be traced to the humanist academies and scholarly networks of the 16th and 17th centuries."<ref name="Royal Propaganda">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/222421/think-tanks-jacob-soll-propaganda|title=How Think Tanks Became Engines of Royal Propaganda|newspaper=Tablet Magazine|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}</ref> Soll notes that "in Europe, the origins of think tanks go back to the 800s, when emperors and kings began arguing with the Catholic Church about taxes. A tradition of hiring teams of independent lawyers to advise monarchs about their financial and political prerogatives against the church spans from Charlemagne all the way to the 17th century, when the kings of France were still arguing about whether they had the right to appoint bishops and receive a cut of their income."<ref name="Royal Propaganda" /> He also writes, independent "research teams became common in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when states often depended on independent scholars and their expertise."<ref name="Royal Propaganda" />

Several major current think tanks were founded in the 19th century. For instance, the [[Royal United Services Institute]] was founded in 1831 in [[London]], the [[Fabian Society]] in 1884. The oldest American think tank, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], was founded in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1910 by philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Carnegie charged trustees to use the fund to "hasten the abolition of international war, the foulest blot upon our civilization."<ref>Edmund Jan Osmanczyk and Anthony Mango, ''Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements.'' London: Routledge, 2004.</ref> The [[Brookings Institution]] was founded shortly thereafter in 1916 by [[Robert S. Brookings]] and was conceived as a bipartisan "research center modeled on academic institutions and focused on addressing the questions of the federal government."<ref name=utnethinktank>{{cite journal

After 1945, the number of policy institutes increased, with many small new ones forming to express various issue and policy agendas. Until the 1940s, most think tanks were known only by the name of the institution. During the Second World War, think tanks were often referred to as "brain boxes"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Diane|title=Capturing the Political Imagination: Think Tanks and the Policy Process|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136309045|page=9}}</ref> after the slang term for skull.  

Before the 1950s, the phrase "think tank" did not refer to organizations.  From its first appearances in the 1890s up to the 1950s, the phrase was most commonly used in [[American English]] to colloquially and pejoratively refer to the [[human brain]] itself when commenting on an individual's failings (in the sense that something was wrong with that person's "think tank").<ref name="Medvetz_Page25">{{cite book |last1=Medvetz |first1=Thomas |title=Think Tanks in America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226517292 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuh_VuW1WisC&pg=PA25 |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref>  Around 1958, the first organization to be regularly described in published writings as "the Think Tank" (note the capitalization and the use of the definite [[Article (grammar)|article]]) was the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]].<ref name="Medvetz_Page26">{{cite book |last1=Medvetz |first1=Thomas |title=Think Tanks in America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226517292 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuh_VuW1WisC&pg=PA26 |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref>  However, the Center does not count itself as and is not perceived to be a think tank in the contemporary sense.<ref name="Medvetz_Page26" /> During the 1960s, the phrase "think tank" was attached more broadly to meetings of experts,<ref name="Medvetz_Page26" /> [[Digital electronic computer|electronic computers]],<ref name="Medvetz_Page27">{{cite book |last1=Medvetz |first1=Thomas |title=Think Tanks in America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226517292 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuh_VuW1WisC&pg=PA27 |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref> and independent military planning organizations.<ref name="Medvetz_Page26" />  The prototype and most prominent example of the third category was the [[RAND Corporation]], which was founded in 1946 as an offshoot of [[Douglas Aircraft]] and became an independent corporation in 1948.<ref name="Medvetz_Page70">{{cite book |last1=Medvetz |first1=Thomas |title=Think Tanks in America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226517292 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuh_VuW1WisC&pg=PA70 |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/2008-05-media/|title=In the Tank|last=Fetherling|first=George|date=2008-05-12|website=The Walrus|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>  In the 1970s, the phrase became more specifically defined in terms of RAND and its ilk.<ref name="Medvetz_Page28">{{cite book |last1=Medvetz |first1=Thomas |title=Think Tanks in America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226517292 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuh_VuW1WisC&pg=PA28 |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref> During the 1980s and 1990s, the phrase evolved again to arrive at its broader contemporary meaning of an independent public policy research institute.<ref name="Medvetz_Page28" /> 

For most of the 20th century, such institutes were found primarily in the United States, along with much smaller numbers in [[Canada]], the UK and Western Europe. Although think tanks had also existed in Japan for some time, they generally lacked independence, having close associations with government ministries or corporations. There has been a veritable proliferation of "think tanks" around the world that began during the 1980s as a result of globalization, the end of the [[Cold War]], and the emergence of transnational problems. Two-thirds of all the think tanks that exist today were established after 1970 and more than half were established since 1980.<ref name="McGann">{{cite web|last=McGann|first=James|title=Think Tanks and the Transnationalization of Foreign Policy|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/thinktanks.20021216.mcgann.transnationalforeignpolicy.html|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629131900/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/thinktanks.20021216.mcgann.transnationalforeignpolicy.html|archive-date=29 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The effect of [[Globalization|globalisation]] on the proliferation of think tanks is most evident in regions such as Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia, where there was a concerted effort by other countries to assist in the creation of independent public policy research organizations. A survey performed by the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute|Foreign Policy Research Institute's]] [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]] underscores the significance of this effort and documents the fact that most of the think tanks in these regions have been established since 1992. {{As of|2002|}}, there were more than 4,500 of these institutions around the world. Many of the more established think tanks, having been created during the Cold War, are focused on international affairs, security studies, and foreign policy.<ref name="McGann" />

== Types ==
Think tanks vary by ideological perspectives, sources of funding, topical emphasis and prospective consumers.<ref name=Singer>{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Washington's Think Tanks: Factories to Call Our Own|url=http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2010/0813_think_tanks_singer.aspx|publisher=the Brookings Institution|access-date=13 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821094149/http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2010/0813_think_tanks_singer.aspx|archive-date=21 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Some think tanks are partisan, such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative organization, and the [[Center for American Progress]], a liberal one. Others are more issue-oriented; the [[Tellus Institute]], for instance, emphasizes social and environmental topics.

The workings of think tanks are also defined by their funding sources and intended consumers. Some think tanks receive direct government assistance, while others rely on private individual or corporate donors.  This invariably affects the degree of academic freedom within each policy institute and to whom or what the institution feels beholden.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Funding may also represent who or what the institution wants to influence; in the United States, for example, "Some donors want to influence votes in Congress or shape public opinion, others want to position themselves or the experts they fund for future government jobs, while others want to push specific areas of research or education."<ref name="Singer" />

A new trend, resulting from [[globalization]], is collaboration between policy institutes in different countries. For instance, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] operates offices in Washington, D.C., Beijing, Beirut, Brussels and Moscow.<ref name="Singer" />

The [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]] (TTCSP) at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], led by Dr. [[James McGann]], annually rates policy institutes worldwide in a number of categories and presents its findings in the [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program#Global Go To Think Tank Index|Global Go-To Think Tanks]] rating index.<ref name="Go-To Think Tanks 2010">{{cite web|last=McGann|first=James|title=The Global "Go-To Think Tanks"|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2010.pdf|publisher=the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program}}</ref> However, this method of the study and assessment of policy institutes has been criticized by researchers such as Enrique Mendizabal and Goran Buldioski, Director of the Think Tank Fund, assisted by the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Institute]].<ref name=Mendizabal>{{cite web|last=Mendizabal|first=Enrique|title=Another year, another ranking of think tanks (and surprise surprise, Brookings is still the best)|url=http://onthinktanks.org/2011/01/21/another-year-another-ranking-of-think-tanks-and-surprise-surprise-brookings-is-still-the-best/|publisher=On Think Tanks|access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=Buldioski>{{cite web|last=Buldioski|first=Goran|title=Mirror, mirror on the wall... tell me who is the best think tank in the world?|url=http://goranspolicy.com/mirror-mirror-wall-tank-world/|publisher=Goran's Musings|access-date=28 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113024736/http://goranspolicy.com/mirror-mirror-wall-tank-world/|archive-date=13 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Several authors have indicated a number of different methods of describing policy institutes in a way that takes into account regional and national variations. For example:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adbi.org/discussion-paper/2005/09/09/1356.think.tanks/think.tanks.definitions.development.and.diversification/|title=Think Tanks: Definitions, Development and Diversification|date=6 February 2007|access-date=19 February 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206171015/http://www.adbi.org/discussion-paper/2005/09/09/1356.think.tanks/think.tanks.definitions.development.and.diversification/|archive-date=6 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Advocacy by think tanks ==
In some cases, corporate interests<ref>{{cite news |title=Researchers or Corporate Allies?

According to the [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], both left-wing and right-wing policy institutes are often quoted and rarely identified as such. The result is that think tank "experts" are sometimes depicted as neutral sources without any ideological predispositions when, in fact, they represent a particular perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1425 |title=What's in a Label? |publisher=FAIR |date=1999-02-22 |access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3322 |title=The Incredible Shrinking Think Tank |publisher=FAIR |date=1999-02-22 |access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> In the United States, think tank publications on education are subjected to expert review by the [[National Education Policy Center]]'s "Think Twice" think tank review project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/think-tank-review-project |title=Think Tank Review Project &#124; National Education Policy Center |publisher=Nepc.colorado.edu |access-date=2011-11-02}}</ref>

A 2014 ''[[New York Times]]'' report asserted that foreign governments buy influence at many United States think tanks. According to the article: "More than a dozen prominent Washington research groups have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years while pushing United States government officials to adopt policies that often reflect the donors’ priorities."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Eric Lipton|author2=Brooke Williams|author3=Nicholas Confessore|title=Foreign Powers Buy Influence at Think Tanks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html|access-date=6 December 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 September 2014}}</ref>

{{Main|List of think tanks}}

=== African think tanks ===

==== Ghana ====
Ghana's first president, Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], set up various state-supported think tanks in the 1960s. By the 1990s, a variety of policy research centers sprang up in Africa set up by academics who sought to influence public policy in Ghana.

One such think tank was [[The Institute of Economic Affairs, Ghana]], which was founded in 1989 when the country was ruled by the [[Provisional National Defence Council]]. The IEA undertakes and publishes research on a range of economic and governance issues confronting [[Ghana]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  It has also been involved in bringing political parties together to engage in dialogue. In particular it has organised Presidential debates every election year since the [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1996]].

The [[Romanian Academic Society]] (SAR), founded in 1996, is a Romanian think tank for policy research.

==== Serbia ====
The Foundation for the Advancement of Economics (FREN) was founded in 2005 by the [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade University]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]].

==== Slovakia ====
Besides the international think tanks present in the surrounding countries as well (with [[Open Society Foundations]] being the most notable one) Slovakia has a host of its own think tanks as well. Some of the think tanks in Slovakia focus on public policy issues, such as [[Institute of Public Affairs]] (''Inštitút pre verejné otázky'' or ''IVO'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) or [[Central European Labour Studies Institute]] (''Stredoeurópsky inštitút pre výskum práce'' or ''CELSI'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]). Others specialize on human rights issues such as minority protection, for example [[Forum Minority Research Institute]] (''Fórum Kisebbségkutató Intézet'' or ''Fórum Intézet'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''Fórum inštitút pre výskum menšín'' or ''Fórum inštitút'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]). Since some of the Slovak think tanks are perceived to be associated with [[right-wing]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties of Slovakia (with the perception being particularly strong among Slovak [[nationalism|nationalists]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/199|title=Res publica|author=Pavel Kapusta|language=sk|publisher=Extra Plus|date=November 2008|access-date=2012-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606151919/http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/199|archive-date=6 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> findings and proposals made by these organizations are generally resented or ignored by left-wing supporters and nationalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/1574|title=Mesežnikovov barometer|language=sk|author=Ľudovít Števko|publisher=Extra Plus|date=August 2011|access-date=2012-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606164210/http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/1574|archive-date=6 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Spain ====
The [[Elcano Royal Institute]] was created in 2001 following the example of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in the UK, although it is closely linked to (and receives funding from) the government in power<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Chatham House|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about|website=Chatham House|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>.

More independent but clearly to the left of the political spectrum are the Centro de Investigaciones de Relaciones Internacionales y Desarrollo (CIDOB) founded in 1973; and the Fundación para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Diálogo Exterior (FRIDE) established in 1999 by Diego Hidalgo and main driving force behind projects such as the Club de Madrid, a group of democratic former heads of state and government, the Foreign Policy Spanish Edition and [[DARA (international organization)]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Former Prime Minister [[José Maria Aznar]] presides over the Fundación para el Analisis y los Estudios Sociales ([[FAES]]), a policy institute that is associated with the conservative Popular Party (PP). Also linked to the PP is the Grupo de Estudios Estratégicos (GEES), which is known for its defense- and security-related research and analysis. For its part, the [[Fundación Alternativas]] is independent but close to left-wing ideas. The Socialist [[Partido Socialista Obrero Español]] (PSOE) created Fundación Ideas in 2009 and dissolved it in January 2014. Also in 2009, the centrist [[Union, Progress and Democracy]] (UPyD) created Fundación Progreso y Democracia (FPyD).

==== Sweden ====
[[Timbro]] is a [[free market]] think tank and book publisher based in [[Stockholm]].

==== Ukraine ====
There are more than 100 registered think tanks in [[Ukraine]]. For example:

* [[Centre of Policy and Legal Reform]] (CPLR)
* [[Razumkov Centre]] is a non-governmental think tank founded in 1994. It carries out research of public policy in the following spheres: domestic policy; state administration; economic policy; energy; land relations; foreign policy; social policy; international and regional security; national security and defense.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{See also|List of think tanks in the United Kingdom}}
In Britain, think tanks play a similar role to the United States, attempting to shape policy, and indeed there is some cooperation between British and American think tanks. For example, the London-based think tank [[Chatham House]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] were both conceived at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and have remained sister organisations.

The [[Bow Group]], founded in 1951, is the oldest centre-right think tank and many of its members have gone on to serve as Members of Parliament or Members of the European Parliament. Past chairmen have included [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Michael Howard]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s longest-serving Cabinet Minister [[Geoffrey Howe]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]] and former [[British Telecom]] chairman [[Christopher Bland]].

=== Transcontinental countries (Asia-Europe) ===

==== Azerbaijan ====
According to research done by the University of Pennsylvania, there are a total of 12 think tanks in Azerbaijan.

[[The Center for Economic and Social Development]], or CESD; in [[Azeri|Azeri, Azerbaijan]], İqtisadi və Sosial İnkişaf Mərkəzi (İSİM) is an [[Azeri]] think tank, [[non-profit organization]], [[NGO]] based in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan. The Center was established in 2005. CESD focuses on policy advocacy and reform, and is involved with policy research and capacity building.

The [[Economic Research Center]] (ERC) is a policy-research oriented non-profit think tank established in 1999 with a mission to facilitate sustainable economic development and good governance in the new public management system of Azerbaijan. It seeks to do this by building favorable interactions between the public, private and civil society and working with different networks both in local (EITI NGO Coalition, National Budget Group,  Public Coalition Against Poverty, etc.) and international levels (PWYP, IBP, ENTO, ALDA, PASOS,  WTO NGO Network etc.).{{Citation needed|reason=While this is all very likely true, I cannot find references other than the website.|date=August 2011}}

The [[Center for Strategic Studies under the President of Azerbaijan]] is a governmental, non-profit think tank founded in 2007. It focusses on domestic and foreign policy.

==== Russia ====
According to the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]], Russia has 112 think tanks, while Russian think tanks claimed four of the top ten spots in 2011's "Top Thirty Think Tanks in Central and Eastern Europe".<ref name="fpri2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2011.pdf|date=24 March 2012|access-date=19 February 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324070825/http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2011.pdf|archive-date=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Notable Russian think tanks include:
* [[Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation]]
* [[Carnegie Moscow Center]]
*[[Institute for US and Canadian Studies]]
*[[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]]
*[[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]]

==== Turkey ====
[[Turkish think tanks]] are relatively new.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} There are at least 20 think tanks in the country, both independent and supported by government. Many of them are sister organizations of political parties, universities or companies some are independent and others are supported by government. Most Turkish think tanks provide research and ideas, yet they play less important roles in policy making than American think tanks. Turksam, Tasam and the ''[[Journal of Turkish Weekly]]'' are the leading information sources.

The oldest and most influential think tank in Turkey is ESAM (The Center for Economic and Social Research; {{lang-tr|Ekonomik ve Sosyal Araştırmalar Merkezi}}) which was established in 1969 and has headquarters in Ankara. There are also branch offices of ESAM in Istanbul, Bursa, Konya and elsewhere. ESAM has strong international relationships, especially with Muslim countries and societies. Ideologically it performs policies, produces ideas and manages projects in parallel to [[Milli Görüş]] and also influences political parties and international strategies. The founder and leader of Milli Görüş, [[Necmettin Erbakan]], was very concerned with the activities and brainstorming events of ESAM. In The Republic of Turkey, two presidents, four prime ministers, various ministers, many members of the parliament, and numerous mayors and bureaucrats have been members of ESAM. Currently the General Chairman of ESAM is [[Recai Kutan]] (former minister for two different ministries, former main opposition party leader, and founder and General Chairman of the [[Saadet Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation]] (TESEV) is another leading think-thank. Established in 1994, TESEV is an independent non-governmental think-tank, analyzing social, political and economic policy issues facing Turkey. TESEV has raised issues about Islam and democracy, combating corruption, state reform, and transparency and accountability. TESEV serve as a bridge between academic research and policy-making. Its core program areas are democratization, good governance, and foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tesev.org.tr/eng/|title=TESEV Türkiye Ekonomik ve Sosyal Etüdler Vakfı|date=25 April 2001|access-date=19 February 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425173927/http://www.tesev.org.tr/eng/|archive-date=25 April 2001|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Other notable Turkish think tanks are the [[International Strategic Research Organisation]] (USAK),  the [[Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research]] (SETA), and the [[Turkish think tanks#BİLGESAM|Wise Men Center for Strategic Studies]] (BİLGESAM).

*[[Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas|CIDE]] - A think tank institute focussing on "public policies", "public choice", "democracy", and "economy".

==== United States ====
{{See also|List of think tanks in the United States}}

As the classification is most often used today, the oldest American think tank is the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], founded in 1910.<ref name="Thomas Medvetz 2012">Thomas Medvetz, "'Think Tanks in America" (2012) Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press</ref> The Institute for Government Research, which later merged with two organizations to form the [[Brookings Institution]], was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the [[Hoover Institution]] (1919), [[Twentieth Century Fund|The Twentieth Century Fund]] (1919, and now known as the Century Foundation), the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (1920), the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (1921), and the [[Social Science Research Council]] (1923). The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the [[National Planning Association]] (1934), the [[Tax Foundation]] (1937),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Tax Foundation|access-date=2015-04-14}}</ref> and the [[Committee for Economic Development]] (1943).<ref name="Thomas Medvetz 2012" />

In collaboration with the Douglas Aircraft Company, the Air Force set up the [[RAND Corporation]] in 1946 to develop weapons technology and strategic defense analysis.

More recently, progressive and liberal think tanks have been established, most notably the [[Center for American Progress]] and the Center for Research on Educational Access and Leadership (CREAL). The organization has close ties to former United States President [[Barack Obama]] and other prominent Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/center-for-america-progress-group-tied-to-obama-accused-of-anti-semitic-language/2012/01/17/gIQAcrHXAQ_story.html|title=Center for American Progress, group tied to Obama, under fire from Israel advocates|last1=Wallstein|first1=Peter|date=19 January 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=26 February 2014}}</ref>

Think tanks help shape both foreign and domestic policy. They receive funding from private donors, and members of private organizations. By 2013, the largest 21 think tanks in the US spent more than $1 billion per year.<ref name="Funding">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Rick|date=12 December 2014|title=The Inner Workings of Think Tanks: Transparify Gives Us a Good Look|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/25317-the-inner-workings-of-think-tanks-transparify-gives-us-a-good-look.html|journal=Nonprofit Quarterly|access-date=21 December 2014}}</ref> Think tanks may feel more free to propose and debate controversial ideas than people within government. The progressive media watchgroup [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) has identified the top 25 think tanks by media citations, noting that from 2006 to 2007 the number of citations declined 17%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3322|title=The Incredible Shrinking Think Tank|date=1999-02-22|website=Fair.org|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> The FAIR report reveals the ideological breakdown of the citations: 37% conservative, 47% centrist, and 16% liberal. Their data show that the most-cited think tank was the [[Brookings Institution]], followed by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]], [[The Heritage Foundation]], and the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].

Recently in response to scrutiny about think tanks appearing to have a "conflict of interest" or lack transparency, executive vice president, Martin S. Indyk of Brookings Institution – the "most prestigious think tank in the world"<ref name="NYT_2016_Lipton">{{cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/2bbXNNk|title=Researchers or Corporate Allies? Think Tanks Blur the Line|last1=Lipton|first1=Eric|date=7 August 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|last2=Williams|first2=Brooke}}</ref> – admitted that they had "decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions." In August 2016, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a series on think tanks that blur the line.  One of the cases the journalists cited was Brookings, where scholars paid by a seemingly independent think tank "push donors' agendas amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington." For example, in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars the Brookings Institution provided the publicly-traded company [[Lennar Corporation]] – one of the United States' largest home builders – with a significant advantage in pursuing their $US8 billion revitalization project in Hunters Point, San Francisco. In 2014 Lennar's then-regional vice president in charge of the San Francisco revitalization, Kofi Bonner in 2014, was named as a Brookings senior fellow – a position as 'trusted adviser' that carries some distinction. Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, also offered to help Lennar Corporation "engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar's innovative approach."<ref name="NYT_2016_Lipton" />

==== Government ====
Government think tanks are also important in the United States, particularly in the security and defense field. These include the Center for Technology and National Security Policy at the [[National Defense University]], the Center for Naval Warfare Studies at the [[Naval War College]], and the [[Strategic Studies Institute]] at the [[U.S. Army War College]].

The government funds, wholly or in part, activities at approximately 30 [[Federally Funded Research and Development Centers]] (FFRDCs). FFRDCs, are unique independent nonprofit entities sponsored and funded by the United States government to meet specific long-term technical needs that cannot be met by any other single organization. FFRDCs typically assist government agencies with scientific research and analysis, systems development, and systems acquisition. They bring together the expertise and outlook of government, industry, and academia to solve complex technical problems. These FFRDCs include the [[RAND Corporation]], the [[MITRE Corporation]], the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], the [[Aerospace Corporation]], the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], and other organizations supporting various departments within the United States Government.

Similar to the above quasi-governmental organizations are [[Federal Advisory Committee Act|Federal Advisory Committees]]. These groups, sometimes referred to as commissions, are a form of think tank dedicated to advising the US Presidents or the Executive branch of government. They typically focus on a specific issue and as such, might be considered similar to special interest groups. However, unlike special interest groups these committees have come under some oversight regulation and are required to make formal records available to the public. Approximately 1,000 these advisory committees are described in the FACA searchable database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fido.gov/facadatabase/search.asp|title=Search Page|date=18 November 2002|access-date=19 February 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021118003800/http://fido.gov/facadatabase/search.asp|archive-date=18 November 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== South American think tanks ===
Research done by Enrique Mendizabal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/events/2009/03/10/443-think-tanks-political-parties.pdf|title=Think tanks and political parties in Latin America, Background Paper|author=Mendizabal Enrique|date=2009|website=Odi.org.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> shows that South American think tanks play various roles depending on their origins, historical development and relations to other policy actors. In this study, Orazio Bellettini from [[Grupo FARO]] suggests that they:<ref>Mendizabal, Enrique y Kristen Sample (eds) (2009) Dime a quien escuchas... Think Tanks y Partidos Politicos en America Latina, ODI/IDEA: Lima</ref>

# Seek political support for policies.
# Legitimize policies – This has been clearer in [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. New governments in Ecuador and Peru have approached policy institutes for support for already defined policies. In Bolivia, the government of [[Evo Morales]] has been working with Non-Government Organizations ([[NGO]]s) and other research institutes to do the same. However, in Chile, many think tanks during the 1990s seemed to endorse and maintain the legitimacy of policies implemented during the previous decade by [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|the military dictatorship]] headed by Pinochet.
# Spaces of debate – In this case think tanks serve as sounding boards for new policies. In [[Chile]], during the Pinochet dictatorship, many left wing intellectuals and researchers found ‘asylum’ in think tanks. In Ecuador, think tanks are seen as spaces where politicians can test the soundness of their policies and government plans.
# Financial channels for political parties or other interest groups – In Ecuador and Bolivia, German foundations have been able to provide funds to think tanks that work with certain political parties. This method has provided support to the system as a whole rather than individual CSOs.
# Expert cadres of policy-makers and politicians – In Peru after the end of the [[Alberto Fujimori|Fujimori]] regime, and in Chile after the fall of Pinochet, think tank staff left to form part of the new governments. In the United States, the role of major think tanks is precisely that: host scholars for a few months or years and then lose them to government employ.

How a policy institute addresses these largely depends on how they work, their ideology vs. evidence credentials, and the context in which they operate including funding opportunities, the degree and type of competition they have and their staff.

This functional method addresses the inherit challenge of defining a think tank. As Simon James said in 1998, "Discussion of think tanks...has a tendency to get bogged down in the vexed question of defining what we mean by ‘think tank’—an exercise that often degenerates into futile semantics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/A2A2BA10-B135-DE11-AFAC-001CC477EC70/|title="Think Tanks as an Emergent Field" — Publication — Social Science Research Council|publisher=Ssrc.org|access-date=2011-11-02}}</ref> It is better (as in the Network Functions Approach) to describe what the organisation should do. Then the shape of the organisation should follow to allow this to happen. The following framework (based on Stephen Yeo's description of think tanks’ mode of work) is described in Enrique Mendizabal's blog "onthinktanks":

First, policy institutes may work in or base their funding on one or more of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onthinktanks.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/on-the-business-model/|title=on the business model and how this affects what think tanks do « on think tanks|publisher=Onthinktanks.wordpress.com|access-date=2011-11-02}}</ref>

# Independent research: this would be work done with core or flexible funding that allows the researchers the liberty to choose their research questions and method. It may be long term and could emphasize ‘big ideas’ without direct policy relevance.  However, it could emphasize a major policy problem that requires a thorough research and action investment.
# Consultancy: this would be work done by commission with specific clients and addressing one or two major questions. Consultancies often respond to an existing agenda.
# Influencing/advocacy: this would be work done by communications, capacity development, networking, campaigns, lobbying, etc. It is likely to be based on research based evidence emerging from independent research or consultancies.

Second, policy institutes may base their work or arguments on:

# Ideology, values or interests
# Applied, empirical or synthesis research
# Theoretical or academic research

According to the [[National Institute for Research Advancement]], a Japanese policy institute, think tanks are "one of the main policy actors in democratic societies ..., assuring a pluralistic, open and accountable process of policy analysis, research, decision-making and evaluation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/nwdtt/2005/intro/intro2002.html|title=NIRA's World Directory of Think Tanks 2002: Introduction|date=2 May 2006|access-date=19 February 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502051923/http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/nwdtt/2005/intro/intro2002.html|archive-date=2 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A study in early 2009 found a total of 5,465 think tanks worldwide.

==== Argentina ====
As of 2009, [[Science and technology in Argentina|Argentina]] is home to 122 think tanks, many specializing in [[public policy]] and [[economics]] issues. Argentina ranks fifth in the number of these institutions worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/01/25/sociedad/s-01846328.htm|title=Argentina, quinto país en el mundo en centros de estudio|date=2009-01-25|website=Clarin.com|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref>

==== Brazil ====
Working on public policies, Brazil hosts, for example, [[Instituto Liberdade]], a University-based Center at Tecnopuc inside the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul]], located in the South Region of the country, in the city of [[Porto Alegre]]. Instituto Liberdade is among the Top 40 think tanks in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the 2009 Global Go To Think Tanks Index<ref name="Go-To Think Tanks 2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2009.pdf|title=The Global "Go-To Think Tanks"|last=McGann|first=James|publisher=the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019080932/http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2009.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a report from the University of Pennsylvania's Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP).

[[Fundação Getulio Vargas]] (Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV)) is a Brazilian higher education institution. Its original goal was to train people for the country's public- and private-sector management. Today it hosts faculties (Law, Business, Economics, Social Sciences and Mathematics), libraries, and also research centers in Rio, São Paulo and Brasilia. It is considered by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to be a top-5 "policymaker think-tank" worldwide.

The [[Igarapé Institute]] is a Brazilian think tank focusing on public security and policing.
