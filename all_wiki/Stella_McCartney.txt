'''Stella Nina McCartney''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 13 September 1971) is an English fashion designer. She is the daughter of English singer-songwriter [[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]] and his late wife, [[Citizenship of the United States|American]] photographer, musician, and [[animal rights]] activist [[Linda McCartney|Linda]]. Like her parents, McCartney is a firm supporter of [[animal rights]] and is particularly known for her use of vegetarian and animal-free alternatives in her work.

==Early life==
McCartney was born on 13 September 1971 by [[Caesarean section]] at [[King's College Hospital]] in London,<ref>http://beatlechildren.tripod.com/stella.html</ref>. She is named after her maternal great-grandmothers (both of Linda's grandmothers were named Stella). As a girl, McCartney travelled the globe with her parents and their group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], along with her siblings: older half-sister [[Heather McCartney|Heather]] (who was legally adopted by ex-Beatle Paul), older sister [[Mary McCartney|Mary]], and younger brother [[James McCartney|James]]. According to her father, the name of Wings was inspired by Stella's difficult delivery.<ref name=Diary/> As his daughter was being born by emergency [[caesarean section]], Paul sat outside the operating room and prayed that she be born 'on the wings of an angel'.<ref name=Diary>{{cite book|editor1=Miles, Barry |editor2=Badman, Keith |title=The Beatles Diary After the Break-Up: 1970–2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Music Sales Group |location=London |isbn=9780711983076 |edition=reprint}}</ref> Her mother was Jewish.<ref>https://forward.com/culture/186536/secret-history-of-paul-mccartney-the-jewish-beatle/</ref>

Despite their fame, the McCartneys wanted their children to lead as normal a life as possible, so Stella and her siblings attended local state schools in [[East Sussex]], one of them being [[Bexhill College]]. McCartney has said that while attending state school, she was a victim of [[bullying]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/stella%20mccartney%20wants%20son%20to%20go%20private |title= Stella Mccartney Wants Son To Go Private |magazine= Contactmusic.com |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> and had been a bully herself.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/stella%20looks%20for%20private%20school |title=Stella Mccartney – Stella Looks For Private School |magazine=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref>

==Career==

===Beginning===
McCartney became interested in designing clothes as a youth. At the age of 13, she designed her first jacket. Three years later, she interned for [[Christian Lacroix]], working on her first [[haute couture]] collection, honing her skills working for [[Edward Sexton]] (her father's [[Savile Row]] tailor) for a number of years.

McCartney studied her foundation at [[Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication]], followed by Fashion Design at [[Central Saint Martins]] in the early 1990s, graduating in 1995. Her graduation collection was modelled for free by friends and supermodels [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Yasmin Le Bon]] and [[Kate Moss]], at the graduation runway show, presented to a song especially written by her father, "Stella May Day".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D9143CF937A25755C0A963958260 |title=Chronicle | work= The New York Times |date=14 June 1995 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref>

A lifelong vegetarian, McCartney uses no leather or fur in her designs. ''[[The Guardian]]'' described her in 2015 as a 'consistent and vocal' supporter of animal rights.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hoskins|first1=Tansy|title=Stella McCartney's fake-fur coats are worlds away from the brutal fur trade|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/13/stella-mccartney-fake-fur-coats-brutal-trade|accessdate=19 May 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 2015}}</ref> Some of McCartney's designs have text that elaborates on her 'no animal' policy; one of her [[Adidas]] jackets carries a sleeve that says 'suitable for sporty vegetarians'. A pair of her vinyl and [[ultrasuede]] boots were marketed specifically as [[Vegan design|vegan-friendly]], though her use of oil-based synthetics still raised ecological concerns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thigh high boots by Stella McCartney, c.2005|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1247537/boots-stella-mccartney/|website=V&A Search the Collections|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref>

In 1997 McCartney was named as the creative director of Chloe, a position she held until 2001.
