==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2019}}
José Marcelo Ejercito was born at 8:25 pm on April 19, 1937 at Manuguit Maternity Hospital (now known as Amisola Maternity Hospital) in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], an urban district of [[Manila]]. His family later moved to the wealthy suburb of San Juan. He belonged to a wealthy family, and was the eighth of ten children of Emilio Ejercito Sr. (1898–1977) and his wife, [[Mary Ejercito|Maria Marcelo]] (1905–2009). After graduating from the Ateneo elementary school in 1951, he was expelled during his second year of secondary studies at the Ateneo High School for disciplinary conduct. Later during college he enrolled in a Bachelor of Sciencs in Civil Engineering course at the Mapúa Institute of Technology in an effort to please his father. He would leave once again and later transferred to Central Colleges of the Philippines College of Engineering but dropped out.

In his twenties, he began a career as a drama actor, usually playing the role of the villain/antagonist. He adopted the stage name "Joseph Estrada", as his mother objected to his chosen career and his decision to quit schooling multiple times. He also acquired the nickname "Erap" (a play on the Tagalog slang "pare", meaning 'buddy') from his friend, fellow actor [[Fernando Poe Jr]].

==Career==
===Film actor===
{{Main|Joseph Estrada filmography}}

In 1974 Estrada founded the [[Movie Workers Welfare Foundation]] (Mowelfund), which helps filmmakers through medical reimbursements, hospitalization, surgery and death benefits, livelihood, and alternative income opportunities and housing. Its educational arm, the Mowelfund Film Institute, has produced some of the most skilled and respected producers, filmmakers, writers and performers in both the independent and mainstream sectors of the industry since its inception in 1979.<ref>Martinez-Belen, Crispina.

===Entry into politics===
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2012}}

====Mayor of San Juan====
Estrada entered politics in 1967, running for mayor of [[San Juan, Metro Manila]], then a municipality of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], failing and only succeeding in 1969 after winning an electoral protest against Braulio Sto. Domingo. His administration achieved many infrastructure developments. These included the establishment of the first Municipal High School, the Agora complex, a modern slaughterhouse, a sprawling government center with a post office, a mini-park and the paving of 98 percent of the town's roads and alleys.

As mayor, he paid particular attention to the elementary education of children by improving and renovating school buildings, constructing additional school structures, health centers, barangay halls and playgrounds in all the barangays and providing artesian wells to areas with low water supply. He relocated some 1,800 squatter families out of San Juan to Taytay, Rizal, at no cost. He was also the first mayor to computerize assessment of the Real Estate Tax in the Municipal Assessor's Office.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://erap.ph/speakson/erap_bio.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090728015822/http://erap.ph/speakson/erap_bio.htm|url-status=dead|title=Untitled Document|date=July 28, 2009|archivedate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> When [[Corazon Aquino]] assumed the presidency in 1986, all elected officials of the local government were forcibly removed and replaced by appointed officers-in-charge, including Estrada{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

====Senator of the Philippines====
The following year, Estrada won a seat in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] under the Grand Alliance for Democracy (GAD) placing 16th in the elections (out of 24 winners). He was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Public Works. He was Vice-Chairman of the Committees on Health, Natural Resources and Ecology and Urban Planning.

In the Senate, Estrada was credited with the passage of, among other major pieces of legislation, the bills on irrigation project and the protection and propagation of [[carabao]]s, the beast of burden in the rural areas.

As a senator, he was one of the so-called "Magnificent 12" who voted to terminate the RP-US Military Bases Agreement leading to the withdrawal of American servicemen from the [[Clark Air Base]] in Pampanga and the [[Subic Naval Base]] in Zambales.

In 1989, the ''Free Press'' cited him as one of the Three Outstanding Senators of the Year. He was conferred the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa by the Bicol University in April 1997, and the University of Pangasinan in 1990.

==Vice presidency==
{{See also|Presidency of Fidel V. Ramos}}

In 1992, Joseph Estrada initially ran for president under the [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Partido ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP), with Vicente Rivera Jr. as his running mate and [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] as his campaign manager.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maragay|first=Fel V.|title=Stars call 'cut' to join Erap|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19920302&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|accessdate=November 16, 2020|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=March 2, 1992|page=2|quote=Fernando Poe, Jr., undisputed king of the local action movies and Estrada's campaign manager...}}</ref> He reluctantly withdrew his bid on March 30 due to financial issues and instead became the running mate of [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]] under the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]; Estrada expressed that the decision was "very painful, if not traumatic".<ref>{{cite news|last=Maragay|first=Fel V.|title=Erap joins Danding|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19920324&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|accessdate=November 16, 2020|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=March 30, 1992|page=2}}</ref> Though Cojuangco lost to former National Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]] for the presidency, Estrada won the vice-presidency garnering more votes than his closest opponent [[Marcelo Fernan]], [[Ramon Mitra Jr.]]'s running mate.

As vice president, Estrada was the chairman of President Ramos' Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC). Estrada arrested criminal warlords and kidnapping syndicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yehey.com/news/Article.aspx?id=181710|title=The rise and fall of Joseph Estrada – Yehey!

In the same year Estrada, together with former President [[Corazon Aquino]], Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], Senator [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] and other political leaders, led an anti-charter change rally brought in an estimated half a million people to Rizal Park against the charter change moves by Ramos and his supporters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/113427/Gloria-and-cha-cha|title=Gloria and cha-cha – Research – Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs – Latest Philippine News – BETA|work=[[GMA News]]|accessdate=October 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817170818/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/113427/Gloria-and-cha-cha|archive-date=August 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In early 1993, Estrada established Club 419 in Cafe Ysabel within [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] as a private men's club for him and his friends, including Poe.<ref>{{cite news|last=Japitana|first=Norma|title=Club 419 — The country's most exclusive|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19930205&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|accessdate=October 19, 2020|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=February 5, 1993|page=20}}</ref>

====Rebellion in Mindanao====
{{Main|2000 Philippine campaign against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front|Battle of Camp Abubakar}}
During the Ramos administration a cessation of hostilities agreement was signed between the Philippine Government and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in July 1997. This was continued by a series of peace talks and negotiations in Estrada administration.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The MILF, an Islamic group formed in 1977, seeks to be an independent Islamic State from the Philippines, and, despite the agreements, a sequence of terrorist attacks on the Philippine military and civilians still continued.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> These included the kidnapping of a foreign priest, namely Father Luciano Benedetti; the destruction by arson of Talayan, Maguindanao's municipal hall; the takeover of the Kauswagan Municipal Hall; the bombing of the Lady of Mediatrix boat at [[Ozamiz City]]; and the takeover of the Narciso Ramos Highway. By doing so, they inflicted severe damage on the country's image abroad, and scared much-needed investments away. For this reason, on
March 21, 2000, Estrada declared an "all out war" against the MILF. During the war the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) asked Estrada to negotiate a [[cease-fire]] with MILF, but Estrada opposed the idea arguing that a cease-fire would cause more terrorist attacks. For the next three months of the war, Camp Abubakar, headquarters of the MILF, fell along with other 13 major camps and 43 minor camps, and then all of which became under controlled by the government. The MILF leader Hashim Salamat fled to [[Malaysia]]. The MILF later declared a [[Jihad]] on the government. On July 10 of the same year, the President went to Minadanao and raised the Philippine flag symbolizing victory. After the war the President said, "...&nbsp;will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and lasting peace and development in Mindanao". In the middle of July the president ordered the military to arrest top MILF leaders.<ref name="peopledaily1">{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |title=Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters |website=People's Daily |date=July 10, 2000 |access-date=March 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813104359/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |archive-date=August 13, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In his [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|state of the nation address]], popularly called "SONA", the president highlighted his vision for Mindanao:
*The first is to restore and maintain peace in Mindanao—because without peace, there can be no development.
*The second is to develop Mindanao—because without development, there can be no peace.
*The third is to continue seeking peace talks with the MILF within the framework of the Constitution—because a peace agreed upon in good faith is preferable to a peace enforced by force of arms.
*And the fourth is to continue with the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF—because that is our commitment to our countrymen and to the international community.

In addition to this the president said his administration can move with more speed in transforming Mindanao into a progressive economic center.<ref name="peopledaily1" /> High on the list of priorities was the plight of MILF guerrillas who were tired of fighting and had no camps left to which to report. On October 5, 2000 the first massive surrender of 669 LC-MILF mujahideen led by the renegade vice mayor of Marugong, Lanao del Sur Malupandi Cosandi Sarip and seven other battalion commanders, surrendered to President Estrada at the 4th ID headquarters in Camp Edilberto Evangelista, Bgy. Patag, Cagayan de Oro City. They were followed shortly by a second batch of 855 surrenderees led by Lost command MILF Commander Sayben Ampaso on December 29, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/8068|title=''American Chronicle'', "AFP-MILF 2000 War in Mindanao Remembered"|publisher=Americanchronicle.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031038/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/8068|archivedate=March 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Foreign policies===
{{Main|Presidency_of_Joseph_Estrada#Foreign_Policies}}

===Economy===
By the end of Estrada's administration, debt supposedly reached P 2.1&nbsp;trillion in 1999. Domestic debt supposedly amounted to P 986.7&nbsp;billion while foreign debt stood at US$52.2&nbsp;billion. The fiscal deficit had reportedly doubled to more than P 100&nbsp;billion from a low of P 49&nbsp;billion in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iskandalo.com/article.html?id=264 |title=www.iskandalo.com |publisher=iskandalo.com |date=August 21, 1983 |access-date=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713061608/http://www.iskandalo.com/article.html?id=264 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref> Despite such setbacks, the GDP by 1999 posted a 3.2 percent growth rate, up from a low of −0.5 percent in 1998.

===Corruption charges and impeachment===
[[File:Joseph estrada 2000.jpg|thumb|150px|left|President Estrada in 2000.]]
In October 2000, [[Ilocos Sur]] governor [[Chavit Singson|Luis "Chavit" Singson]], a close friend of the President, alleged that he had personally given Estrada ₱400&nbsp;million as payoff from jueteng, a grassroots-based numbers game, hidden in a bank account known as "Jose Velarde", as well as ₱180&nbsp;million from the government price subsidy for the tobacco farmers' marketing cooperative after Estrada ordered a full blown investigation into Chavit Singson's alleged misuse of millions of pesos in public funds. Singson's allegation caused controversy across the nation, which culminated in the House of Representatives' filing of an impeachment case against Estrada on November 13, 2000. House Speaker [[Manny Villar]] fast-tracked the impeachment complaint. The impeachment suit was brought to the Senate and an impeachment court was formed, with Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] as presiding officer. Estrada pleaded "not guilty".

This was the first time the Filipino public witnessed, through radio and television, an elected president stand in trial and face possible impeachment with full media coverage. During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses and alleged pieces of evidence to the impeachment court regarding Estrada's alleged involvement in jueteng. The existence of secret bank accounts which he allegedly uses for receiving payoffs was also brought to the fore.

In the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Estrada made into the list of the World's All-Time Most Corrupt Leaders in the World. He was listed tenth and he was said to have amassed between $78&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004. |access-date=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726142725/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |archive-date=July 26, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report |publisher=Transparency International |access-date=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327002359/http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Also making it to the list from the [[Philippines]] is [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who ended up second in the list as he was said to have embezzled between $5&nbsp;billion to $10&nbsp;billion during his 21 years as president from 1965 to 1986.

===EDSA II===
{{Main|EDSA Revolution of 2001}}

====Protests====
On the evening of January 16, 2001, the impeachment court voted not to open an envelope that allegedly contained incriminating evidence against Estrada simply because it was not part of the impeachment complaint. The final vote was 11–10, in favor of keeping the envelope closed. The prosecution panel (of congressmen and lawyers) walked out of the impeachment court in protest of this vote. The 11 senators who voted not to open the envelope are known as the "Craven Eleven". That night, anti-Estrada protesters gathered in front of the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] at [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]], not too far away from the site of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos.

On January 19, 2001, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff [[Angelo Reyes]], seeing the political upheaval throughout the country, decided to "withdraw his support" of the president and pay his allegiance to the vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

====Resignation====
The following day, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant, saying that Estrada had resigned the office. At noon, the Chief Justice swore in Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president of the Philippines. Before Estrada's departure from [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang]], he issued the following press release:

{{cquote|At twelve o'clock noon today, Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took her oath as President of the Republic of the Philippines. While along with many other legal minds of our country, I have strong and serious doubts about the legality and constitutionality of her proclamation as President, I do not wish to be a factor that will prevent the restoration of unity and order in our civil society.

It is for this reason that I now leave Malacañang Palace, the seat of the presidency of this country, for the sake of peace and in order to begin the healing process of our nation. I leave the Palace of our people with gratitude for the opportunities given to me for service to our people. I will not shirk from any future challenges that may come ahead in the same service of our country.

I call on all my supporters and followers to join me in to promotion of a constructive national spirit of reconciliation and solidarity.

May the Almighty bless our country and beloved people. [[Mabuhay]]!<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2001/mar2001/gr_146710_2001.html |title=G.R.

==Post-Presidency==
Estrada returned to his old home in San Juan. He maintained that he never resigned, implying that Arroyo's government was illegitimate.

The new government created a special court and charged him with plunder and had him arrested in April. His supporters marched to the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] demanding Estrada's release and his reinstatement as president but were dispersed by high-grade teargas and warning shots from automatic rifles. On the morning of May 1, the protesters marched straight to [[Malacañang Palace]]. Violence erupted and the government declared a [[State of Rebellion]]. Many Filipino protesters were badly injured and arrested, including politicians. The government called out the military and was able to quell the demonstration with teargas and automatic rifles. The bloody uprising came to be known as [[EDSA III]].

Estrada was initially detained at the Veterans' Memorial Medical Center in [[Quezon City]] and then transferred to a military facility in [[Tanay, Rizal]], but he was later transferred to a nearby vacation home, virtually in house arrest. Under Philippine law, plunder had the maximum penalty of death; The death penalty was eventually repealed.

===Trial===
{{Main|Trial of Joseph Estrada}}

On September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan finally gave its decision, finding Estrada not guilty on his perjury case but guilty of plunder "beyond reasonable doubt". He was sentenced to ''[[reclusión perpetua]]''. He was thus the first Philippine President who was convicted of Plunder.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60117/Erap-guilty-of-plunder-sentenced-to-reclusión-perpetua "Erap guilty of plunder, sentenced to ''reclusión perpetua''"], gmanews.tv, September 12, 2007.</ref>

On September 26, 2007, Joseph Estrada appealed by filing a 63-page motion for reconsideration of the [[Sandiganbayan]] judgment penned by [[Teresita de Castro]] (submitting five legal grounds).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder |title=Monstersandcritics.com, Philippines' ex-president Estrada appeals conviction for plunder |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=September 26, 2007 |access-date=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812030703/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6271706.html |title=Convicted Philippine ex-president files reconsideration motion |website=People's Daily |date=September 26, 2007 |access-date=October 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121205352/http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6271706.html |archive-date=January 21, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Estrada alleged that the court erred "''when it convicted him by acquitting his alleged co-conspirators.''"<ref>{{cite news|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90841 |title=Estrada asks Sandiganbayan to reverse conviction, Cites acquittal of co-accused |access-date=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814030420/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90841 |archivedate=August 14, 2009 }}</ref>

On October 5, 2007, the Sandiganbayan's Special Division ruled to set on October 19 an [[oral argument]] (instead of a defense reply) on Joseph Estrada's motion for reconsideration. Estrada asked for the court's permission to attend the hearing, since it ordered the prosecution to file a comment before October 11.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trial |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/jun2001/am_01_4_03_sc.htm |access-date=August 26, 2018}}</ref>

===Perjury case===
[[File:JosephEstradajf1486.JPG|thumb|Estrada in 2012.]]

The [[Sandiganbayan]]'s special division, on June 27, 2008, ordered Estrada to file comment within 10 days, on the motion of the Ombudsman's Special Prosecutor to re-open the trial of his [[perjury]] case regarding 1999 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN). The court was also to resolve [[Banco de Oro]]'s (formerly Equitable PCI Bank), plea that it cannot determine "without hazard to itself" whom to turn over to the P1.1&nbsp;billion Jose Velarde assets due to claims by Wellex Group / William Gatchalian and a [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] stay order.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080627-145167/Estrada-told-to-reply-to-request-to-start-perjury-trial |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Estrada told to reply to request to start perjury trial |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923151851/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080627-145167/Estrada-told-to-reply-to-request-to-start-perjury-trial |archivedate=September 23, 2012 }}</ref>

===Pardon and release from detention===
On October 22, 2007, Acting Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera stated that Joseph Estrada is seeking a "''full, free, and unconditional pardon''" from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Estrada's lawyer Jose Flaminiano wrote Arroyo: "''The time has come to end President Estrada's fight for justice and vindication before the courts. Today [Monday], we filed a withdrawal of his Motion for Reconsideration.''" Estrada, 70, stressed the "''delicate condition''" of his mother in asking for pardon.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/22/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Estrada.php ''IHT'', Ousted Philippine president withdraws appeal for his plunder conviction, seeks pardon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517231504/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/22/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Estrada.php |date=May 17, 2008 }}</ref>

On October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted [[executive clemency]] to Joseph Estrada based on the recommendation by the Department of Justice (DoJ). Acting Executive Secretary and Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye quoted the signed Order: "''In view hereof in pursuant of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant Executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusión perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.''"
Bunye noted that Estrada committed in his application not to seek public office, and he would be free from his Tanay resthouse on October 26, noon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1368473.php/Philippine_leader_pardons_ex-president_Estrada__1st_Lead_|title=Philippine leader pardons ex-president Estrada|publisher=Monstersandcritics.com|date=October 25, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812031116/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1368473.php/Philippine_leader_pardons_ex-president_Estrada__1st_Lead_|archivedate=August 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96730|title=Inquirer.net, Arroyo grants pardon to Estrada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814075726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96730|archivedate=August 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/65884/Estrada-granted-pardon|title=Gmanews.tv, Estrada granted executive clemency|work=[[GMA News]]|access-date=October 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522024858/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/65884/Estrada-granted-pardon|archive-date=May 22, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> On October 26, 2007, after almost seven years of detention, Joseph Estrada was finally released after the [[Sandiganbayan]] promulgated the historical resolution.<ref>{{cite news|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96897 |title=Inquirer.net, Sandigan approves Estrada release|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814031645/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96897|archivedate=August 14, 2009}}</ref>
