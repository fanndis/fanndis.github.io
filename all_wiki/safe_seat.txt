{{Elections}}

A '''safe seat''' is an [[electoral district]] (constituency) in a [[legislature|legislative body]] (e.g. Congress, Parliament, City Council) which is regarded as fully secure, for either a certain [[political party]], or the [[incumbent]] representative personally or a combination of both. In such seats, there is very little chance of a seat changing hands because of the political leanings of the [[constituency|electorate]] in the [[constituency]] concerned and/or the popularity of the incumbent member. The opposite (i.e. more competitive) type of seat is a [[marginal seat]].

==Definition==
There is a spectrum between safe and marginal seats. Safe seats can still change hands in a [[landslide election]], such as [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield Southgate]] being lost by the Conservatives (and potential future party leader [[Michael Portillo]]) to Labour in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 UK general election]], whilst other seats may remain marginal despite large national swings, such as [[Gedling (UK Parliament constituency)|Gedling]], which Labour narrowly won in every election for twenty years until the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], despite having both major victories and defeats during this time. Gedling would still be seen as a marginal seat, even though it had been held by Labour for a long time. Safe seats are usually seats that have been held by one party for a long time, but the two concepts are not interchangeable.

In countries with parliamentary government, parties often try to ensure that their most talented or influential politicians are selected to contest these seats — in part to ensure that these politicians can stay in parliament, regardless of the specific election result, and that they can concentrate on [[minister (government)|ministerial]] roles without needing to spend too much effort on managing electorate-specific issues.

Unsurprisingly, candidate selection for a party's safe seats is usually keenly contested, although many parties restrict or forbid challenges to the nomination of sitting members. The selection process can see incumbent party, untroubled by the need to have a representative that must appeal to a broader electorate, take the opportunity to choose a candidate from the more ideological reaches of the membership. Opposing parties will often be compelled to nominate much less well-known individuals (such as backroom workers or youth activists in the party), who will sometimes do little more than serve as [[paper candidate]]s who do little or no campaigning, or will use the contest to gain experience so that they become more likely to be selected for a more winnable seat. In some cases (especially in the United States), these seats may go uncontested by other major parties.

Safe seats can become marginal seats (and vice versa) gradually as voter allegiances shift over time. However, this shift can happen more rapidly for a variety of reasons. The retirement or death of a popular sitting member may make a seat more competitive, as the accrued personal vote of a long-serving parliamentarian will sometimes have resisted countervailing demographic trends. An [[Independent politician|independent]] or third party candidate with an ideology close to that of the incumbent party may also be able to make a more credible challenge than more established parties, but these factors can combine: a retiring third-party member may turn a safe seat for that party into a marginal seat. For instance, in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]], with the retirement of the popular incumbent [[Alan Beith]], the seat was no longer safe for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Traditionally safe seats can also be more vulnerable in [[by-election]]s, especially for governing parties. Safe seats may also be marginal if the sitting member is involved in scandal: in 1997, [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] was gained from the Conservatives by an anti-sleaze [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate, despite the majority previously being that of a very safe seat for the Conservatives. The incumbent, [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]], had been mired in controversy, and was defeated by the veteran [[BBC]] journalist [[Martin Bell]]. However, Bell was aided by the decision of the main opposition parties (Labour and the Liberal Democrats) not to field candidates. Without such pacts, a [[Vote splitting|split vote]] is more likely under a [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] electoral system, as in the UK.

Opposition supporters in safe seats have restricted means to affect election outcomes, and thus the incumbent parties can, in theory, decide to ignore those supporters' concerns, as they have no direct effect on the election result. Even those voters who are moderate supporters of the incumbent party may be disenfranchised by having a representative whose views may be more extreme than their own. Political objectors in such areas may experience marginalisation from wider democratic processes and [[political apathy]]. This is often regarded as undemocratic, and is a major argument in favour of various multi-member [[proportional representation]] election methods. Safe seats may receive far less political funding than marginal seats, as the parties will attempt to "buy" marginal seats with funding (a process known in North America and Australia as "[[Pork barrel|Pork Barrelling]]") while ignoring safe seats which will reliably fall to the same party every time; this is especially true in cases where the safe seat is held by the minority party.

In countries that do not apply the first past the post system, many of which equally operate a geographic division-based system, selected or party sub-nominated candidates can be allocated a safer or more tenuous list position. If a party is strong enough nationwide to gather representations in all subdivisions, the top candidate(s) on each list tend to be very safely elected to parliament. This is seen in the extremely [[proportional representation|proportional]] election systems of the [[Nordic countries]], for example. Safe seats and candidates can be avoided altogether by a purposefully [[marginal seat|marginal]]-preference allocation of all divisions, ensuring all divisions are near-identically demographically diverse which may be achieved by pairing non-adjoining areas.

The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] defines seat margins as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/FAQs/Elections.htm|title=Elections – Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/australian_electoral_system/files/jscem/1998_election/sub88.pdf|title=Submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters: The Conduct of the 1998 Federal Election|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|date=12 March 1999}}</ref>

In his election analysis, [[Psephology|psephologist]] [[Antony Green]] puts the cutoff between "safe" and "very safe" at 12%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/qa.htm|title=Election Q&A|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|year=2010}}</ref>

In Australia's federal system, most rural seats are safe seats for either the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]. Conversely, inner-city and poorer suburban seats are typically safe [[Australian Labor Party]] seats, and a few of the most affluent inner-middle urban seats are held by the Liberal Party. Marginals are generally concentrated in the middle-class outer-suburban areas of Australia's larger state capitals, which therefore decide most Australian federal elections.

At the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], the governing [[Australian Labor Party]]'s safest seat was the seat of [[Division of Batman]] in [[Melbourne]]'s inner-northern suburbs, with a two-party-preferred margin of 26.0%. The safest seat for the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was the rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] electorate of [[Division of Murray|Murray]], with a margin of 18.3%. The Liberal Party's junior coalition partner, the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]]'s safest seat was the [[division of Mallee]], also located in rural Victoria, with a margin of 21.3%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/2007/pendulum2007.txt |author=Adam Carr |accessdate=2008-10-18 |title=2007 Australian federal election electoral pendulum }}</ref>

*[[Bow River (electoral district)|Bow River]], located in southern Alberta, is considered a safe seat for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. In the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], the Conservative candidate won by 77% of the vote.
*[[Central Nova]], located in east-central [[Nova Scotia]], which has previously been called a safe seat for the Conservative Party and its predecessor, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]], having been held by either [[Elmer MacKay]] or his son [[Peter MacKay|Peter]] for all but five of forty years until [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015]]. The only time the riding was not in Conservative control was from [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]] to [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]], when the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to just two seats nationwide and a [[Social conservatism in Canada|socially conservative]] candidate ran for the Liberals. In 1983, when [[Brian Mulroney]] became Progressive Conservative leader and needed a seat in the House of Commons, he chose to run in Central Nova.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Jeff|title=Swing voters could make anything happen next time in Central Nova|url=http://www.thehilltimes.ca/html/index.php?display=story&full_path=2008/july/7/swing_voters/&c=2|publisher=[[The Hill Times]]|date=2008-07-07|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> The Conservatives lost this seat to the Liberals in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Justin Trudeau's Liberal majority swept across Canada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-majority-liberal-regional-narrative-1.3279126|website=CBC News|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>

==Fiji==

:''see also'': [[House of Representatives of Fiji|Constituencies of Fiji]]

In Fiji, prior to the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|December 2006 military coup]], elections were held under the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], which allotted 46 of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]]' 71 seats on an ethnic basis. 23 were reserved for the indigenous majority, 19 for [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], 1 for [[Rotuma]]ns, and 3 for members of all other ethnic minorities. There was a strong tendency towards voting on ethnic lines. Thus, in the [[1999 Fijian general election|1999 general election]], although the indigenous seats were split between several parties, all 19 Indo-Fijian seats were won by the [[Fiji Labour Party]] - which won none of the indigenous seats. In the [[2001 Fijian general election|2001 general election]], the conservative indigenous nationalist [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party won 18 of the indigenous seats, with the other 5 going to the ultra-nationalist [[Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua|Conservative Alliance]] - which later merged into the SDL. All 19 "Indian" seats were retained by the Labour Party. In the [[2006 Fijian general election|2006 general election]], all Indo-Fijian seats remained safely Labour, while the SDL won all 23 indigenous seats. Among other minorities, only the communal seat of [[West Central (General Electors Communal Constituency, Fiji)|West Central]] was a safe seat for the ethnic [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]].<ref>[http://www.elections.gov.fj/results1999/sum_open_comm.html "Elections 1999 Results Summary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010922205709/http://www.elections.gov.fj/results1999/sum_open_comm.html |date=2001-09-22 }}, Fiji Elections Office</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011116025519/http://elections.gov.fj/results2001/summaries/03_open_comm.html "2001 election: summary by open seats and type of communal seats"], iji Elections Office</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/fijian-parties.gif|title="2006 election: Fijian communal constituencies"|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528043544/http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/fijian-parties.gif|archive-date=2006-05-28|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/indian-parties.gif|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729022648/http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/indian-parties.gif|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-29|title="2006 election: Indian communal constituencies"|publisher=}}</ref>

The [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|new Constitution adopted in 2013]] abolished constituency representation altogether, in favour of party list seat allocation based on nationwide results. The [[2014 Fijian general election|2014 general election]] was held on that basis, thus putting an end to all safe seats. The Labour Party suffered a near wipe-out.

== Hong Kong ==
There is no formal definition in Hong Kong, yet there are some [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] seats which are regarded as fully secured by a [[political party]] or a political camp.

Fully secured by the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pan-democracy camp]]:
*[[Education (constituency)|Education]], formerly called '''Teaching''' in the colonial period, has been a safe seat of [[HKPTU]] since 1985 until now. Except the incumbent [[Ip Kin-yuen]], the LEGCO member elected in this constituency are members of the [[Democratic Party Hong Kong]].
*[[Legal (constituency)|Legal]] - it has been a safe seat of Pro-democracy camp since 1985, and a safe seat for [[Civic Party]] since 2008.[[Simon Ip|Ip Sik On]], who was elected by this constituency in 1991, is the only one who is not from the pro-democracy camp.

Fully secured by the [[pro-Beijing camp]]:
*[[Agriculture and Fisheries (constituency)|Agriculture and Fisheries]], which has been held by the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] since its creation in 1998, with the DAB candidate being unopposed from 2000 to 2008.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, many rural electorates, and those based in wealthy suburban areas, notably the North Shore and eastern suburbs of [[Auckland]], are considered safe seats for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. An example of a safe National seat is [[Taranaki-King Country]], currently held by [[Barbara Kuriger]], who gained 68% of votes in [[2005 New Zealand general election|the 2005 election]], with only 16% of votes going to her [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] rival. By contrast, inner-city and poorer suburban electorates are safe Labour seats. For example, in 2014, the seat of [[Māngere (New Zealand electorate)|Mangere]] was won by incumbent Labour MP [[William Sio]] with 71% of the vote, his National rival getting only 14% of the vote.

Historically, some seats thought to be safe have witnessed surprise upsets. Perhaps the most dramatic recent case was the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]], in which the [[Maori seats]], safe Labour seats for the previous 60 years, were all won by [[New Zealand First]].

The adoption of [[proportional representation]] by New Zealand, beginning in 1996, has decreased the importance of winning votes in geographical electorates. It remains to be seen what long-term effect proportional representation will have on the safety of individual electorate seats.

== United Kingdom ==
On 6 April 2010, the [[Electoral Reform Society]] (ERS) estimated that going into the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], of the 650 [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]], 382 (59%) were safe seats. Some of these seats have since been lost by the parties that held them at the time, notably most of the Liberal Democrat seats and some Labour seats, meaning they can no longer be considered "safe".<ref name=ERS-2010-04>{{cite web|title=Election already over in nearly 400 seats|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/safe-seats/|publisher=Electoral Reform Society|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref>

Examples of safe seats for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] are in major urban areas and the industrial centres, such as the [[North West England|North West]] ([[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]]); the [[North East England|North East]] ([[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]); South and West [[Yorkshire]], the Valleys of [[South Wales]]; the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] county and parts of [[Inner London]] (e.g. [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]]).

Many areas of the Central Belt of Scotland, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, were seen as safe Labour seats until the 2015 election, when the [[Scottish National Party]] took all but one Labour seat in Scotland ([[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]]).

Safe seats for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] tend to be in rural areas: the [[Home Counties]] (e.g. [[Surrey]], [[Buckinghamshire]]), the [[Non-metropolitan county|shires]] (e.g. [[North Yorkshire]] and [[Cheshire]]) and affluent areas of [[London]] (e.g. [[Chelsea and Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea and Fulham]]).

The safest seat in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] was [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Walton]], where Labour received 86% of the vote, giving them a 77% majority over the second-placed Conservatives (at 9%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-safe-seat-marginal-constituencies-house-of-commons-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-a7886571.html|title=Labour now has all 10 of the safest seats in UK, House of Commons analysis reveals|last=Cowburn|first=Ashley|date=2017-08-10|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> [[Christchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Christchurch]] is a safe Conservative seat; in 2017 the party gathered 69.6% of the vote there, giving it a near-50% majority over Labour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/christchurch-dorset-safest-tory-seat-angry-voters-theresa-may|title=In the safest Tory seat in the country, who do angry, alarmed voters want to be PM?|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|date=2019-05-25|work=The Observer|access-date=2019-08-16|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref>

At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], seven out of eight of the Liberal Democrats' remaining seats were marginal, with their soon-to-be leader [[Tim Farron]]'s seat of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale]] being the only one considered safe. [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] has been held by the Liberal Democrats and their predecessor party, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], continuously since the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], but was almost lost to the [[Scottish National Party]] in the latter's national landslide. The seat of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] was notable in the run up to the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], when opinion polls were forecasting a Labour gain despite the incumbent MP, [[Nick Clegg]], being the party leader and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]. The seat was, however, held by Clegg, albeit with a much reduced majority of just 2,353 (4.2%). In 2017, several Lib Dem MPs either regained their seat, such as [[Vince Cable]] and [[Ed Davey]], or won new ones. Despite the net gain in seats, several were still lost, such as Clegg's, whilst Farron's majority was reduced to less than 1,000.

The ERS identifies what it calls "super safe seats", which have been held continuously by one party since the 19th century. In so doing, it equates seats with their rough equivalents under previous boundaries. For example, following the 2010 general election, it identifies the national representative of the area forming [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] (drawn as a constituency in 1997) as having been a Conservative since the [[1837 United Kingdom general election|1837 general election]]. Similarly, it considers that [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] (and a few others)  have been held by the Conservative Party since 1885, [[Devon East (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon East]], [[Fylde (UK Parliament constituency)|Fylde]] and [[Arundel and South Downs (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel and South Downs]] since 1868, [[Hampshire North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampshire North East]] since 1857, [[Rutland and Melton (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland and Melton]], [[Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Bognor Regis and Littlehampton]] and [[East Worthing and Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worthing and Shoreham]] since 1841, and [[Shropshire North (UK Parliament constituency)|Shropshire North]] since 1835, making it historically the safest seat of all, having been held without interruption by the Conservatives since the time of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]], and since before [[Queen Victoria]]'s accession to the throne. (For historical reasons, the Conservative Party being older than the other current main parties, it holds all the oldest safe seats.)<ref>[http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/safe-seats/ "Safe seats"], Electoral Reform Society</ref>

Even the safest of seats can be - and sometimes are - upset. Whilst it is rare for the opposition to take such seats, outside candidates may be able to. Examples include the election of [[Peter Law]] and [[George Galloway]] in very safe Labour seats in 2005, [[Jim Murphy]] in the [[Eastwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] constituency in Scotland in 1997, and [[Martin Bell]] in the safe Conservative seat of [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in 1997.
The loss of safe seats can become historic moments: the defeat of [[Michael Portillo]] in his 'safe' Conservative seat in 1997 created the "[[Portillo moment]]". That expression has since been used to describe huge voting swings that generally usher in a new government, as occurred in 1997. Similarly, in 2015, the Labour Party lost many formerly safe seats in Scotland, including [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]], which had previously been held by former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], and [[Paisley and Renfrewshire South (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley and Renfrewshire South]], the seat of [[shadow Foreign Secretary]] [[Douglas Alexander]]. In both cases, [[Swing (politics)|swings]] of over 25% to the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] were recorded.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paisley & Renfrewshire South|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000053|website=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000041|website=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour lost many formerly safe seats that were part of its '[[Red Wall (British politics)|Red Wall]]' in northern England. These defeats represented about 20% of the party's overall 2017 vote in such seats.<ref name="miscampbell20191218">{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-predicted-workington-man-as-key-to-election-but-underestimated-the-chasm-with-labour-27nxct3kg |title=How the Tories won over Workington Man |last=Miscampbell |first=Guy |date=2019-12-18 |work=The Times |access-date=2019-12-18 |language=en |issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

==United States==
Many [[United States|American]] commentators{{who|date=April 2013}} have decried the tendency of most [[US House of Representatives|House]] seats to become safe seats, decreasing the number of contested seats in every cycle. This is due to a variety of disparate factors. The first involves migration patterns in the United States. Works by the [[Pew Research Center]] and author [[Bill Bishop (author)|Bill Bishop]] show how like-minded voters will gravitate toward communities with shared values.<ref>{{cite web |title=Political Polarization and Personal Life |url=https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/ |publisher=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press |accessdate=28 January 2020 |date=12 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |title=America's 'Big Sort' Is Only Getting Bigger |url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/10/the-big-sort-revisited/504830/ |website=CityLab |accessdate=28 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Cities such as Berkeley, California and Ogden, Utah, consistently elect members of one party due to their populations. The second factor revolves around partisan gerrymandering. Many congressional districts are [[Gerrymander|drawn by state legislatures to be all but unwinnable]] for the district's minority party (with only a handful of districts, either in strong pockets of support or in order to avoid court challenges of racial discrimination, allocated to the minority party). Specific [[U.S. State]]s, [[congressional district]]s, and [[United States Senate|senate seats]] since 2000 are sometimes referred to as "solid blue" ([[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]]) or "solid red" ([[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]) after the use of these colors in television maps on election night.

The [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rates [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] on how strongly they lean towards either major party. Currently New York's [[New York's 15th congressional district|15th]] ([[South Bronx]]) district is the most Democratic at D+44, while [[Texas's 13th congressional district|Texas's 13th]] (far northern Texas including the [[Texas Panhandle]]) district is the most Republican at R+33.

Other examples of a safe seat for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] is [[California's 12th congressional district]], which currently covers most of the city of [[San Francisco]]. This district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1949. Its current representative, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], was most recently reelected with 86.8 percent of the vote.<ref name="2018-pelosi">{{cite web|title=2018 California general election results|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2018-general/sov/2018-complete-sov.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>

Safe [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] seats include [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]] and [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district]], which are located in the eastern part of the state. Both districts have been held by Republicans or their predecessors (except for two terms in the 1st) since 1859, despite the [[Southern strategy|South's shift from being monolithically Democratic to being heavily Republican]].

Because American representatives are generally residents of the constituency which they represent, it is much less common for aspiring politicians to select safe seats to represent. In fact, an aspiring politician may instead want to prove oneself by winning a [[swing seat]] and thus show they have the capability of winning a close-fought election, thus making the candidate more attractive for a state or national candidacy where those skills will be of greater importance. A candidate elected to a safe seat, on the other hand, can take greater risks in appealing to the base of the political party and totally disregard the minuscule opposition, thus leaving the candidate vulnerable to opposition attacks if they seek higher office; such a politician also does not have to focus as much on fundraising or networking, which further puts the candidate at a disadvantage in broader elections.
