Giuliani was elected president of his class in his sophomore year, but was not re-elected in his junior year. He joined the Phi Rho Pi college forensic fraternity and honor society.

== Legal career ==

[[File:Reagan Contact Sheet C20382 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Giuliani greeting President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984]]

Upon graduation from law school, Giuliani [[law clerk|clerked]] for Judge [[Lloyd Francis MacMahon]], United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.<ref>{{cite book |author=Giuliani, Rudy |year=2002 |title=Leadership |url=https://archive.org/details/leadershipthroug00rudo |url-access=registration |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0-7868-6841-4}}</ref>

Giuliani did not serve in the military during the [[Vietnam War]]. His [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from the latter in 1968, he was [[Selective Service System#Classifications|classified]] 1-A (available for military service), but in 1969 he was reclassified 2-A (essential civilian) as Judge MacMahon's law clerk. In 1970, Giuliani was reclassified 1-A but received a high 308 draft lottery number and was not called up for service.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani18.html |title=Rudolf W.

In 1975, Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent.<ref name="nationrudy" /> This occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in Washington, D.C. with the [[Ford administration]]: Giuliani served as the [[Associate Deputy Attorney General]] and [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]] to [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Harold R. Tyler Jr.|Harold "Ace" Tyler]].<ref name="nationrudy" /> 

His first high-profile prosecution was of Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bertram L. Podell]] ([[New York's 13th congressional district|NY-13]]), who was convicted of corruption. Podell pleaded guilty to conspiracy and conflict of interest for accepting more than  $41,000 in campaign contributions and legal fees from a Florida airline to obtain federal rights for a Bahama route. Podell, who maintained a legal practice while serving in Congress, said the payments were legitimate legal fees.  The ''Washington Post'' later reported: "The trial catapulted future New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani to front-page status when, as assistant U.S. attorney, he relentlessly cross-examined an initially calm Rep. Podell. The congressman reportedly grew more flustered and eventually decided to plead guilty."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/21/AR2005082101051.html "Convicted Politician Bertram Podell, 79"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. August 22, 2005.</ref> 

From 1977 to 1981, during the [[Carter administration]], Giuliani practiced law at the [[Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler]] [[law firm]], as chief of staff to his former boss, Ace Tyler. In later years, Tyler became "disillusioned" by what Tyler described as Giuliani's time as US Attorney, criticizing several of his prosecutions as "overkill."<ref name="nationrudy" />

On December 8, 1980, one month after [[1980 United States presidential election|the election of Ronald Reagan]] brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican.<ref name="nationrudy" /> Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies "naïve", and that "by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me."<ref name="usa020707" /> Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department.<ref name="nationrudy" /> Giuliani's mother maintained in 1988 that:
{{quote|He only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He's definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn't. He still feels very sorry for the poor.<ref name="nationrudy" />}}

In 1981, Giuliani was named [[United States Associate Attorney General|Associate Attorney General]] in the [[Reagan administration]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/222761/doing-rudy-justice-theodore-b-olson |title=Doing Rudy Justice |work=National Review |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref> the third-highest position in the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the [[Department of Corrections]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[United States Marshals Service]]. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] "detention posture" regarding the internment of more than 2,000 [[Haiti]]an [[asylum seeker]]s who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were "economic migrants". In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that "political repression, at least in general, does not exist" under [[President of Haiti]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]'s regime.<ref name="Raceforcityhall" /><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/world/around-the-world-us-official-finds-no-repression-in-haiti.html "Around the World; U.S. Official Finds No Repression in Haiti"].

In 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]], which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the [[SDNY]] is considered the highest profile United States Attorney's Office in the country, and as such, is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office.  It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of [[Wall Street]] figures [[Ivan Boesky]] and [[Michael Milken]]. He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, [[organized crime]], and corruption in government.<ref name="bio" /> He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the [[perp walk]], parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=900005449600/How-to-Avoid-Letting-a-Perp-Walk-Turn-Into-a-Parade?slreturn=20151019230043 |title=How to Avoid Letting a 'Perp Walk' Turn Into a Parade |first=William |last=Mitchelson Jr. |work=National Law Journal |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref> After Giuliani "patented the perp walk", the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Breaking Down the "Perp Walk" |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/22/breaking-down-the-perp-walk |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 22, 2006 |first=Peter |last=Lattman |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref>

Giuliani's critics claimed that he arranged for people to be arrested, then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his arrests of alleged [[White-collar crime|white-collar criminals]] at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged "perps".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=No more 'perp walks'|url=http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|magazine=National Law Journal|date=August 5, 2002|accessdate=June 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614015739/http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|archive-date=June 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> He claimed veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of [[Kidder, Peabody & Co.]], was guilty of [[insider trading]]; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears.<ref name=wigton /> Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.<ref name=wigton>{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_boyer|title=Mayberry Man|work=The New Yorker|first=Peter J.|last=Boyer|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Collins-cnr02">{{cite news |first1=Heidi |last1=Collins |first2=Allan |last2=Chernoff |first3=Crystal McCrary |last3=Anthony |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/23/cnr.02.html |title=Body Found in Military Fatigues in Euphrates River; Helmet Boxing; Early Learning in Iraq |publisher=CNN |date=May 23, 2007 |department=Transcripts |access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

=== Mafia Commission trial ===

In the [[Mafia Commission Trial]], which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted 11 [[organized crime]] figures, including the heads of New York City's so-called "[[Five Families]]", under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) on charges including [[extortion]], labor racketeering, and [[Contract killing|murder for hire]]. ''Time'' magazine called this "Case of Cases" possibly "the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the [[Chicago Outfit|Chicago Mafia]] was swept away in 1943", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: "Our approach is to wipe out the five families."<ref name="passionate">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101860210-143096,00.html |title=The Passionate Prosecutor |accessdate=November 15, 2006 |last=Stengel |first=Richard |date=June 24, 2001 |work=Time}}</ref> [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Paul Castellano]] evaded conviction when he and his [[underboss]], [[Thomas Bilotti]], were murdered on the streets of [[Midtown Manhattan]] on December 16, 1985.

=== Boesky, Milken trials ===

[[Ivan Boesky]], a Wall Street [[arbitrage]]ur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader [[Michael Milken]]. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a {{frac|3|1|2}}-year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine.<ref name="trumbore">{{cite web |url=http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2000/boesky.html |title=Ivan Boesky |last=Trumbore |first=Brian |publisher=BUYandHOLD |accessdate=November 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111092843/http://buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2000/boesky.html |archive-date=November 11, 2006}}</ref> In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud.

Giuliani was U.S. Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the [[Reagan administration]] ended.

=== 1989 ===

Giuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent [[Ed Koch]]. He won the September 1989 Republican Party [[primary election]] against business magnate [[Ronald Lauder]], in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was [[Republican In Name Only|not a true Republican]] and after an acrimonious debate between the two men.<ref name="nyt050307">Katharine Q.

In the general election, Giuliani ran as the [[electoral fusion|fusion]] candidate of both the Republican and the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] parties. The [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]], which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead.<ref>Frank Lynn, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/nyregion/giuliani-files-2-challenges-to-take-lauder-off-ballot.html?pagewanted=all "Giuliani Files 2 Challenges To Take Lauder off Ballot"], ''The New York Times'', July 21, 1989.

During two televised debates, Giuliani framed himself as an agent of change, saying, "I'm the reformer,"<ref name="nyt110589">[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/in-their-first-debate-dinkins-and-giuliani-go-at-it-gently.html?pagewanted=all "In Their First Debate, Dinkins and Giuliani Go At It, Gently"], ''The New York Times'', November 5, 1989.

In the end, Giuliani lost to Dinkins by a margin of 47,080 votes out of 1,899,845 votes cast, in the closest election in New York City's history.

Giuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 through 2001.

=== Law enforcement ===

In Giuliani's first term as mayor, the [[New York City Police Department]]—at the instigation of Commissioner [[Bill Bratton]]—adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on [[James Q.

Giuliani's supporters cite studies concluding that the decline in New York City's crime rate in the 1990s and 2000s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country: what [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Frank Zimring]] calls "the most focused form of policing in history". In his book ''The Great American Crime Decline'', Zimring argues that "up to half of New York's crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing [[crime decline]] since 2000, has resulted from policing."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Heather |last=MacDonald |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_ny_cops.html |title=New York Cops: Still the Finest |magazine=City Journal |date=Summer 2006 |access-date=May 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Zimring |first=Franklin E. |title=The Great American Crime Decline (Studies in Crime and Public Policy) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=November 3, 2006 |page=272 |isbn=978-0-19-518115-9}}</ref>

=== City services ===

The Giuliani administration advocated the privatization of the City's public schools, which he called "dysfunctional", and advocated the reduction of state funding for them. He  advocated for a [[school voucher|voucher]]-based system to promote private schooling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Rudy_Giuliani_Education.htm |title=Rudy Giuliani on Education |publisher=On The Issues |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> Giuliani supported protection for [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].

During his mayoralty, gay and [[lesbian]] New Yorkers received [[domestic partner]]ship rights. Giuliani induced the city's Democratic-controlled New York City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for [[same-sex partner]]s. In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.isebrand.com/article_Rudy's_gay_friends.htm |title=What will Rudy say to his gay friends? |date=February 26, 2004 |work=Salon |first=Eric |last=Boehlert |author-link=Eric Boehlert |via=isebrand.com |access-date=May 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061244/http://www.isebrand.com/article_Rudy%27s_gay_friends.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2009}}</ref>

=== 2000 U.S. Senate campaign ===

{{Main|2000 United States Senate election in New York}}
[[File:Rudy Giuliani speaking.jpg|thumb|left|Giuliani campaigned for Senate in 2000 before withdrawing after being diagnosed with cancer]]

Due to [[term limits]], Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor. In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat. Due to his high profile and visibility Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party. Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman [[Charles Rangel]] and others to recruit then-[[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]] to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.

An early January 1999 poll showed Giuliani trailing Clinton by 10 points.<ref name="nyt013100">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/31/opinion/losing-the-women.html |title=Losing the Women |first=Lee M. |last=Miringoff |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 31, 2000 |accessdate=September 27, 2007}}</ref> In April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the Senate run. By January 2000, polling for the race dramatically reversed, with Giuliani now pulling nine points ahead of Clinton, in part because his campaign was able to take advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton.<ref name="nyt013100" /> Nevertheless, the Giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses; so closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to normally Republican voters in [[Upstate New York]].<ref name="nyt110699">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/opinion/looking-for-the-senator-from-all-of-new-york.html |title=Looking for the Senator From All of New York |last=Gates |first=George |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1999 |accessdate=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The [[New York Police Department]]'s fatal shooting of [[Patrick Dorismond]] in March 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained relations with the city's minority communities,<ref name="gvn-211">{{cite book |last1=Gerth |first1=Jeff |author-link=Jeff Gerth |first2=Don |last2=Van Natta Jr. |author2-link=Don Van Natta Jr. |title=Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton |year=2007 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-316-01742-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/herwayhopesambit00gert }}, p. 211.</ref> and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue.<ref name="gvn-211" /> By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who said his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/08/nyregion/despite-polls-giuliani-says-that-he-won-t-alter-his-campaign-style.html?pagewanted=all |title=Despite Polls, Giuliani Says That He Won't Alter His Campaign Style |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 2000 |accessdate=September 27, 2007|author-link=Adam Nagourney }}</ref> Clinton was now eight to ten points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.<ref name="gvn-211" />

Then followed [[2000 United States Senate election in New York#A tumultuous four weeks|four tumultuous weeks]] in which Giuliani learned he had [[prostate cancer]] and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with [[Judith Nathan]] became public and the subject of a media frenzy; and he announced a separation from his wife [[Donna Hanover]].

=== September 11 terrorist attacks ===

==== Response ====

Giuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards—for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]ry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said:
{{quote|Tomorrow New York is going to be here. And we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before{{nbsp}}... I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.<ref name="POY2001" />}}

The 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January{{nbsp}}1 to April{{nbsp}}1 under the [[New York State Constitution]] (Article{{nbsp}}3 Section 25).<ref>{{cite web |title=Content Removed |url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?co=5 |accessdate=November 15, 2005}}</ref> He threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full four-year term, if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty.<ref>{{cite news |title=Conservative Party and Courts May Hold Key to NYC Mayor's Race—October 1, 2001 |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |accessdate=November 15, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020116071502/http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |archive-date=January 16, 2002}}</ref> In the end leaders in the [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]] and [[New York Senate|Senate]] indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert [[Michael Bloomberg]], took office on January 1, 2002 per normal custom.

Giuliani claimed to have been at the [[Ground Zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] site "as often, if not more, than most workers{{nbsp}}... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them."

When Saudi Prince [[Alwaleed bin Talal]] suggested the attacks were an indication that the United States "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause," Giuliani asserted, "There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it{{nbsp}}... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem." Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10 million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/ |title=Giuliani rejects $10 million from Saudi prince |publisher=CNN |date=October 12, 2001 |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209092439/https://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/ |archive-date=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>

==== Emergency command center location and communications problems ====

{{Main|Communication during the September 11 attacks#Radio communications}}

Giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the [[NYC Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the [[7 World Trade Center|7{{nbsp}}World Trade Center]] building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous [[World Trade Center bombing|terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World Trade Center: Profile |url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center |accessdate=June 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031021/https://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="VV20070808" /><ref name="village voice 2006">{{cite news |title=The Grand Illusion: The untold story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0635%2Cbarrett%2C74322%2C6.html |first1=Wayne |last1=Barentt |author-link1=Wayne Barrett |first2=Dan |last2=Collins |author-link2=Dan Collins (journalist) |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=September 2006 |accessdate=September 6, 2006}}</ref> The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Open and Shut |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549,murphy,70685,6.html |accessdate=June 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611004630/https://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549%2Cmurphy%2C70685%2C6.html |archive-date=June 11, 2007 }}</ref> Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7{{nbsp}}World Trade to power the command center.

Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and ''[[New York Magazine]]'' with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in [[Brooklyn]] but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and claimed that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location.

For his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on February 13, 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/02/13/knighthoods/ |title=Giuliani joins a distinguished club |publisher=CNN |author=Reynolds, Dylan |date=February 13, 2002 |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref>

Giuliani took control away from agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], leaving the "largely unknown" city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of [[respirators]]. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.<ref>Anthony DePalma, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 14, 2007 or</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/opinion/22tue1.html Macho Mistakes at Ground Zero], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 22, 2007</ref> In June 2007, [[Christie Todd Whitman]], former Republican Governor of [[New Jersey]] and director of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), reportedly said the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but she had been blocked by Giuliani.

Giuliani asked the city's Congressional delegation to limit the city's [[Legal liability|liability]] for Ground Zero illnesses to a total of $350 million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1 billion to a special insurance fund, called the [[World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company]], to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?pagewanted=all "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 14, 2007</ref>

In February 2007, the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]] issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: "Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no [[closure (psychology)|closure]] for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]]," it said, adding: "Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404003924/http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html|url-status=dead|title=Giuliani & New York firefighters|archive-date=April 4, 2007}}</ref> Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08,0,2321840,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=Giuliani foes see another side to his 9/11 activities |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621112054/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08%2C0%2C2321840%2Cprint.story?coll=la-home-headlines |archive-date=June 21, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Wallsten |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref>

Since leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. When [[George Pataki]] became Governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both Mayor and Governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since [[John Lindsay]] and [[Nelson Rockefeller]]. Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] to New York City.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.b270a4a1d51bb3017bce0ed101c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=nyc_blue_room&catID=1194&doc_name=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2003a/pr032-03.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1 |title=Mayor Michael R.

Similarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called Solutions America to help elect Republican candidates across the nation.

After campaigning on Bush's behalf in the [[2004 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election of 2004]], he was reportedly the top choice for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] after [[Tom Ridge]]'s resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani's confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner [[Bernard Kerik]]. After the formal announcement of Kerik's nomination, information about Kerik's past—most notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had failed to properly report gifts he had received, had been sued for [[sexual harassment]] and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servant—became known, and Kerik withdrew his nomination.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Nina |last2=Stein |first2=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/16/national/16nanny.html?_r=0 |title=Mystery Woman in Kerik Case: Nanny |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

In November 2006 Giuliani announced the formation of an [[exploratory committee]] toward a run for [[2008 United States presidential election|the presidency in 2008]]. In February 2007 he filed a "statement of candidacy" and confirmed on the television program ''[[Larry King Live]]'' that he was indeed running.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/14/giuliani.lkl/index.html |title=Giuliani 'not confident' war will turn around |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>

Early polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition ever recorded along with high levels of support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2008 presidential candidates|most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans]]. Senator [[John McCain]], who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator [[Fred Thompson]] and former Governor [[Mitt Romney]] showing greater support in some [[Opinion polling for the Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|per-state Republican polls]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pollingreport.com/wh08rep.htm |title=WH2008: Republicans |publisher=Polling Report |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from [[Evangelicalism|evangelist]], [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] founder, and past presidential candidate [[Pat Robertson]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Steinhauser |title=Giuliani, McCain pick up key Christian conservative backing |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/07/conservatives.endorsements/index.html#cnnSTCText |publisher=CNN |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that [[Christian evangelism|evangelicals]] and other [[social conservative]]s could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.<ref name="msnbc110707">{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21669328 |title=Pat Robertson endorses Giuliani |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2007}}</ref>

Giuliani supported [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the [[2016 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/18/giuliani-blasts-clinton-touts-trump-american-security/87266562/ |title=Giuliani blasts Clinton, touts Trump for American security|access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate [[Ben Carson]] appeared at an event for the pro-Trump [[Great America PAC]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/21/politics/donald-trump-super-pac-convention/index.html |title=Trump super PACs battle in Cleveland |last=Schleifer |first=Theodore |publisher=CNN|access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled "Leadership".<ref>{{Citation |last=Great America Pac |title=Leadership 30 sec TV spot |date=July 26, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9B7I1MeCRo |access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> Giuliani's and [[Jeff Sessions]]'s appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 1, 2016

In August 2016, Giuliani, while campaigning for Trump, claimed that in the "eight years before Obama" became president, "we didn't have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States." On the contrary, 9/11 happened during George W. Bush's first term. [[Politifact]] brought up four more counter-examples (the [[2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting]], the 2002 [[D.C. sniper attacks]], the [[2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting]] and the [[2006 UNC SUV attack]]) to Giuliani's claim. Giuliani later said he was using "abbreviated language".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |last2=Killough |first2=Ashley |title=Giuliani wrong about terror attacks and Obama |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/15/politics/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-9-11-terror-attack/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Edelman |first1=Adam |title=Rudy Giuliani blames his use of 'abbreviated' language for 9/11-forgetting gaffe, claim no terror attacks happened 'before Obama came along' |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/rudy-giuliani-blames-9-11-forget-gaffe-abbreviated-language-article-1.2753356 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Qiu |first1=Linda |title=Aside from 9/11, Rudy Giuliani is wrong about no terrorist attacks before Obama |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/rudy-giuliani/aside-from-911-rudy-giuliani-wrong-about-no-terr/ |publisher=[[Politifact]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}</ref>

===== Advisor to the president =====

On January 12, 2017, the [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser.<ref name=csadviser>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/12/trump-names-rudy-giuliani-as-cybersecurity-adviser/|title=Trump names Rudy Giuliani as cybersecurity adviser|last=Phillip|first=Abby |author-link=Abby Phillip |date=January 12, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post PowerPost blog |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref> The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the [[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency]] (CISA), headed by Christopher Krebs as director and [[Matthew Travis]] as deputy. In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an [[Apple Store]] [[Genius Bar]] when he "was locked out of his [[iPhone]] because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times," belying his putative expertise in the field.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rudy-giuliani-needed-apple-genius-help-unlock-his-iphone-after-n1074241 |title=Rudy Giuliani needed Apple genius help to unlock his iPhone after being named Trump cybersecurity adviser |date=October 31, 2019 |publisher=NBC News |first=Rich |last=Schapiro |access-date=November 18, 2020 }}</ref> 

In January 2017, Giuliani said he advised [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]] in matters relating to [[Executive Order 13769]], which barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days.<ref>{{Citation|first=Ben |last=King |title=Judge Jeanine Pirro Rudy Giuliani FULL Interview—1/28/17 |date=January 28, 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI |access-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521170603/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI |archive-date=May 21, 2017 }}<!-- archives do not include video content --></ref>

===== Personal lawyer =====

<!-- [[Doublespeak Award]] links here -->
In mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] by [[Robert Mueller]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections]]. Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384028-giuliani-joins-trump-legal-team|title=Giuliani joins Trump legal team|last=Fabian|first=Jordan|date=April 19, 2018|work=The Hill|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref>

In early May, Giuliani made public that Trump had reimbursed his personal attorney [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]] $130,000 that Cohen had paid to adult-film actress [[Stormy Daniels]] for her agreement not to talk about her alleged affair with Trump.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-trump-stormy-daniels_us_5aea6adee4b00f70f0eefbea|title=Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Lawyer For $130,000 Payment To Stormy Daniels|last=Visser|first=Nick|date=May 2, 2018|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Cohen had earlier insisted he used his own money to pay Daniels, and he implied that he had not been reimbursed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/09/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-says-he-paid-stormy-daniels-his-home-equity-line/412335002/|title=Trump lawyer Michael Cohen says he paid Stormy Daniels with his home-equity line|last=Schouten|first=Fredreka|date=March 10, 2018|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Trump had previously said he knew nothing about the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/politics/donald-trump-stormy-daniels/index.html|title=Trump says he didn't know about Stormy Daniels payment|last=Liptak|first=Kevin|date=April 6, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Within a week, Giuliani said some of his own statements regarding this matter were "more rumor than anything else".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldschlag |first1=William |last2=Janison |first2=Dan |title=Giuliani: I'm still winging it on Trump's Stormy payoff story |url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/trump-giuliani-mueller-daniels-cohen-1.18427393 |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

Later in May 2018, Giuliani, who was asked on whether the promotion of the [[Spygate (conspiracy theory)|Spygate]] conspiracy theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, said the investigators "are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president{{nbsp}}... it is for public opinion" on whether to "impeach or not impeach" Trump.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/28/rudy-giuliani-spygate-mueller-investigation/|title='It Is for Public Opinion.'

In June 2018, Giuliani also said Trump should not testify to the special counsel investigation because "our recollection keeps changing."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vazquez |first1=Maegan |title=Giuliani says Trump shouldn't testify because 'our recollection keeps changing' |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/03/politics/donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-jay-sekulow-recollection/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 3, 2018 |access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref> In early July, Giuliani characterized that Trump had previously asked Comey to "give then-national security adviser Michael Flynn a break".

Not the truth." Giuliani's argument continued: "Truth isn't truth." Giuliani later clarified that he was "referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements".<ref>{{cite news |title=Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani defends 'truth isn't truth' remark |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45252493 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=August 20, 2018 |access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref>

It was reported in early September that Giuliani said the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege.

In May 2019, Giuliani described Ukraine's chief prosecutor [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] as a "much more honest guy" than his predecessor, Viktor Shokin. After Lutsenko was removed from office, he said in September 2019 that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and that he had met Giuliani about 10 times.

Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma. Giuliani, who asserts he has "nothing to do with" and has "never met or talked to" Firtash, has promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.
