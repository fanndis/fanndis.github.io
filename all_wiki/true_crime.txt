{{short description|Literary genre}}
'''True crime''' is a [[nonfiction]] literary, [[podcast]], and [[film genre]] in which the author examines an actual [[crime]] and details the actions of real people.

The crimes most commonly include [[murder]]; about 40 percent focus on tales of [[serial killer]]s.<ref name="Levinson2002"/><ref name="Surette2010">{{cite book|author=Ray Surette|title=Media, Crime and Criminal Justice: Images, Realities, and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geK4L1Q7fqAC&pg=PA92|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-80914-2|page=92}}</ref> True crime comes in many forms, such as books, films, podcasts, and television shows. Many works in this genre recount high-profile, sensational crimes such as the [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey|JonBenét Ramsey]] killing, the [[O.&nbsp;J. Simpson murder case]], and the [[Pamela Smart]] murder, while others are devoted to more obscure slayings.

True crime works can impact the crimes they cover and the audience who consumes it.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-true-crime-shows-affect-your-brain-according-to-trauma-therapists-8714092|title=How True Crime Shows Affect Your Brain, According To Trauma Therapists|work=Elite Daily|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> The genre is often criticized for being insensitive to the victims and their families and is described by some as [[trash culture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://longreads.com/2019/01/18/true-crime-and-the-trash-balance/|title=True Crime and the Trash Balance|date=2019-01-18|website=Longreads|publisher=[[Automattic]]|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bellingham Pamphlet.jpg|thumb|Murder pamphlet, 1812]]
Zhang Yingyu's ''[[The Book of Swindles]]'' ({{circa|1617}}) is a late Ming dynasty collection of stories about allegedly true cases of fraud.<ref>Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk, "Translators' Introduction," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017).</ref> Works in the related Chinese genre of [[Gong'an fiction|court case fiction]] (gong'an xiaoshuo), such as the 16th-century ''[[Cases of Magistrate Bao]]'', were either inspired by historical events or else purely fictional.
 
Hundreds of [[pamphlet]]s, [[broadside (printing)|broadsides]], [[chapbook]]s and other [[street literature]] about murders and other crimes were published from 1550 to 1700 in [[Great Britain|Britain]] as [[literacy]] increased and cheap new printing methods became widespread. They varied in style: some were sensational, while others conveyed a moral message. Most were purchased by the "artisan class and above", as the lower classes did not have the money or time read them. [[Ballad]]s were also created, the verses of which were posted on walls around towns, that were told from the [[Suspect|perpetrator]]'s point of view in an attempt to understand the [[Psychology|psychological]] motivations of the crime. Such pamphlets remained in circulation in the 19th century in Britain and the [[United States]], even after widespread crime journalism was introduced via the [[penny press]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/bloody-history-of-true-crime-genre/|title=The Bloody History of the True Crime Genre|date=2016-08-24|work=[[JSTOR|JSTOR Daily]]|publisher=[[Ithaka Harbors]]|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US|archive-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826092135/https://daily.jstor.org/bloody-history-of-true-crime-genre/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Thomas De Quincey]] published the essay "[[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts|On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts]]" in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1827, which focused not on the murder or the murderer but on how society views crime.<ref name=":03" />

Starting in 1889, Scottish lawyer [[William Roughead]] wrote and published essays for six decades about notable British murder trials he attended, with many of these essays collected in the 2000 book ''Classic Crimes.'' Many regard Roughead "as the dean of the modern true crime genre."<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/149080/arthur-conan-doyle-true-detective|title=Arthur Conan Doyle, True Detective|work=[[The New Republic]]|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US|archive-date=January 7, 2020|archive-url= https://archive.today/20200107143205/https://newrepublic.com/article/149080/arthur-conan-doyle-true-detective|url-status=live}}</ref>

An American pioneer of the genre was [[Edmund Pearson]], who was influenced in his style of writing about crime by De Quincey. Pearson published a series of books of this type starting with ''Studies in Murder'' in 1924 and concluding with ''More Studies in Murder'' in 1936. Before being collected in his books, Pearson's true crime stories typically appeared in magazines like ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. Inclusion in these high-class magazines distinguished Pearson's crime narratives from those found in the penny press.<ref name="Schmid2010" />

[[Truman Capote]]'s "[[Nonfiction novel|non-fiction novel]]" ''[[In Cold Blood (book)|In Cold Blood]]'' (1965) is usually credited with establishing the modern novelistic style of the genre<ref name="Levinson2002">{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment|year=2002|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-2258-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofcr0004unse/page/1019 1019–1021]|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofcr0004unse/page/1019}}</ref> and the one that rocketed it to great profitability.<ref name="Schmid2010"/>

==Forms==
=== Books ===
True crime books often center on sensational, shocking, or strange events, particularly murder. Even though murder makes up less than 20% of reported crime, it is present in most true crime stories. Typically, these books report on a crime from the beginning of its investigation to its [[legal proceeding]]s.<ref>"True Crime." ''World of Criminal Justice, Gale'', edited by Shirelle Phelps, Gale, 1st edition, 2002. ''Credo Reference''. Accessed 02 Dec. 2018.</ref> Serial killers have been a highly profitable sub-genre. An informal survey conducted by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' in 1993 concluded that the more popular true crime books focus on serial killers, with the more gruesome and grotesque content performing even better.<ref name="Schmid2010">{{cite book|author=David Schmid|editor1=Charles J.

Some true crime works are "instant books" produced quickly to capitalize on popular demand; these have been described as "more than formulaic" and hyper-conventional.<ref name="Gregoriou2011-59">{{cite book|title=Language, Ideology and Identity in Serial Killer Narratives|author=Christiana Gregoriou|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2011|isbn=978-0-203-83265-3}}</ref> Others may reflect years of thoughtful research and inquiry and may have considerable [[literary merit]].<ref name="Levinson2002" />

A milestone of the genre was [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Executioner's Song]]'' (1979), which was the first book in the genre to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name="Voss2011-96">{{cite book|author=Ralph F.

In 2006, [[Associated Content]] stated that since the start of the 21st century, the genre of writing that was growing the quickest was true crime. Much of this is due to the ease of recycling materials and the publication of numerous volumes by the same authors differing only by minor updates.<ref name="Gregoriou2011-10">{{cite book|title=Language, Ideology and Identity in Serial Killer Narratives|author=Christiana Gregoriou|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2011|isbn=978-0-203-83265-3|page=10}}</ref> The majority of readers of true crime books are women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Browder|first=Laura|date=December 2006|title=Dystopian Romance: True Crime and the Female Reader|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=39|issue=6|pages=928–953|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2006.00328.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-megan-abbott-true-crime-20180614-story.html|title=Why do we — women in particular — love true crime books? - Los Angeles Times|last=Abbott|first=Megan|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>

=== Films & television ===
True crime [[Documentary film|documentaries]] have been a growing medium in the last several decades. One of the most influential documentaries in this process was ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', directed by [[Errol Morris]]. This documentary, among others, feature reenactments, although other documentary filmmakers choose not to use them since they don't show the truth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/01/30/true-crime-genre-docudrama/|title=True crime and the rise of the docudrama|date=2018-01-30|work=The Hub|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}</ref> Other prominent documentaries include ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]], [[Making a Murderer]]'', ''[[The Jinx (miniseries)|The Jinx]],'' and ''[[The Keepers]].''<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://time.com/5373554/best-true-crime-documentaries/|title=12 True Crime Documentaries You Should Stream Right Now|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, a boom of true crime films began in Hong Kong. These films ranged from graphic [[Category III films|Category III]]-rated films such as ''[[The Untold Story]]'' and ''[[Dr. Lamb]]'' (based on serial killers Wong Chi Hang and [[Lam Kor-wan]], respectively) to more general audience fare such as the film ''[[Crime Story (film)|Crime Story]]'' (based on the kidnapping of businessman [[Teddy Wang|Teddy Wang Tei-huei]]), which featured action star [[Jackie Chan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/2162815/how-safe-hong-kong-four-gruesome-killings-citys-past|title=A history of violence: 4 gruesome killings that shocked Hong Kong|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-25/entertainment/ca-27075_1_jackie-chan|title=MOVIE REVIEW : An Action-Packed 'Crime Story' : Martial arts superstar Jackie Chan cuts the clowning when he sets out to rescue a kidnaped Hong Kong tycoon.|last=THOMAS|first=KEVIN|date=1994-02-25|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

=== Podcasts ===
[[Podcasts]] with a true crime theme are a recent trend. The 2014 true crime podcast [[Serial (podcast)|''Serial'']] broke podcasting records when it achieved 5 million downloads on [[iTunes]] quicker than any previous podcast.<ref name="Dredge2">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/serial-podcast-itunes-apple-downloads-streams|title=Serial podcast breaks iTunes records as it passes 5m downloads and streams|last1=Dredge|first1=Stuart|date=November 18, 2014|access-date=April 3, 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="Carr2">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/media/serial-podcastings-first-breakout-hit-sets-stage-for-more.html|title='Serial,' Podcasting's First Breakout Hit, Sets Stage for More|last1=Carr|first1=David|access-date=3 April 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=":32">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/serial-mania-says-growing-popularity-podcasts/|title=What 'Serial'-mania says about the growing popularity of podcasts|date=December 11, 2014|work=[[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour]]|publisher=PBS|access-date=December 12, 2014}}</ref> As of September 2018, it has been downloaded more than 340 million times.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/serial-season-3-premiere-date-podcast-1202927015/|title='Serial' Season 3 Podcast Premiere Date Set|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-09-05|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}</ref> It has been followed by other true crime podcasts such as ''[[Dirty John]], [[My Favorite Murder]], [[Up and Vanished]]'', [[Parcast]] series such as ''Cults'', ''Female Criminals'' and ''Mind's Eye'',  ''[[Someone Knows Something]],'' and many more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/52-best-true-crime-podcasts.html|title=52 Great True-Crime Podcasts|last=Nelson|first=Hillary|publisher=Vulture.com|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref>

It's been speculated that [[fear]] could play a role in the popularity of true crime podcasts. These podcasts often recount horrific crimes, which triggers the fear response and the release of [[adrenaline]] in the body. Due to the possibility of [[Binge-watching|bingeing]] podcasts, adrenaline rushes can be experienced in quick bursts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/why-true-crime-and-podcasts-were-made-for-each-other-128984/|title=Why True Crime and Podcasts Were Made for Each Other|last=Stahl|first=Michael|date=2017-04-13|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Another explanation for the popularity of true crime podcasts is due to the [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] nature of crime, in which events happen one after another. Podcasts that explore a crime episodically can utilize this aspect in their storytelling.<ref name=":0" />

== Effects ==
The investigative process of the true crime genre can lead to changes in the cases being covered, such as when [[Robert Durst]] seemingly confessed to murder in the documentary ''The Jinx'' and was arrested.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/true-detectives-serial-the-jinx/393575/|title=The New True Crime: Telling Stories About Murder for the 21st Century|last=Cruz|first=Lenika|date=2015-06-11|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-durst-reply-documents-20161219-story.html|title=HBO's 'The Jinx' played key role in 'urgent' timing of Robert Durst's arrest, prosecutors say|last=Hamilton|first=Matt|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>

A study conducted in 2011, in [[Nebraska]], showed that consuming non-fiction crime shows (aka True Crime) is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with an increased fear of being a victim of crime. As the frequency of watching true crime shows increased, support for the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] increased, while support for the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]] decreased.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kort-Butler|first=Lisa A.|last2=Sittner Hartshorn|first2=Kelley J.|date=Winter 2011|title=Watching The Detectives: Crime Programming, Fear of Crime, and Attitudes About the Criminal Justice System|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=52|issue=1|pages=36–55|jstor=23027459|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.2010.01191.x|pmid=21337735|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&context=sociologyfacpub}}</ref>

In [[Australia]], the amount of reports given to the crime reporting network [https://www.crimestoppers.com.au/ Crime Stoppers Australia] that led to [[Criminal charge|charges]] being pressed doubled from 2012 to 2017. This increased interest in crime is attributed to popular true crime podcasts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-08/true-crime-podcasts-help-solve-real-crimes/10346474|title=True crime podcast fans help solve real crimes|date=2018-10-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-AU}}</ref>

The Netflix show ''Making A Murderer'' has had a range of real-life effects, ranging from the show being shown in law schools as instructional material to increased mistrust in criminal investigators.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/steven-avery/2016/05/12/making-murderer-impact-far-reaching/84194936/|title='Making a Murderer' impact far-reaching|last=Thompson|first=Andy|publisher=Post-Crescent Media|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
The true crime genre has been criticized as being disrespectful to crime victims and their families. Author [[Jack Miles]] believes this genre has a high potential to cause harm and mental [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] to the real people involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miles|first=Jack|date=December 1991|title=Imagining Mayhem: Fictional Violence vs. "True Crime"|journal=The North American Review|volume=276|issue=4|pages=57–64|jstor=25125321}}</ref> True crime media can be produced without the consent of the victim's family, which can lead to their being re-traumatized.<ref name=":02">{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/the-secret-my-family-traumatised-murder-tv-drama-bereaved|title=My family was traumatised first by a murder, then by the TV serialisation|last=Bradford|first=Lauren|date=2016-05-02|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Recent discussions about the consumption of true crime media have also focused on the impact on the audience's mental health.<ref name=":1" />

Depending on the writer, true crime can adhere strictly to well-established facts in [[journalism|journalistic]] fashion or can be highly speculative.<ref name="Gregoriou2011-59" /> Writers can selectively choose which information to present and which to leave out in order to support their [[narrative]].<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/17/hbo-confirmation-anita-hill-clarence-thomas|title=HBO's Confirmation: how far is too far when it comes to retelling the truth?|last=Brockes|first=Emma|date=2016-04-17|newspaper=The Guardian|location=UK|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Author Christiana Gregoriou analyzed several books of the genre and concluded that [[Tabloid journalism|tabloidization]] and fictionalization are pervasive in the works of some of the authors of true crime literature.
