==Biography==
===Early life and ''Blissed Out'' (1990)===
Reynolds was born in [[London]] in 1963<ref name="backpages">[http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/simon-reynolds Rock's Backpages - Simon Reynolds]</ref> and grew up in [[Berkhamsted]].<ref>[http://pitchfork.com/features/tpr/reader/worth-their-wait/ Worth Their Wait | Features | Pitchfork] Retrieved 30 October 2016.</ref> Inspired by his younger brother Tim, he became interested in rock and specifically punk in 1978.<ref name= Reynolds>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |year=2006 |title=[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]] |location=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0-571-21570-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> In the early 1980s, he attended [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. After graduating, in 1984 he co-founded the Oxford-based music journal ''Monitor'' with his friends and future ''Melody Maker'' colleagues Paul Oldfield and [[David Stubbs]] along with Hilary Little and Chris Scott.<ref name="backpages"/>

In 1986, Reynolds joined the staff of ''[[Melody Maker]]'', where his writing was marked by enthusiasm for a wave of [[neo-psychedelic rock]] and [[hip hop]] artists that emerged in the mid-1980s (including [[A.R. Kane]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Throwing Muses]] and [[The Young Gods]]). During this period, Reynolds and his ''Melody Maker'' colleagues set themselves in opposition to what they characterized as the conservative [[humanism]] of the era's [[indie rock]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[pop music]], as well as the unadventurous style and approach of most music criticism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |date=1990 |title=Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock |url= |location= |publisher=Serpent's Tail |page= |isbn=1-85242-199-1 |access-date= }}</ref> Pieces from this late Eighties era would form the remixed collection ''Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock'', published in 1990.<ref name="readysteady">[http://www.readysteadybook.com/Article.aspx?page=simonreynolds ReadySteadyBook - Simon Reynolds Interview]</ref>

===Freelance and ''Energy Flash'' (1998)===
In 1990, Reynolds left the staff of ''Melody Maker'' (although he would continue to contribute to the magazine until 1996) and became a [[freelance]] writer, splitting his time between London and New York. In the early 1990s, he became involved in [[rave]] culture and the [[electronic dance music]] scene, particularly that of the UK, and became a [[music critic|writer]] on the development of what he would later conceptualise as the "[[UK hardcore|hardcore]] continuum" along with its surrounding culture such as pirate radio.<ref name="readysteady"/> Much of this writing was later published in ''[[Energy Flash|Energy Flash: a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture]]'' (1998), a history of the [[breakbeat hardcore|hardcore]], [[house music|house]], [[techno]] and later rave genres like [[jungle music]] and [[gabber]]. The book was published that same year in America in abridged form, with the title ''Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture''.

During this time, he also theorized the concept of  "[[post-rock]]", using the term first in a ''Melody Maker'' 1993 feature about [[Insides (band)|Insides]] and then in a more developed form in a May 1994 thinkpiece for [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] and in a review of [[Bark Psychosis]]' album ''[[Hex (Bark Psychosis album)|Hex]]'', published in the March 1994 issue of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine.<ref name="Mojo">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=5803|title=Bark Psychosis: ''Hex''|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=March 1994|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}</ref> In late 1994, Reynolds moved to the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 1995, with his wife, [[Joy Press]], Reynolds co-authored ''The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll'', a critical analysis of gender in rock. In 1998 Reynolds became a senior editor at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine in the US. In 1999, he returned to freelance work.

In 2013, a second expanded update of ''Energy Flash'' was published, with new material on the rise of [[dubstep]] to worldwide popularity and the EDM or [[Electronic Dance Music]] explosion in America.

===''Rip It Up and Start Again'' (2005) and ''Retromania'' (2011)===
In 2005, Reynolds released ''[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]]'', a history of the [[post-punk]] era.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/inventory-17-essential-books-about-popular-music,1607/ The A.V. Club, ''Inventory: 17 Essential Books About Popular Music'']</ref> In 2007, Reynolds published ''Bring the Noise: 20 Years of Writing about Hip Rock and Hip Hop'' in the UK, a collection of his writing themed around the relationship between white bohemian rock and black street music. In 2008, an updated edition of ''Energy Flash'' was published, with new chapters on the decade of dance music following the appearance of the first edition. In 2009, a companion volume to ''Rip It Up and Start Again'' was published, ''Totally Wired: Postpunk Interviews and Overviews'', containing interview transcripts and new essays.

In 2011, Reynolds published ''Retromania: Pop Culture's Addiction to Its Own Past'', a critical investigation into what he perceives as the current situation of chronic retrogression in pop music, with a focus on the effects of the internet and digital culture on music consumption and musical creativity.<ref>Adam Harper, [http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/record-recollection/ "Record Recollection"], ''[[Oxonian Review]]'', 2 June 2011</ref>

===''Shock and Awe'' (2016) to present===
Reynolds's eighth book, a history of the [[glam rock]] era, ''Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy'', was published in October 2016.<ref>Faber Social. ''Shock and Awe by Simon Reynolds''. 18 July 2016.</ref>

In addition to writing books, Reynolds has continued freelancing for magazines, giving lectures, writing liner notes, and appearing in music documentaries. He also operates a [[blog]], ''Blissblog'' along with various satellite blogs such as the book-focused outlets ''Energy Flash'', ''Retromania'' and ''Shock and Awe'', and the drivel blog ''Hardly Baked''. Reynolds also maintains an archive for his writing, the blog ''ReynoldsRetro''. He resides in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>[https://m3event.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/interview-simon-reynolds/ M3 - Simon Reynolds Interview]</ref>

==Critical style==
Reynolds' writing has blended [[cultural criticism]] with music journalism.<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=From Bowie to Gaga: How Glam Rock Lives On|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1333-from-bowie-to-gaga-how-glam-rock-lives-on/|website=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> He has written extensively on [[gender]], [[Social class|class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in relation to music and culture. Early in his career, Reynolds often made use of [[critical theory]] and [[philosophy]] in his analysis of music, deriving particular influence from thinkers such as [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]].<ref name="readysteady"/> He has on occasion used the [[Marxist]] concepts of [[commodity fetishism]] and [[false consciousness]] to describe attitudes prevalent in [[hip hop music]].<ref>Simon Reynolds: [http://bringthenoisesimonreynolds.blogspot.com/2008/03/bring-noise-deleted-scene-51-jay-z-vol.html Review of JAY-Z, Vol. 3... Life and Times of S.Carter / DMX, And Then There Was X / JUVENILE, Tha G-Code /THE LOX, We Are The Streets] [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], May 2000 (online copy at Reynolds "Bring The Noise" blog)</ref> In discussing the relationship between class and music, Reynolds coined the term ''liminal class'', defined as the upper-[[working class]] and lower-[[middle-class]], a group he credits with "a lot of music energy".<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/simonreynolds31.html Perfect Sound Forever: Simon Reynolds interview on post-punk]</ref> Reynolds has also written about [[drug culture]] and its relationship to various musical developments and movements.<ref>Simon Reynolds: [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n10_v34/ai_18533846 High society - Irvine Welsh's film 'Trainspotting']. [[Artforum]], Summer 1996</ref>  In the 2000s, in tandem with fellow critic and blogger [[Mark Fisher]], Reynolds made use of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s concept of [[hauntology]] to describe a [[hauntology (music)|strain of music]] and popular art preoccupied with the disjointed temporality and "lost futures" of contemporary culture.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2011/07/musica-globalista-simon-reynolds-on-undead-hauntology/ The Guardian - Hauntology: A not-so-new critical manifestation]</ref>

==Year-end critics' polls==
Reynolds has voted in a number of year-end critics' polls, most often for ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''{{'}}s [[Rewind (The Wire)|Rewind]] and for ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Pazz & Jop]]. Since 2011, when ''The Wire'' renamed its year-end poll from Records of the Year to Releases of the Year, Reynolds has cast several votes for songs rather than album-length releases. Reynold's full voting ballots and year-end commentaries for a variety of magazines, going back to the late 1980s, can be found at Reynolds's Faves/Unfaves blog.
