The '''Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan''' ({{literal translation|Philippine Democratic Party–People's Power}}), more commonly known as '''PDP–Laban''', is a left-wing [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]] founded in 1982 and the [[ruling party]] since 2016.

==History==
=== Background and early history, 1983–1988 ===
The party now known as PDP–Laban is the result of a merger between the ''Partido Demokratiko Pilipino'' and [[Lakas ng Bayan]].<ref name="philstar_737507">{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2017/09/09/1737507/how-pdp-laban-began|title=How PDP-Laban began {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/405311/|title=Wenceslao: Old PDP-Laban|last=Wenceslao|first=Bong O.|date=November 16, 2017|work=Sunstar|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref> Former Olongapo City mayor Teodoro “Teddy” Macapagal, Rodrigo Duterte and Nene Pimentel founded PDP-Laban.<ref>{{Cite web|title=President appoints Macapagal to PNOC|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/09/11/news/regions/president-appoints-macapagal-to-pnoc/614168/|access-date=2020-07-19|website=The Manila Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) was founded on February 6, 1982 in Cebu City by [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.|Aquilino "Nene" Pimentel Jr.]] and a group of protesters against the authoritarian government of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|10th]] [[President of the Philippines]], and the then-ruling [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan|Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL)]].<ref name="philstar_737507"/> These protesters included the leaders of [[Davao City]] and [[Cagayan de Oro City]], such as Zafiro L. Respicio, Rey Magno Teves, Cesar R. Ledesma, Samuel Occeña, Crispin Lanorias and Mords Cua.

====Merger and participation in the 1986 snap election====
By 1983, PDP had formed a coalition with [[Lakas ng Bayan]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "People's Power"), the party founded by former Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] in 1978.

In 1986, the two groups merged to form the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan or PDP–Laban. During that period, PDP–Laban became the single biggest opposition group to run against the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap presidential election]]. [[Corazon Aquino]], the widow of the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassinated]] senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became the party's nominee to run for [[President of the Philippines|President]]. Aquino was persuaded to run by businessman, newspaperman and street parliamentarian [[Chino Roces|Joaquin Roces]], who was convinced that Aquino would have the biggest chance to defeat Marcos in the polls.

Roces started the "Cory Aquino for President" movement to gather one million voters in one week to urge Aquino to run for president. However, another opposition group led by Senator [[Salvador Laurel]] of [[Batangas]] was also participating in the election, with Laurel being its presidential bet. Before the election, Aquino approached Laurel and offered to give up her allegiance to the PDP–Laban party and run as president under Laurel's [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization]] (UNIDO) party. Laurel later approached Aquino, offering her only the vice-vresidential nomination of UNIDO (or Unity). In the end, Laurel became the vice-presidential running-mate of Aquino, after being convinced to do so by the [[Archbishop of Manila]], [[Jaime Sin|Jaime Cardinal Sin]].

PDP–Laban then aligned itself with UNIDO, which became the main group and leader of the coalition which opposed Marcos. After the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986, which saw Aquino and Laurel proclaimed President and Vice President respectively, PDP–Laban continued its alliance with UNIDO until the latter's dissolution in 1987. In 1988, PDP–Laban was split into two factions: the Pimentel Wing led by [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]] and the Cojuangco Wing led by [[Jose Cojuangco, Jr.]]. The Cojuangco Wing and the Lakas ng Bayan party of House Speaker [[Ramon Mitra, Jr.]] merged in 1988 to form the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] party.

===Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and majority in Congress, 2016–present===
{{As of|2016|05|post=,}} PDP–Laban is headed by its president, senator [[Aquilino Pimentel III|Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III]], after the then incumbent Vice-President of the Philippines, [[Jejomar Binay]], resigned as party chairman and left the party. Binay later created [[United Nationalist Alliance]] or UNA.

The party is currently re-grouping, and there are some movements of expansion especially in [[Mindanao]], where it originated, particularly in the [[Davao Region|Davao region]]. Two of the party's founders, Crispin Lanorias and Cesar Ledesma, are again active in recent party activities. After the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 elections]], PDP–Laban signed a coalition agreement with the [[Nacionalista Party]], [[Lakas–CMD]], [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]] and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], witnessed by then President-elect [[Rodrigo Duterte]].

Immediately after the May 2016 elections, several [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|representatives]] from other parties moved to PDP–Laban, notably: [[Geraldine Roman]] ([[Bataan]]), [[Alfred Vargas]] ([[Quezon City]]), and [[Ansaruddin Alonto Adiong|Ansaruddin Adiong]] ([[Lanao del Sur]]).<ref name="More_join">{{cite news|title=More LP lawmakers, local officials jump ship to admin party|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/11/10-congressmen-jump-ship-to-PDP-Laban.html|accessdate=January 21, 2018|agency=''CNN Philippines''|date=May 11, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717042521/http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/11/10-congressmen-jump-ship-to-PDP-Laban.html|archivedate=July 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The party's presence in the House of Representatives eventually grew from three members in the [[16th Congress of the Philippines|16th Congress]], to 123 members in the current [[17th Congress of the Philippines|17th Congress]].<ref name="Supermajority">{{cite news|last1=Cabacungan|first1=Gil|title=From 3 to 300, PDP-Laban forms ‘supermajority’ in House|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/787547/from-3-to-300-pdp-laban-forms-supermajority-in-house|accessdate=January 21, 2018|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109182408/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/787547/from-3-to-300-pdp-laban-forms-supermajority-in-house|archivedate=January 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Paolo|title=Pimentel denies Alvarez booted out of PDP-Laban|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/08/27/1733156/pimentel-denies-alvarez-booted-out-pdp-laban|accessdate=January 21, 2018|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=August 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826232154/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/08/27/1733156/pimentel-denies-alvarez-booted-out-pdp-laban|archivedate=August 26, 2017}}</ref> By April 2018, 300,000 politicians had joined the party, according to Koko Pimentel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/985397/300000-politicians-have-jumped-ship-to-pdp-laban-says-pimentel|title=300,000 politicians have jumped ship to PDP-Laban, says Pimentel|last=See|first=Aie Balagtas|access-date=July 8, 2018}}</ref>

Reacting to the influx of new members, party founder Nene Pimentel urged members to question the motivations of new incoming politicians and ensure they are interested in the party's ideals. He stated that these new members might only be interested in identifying with the current administration, in order to boost their chances of winning in the upcoming 2019 elections.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/177090-nene-pimentel-pdp-laban-question-motives|title=Question new members' motives, Nene Pimentel urges PDP-Laban|work=Rappler|access-date=July 8, 2018}}</ref>

==== Leadership crisis ====
On July 23, 2018, the same day as [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|Duterte's third State of the Nation Address]], an internal leadership dispute within the House of Representatives' majority resulted in former president and current Pampanga representative [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] becoming [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] of the lower house, replacing Pantaleon Alvarez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/25/1836677/arroyo-alvarez-meet-after-house-leadership-change|title=Arroyo, Alvarez meet after House leadership change {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/videos/2018/07/25/House-holds-first-full-session-under-Speaker-Arroyo.html|title=House holds first full session under Speaker Arroyo|work=cnn|access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/25/18/arroyo-meets-alvarez-following-house-coup|title=Arroyo meets Alvarez following House coup|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref> The resolution was adopted that same night with 184 voting in favor and 12 abstaining.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/25/18/amid-shouting-house-adopts-resolution-recognizing-arroyo-as-speaker|title=Amid shouting, House adopts resolution recognizing Arroyo as Speaker|last=News|first=RG Cruz, ABS-CBN|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref> Arroyo was previously a member of Lakas–CMD, before switching to PDP–Laban in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/gma-leaves-lakas-cmd-for-pdp-laban-to-consolidate-support-for-du30/|title=GMA leaves Lakas–CMD for PDP-Laban to ‘consolidate support’ for DU30|date=October 11, 2017|website=Interaksyon}}</ref>
