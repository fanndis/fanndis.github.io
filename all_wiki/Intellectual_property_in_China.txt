'''Intellectual property rights''' (IPRs) have been acknowledged and protected in [[China]] since the 1980s. China has acceded to the major international conventions on protection of rights to [[intellectual property]]. Domestically, protection of intellectual property law has also been established by government legislation, administrative regulations, and decrees in the areas of [[trademark]], [[copyright]], and [[patent]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This has led to the creation of a comprehensive legal framework to protect both local and foreign intellectual property. Despite this, copyright violations are common in the PRC.<ref>[http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2009/2009-special-301-report USTR 2009 Special 301 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505011016/http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2009/2009-special-301-report |date=5 May 2010 }}, 30 April 2009.</ref> The American Chamber of Commerce in China surveyed over 500 of its members doing business in China regarding IPR for its ''2016 China Business Climate Survey Report'', and found that IPR enforcement is improving, but significant challenges still remain. The results show that the laws in place exceed their actual enforcement, with patent protection receiving the highest approval rate, while protection of trade secrets lags far behind. Many US companies have claimed that the Chinese government has stolen their intellectual property sometime in 2009–2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/1-in-5-companies-say-china-stole-their-ip-within-the-last-year-cnbc.html|title=1 in 5 corporations say China has stolen their IP within the last year: CNBC CFO survey|first=Eric|last=Rosenbaum|date=1 March 2019|website=CNBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/chinese-theft-of-trade-secrets-is-on-the-rise-us-doj-warns.html|title=Chinese theft of trade secrets on the rise, the US Justice Department warns|first=Nancy|last=Hungerford|date=23 September 2019|website=CNBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2019/03/01/china-ip-theft/|title=One in Five U.S. Companies Say China Has Stolen Their Intellectual Property|website=Fortune}}</ref>

==International conventions==
In 1980, China became a member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO).

It has patterned its IPR laws on the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

China acceded to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] on 19 December 1984 and became an official member on 19 March 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/remarks.jsp?cnty_id=209C|title=Treaties and Contracting Parties > Contracting Parties > Paris Convention > China|website=wipo.int|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> China also acceded to the [[Madrid Agreement|Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of Trademarks]] in June 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_id=21|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties > Contracting Parties > Madrid Agreement (Marks)|website=www.wipo.int|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>

In January 1992, the PRC entered into a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with the United States government to provide copyright protection for all American "works" and for other foreign works. Several bilateral negotiations have been conducted between the two governments. At some points, trade sanctions were threatened by the two governments over IPRs issues. At the conclusion of negotiations in 1995, the ''Sino-US Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights'' was signed. In June 1996, the two governments entered into another agreement protecting American intellectual property in the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Generally, once the PRC has acceded to an international treaty, the [[Local people's courts|People's Courts]] can quote the provisions of the treaty directly in deciding an [[intellectual property infringement]] case, without reference to a Chinese domestic law by which the treaty provision is incorporated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==National legal framework==
The legal framework for protecting intellectual property in the PRC is built on three national laws passed by the [[National People's Congress]]: the ''Patent Law'', the ''Trademark Law'' and the ''Copyright Law''. A great number of regulations, rules, measures and policies have been made by the [[NPC Standing Committee]], the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] and various ministries, bureaux and commissions. The circulars, opinions and notices of the [[Supreme People's Court]] also form part of the legal framework.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Trademark law===
{{Main|People's Republic of China's trademark law}}

The ''Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China'' (中华人民共和国商标法) sets out general guidelines on administration of trademarks, protection of trademark owners' exclusive rights and maintenance of quality of products or services bearing the registered trademarks, "with a view to protecting consumer interests and to promoting the development of the socialist market economy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/China/201910/20191002905585.shtml|title=Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China|website=mofcom.gov.cn|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>

Adhering to Article 4 of the Paris Convention, the Chinese government passed the ''Provisional Regulations Governing Application for Priority Registration of Trademarks in China'' to grant the right of priority to trademark applications submitted in PRC by the nationals of the Paris Convention member countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Copyright law===
{{wikisource|Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China}}
Copyright law is mainly governed by the ''{{illm|Copyright Law of the PRC|zh|中华人民共和国著作权法}}'' (中华人民共和国著作权法)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/China/201910/20191002905583.shtml|title=Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China|website=mofcom.gov.cn|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> and the ''Implementing Rules for the Copyright Law of the PRC'' (著作权法实施条例), the Copyright Law of the PRC adopted and promulgated in 1990 and the "Implementing Rules" adopted in 1991 and revised in 2002. In most cases the copyright term is the life of the author plus 50 years, but for cinematographic and photographic works and works created by a company or organization the term is 50 years after first publication.

To implement the Berne Convention and the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], as well as bilateral copyright treaties signed between the PRC and other foreign countries, the PRC government passed the ''Regulations on Implementation of International Copyright Treaties'' (1992). These have given foreign copyright holders protection for their rights and interests in the PRC.

Before the PRC acceded to the Berne Convention, computer software was not treated as a kind of literary work under the ''Copyright Law''. In May 1991, the State Council passed the ''Computer Software Protection Rules''. Based upon these rules, the ''Measures for Computer Software Copyright Registration'' were formulated by the then Ministry of Engineering Electronics Industries. These regulations provide a set of rules covering the definitions of various terms and the registration, examination and approval of computer software programmes in the PRC. At the moment both the Berne Convention and these two domestic computer regulations are co-effective. However, in the event of any inconsistencies, the Berne Convention prevails.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Berne Convention does not require [[copyright registration]], and thus protection in the PRC technically does not require registration. However, registering copyrights for literary works can avoid, or at least simplify, ownership disputes. Copyright registration cost is 300 RMB. On the downside, the copyright registration process requires the registrant to disclose detailed information, including software source code, which companies might be reluctant to share.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Patent law===
{{Main|Patent law of China}}
China passed the ''Patent Law of the PRC''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/China/201910/20191002905592.shtml|title=Patent Law of the People's Republic of China|website=mofcom.gov.cn|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> (中华人民共和国专利法) to encourage invention-creation and to promote the development of science and technology.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Text of the 1984 Patent Law |url=http://iprchina.blogspot.com/2009/10/patent-law-1984.html |work=IPR China blog |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> The subsequent ''Implementing Regulations of the Patent Law of the PRC'' added clarification.

===Other legislation===
Apart from major legislation on trademarks, copyright and patents, a few other laws and regulations have been passed to deal with intellectual property related issues. In 1986, the ''General Principles of Civil Law'' was adopted to protect the lawful civil rights and interests of citizens and legal persons, and to correctly regulate civil relations. Articles 94-97 of the ''General Principles of Civil Law'' deal with intellectual property rights of Chinese citizens and legal persons.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the 1990s, many more pieces of legislation were passed to perfect the intellectual property protection system. These include the ''Regulations on Customs Protection of Intellectual Property Rights'' (1995) and the ''Law Against Unfair Competition of the PRC'' (1993).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The latter prohibited the passing off of registered trademarks, infringing trade secrets, the illegal use of well-known goods or names of other people, as well as other misleading and deceptive conduct. The ''Advertising Law of the PRC'' was passed in 1994 to prohibit the unfair, misleading and deceptive conduct involving patent advertising or other advertising activities in general.

==Implementation==
To enforce IPR protection, an administrative system has been established within the government. After the reshuffle of the State Council in March 1998, the Patent Office became part of the [[State Intellectual Property Office]]. The Trademarks Office is still under the authority of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. The Copyright Office falls within the State Administration for Press and Publication. A similar system exists at various levels of local government. Commonly, enforcement of IPRs will be carried out by local IPRs personnel, assisted by police from the local Public Security Bureau.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Creation of Specialized Intellectual Property Courts and Tribunals ===
In recent years, China has begun to establish specialized intellectual property courts to more effectively resolve disputes. These courts have many similarities to specialized IP courts in other parts of the world, such as the [[Intellectual Property High Court]] in Japan, in that they focus on developing expertise within a highly technical field of law. In August 2014, the [[National People's Congress]] promulgated a decision to pilot 3 specialized intellectual property courts in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c12489/201409/9d38b14721f44b35817082f371afb76a.shtml|title=Decision on the establishment of intellectual property courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou|date=August 31, 2014|website=National People's Congress|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> Then, in October 2014 the [[Supreme People's Court]] provided additional regulatory guidance on specialized intellectual property court jurisdiction.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinacourt.org/law/detail/2014/10/id/147980.shtml|title=Provisions of the Supreme People's Court on the Jurisdiction of Intellectual Property Courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou|last=Supreme People's Court|date=October 31, 2014|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> The specialized IP courts sit at the intermediate court level and have first instance jurisdiction over all technically complex civil and administrative IP cases (including patents, new plant varieties, integrated circuit layout designs, trade secrets, and computer software). They also have first instance jurisdiction over well-known trademarks and deal with all other IP cases upon appeal from the basic people’s courts in their province.86 In terms of administrative law, the [[Beijing Intellectual Property Court]] also has special, first-instance jurisdiction over administrative appeals brought against decisions issued by administrative IP adjudication bodies.<ref name=":0" /> Since 2017, the system has expanded to include 20 specialized IP tribunals across the country.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Weightman|first=William|date=2020-01-01|title=Is the Emperor Still Far Away? Centralization, Professionalization, and Uniformity in China's Intellectual Property Reforms, 19 UIC Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 145 (2020)|url=https://repository.jmls.edu/ripl/vol19/iss2/3|journal=The John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law|volume=19|issue=2|issn=1930-8140}}</ref> Although these tribunals are administratively a part of the intermediate people’s court in their city, they have cross-regional and exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over IP cases—similar to the IP courts established in 2014.<ref name=":1" /> 

=== Customs Enforcement ===
Customs protection is another positive mechanism in law enforcement with regard to IPRs. The ''Regulations on Customs Protection of Intellectual Property Rights'' (中华人民共和国知识产权海关保护条例), promulgated in June 1995, strengthened border control to stop counterfeited goods from coming into, or leaving, the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Despite this regulation existing as a legislative capacity, the ability to enforce these laws varies according to the differing interpretations that exist amongst the local governmental authorities in China. Despite the growing number of raids on hubs for traders of counterfeited goods and the rise in the number of lawsuits brought against companies that use counterfeited technology, codes, or logos, the level of government response does not match the degree to which counterfeiting is happening in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Papageorgiou|first=Elliot|title=China's anti-piracy measures 'inconsistent', lawyer argues|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/13185241|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-04-26|date=26 April 2011}}</ref> The rate at which the legal implementation has proceeded more closely matches the desires of IP protection from Chinese businesses and other bastions of capital.<ref>{{cite web|title=WTO China Piracy Ruling: It Ain't Worth A Thing....|url=http://www.chinalawblog.com/2009/01/wto_china_piracy_ruling_it_ain.html|publisher=China Law Blog|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>

===Difficulties===
The enforcement of protection of intellectual property rights is particularly difficult in the PRC. Without adequate education with regard to IPRs, there is little awareness that infringement is a crime. For example, though the first intellectual property law was drafted in 1982, the first IPR training centre was not established until 1996.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Sometimes local protectionism may dilute the strength of central legislation or the power of law enforcement. For example, local governments might not want to genuinely support the work of copyright protection supervisors. It may create obstacles during IPRs investigation and assist local counterfeiters by letting them hide their production lines in safer places. When counterfeiters have good connections with local governmental or law enforcement officials, they may find an umbrella for their counterfeiting activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Priest|first=Eric|title=The Future of Music and Film Piracy in China|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|year=2006|volume=21|series=795|pages=796–870|url=http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol21/21_2/21-berkeley-tech-l-j-0795-0872.pdf}}</ref>

Chinese government-sponsored search-engine [[Baidu]] provides links to third-party websites that offer online counterfeit products as well as access to counterfeit hardware and merchandise. The Chinese government dominates 70% of its country's search engine revenue and has been called on by US officials to limit the activity of online counterfeiting groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=China Baidu search engine profits more than treble|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12331266|accessdate=2011-04-25 | work=BBC News|date=31 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US says China's Baidu is notorious pirated goods market|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12605067|accessdate=2011-04-25 | work=BBC News|date=1 March 2011}}</ref>

==Cases==
The first major dispute on violation of intellectual property rights was filed in April 1992 by [[Wang Yongmin]], the inventor of [[Wubi method|Wubi]], against [[Dongnan Corporation]].<ref name="qq">[http://tech.qq.com/a/20070813/000181.htm 分析：王永民败诉五笔字型专利案真相] In 腾讯网, 13 August 2007.</ref>

According to [[Zheng Chengsi]], the first major copyright case involving a foreign party was ''[[Walt Disney Productions vs. Beijing Publisher and Co]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In March 1992 Chinese authorities found that Shenzhen reflective materials institute had copied 650,000 Microsoft Corporation holograms. The institute was found to be guilty of trademark infringement against Microsoft, but was fined a mere US$252. Losses to Microsoft as a result of the infringement are estimated at US$30 million.<ref>Gregory, A. (2003). The Impact of China’s Accession to the WTO. In Cass, D, Barker, G., and Willims, B (Eds.), China and the World Trading System (Pg. 330). NY: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

In 2001, the China Environmental Project Tech Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against American company Huayang Electronics Co. and Japanese FKK after those companies profited using a CEPT patented technique for using seawater in a fuel gas desulphurization process.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CEPT prevails in 8-year legal saga. |work=Intellectual Property Protection China |date=26 February 2010 |url=http://www.chinaipr.gov.cn/casesarticle/cases/caseothers/201002/616526_1.html |access-date=17 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004062540/http://www.chinaipr.gov.cn/casesarticle/cases/caseothers/201002/616526_1.html |archive-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though the Supreme Court ruled in favor of CEPT, the court failed to issue an injunction because the infringing process was being used to generate electricity and an injunction would interfere with the public interest. The court instead awarded RMB 50 million to CEPT.<ref name="MWE China Law Offices"/>

In 2007, CHINT Group Co. Ltd sued French low-voltage electronics manufacturer [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] for infringement of a circuit breaker utility model patent. The Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court ruled in CHINT's favor, awarding RMB 334.8 million to the Chinese manufacturer, the highest amount ever in a Chinese IP case. After Schneider appealed to the High Court of Zhejiang province, the courts mediated the issue and the parties settled for RMB 157.5 million.<ref name="MWE China Law Offices">{{Cite web |title=Top Ten Chinese Intellectual Property Cases of 2009 |publisher=MWE China Law Offices |date=10 August 2010 |url=http://www.mwe.com/info/news/wp_c0810a.pdf}}</ref> In its judgement, the Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court labeled the case "the no. 1 case of patent infringement in China". At the EU–China summit 2007, [[EU Trade Commissioner]] [[Peter Mandelson]] said, "I regard the SCHNEIDER case as a test case of the level playing field in China on intellectual property protection that we want to see".<ref>{{Cite web |author=Yang, Harry. |title=CHINT v. SCHNEIDER on Patent Infringement |work=China Intellectual Property Magazine |date=2 January 2008 |url=http://www.chinaipmagazine.com/en/journal-show.asp?id=258}}</ref>

In 2010, US law firm Gipson Hoffman & Pancione filed a suit against the Chinese government on allegations of distributing an unlicensed version of the cyber-filtering software of the US company Solid Oak.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10434551-245.html|title= U.S. law firm behind China piracy suit targeted in attacks|date= 2010-01-13|publisher = CNET}}</ref>

==U.S. Priority Watchlist==
In 2014, the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] once again placed China on its "priority watch list" for [[intellectual property]] rights violations, along with other nations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/reports-and-publications/2014/2014-Special-301-Report | title = 2014 Special 301 Report}}</ref> In addition, the U.S., based on claims brought to it by the [[China Copyright Alliance]] (CCA) – a group of major copyright industry associations and select companies – brought two [[World Trade Organization]] cases against China, one focused on intellectual property rights violations, and one based on market access deficiencies.  In both cases, it was ruled that China must change its operating standards to comply with WTO rules; in the IPR case, a helpful standard was established as to the definition of "commercial scale" for which criminal penalties would be required, but found that the U.S. had not supplied sufficient evidence to show that China's 500 copy threshold for criminal liability left some "commercial scale" infringement cases without a criminal remedy.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/20/us-china-usa-wto-idUSTRE52J3T920090320|title= China, U.S. trade barbs over WTO piracy case|date= 2009-03-20|publisher= Reuters}}</ref>
