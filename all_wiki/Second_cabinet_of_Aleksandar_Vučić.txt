The [[Government of Serbia]], the second one led by [[Prime Minister of Serbia|prime minister]] [[Aleksandar Vučić]], was elected on 11 August 2016 by a majority vote in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]].<ref name=Reuters>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-serbia-government-idUKKCN10M1TO |title=New Serbian government gets parliament approval |publisher=Reuters |date=11 August 2016}}</ref> [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2016|Parliamentary election]] was held on 24 April 2016, and the ruling coalition of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]] and the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], running in separate lists, won the total of 160 out of 250 seats and retained its parliamentary majority. While the Vučić's Progressive party again won enough seats to form the government alone, he decided to continue cooperation with the Socialists.

The cabinet comprises ministers from the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), [[Social Democratic Party of Serbia]] (SDPS), [[Movement of Socialists]] (PS) and [[Party of United Pensioners of Serbia]] (PUPS), as well as some without a party affiliation.

Eleven of them served in the [[first cabinet of Aleksandar Vučić|previous cabinet]] and eight are new.<ref name=N1>{{cite web|url=http://rs.n1info.com/a183266/Vesti/Vesti/Objavljen-sastav-nove-Vlade.html |title=Objavljen sastav nove Vlade, osam novih imena |publisher=N1 |date=8 August 2016}}</ref>
