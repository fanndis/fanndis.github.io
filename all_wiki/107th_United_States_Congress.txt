Bush]] [[Presidency of George W. Bush|presidency]]. The apportionment of seats in this [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[1990 United States Census]]. The House of Representatives had a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority, and the Senate switched majorities from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to Republican and back to Democratic. By the end of term, Republicans had regained the majority in the Senate, but since the body was out of session reorganization was delayed till the next Congress.<ref name="partydiv" />
