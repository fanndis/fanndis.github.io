'''Cloo''' (stylized as '''cloo''')  is a former American [[pay television]] [[television channel|channel]] which aired programming originally dedicated to the [[crime drama|crime]] and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[genre]]s, though it often fell out of this format in its later years with a more generic selection of series and films, and was used as an example of [[channel drift]] and superfluous [[Product bundling|channel bundling]], presenting series easily found through other venues. The network was owned and operated by [[NBCUniversal]].

{{as of|2015|February}}, approximately 25,495,000 American households (21.9% of households with television) received Cloo, though this declined with later removals by several cable services as carriage agreements expired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref>

Cloo launched on January 1, 2006, as Sleuth, replacing [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]]. The channel ceased all operations on February 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beld.net/?q=node/494|title=NBCUniversal will discontinue the Cloo network 2/1/2017|work=Beld.net|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.tdstelecom.com/tv/insp-coming-to-tds-tv-cloo-shutting-down/|title=INSP coming to TDS TV, Cloo shutting down|last=Kellor|first=Missy|work=[[TDS Telecom]]|date=January 31, 2017|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnics.com/channel-removal/|title=Channel Removal|work=RC Technologies|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Sleuth logo.svg|150px|thumb|left|Logo at launch as Sleuth.]]
Cloo focused on mystery entertainment, with the majority of the channel's programming sourced from fellow Comcast networks such as [[NBC]] and [[USA Network]]. As of the fall of 2016 the network's schedule was made up mostly of repeats of current USA Network series, and marathons of acquired series from the ''[[Law & Order (franchise)|Law and Order]]'', ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' franchises, along with the original ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' and ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. Films from the NBCUniversal library or acquired as part of USA Network's film rights purchases were also part of the schedule, meaning films having nothing to do with crimes or mysteries, such as ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', ''[[The 40 Year-Old Virgin]]'' and ''[[Bee Movie]]'', aired on the network.<ref name="indiewireclosure">{{cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/cloo-cable-channel-shut-down-nbc-universal-oxygen-1201776892/|title=NBCUniversal Shuts Down Crime Drama Channel ‘Cloo’ After 10 Years|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=1 February 2017|work=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

On August 15, 2011 '''Cloo''' was rebranded from its former name of '''Sleuth''', in order for NBCU to be able to trademark and own the name, as the word "[[wikt:clue|clue]]" itself is too common a name to be trademarkable and the commonness of both "sleuth" and "clue" would not work for [[search engine optimization]]. In addition, the different spelling averted any confusion with [[Hasbro]]'s board game [[Cluedo|Clue]].<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sleuth-Name-Cloo-1031554.aspx Exclusive: Sleuth Gets A New Name: Meet Cloo], ''TV Guide'', April 7, 2011</ref><ref name=original>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Exclusive-Newly-Rebranded-1035347.aspx Exclusive: Newly Rebranded Cloo TV Picks Up First Original Series] ''TV Guide'' July 15, 2011</ref>

===Carriage decline and closure===
On August 10, 2013, Cloo was dropped by [[Dish Network]], which cited that most of the network's rerun-centric programming was duplicative of that available on other NBCUniversal networks, streaming services, and the broadcast [[Ion Television]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DISH/posts/10151788911550851|title=Dish Network Facebook page response: "...We removed Cloo because most of the content they offered was available on other stations."|date=12 August 2013|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> A year later on August 18, 2014, it was removed from [[Verizon FIOS]] for the same reason.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20140829-column.html|title=Why isn't your pay-TV bill reduced when a channel is removed?|last=Lazarus|first=David|date=28 August 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>

[[Charter Communications]] ([[Charter Spectrum|Spectrum]], [[Bright House Networks]] and [[Time Warner Cable]]) effectively ended the network's life in January 2017, as with [[Esquire Network]] (another Comcast/NBCU network which was discontinued on June 28, 2017), when it refused to continue their carriage of Cloo within their new carriage agreements with NBCUniversal, removing around <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>rds of the network's homes (bringing it down to 8.5 million households<ref>{{cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/media/small-change/308086/|title=Small Change: Why Niche Cable Nets Are on Their Last Legs &#124; Media - AdAge|last=Crupi|first=Anthony|date=27 February 2017|work=[[Advertising Age]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>), and NBCU already had been looking to remove extraneous networks without original programming since the summer of 2016, criteria included Cloo, Chiller, and Esquire fell into.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/nbcu-esquire-network-1201968897/|title=Could End of NBCU's Esquire Network Foretell More Cable Culling?|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/demise-of-participants-pivot-reflects-niche-cables-diminished-fortunes-1201840225/|title=Participant’s Pivot: Demise Reflects Niche Cable's Diminished Fortunes|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 18, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref> In the end, however, industry media had little to no notice of the closure, and only cable providers learned of its demise in advance on January 31 as of 5:59&nbsp;a.m. ET from Comcast, due to the small amount of time which passed between Charter's settlement of their new NBCUniversal carriage agreement and the network's closure. Because the network was effectively [[broadcast automation|automated]] with little to no promotions to maintain, no employees were affected by the network's closure.

The same morning, its social media presences were removed (the network's [[Facebook]] had not been updated since September 2015), and the website redirected to the USA Network site without any notice. The network's last programming day consisted of a full-series marathon of [[Syfy]]'s ''[[Continuum (TV series)|Continuum]]'', a final sign of its later channel drift. Following the end credits, a slide was shown, with the Cloo logo and the words "GOOD NIGHT!" underneath, along with "Thank you for watching Cloo", the NBCUniversal logo, and the name of the satellite that provided Cloo's broadcast (AMC 10, Transponder 7) in between two NBC logos, along with the common NBC off-air audio test using the [[NBC chimes|network's trademark chimes]], after which the channel space, created by Trio in 1994, folded and ceased to exist.<ref name="indiewireclosure"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neJac6GLgc4 Cloo has Ceased Operations on February 1, 2017 - YouTube]</ref> The end of Cloo was coincidental with another Comcast announcement that the female-focused [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] would be switched to a [[true crime]] focus the same day within the coming months.

== Programming ==

On September 17, 2011 Cloo premiered two original series, which were cancelled after their first seasons.

* ''Dateline on Cloo'', featuring repurposed ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' episodes focused on true-crime stories.
* ''Killer Instinct'', a 13-part true-crime series featuring criminal profiler Mark Safarik.

The channel originally featured crime and mystery programming from NBCUniversal's extensive library of feature films, classic television shows, reality series and documentaries. Programming initially included popular and cult television series such as ''[[Simon & Simon]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' (1967–70 and 2003 versions), ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[The Equalizer]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', ''[[Profiler (TV series)|Profiler]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[The Burning Zone]]'' and more recent canceled series such as ''[[EZ Streets]]'', ''[[Karen Sisco]]'', and ''[[Deadline (2000 TV series)|Deadline]]'', ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'', and ''[[Medical Investigation]]''. Much of this older programming eventually migrated to sister digital subchannel network [[Cozi TV]].

As Sleuth, it also aired mystery and suspense films such as ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' and ''[[Mercury Rising]]''.

On February 25, 2007, the channel aired a fourteen-hour movie marathon entitled "Chiller On Sleuth" to promote the launch of [[Chiller (TV channel)|Chiller]], a sister [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[suspense]] programming that launched four days later on March 1; The movies that aired during this marathon are ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'',  ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[I Saw What You Did]]'' (the 1988 version), and ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]''.

In January 2009, all shows from the lineup were removed and replaced with mainly [[NBCUniversal]]-produced, [[USA Network]] original shows, ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' and ''[[In Plain Sight]]'' to its lineup, running marathons of each program's episodes. ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' was added to the channel's lineup, as well as two Canadian series, ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]'' and ''[[Cold Squad]]'', which were [[Broadcast syndication|barter syndication]] series which were mainly prevalent on low-tier local television stations and digital subchannel networks such as [[Retro Television Network|RTN]]. The [[Law & Order franchise|''Law & Order'']] franchise also joined the channel. It also aired another Canadian series, ''[[The Eleventh Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]''. However, it was renamed ''Bury the Lead'', to differentiate it from the since-canceled [[Eleventh Hour (U.S. TV series)|CBS series of the same name]].

Besides the above-mentioned series and franchises, various other series aired from the [[NBCUniversal]] library with rights through USA Network aired on Cloo, along with ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' before its 2015 departure to [[Grit (TV network)|Grit]] and [[INSP (TV network)|INSP]]. In September 2014, the rights to ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' previously held by now-defunct sister network [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] moved over to Cloo until new episode partner  Spike (now [[Paramount Network]]) took all control of the cable syndication rights of ''COPS'' at the start of 2016.
