{{Politics of Nigeria}} 
The '''president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria''' is the head of state and head of government of [[Nigeria|the Federal Republic of Nigeria]]. The president of Nigeria is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Nigeria|Nigerian Armed Forces]]. The president is elected in national elections which take place every four years. The offices, powers, and titles of the head of state and the head of government were officially merged into the office of the presidency under the [[Second Nigerian Republic|1979 Constitution of Nigeria]]. The current president, [[Muhammadu Buhari]], took office on May 29, 2015, as the [[List of heads of state of Nigeria|15th]] president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=President, Muhammadu Buhari {{!}} Consulate of Nigeria, Atlanta|url=http://nigeria-consulate-atl.org/president/president-muhammadu-buhari/|last=admin|language=en|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

==History==
{{Prose|section|date=March 2019}}
On October 1, 1960, [[Nigeria]] gained independence from Britain. An all-Nigerian Executive Council was headed by a [[prime minister]], Alhaji Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]]. On November 16, 1960, [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] became the first governor-general of a federation of three regions of the north, east and west, with [[Lagos]] as the Federal Capital. Each of the regions was headed by a premier with a governor as ceremonial head. On October 1, 1963, Nigeria became a [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] and severed whatever ties were left with the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], but remained a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. An amendment to the 1960 Independence Constitution replaced the office of the [[List of governors and governors-general of Nigeria|governor-general]] with that of the president. Nnamdi Azikwe was sworn into that office on October 1, 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/pageturn/mums312-b156-i083/#page/4/mode/1up|title=bookreader demo|website=credo.library.umass.edu|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> The office at that time was primarily ceremonial, and the main duties of the president were on such things as receiving foreign dignitaries and opening Parliament. 

In a [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|January 1966 failed coup d'état]], a group of army officers, led by Major [[Chukwuma Nzeogwu]], overthrew the central and regional governments, killed the prime minister, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and tried to take control of the government. Nzeogwu was countered, captured and imprisoned by General [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]]. General Aguiyi-Ironsi was named Military Head of State.

In July 1966, a group of northern army officers revolted against the government, killed General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, and appointed the army chief of staff, General [[Yakubu Gowon]] as the head of the new military government.

In 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was deposed and General [[Murtala Mohammed]] was the head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria until his assassination in 1976. On his death, the chief-of-staff, Supreme Headquarters (equivalent to a [[Vice president|vice-president]]) general [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] assumed office of head of state in a meeting of the [[Supreme_Military_Council_of_Nigeria_(1966–1979)|Supreme Military Council]], keeping the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] established by [[Murtala Muhammed]] in place. Gen. Obasanjo was responsible for completing the democratic transition begun by his predecessor, which culminated in [[1979 Nigerian presidential election|an election in August 1979]].

In 1979, Nigeria adopted a [[Federalism|federal]] [[presidential republic|presidential]] constitution. The presidency became an executive post, with powers similar to those of his American counterpart. The legislature was a bicameral [[National Assembly (Nigeria)|National Assembly]], comprising a [[Senate of Nigeria|Senate]] and [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|House of Representatives]]. 

In October 1979, after more than 13 years of military rule, Nigeria returned to democratic rule. The National Party of Nigeria emerged victorious in the presidential election and Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]] became the first democratically elected president. 

On December 31, 1983, the military overthrew the Second Republic. Major General [[Muhammadu Buhari]] emerged as the chairman of the [[Supreme_Military_Council_of_Nigeria_(1966–1979)|Supreme Military Council (SMC)]], the new head of state.

In August 1985, General Buhari's government was peacefully overthrown by the Army chief of staff, Major General [[Ibrahim Babangida]]. Babangida became the president and chairman of the [[Armed Forces Ruling Council (Nigeria)|Armed Forces Ruling Council]].

In August 1993, General Babangida stepped down and chose an interim government to replace him. [[Ernest Shonekan]] was named as interim president. General [[Sani Abacha]] seized power from Shonekan in November 1993 and became the president and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council.

On 8 June 1998, General Abacha died at the presidential villa in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/world/new-chapter-nigeria-obituary-sani-abacha-54-beacon-brutality-era-when-brutality.html|title=NEW CHAPTER IN NIGERIA: THE OBITUARY; Sani Abacha, 54, a Beacon of Brutality In an Era When Brutality Was Standard|date=1998-06-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Rupert|first=James|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/06/09/gen-sani-abacha-dies/525d7c85-020d-4327-a342-e904104daf1d/|title=GEN.
