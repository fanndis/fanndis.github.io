'''Chris Anderson''' (born 1957) is a British-American businessman who is the head of [[TED (conference)|TED]], a non-profit organization that provides idea-based talks and hosts an annual conference in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Previously he founded [[Future Publishing]].

==Early life==
Anderson was born to British parents in Pakistan in 1957.<ref name="TED">{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted.html|title=Profile: Chris Anderson – TED Curator|publisher=TED.com|work=Speaker Page|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> His father was "an eye surgeon and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian", and ran a mobile hospital in rural Pakistan.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|first=Mick|last=Brown|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He has two sisters, and is the middle child.<ref name="auto"/>

He studied at [[Woodstock School]] in the Himalayan mountains of [[Mussoorie]], Uttarakhand, India briefly, before moving to [[Monkton Combe School]], a boarding school in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tributes to "extraordinary" daughter of Future founder after Bath tragedy|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Tributes-extraordinary-daughter-Future-founder-Bath-tragedy/story-11341261-detail/story.html|website=Bath Chronicle|publisher=Local World Ltd|accessdate=8 April 2016}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.woodstockschool.in/alumni/distinguished-alumni/anderson/|title=Chris Anderson '74|website=Woodstock|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>

At the [[University of Oxford]], Anderson first studied physics. He changed to the subjects of [[philosophy, politics and economics]], graduating in 1978.<ref name="TED"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodstockschool.in/page.cfm?p=656#|title=Distinguished Alumni of Woodstock School – 2008 Chris Anderson '74|publisher=Woodstock School|work=Woodstockschool.in|accessdate=12 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012150114/http://www.woodstockschool.in/page.cfm?p=656|archive-date=12 October 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
Anderson began a career in journalism, working in newspapers and radio. He produced a world news service in the [[Seychelles]].<ref name="TED" />

After returning in 1984 to the UK, Anderson was captivated by the home-computer revolution. He became an editor at two of the UK's early computer magazines, ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'' and ''[[Zzap!64]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzaphistory.html|title=The History of Zzap!64|website=www.zzap64.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.outofprintarchive.com/articles/features/out-of-print/Retro_Future.html|title=out-of-print archive • Retro Future|website=www.outofprintarchive.com|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref> A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications, but he eventually expanded it into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design. It doubled in size <!-- distribution? copies? revenues? -->every year for seven years.<ref name="TED" /> 

In 1994, Anderson moved to the United States. There he developed Imagine Media, publisher of ''[[Business 2.0]]'' magazine and creator of the popular video game users' website [[IGN]]. Anderson eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in [[London]] in 1999, under the name [[Future US]].<ref name="TED" /> At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.<ref name="auto" />

Based on this financial success, Anderson established a private nonprofit organization, the [[Sapling Foundation]]. He wanted to find new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and ideas.<ref name="auto" />

In 2012, Anderson was honored with an [[Edison Awards|Edison Achievement Award]] for his commitment to innovation throughout his career.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bird|first=Susan|date=19 April 2012|title=Bird's Eye View: The Edison Award To Chris Anderson of TED|url=https://wf360.typepad.com/bev/2012/04/the-edison-award-to-chris-anderson-of-ted.html}}</ref>

===TED===
In 2001, the foundation acquired the [[TED (conference)|TED]] Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of technology, entertainment and design, held in [[Monterey, California]]. Anderson left Future to work full-time on TED.<ref name="auto" />

He expanded the conference to cover all topics, including science, culture, academia, and business and key global issues. He added a fellows program, which now has some 400 alumni. He also established the TED Prize, which grants recipients $1&nbsp;million to support their "one wish to change the world".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-fellows-program|title=TED Fellows Program|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize|title=TED Prize|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>

In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Anderson to develop the organization as a global media initiative devoted to "ideas worth spreading". In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/the-2000th-ted-talk/|title=The TED Talks library, now 2,000 talks strong|date=2015-06-16|work=TED Blog|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref> The talks are free to view. Through a related project, they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of thousands of volunteers from around the world.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/history-of-ted|title=History of TED|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-translators|title=TED Translators|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref> Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.<ref name="TED" />

Continuing a strategy of "radical openness", in 2009 Anderson introduced the [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDx]] initiative. The TED organization provides free licences to local organizers who want to organize their own TED-like events. Requirements are that speakers must appear for free, and the events have to be non-profit, with talks released to TED through Commons Media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/fashion/Chris-Anderson-Curator-of-TED-Talks-Builds-his-Brand.html|title=No, His Name Is Not Ted|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> More than 10,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 100,000 TEDx talks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events?when=past|title=TEDx {{!}} Event Listing {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/achievement-unlocked-tedx-celebrates-100000-talks/|title=Achievement unlocked: TEDx celebrates 100,000 talks!|date=2017-10-19|work=TED Blog|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched. It offers free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>

In May 2016, Anderson published a book titled ''TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking'' which offers tips and advice for public speaking. The book became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/05/22/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/?action=click&contentCollection=Books&referrer=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/05/15/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/&region=Header&module=ArrowNav&version=Right&pgtype=Reference&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=EFB40F305197EBC6297C83022EDE3E2A&gwt=pay|title=Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous Books - Best Sellers - May 22, 2016 - The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}</ref>

In April 2018, he unveiled a major upgrade to the TED Prize, titled “The Audacious Project”. He seeks to raise significant funding for bold philanthropic projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/announcing-audacious-project-chris-anderson/|title=Announcing ...
