Known as Serdica in [[Late antiquity|Antiquity]] and Sredets in the [[Middle Ages]], Sofia has been an area of [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|human habitation]] since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the [[Roman Republic]] in 29 BC from the [[Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe|Celtic]] tribe [[Serdi]]. During the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the city was raided by [[Huns]], [[Visigoths]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]]. In 809 Serdica was incorporated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] by Khan [[Krum]] and became known as Sredets. In 1018, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] ended Bulgarian rule until 1194, when it was reincorporated by the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|reborn Bulgarian Empire]]. Sredets became a major administrative, economic, cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1382. From 1530 to 1826, Sofia was the regional capital of [[Rumelia Eyalet]], the Ottoman Empire's key province in Europe. Bulgarian rule was restored in 1878. Sofia was selected as the capital of the [[Principality of Bulgaria|Third Bulgarian State]] in the next year, ushering a period of intense demographic and economic growth.

Sofia is the [[List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits|13th largest city in the European Union]]. It is surrounded by mountainsides, such as [[Vitosha]] by the southern side, [[Lyulin Mountain|Lyulin]] by the western side, and the [[Balkan Mountains]] by the north, which makes it the [[List of capital cities by elevation|third highest European capital]] after [[Andorra la Vella]] and [[Madrid]]. Being Bulgaria's [[primate city]], Sofia is home of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies.<ref>[http://www.internethostelsofia.hostel.com/ Internet Hostel Sofia, Tourism in Sofia]. Internethostelsofia.hostel.com, Retrieved Jan 2012</ref> The city has been described as the "triangle of religious tolerance". This is due to the fact that three temples of three major world religions—[[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]—are situated within one square: [[St Nedelya Church|Sveta Nedelya Church]], [[Banya Bashi Mosque]] and [[Sofia Synagogue]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-c-d.de/index.php?title=Triangle_of_Religious_Tolerance_(1903)|title=Triangle of Religious Tolerance (1903) – iCulturalDiplomacy|website=www.i-c-d.de|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref> This triangle was recently expanded to a "square" and includes the Catholic [[Cathedral of St Joseph, Sofia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/bulgaria/articles/10-things-we-can-all-learn-from-bulgarias-square-of-religious-tolerance|title=10 Things We Can all Learn from Bulgaria's Square of Religious Tolerance}}</ref>

It seems that the first written mention of ''Serdica'' was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (Сардакіи, ''Sardaki''). Other names given to Sofia, such as ''Serdonpolis'' (Σερδών πόλις, "City of the Serdi" in [[Greek language|Greek]]) and ''Triaditza'' (Τριάδιτζα, "Trinity" in [[Greek language|Greek]]), were mentioned by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Greek language|Greek]] sources or coins. The Slavic name ''Sredets'' (Срѣдецъ), which is related to "middle" (среда, "sreda") and to the city's earliest name, first appeared on paper in an 11th-century text. The city was called ''Atralisa'' by the Arab traveller [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] and ''Strelisa'', ''Stralitsa'' or ''Stralitsion'' by the [[Crusaders]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erwin Anton Gutkind|title=International history of city development|year=1964|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|location=[[Michigan University]]|edition=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNsPAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>

The name ''Sofia'' comes from the [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milarodino.com/bg/13_centuries/city/sofia_city/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219041530/http://www.milarodino.com/bg/13_centuries/city/sofia_city/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 December 2007 |title=София |publisher=Мила Родино |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=14 September 2008 }}</ref> as opposed to the prevailing [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[List of Bulgaria province name etymologies|origin of Bulgarian cities and towns]]. The origin is in the Greek word ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'' (σοφία) "wisdom". The earliest works where this latest name is registered are the duplicate of the Gospel of Serdica, in a dialogue between two salesmen from [[Dubrovnik]] around 1359, in the 14th-century Vitosha Charter of Bulgarian tsar [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]] and in a [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchant's notes of 1376.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana|date=1999|publisher=Grolier Incorporated|location=[[Pennsylvania State University]]|isbn=0717201317|page=878|edition=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qBhZAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> In these documents the city is called ''Sofia'', but at the same time the region and the city's inhabitants are still called ''Sredecheski'' (срѣдечьскои, "of Sredets"), which continued until the 20th century. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] came to favour the name ''Sofya'' (صوفيه). In 1879 there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of ''Sofia'' for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title ''Sredets'' for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sredec-sofia.org/bg/page/38/istoriya|publisher=Capital Municipality|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==

[[Sofia City Province]] has an area of 1344&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|title=District Sofia-city |url=http://www.guide-bulgaria.com/SW/Sofia-city|work=Guide Bulgaria |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> while the surrounding and much bigger [[Sofia Province]] is 7,059&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the [[Balkans]]. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the [[Vitosha]] mountain, in the [[Sofia Valley]] that is surrounded by the [[Balkan mountains]] to the north. The valley has an average altitude of {{convert|550|m}}. Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three [[mountain pass]]es lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s.

A number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the [[Boyanska reka|Boyanska]], [[Vladaya River|Vladayska]] and [[Perlovska]]. The [[Iskar (river)|Iskar River]] in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in [[Rila]], Bulgaria's highest mountain,<ref name="Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 537">{{harvnb|Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria|1980|p=537}}</ref> and enters Sofia Valley near the village of [[German, Bulgaria|German]]. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of [[Sofia Airport]], and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of [[Novi Iskar]], where the scenic [[Iskar Gorge]] begins.<ref name="Iskar 1">{{cite web|url=http://old.bluelink.net/water/dunav/iskar/obshtihidrldanni.htm|title=General Hydrological Data|publisher=Iskar River System|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207013903/http://old.bluelink.net/water/dunav/iskar/obshtihidrldanni.htm|archive-date=7 December 2017|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>

The city is known for its 49 [[Spring (hydrosphere)|mineral]] and [[Hot spring|thermal]] springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the twentieth century.

While the 1818 and 1858 earthquakes were intense and destructive, the [[2012 Pernik earthquake]] occurred west of Sofia with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 5.6 and a much lower Mercalli intensity of VI (''Strong''). The [[2014 Aegean Sea earthquake]] was also noticed in the city.

===Climate===

The city expanded and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an [[State religion|official religion]] (under [[Galerius]]). The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of "[[religio licita]]", a worship recognised and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the [[Edict of Milan]] by two years.

For [[Constantine the Great]] it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]] instead of Constantinople.<ref>Nikolova, Kapka [https://books.google.com/books?id=yI2gAAAAMAAJ Sofia] University of Indiana.

The city was destroyed in the [[Theodosius II#Wars with the Huns, Vandals, and Persians|447 invasion]] of the [[Huns]] and laid in ruins for a century<ref name=Routledge/> It was rebuilt by [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]]. During the reign of Justinian it flourished, being surrounded with great fortress walls whose remnants can still be seen today.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Kalojan desislava.jpg|left|thumb|The 13th century lord of Sredets [[Kaloyan and Desislava|Kaloyan]] and his wife Desislava, [[Boyana Church]]]]
Serdica became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] during the reign of Khan [[Krum]] in 809, after a long [[Siege of Serdica (809)|siege]]. The fall of the strategic city prompted a major and ultimately disastrous invasion of Bulgaria by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Nikephoros I]], which led to demise at the hands of the [[Medieval Bulgarian army|Bulgarian army]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=127–128}}</ref> In the aftermath of the war, the city was permanently integrated in Bulgaria and became known by the Slavic name of Sredets. It grew into an important fortress and administrative centre under Krum's successor Khan [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], who made it a centre of Sredets province (Sredetski komitat, Средецки комитат). The Bulgarian patron saint [[John of Rila]] was buried in Sredets by orders of Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] in the mid 10th century.<ref name="stancheva120">{{harvnb|Stancheva|2010|pp=120–121}}</ref> After the conquest of the Bulgarian capital [[Preslav]] by [[Sviatoslav I|Sviatoslav I of Kyiv]] and [[John I Tzimiskes]]' armies in 970–971, the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian Patriarch]] Damyan chose Sredets for his seat in the next year and the capital of Bulgaria was temporarily moved there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slaviani|date=1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMhmAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> In the second half of 10th century the city was ruled by [[Nicholas (komes)|Komit Nikola]] and his sons, known as the "[[Cometopuli dynasty|Komitopuli]]". One of them was [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]], who was eventually crowned Emperor of Bulgaria in 997. In 986, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] laid siege to Sredets but after 20 days of fruitless assaults the garrison broke out and forced the Byzantines to abandon the campaign. On his way to Constantinople, Basil II was ambushed and soundly defeated by the Bulgarians in the [[battle of the Gates of Trajan]].<ref name="stancheva120"/><ref>{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=319}}</ref>

The city eventually fell to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1018, following the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria]]. Sredets joined the [[uprising of Peter Delyan]] in 1040–1041 in a failed attempt to restore Bulgarian independence and was the last stronghold of the rebels, led by the local commander Botko.<ref>{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=400–401}}</ref> It was once again incorporated into the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]] in 1194 at the time of Emperor [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen I]] and became a major administrative and cultural centre.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancheva|2010|pp=123–124}}</ref> Several of the city's governors were members of the Bulgarian imperial family and held the title of ''[[sebastokrator]]'', the second highest at the time, after the [[tsar]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries Sredets was an important spiritual and literary hub with a cluster of 14 monasteries in its vicinity, that were eventually destroyed by the Ottomans. The city produced multicolored sgraffito ceramics, jewelry and ironware.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancheva|2010|pp=131, 139}}</ref> In 1385, Sredets was seized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the course of the [[Bulgarian–Ottoman Wars|Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars]] by [[Lala Şahin Pasha]], following a [[Siege of Sofia|three-month siege]].<ref name=":0">Ivanova, Svetlana, "Ṣofya", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

=== Early modern history ===
In the late 14th century the city became the seat of newly established Ottoman [[Sanjak of Sofia]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Godisnjak | publisher=Drustvo Istoricara Bosne i Hercegovine, Sarajevo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4wxAQAAIAAJ| year=1950 | page=174 | quote=Санџак Софија Овај је санџак основан око г. 1393.}}</ref> During the initial stages of the [[Crusade of Varna]] in 1443, it was occupied by Hungarian forces for a short time in 1443, and the Bulgarian population celerated a mass [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]. Following the defeat of the crusader forces in 1444, the city's Christians faced persecution. In 1530 Sofia became the capital of the [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] (beylerbeylik) of [[Rumelia]] for about three centuries. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export-base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. In the 15th and 16th century, Sofia was expanded by Ottoman building activity. Public investments in infrastructure, education and local economy brought greater diversity to the city. Amongst others, the population consisted of [[Muslim]]s, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Ragusans, Jews ([[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]], [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]]), and [[Romani people]].<ref name=":0" /> The 16th century was marked by a wave of persecutions against the Bulgarian Christians, a total of nine became [[New Martyrs]] in Sofia and were sainted by the Orthodox Church, including [[George of Kratovo|George the New]] (1515), Sophronius of Sofia (1515), George the Newest (1530), [[St. Nicholas of Sofia|Nicholas of Sofia]] (1555) and Terapontius of Sofia (1555).<ref>{{harvnb|Stancheva|2010|pp=165, 167–169}}</ref>

[[File:Sofia-oberbauer.png|thumb|alt=Sofia with the clock tower|Sofia in mid-19th-century]]

When it comes to the cityscape, 16th century sources mention eight [[Jama Masjid|Friday mosques]], three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest [[bedesten]] (market) of the Balkans.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, there were fountains and ''[[Turkish bath|hammams]]'' (bathhouses). Most prominent churches such as Saint Sofia and Saint George were converted into mosques, and a number of new ones were constructed, including [[Banya Bashi Mosque]] built by the renowned Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. In total there were 11 big and over 100 small mosques by the 17th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancheva|2010|pp=154–155}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sofia – Trip around Sofia|url=http://old.omda.bg/biblioteka/obikolka_sofia_1968/obikolka_sofia_balkantourist_1968_3.htm|publisher=Balkan tourist, 1968|access-date=8 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305050426/http://old.omda.bg/biblioteka/obikolka_sofia_1968/obikolka_sofia_balkantourist_1968_3.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1610 the [[Catholic Church|Vatican]] established the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv|See of Sofia]] for Catholics of [[Rumelia]], which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated.<ref>{{Catholic|title=Sardica|url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sardica}}</ref>

Sofia entered a period of economic and political decline in the 17th century, accelerated during the period of anarchy in the Ottoman Balkans of the late 18th and early 19th century, when local Ottoman warlords ravaged the countryside. Since the 18th century the ''[[beylerbey]]s'' of Rumelia often stayed in [[Bitola]], which became the official capital of the province in 1826. Sofia remained the seat of a [[sanjak]] (district). By the 19th century the Bulgarian population had two schools and seven churches, contributing to the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. In 1858 [[Nedelya Petkova]] created the first Bulgarian school for women in the city. In 1867 was inaugurated the first ''[[chitalishte]]'' in Sofia – a Bulgarian cultural institution. In 1870 the Bulgarian revolutionary [[Vasil Levski]] established a [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|revolutionary committee]] in the city and in the neighbouring villages. Folling his capture in 1873, Vasil Levski was transferred and hanged in Sofia by the Ottomans.

===Modern and contemporary history===
During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]], [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Suleiman Pasha]] threatened to burn the city in defence, but the foreign diplomats Leandre Legay, [[Vito Positano]], Rabbi Gabriel Almosnino and Josef Valdhart refused to leave the city thus saving it. Many Bulgarian residents of Sofia armed themselves and sided with the Russian forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/genov/09.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Военная история ]-- Генов Ц.

[[Iosif Gurko]] on 4 January 1878. It was proposed as a capital by [[Marin Drinov]] and was accepted as such on 3 April 1879. By the time of its liberation the population of the city was 11,649.<ref>Kiradzhiev, Svetlin (2006). "Sofia. 125 years a capital. 1879–2004". "Guttenberg". {{ISBN|978-954-617-011-8}}</ref>

For a few decades after the liberation, Sofia experienced large population growth, mainly by migration from other regions of the Principality (Kingdom since 1908) of Bulgaria, and from the still Ottoman [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]].

In 1900, the first electric lightbulb in the city was turned on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://novinar.bg/news/prez-1900-g-svetva-parvata-elektricheska-lampa-po-sofijskite-ulitci_MzUwMjszOA==.html |title=E-novinar.com – Новините на едно място |language=Bulgarian |trans-title=Mohailova, Tihomria.

In the [[Second Balkan War]], Bulgaria was fighting alone practically all of its neighbouring countries. When the [[Romanian Army]] entered [[Vrazhdebna]] in 1913, then a village {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Sofia, now a suburb,<ref name="Hall97">Hall (2000), p. 97.</ref> this prompted the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] to capitulate.

In 1925, a terrorist act of ultra-leftists failed their attempted assassination of the king but resulted in the destruction of the [[Saint Nedelya Church]] and many victims.

During the [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Second World War]], Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia]]. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.

In 1945, the communist [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] took power. The transformations of Bulgaria into the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.

During the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.<ref>L. Ivanov. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319820028_1991_Sofia_street_naming_proposal 1991 Sofia street naming proposal.] Sofia City Place-names Commission, 22 January 1991.</ref>

The [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]], where [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov's]] body had been preserved in a similar way to the [[Lenin mausoleum]], was demolished in 1999.

[[File:Cathedral Saint Alexander Nevsky (23997168458).jpg|thumb|A view over central Sofia, with the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]] in the foreground and [[Vitosha]] in the distance]]

In Sofia there are 607,473 dwellings and 101,696 buildings. According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000 and 20,000 in each following decade.<ref name=book/> Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgarian fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century [[Church of St. George, Sofia|Rotunda of St. George]], the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved [[Amphitheatre of Serdica]].

After the Liberation War, knyaz [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander Battenberg]] invited architects from [[Austria–Hungary]] to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.<ref name="Fig. Arts">{{cite book |last=Collective |title=Encyclopedia of Figurative Arts in Bulgaria, volume 1 |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1980 |location=Sofia |pages=209–210}}</ref>

Among the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were [[Friedrich Grünanger]], Adolf Václav Kolář, and [[Viktor Rumpelmayer]], who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite.<ref name="Fig. Arts"/> Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], Neo-[[Rococo]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]], with the [[Vienna Secession]] also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.

After World War II and the establishment of a [[Communist state|Communist government]] in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic]] public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]], Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete [[tower block]]s, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of [[Brutalist architecture]].

After the abolition of [[Communism]] in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The {{convert|126|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Capital Fort]] Business Centre is the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with its 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.

===Green areas===
[[File:Borisova gradina autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borisova gradina]]]]
The city has an extensive [[green belt]]. Some of the neighbourhoods constructed after 2000 are densely built up and lack green spaces. There are four principal parks – [[Borisova gradina]] in the city centre and the ''Southern'', ''Western'' and ''Northern'' parks. Several smaller parks, among which the [[Vazrazhdane Park]], [[Zaimov Park]], [[City Garden (Sofia)|City Garden]] and the [[Doctors' Garden]], are located in central Sofia. The [[Vitosha]] Nature Park (the oldest [[national park]] in the [[Balkans]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journey.bg/bulgaria/bulgaria.php?&gtype=21 |title=National parks in the world |publisher=journey.bg |accessdate=24 May 2008 |language=bg}}</ref> includes most of [[Vitosha]] mountain and covers an area of {{convert|266|km²|0|abbr=out}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vitoshamount.hit.bg/ |title=Vitosha Mountain |publisher=vitoshamount.hit.bg |accessdate=29 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040620025050/http://www.vitoshamount.hit.bg/ |archivedate=20 June 2004 }}</ref> with roughly half of it lying within the municipality of Sofia. Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter. During the 1970s and the 1980s multiple ski slopes of varying difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski areas have been left to decay in the last 10 years, so that only one chairlift and one slope work.

Private automobile ownership has grown rapidly in the 1990s; more than 1,000,000 cars were registered in Sofia after 2002. The city has the 4th-highest number of automobiles per capita in the European Union at 546.4 vehicles per 1,000 people.<ref>Sofia in Figures, p.26</ref> The municipality was known for minor and cosmetic repairs and many streets are in a poor condition. This is noticeably changing in the past years. There are different boulevards and streets in the city with a higher amount of traffic than others. These include Tsarigradsko shose, Cherni Vrah, Bulgaria, Slivnitsa and Todor Aleksandrov boulevards, as well as the city's ring road, where long chains of cars are formed at peak hours and [[traffic jam]]s occur regularly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/show/?storyid=372682|title=Fines for bad repair work – 'Dnevnik' newspaper|publisher=dnevnik.bg|accessdate=24 May 2008}}</ref> Consequently, traffic and air pollution problems have become more severe and receive regular criticism in local media. The extension of the underground system is hoped to alleviate the city's immense traffic problems.

Sofia has an extensive [[Toplofikatsiya Sofia|district heating system]] based around four [[cogeneration|combined heat and power]] (CHP) plants and [[heat-only boiler station|boiler stations]]. Virtually the entire city (900,000 households and 5,900 companies) is centrally heated, using residual heat from [[electricity generation]] (3,000 MW) and gas- and oil-fired heating furnaces; total [[Thermal mass|heat capacity]] is 4,640 MW.
