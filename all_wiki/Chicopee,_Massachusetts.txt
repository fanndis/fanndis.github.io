The name reflects the city's location among a number of metropolitan areas and its transportation network. Four interstate highways run through its boundaries, including [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]], [[Interstate 91|I-91]], [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], and [[I-391]], as well as state routes such as [[Massachusetts Route 33|Route 33]], [[Massachusetts Route 116|116]], and [[Massachusetts Route 141|141]].

==Name==
The city is named after the [[Chicopee River]], a tributary that flows into the [[Connecticut River]] at the confluence on in its boundaries. "Chicopee" is derived from the [[Loup A|Nipmuc]] language, probably from the words ''chekee'' ("violent") and ''pe'' ("waters") in most [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] dialects, with reference to [[rapids]]. The [[Nipmuck|Nipmuc]] were the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous]] people who occupied this area before the arrival of European colonists.

Alternatively, ''chikkuppee'' ("of cedar") may be the adjective form of ''chickkup'' ("cedar").<ref>An Historical Address / Delivered before the citizens of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] in Massachusetts at the public celebration May 26, 1911, of the Two Hundred and Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Settlement with Five Appendices, by Charles H.

In 1636, [[William Pynchon]] purchased land from the Agawam Indians on the east side of the Connecticut River. He moved from the Town of Roxbury to Springfield to found the first settlement in the area that comprises the territory of today's Chicopee Center (Cabotville). Both Cabotville and the Falls were developed as manufacturing centers (villages).<ref>''Chicopee Illustrated 1896,'' Transcript Publishing Company, Holyoke, MA</ref>

According to local historian Charles J. Seaver, the area above the falls was first settled in 1660. The land purchased from the Indians was divided into districts. Nayasett (Nipmuc for "at the small point/angle") was the name given to the area of what are now Chicopee Center and Chicopee Falls. The settlement in the upper district was at Skipmuck (possibly based on Nipmuc ''Skipmaug,'' meaning "chief fishing place" or ''Shipmuck,'' meaning "big watery place"), a place above the falls on the south side of the river.

Colonists built a sawmill as the first industrial site along the river. The mill was built at ''Skenungonuck'' (Nipmuc for "green fields") Falls (now Chicopee Falls) in 1678 by Japhet Chapin, John Hitchcock and Nathaniel Foote.

In 1786, what was called Factory Village began to develop when two acres of land was leased to 10 local men, with the understanding that they would build an iron foundry within two years. This was accomplished and the business flourished.
[[File:Tony Soccha, a young bobbin boy, been working there a year. Chicopee, Mass. - NARA - 523488.jpg|thumb|right|Child laborer in Chicopee, 1911.<br />Photo by [[Lewis Hine]].]]
In 1823, Jonathan Dwight purchased the water privilege at Skenungonuck Falls in Chicopee. He built a textile mill and five years later, it operated 14,000 spindles and nearly 500 looms, making it the second-largest operation in the state. It processed cotton from the Deep South, becoming part of the extended slave economy and King Cotton. By 1831, settlers had developed two giant dams, two waterpower canals, and two manufacturing communities on the Chicopee River.

In 1848, Chicopee, which for more than two centuries had been a part of the Town of Springfield, was separated and organized as a distinct town. Political factions in Springfield wanted that jurisdiction to remain a town, rather than become a city and take on a mayoral form of government. By partitioning Chicopee, those political factions prevented Springfield from becoming a city until 1852. The result was that Springfield lost 2/5 of its land area and nearly half of its population when Chicopee was created.

Before and after the partition, eight Chicopee River companies gained product recognition around the globe: Ames, Belcher, Lamb, Dwight, Stevens, Spalding, Fisk, and Duryea. Below the falls, in the bend of the river at a place called Factory Village, an important chapter of the region's industrial history was played out.

===Various industries===
Chicopee adopted the motto ''"Industriae Variae",'' which means "Various Industries". Chicopee's industries included cotton mills, woolen mills, textiles, [[brass foundry|brass]] and [[iron foundry|iron]] foundries, paper making, footwear factories, for leather boots and shoes, the first friction matches, and ship building. In nearby South Hadley Canal, the firearms company [[Crescent-Davis]] specialized in producing double-barrel [[shotgun]]s.

The [[Ames Manufacturing Company]] made many machines and [[bronze]] cannons, and more [[sword]]s than any other American manufacturer at the time. Ames cast a number of bronze statues, including Thomas Ball's monumental equestrian statue of President [[George Washington]], installed in Boston's Public Garden. Ames was a major provider of cannon to the Union army during the Civil War.<ref name="NorthAndSouth">{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Jacqueline T.|title=The Ames Manufacturing Company – Civil War and the New England Mill Town|url=http://newenglandtravels.blogspot.com/2009/03/ames-manufacturing-company-civil-war.html|website=New England Travels|publisher=Originally published in North and South Magazine June 2006|accessdate=6 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823042906/http://newenglandtravels.blogspot.com/2009/03/ames-manufacturing-company-civil-war.html|archivedate=23 August 2011|date=3 March 2009}}</ref> The [[Stevens Arms]] plant (later [[Savage Arms|Savage]]) was responsible for most of the [[Enfield rifle#Rifle No 4 Mk I|No. 4 Enfields]] manufactured for the British under [[Lend-Lease]].

Albert H. Overman moved his bicycle production from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to Chicopee Falls in 1883.<ref name="Jendrysik"/> The Overman company benefited from the surging popularity of the [[safety bicycle]] during the [[bicycle boom]] of the 1890s. At its height in 1894, Overman's factory employed over 1,200 workers. The boom eventually went bust, as overproduction drove the price of bicycles down. By 1901 the Overman firm was out of business.<ref name="Jendrysik"/>

===Library===
Chicopee was the first city west of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to form a publicly funded public library. The [[Chicopee Public Library]] was formed by a donation to the city by the Cabotville Institute.
[[Image:ChicopeeLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|Main Branch of the Chicopee Public Library]]

==Neighborhoods==
===Willimansett===
In 1641, Willian Pynchon expanded his 1636 holdings by buying the land from the Chicopee River north to the Willimansett (Nipmuc for "good berries place" or "place of red earth") Brook. Land sales in Chicopee were recorded in 1659, but apparently no homes were built immediately.

Winthrop McKinstry writes that the sons of Deacon Samuel Chapin appear to be the first home builders. Henry Chapin is believed to have constructed his at Exchange and West streets (lower Chicopee) in 1664, and Japhet Chapin north of what is now known as James Ferry Road (upper Chicopee) in 1673. It is apparent from McKinstry's book that the Chapin family dominated the area north of the Chicopee River for the settlement's first 70 years. Chicopee Street was part of the First Parish in Springfield.

By the 1750s, Quabbin Road (now McKinstry Avenue) allowed the farmers to access the meadows and fields on the plains at the top of the hill. The Chapins used the land in common for grazing livestock and built ice houses near several large ponds. The ponds were drained by several brooks which flowed into the Connecticut River.

At the end of the 19th century, the city voted to build the Willimansett Bridge, connecting Willimansett with Holyoke. The results were profound. Willimansett and Aldenville would develop close ties to Holyoke; even postal and telephone service were (and still are) tied to the "Paper City." The legislative act ordering the building of the bridge was passed in 1892. L.L. Johnson reports that the completion of the bridge was grandly celebrated.

By the 20th century, Willimansett village had developed into quintessential Americana with a high percentage of French Canadian inhabitants. In total, Chicopee became four distinct commercial and political sub-divisions, each with its own ethnic makeup representing its own special interests and, much too frequently, in conflict with each other.

Located between Fairview and Willimansett, the Smith Highlands section once had its own school (first and second grades), [[Holyoke Street Railway Company|Holyoke Street Railway]] bus service from Ingham Street across Irene, Factory, and Prospect streets, and two locally owned markets. The former Robert's Pond swimming area was a popular summer attraction, and the fields where the current Bellamy Junior High School is located were a popular sledding and skiing location winters.

===Fairview===
Fairview is the northernmost neighborhood (village) in Chicopee and originally included the lands that are now part of Westover ARB. Primarily agricultural, Fairview was known for its tobacco farms. After 1939, Westover helped to rapidly develop the village into a residential and commercial district. Memorial Drive (Route 33) flows north–south connecting Chicopee Falls with South Hadley.

===Aldenville===
On August 18, 1870, Edward Monroe Alden purchased 600 acres of land just east of Willimansett for the sum of $9,000 with the intent to create a "little city on the hill," which would become Aldenville. In 1890, he began laying out streets which he named for family members and divided the land up into 60-by-170 feet lots. French-Canadian factory workers from Chicopee Falls, Cabotville (Chicopee Center), and Holyoke began to build up the community. Sold for a selling price of $150 with $10 down, the first house was bought and built by French-Canadian builder and carpenter Marcellin Croteau.<ref>[http://www.masslive.com/holyokeplus/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-6/1302507943103390.xml&coll=1 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924105715/http://www.masslive.com/holyokeplus/republican/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-6%2F1302507943103390.xml&coll=1 |date=2012-09-24 }}</ref>

===Partition from Springfield and modern history===
[[Image:ChicopeeTownMA-seal.png|thumb|150px|left|Seal of the former Town of Chicopee, prior to its incorporation as a city in 1890]]
[[Image:Basilica of St. Stanislaus, Chicopee MA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr]]]]
The villages of Cabotville, Chicopee Falls, Willimansett, and Fairview (and the lands that would become Aldenville) remained a part of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], from 1636 until 1848, when they were partitioned to form the Town of Chicopee. Political factions in Springfield had wished to keep Springfield a "town," instead of becoming a "city," which would give it a mayoral form of government. To keep Springfield sufficiently unpopulated to subvert a state regulation that would have required it to become a city, they partitioned Chicopee, which contained approximately 2/5 of Springfield's land area, and nearly half of its population.

Regardless of the partition, Springfield became a city only four years after the partition of Chicopee. Both cities continued to flourish for over a century after the partition.

On April 18, 1890, the community was granted a charter as a city by the [[Massachusetts General Court]]. [[George Sylvester Taylor]] (1822–1910) became Chicopee's first mayor on January 5, 1891.

Westover Field was created by a war-readiness appropriation signed by president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939. The site used to be tobacco crop fields east of and part of Fairview, east of Aldenview, and northern Willimansett. It was assigned to the United States Army Air Corps Northeast Air District. It was renamed Westover Air Force Base in 1948 after that Air Force's creation as a separate service. In 1974 SAC leadership turned the base over to the Air Force Reserve.

In 1991, [[Basilica of St. Stanislaus, Chicopee|St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Church]], located on Front Street, was proclaimed a [[minor basilica]] by [[Pope John Paul II]].

==Geography==
Chicopee is located at {{coord|42|10|13|N|72|35|19|W|type:city}} (42.170159, -72.588630).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

The city is made up of several neighborhoods; the result of the city's origin as a collection of four villages in the northernmost part of Springfield, which seceded from it in 1848. Chicopee Falls, Chicopee Center (Cabotville), Fairview, and Willimansett continued to develop. In the early 1900s, Aldenville developed as a distinct community. Since then, the city has filled in most of its open space resulting in a number of new neighborhoods. These neighborhoods include Chicomansett, Ferry Lane, Sandy Hill and the geographically isolated Burnett Road neighborhood.

The city is bordered by [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]] to the northwest, [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]] to the southwest, [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] to the south, [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]] to the east, [[Granby, Massachusetts|Granby]] to the northeast and [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]] to the north. Chicopee is located {{convert|29|mi|km}} away from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], {{convert|89|mi|km}} away from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], {{convert|90|mi|km}} from [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and {{convert|140|mi|km}} from New York City.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|1.0|sqmi|km2}} (4.31%) is water. The [[Chicopee River]] flows through the south part of the city, emptying into the [[Connecticut River]]. Many ponds, lakes, and streams are part of the Chicopee River or Connecticut River watersheds.

Willimansett, and portions of the Center and Falls are on low land, with Aldenville, Fairview, Westover, and the Burnett Road neighborhoods on an elevated plateau. At 288 feet, the highest elevation in the city is on Old Lyman Road, in the Fairview section.
