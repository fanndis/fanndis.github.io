'''Bard College''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]]. The campus overlooks the [[Hudson River]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], and is within the [[Hudson River Historic District]], a [[National Historic Landmark]].

Founded in 1860, the institution consists of a liberal arts college and a [[Bard College Conservatory of Music|conservatory]], as well as eight graduate programs offering over 20 graduate degrees in the arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bard.edu/about/ataglance/ |title=At a Glance |publisher=Bard College |access-date=August 9, 2014|website = Bard College}}</ref> The undergraduate [[student-teacher ratio|student-to-faculty ratio]] is 10:1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeBasics.aspx?iid=1024046|title=Bard College |publisher=The Princeton Review |access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> The college has a network of over 35 affiliated programs, institutes, and centers, spanning twelve [[city|cities]], five [[U.S. states|states]], seven [[country|countries]], and four [[continent]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/institutes/ |title=Institutes |publisher=Bard College |access-date=July 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629125438/http://www.bard.edu/institutes/ |archive-date=June 29, 2012 }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Origins and early years ===

[[File:1867 Map of Red Hook.png|thumb|left|A map circa 1867 showing the various estates in the Town of [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]]]]
During much of the nineteenth century, the land now owned by Bard was mainly composed of several [[estate (land)|country estates]]. These estates were called [[Blithewood]], Bartlett, Sands, Cruger's Island, and Ward Manor/Almont.

In 1853, [[John Bard]] and Margaret Bard purchased a part of the Blithewood estate and renamed it Annandale. John Bard was the grandson of [[Samuel Bard (physician)|Samuel Bard]], a prominent doctor, a founder of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|medical school]],  and [[physician]] to [[George Washington]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hirsch |first=Felix |date=October 1941 |title=The Bard Family |journal=Columbia University Quarterly |location=Bard College Archives, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY }}</ref> John Bard was also the nephew of the Rev. John McVickar, a professor at [[Columbia University]]. The family had strong connections with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and Columbia.
[[Image:John Bard, 1893 crop.jpg|thumb|[[John Bard]], founder of St. Stephen's College]]

The following year, in 1854, John and Margaret established a [[parochial school|parish school]] on their estate in order to educate the area's children. A wood-frame [[cottage]], known today as Bard Hall, served as a school on weekdays and a [[chapel]] on weekends. In 1857, the Bards expanded the [[parish]] by building the Chapel of the Holy Innocents next to Bard Hall.<ref>{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=15 |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/links.htm
}}</ref>  During this time, John Bard remained in close contact with the New York leaders of the Episcopal Church. The Church suggested that he found a [[seminary|theological college]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Reminiscences of St. Stephen’s College |last=Hopson |first=George |year=1910 |publisher=Edwin S. Gorham |location=New York, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesofs00hops/page/16 16]–17 |url=https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesofs00hops}}</ref>

With the promise of outside financial support, John Bard donated the unfinished Chapel, and the surrounding {{convert|18|acre}}, to the diocese in November 1858. In March 1860, St. Stephen's College was founded. In 1861, construction began on the first St. Stephen's College building, a stone [[collegiate gothic]] [[dormitory]] called Aspinwall. During its initial years, the college relied on wealthy benefactors, like [[trustee]] [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], for funding.<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of St. Stephen’s College 1860-1933  |last=Magee |first=Christopher |year=1950 |publisher=Bard College Senior Project |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=38}}</ref>

The college began taking shape within four decades. In 1866, Ludlow Hall, an administrative building, was erected. Preston Hall was built in 1873 and used as a refectory. A set of four dormitories, collectively known as Stone Row, were completed in 1891. And in 1895, the [[greek revival architecture|Greek revival]] Hoffman Memorial Library was built.<ref>{{Cite report |author=John Milner Associates Inc. |date=December 2008 |title=Bard College Master Preservation Plan |page=27 }}</ref> The school officially changed its name to Bard College in 1934 in honor of its founder.

=== Growth and secularization ===

[[File:Ward Manor Bard College.jpg|thumb|left |Ward Manor House now serves as a dormitory]]
In the 20th century, social and cultural changes amongst New York's [[high society (group)|high society]] would bring about the demise of the great estates. In 1914, Louis Hamersley purchased the fire-damaged Ward Manor/Almont estate and erected a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]] mansion and gatehouse, or what is today known as Ward Manor.<ref name="Kline 1982">{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/links.htm}}</ref> Hamersley expanded his estate in 1926 by acquiring the abandoned Cruger's Island estate. That same year, after Hamersley's combined estate was purchased by William Ward, it was donated to charity and served as a retirement home for almost four decades.

By the mid-1900s, Bard's campus significantly expanded. The Blithewood estate was donated to the college in 1951, and in 1963, Bard purchased {{convert|90|acre}} of the Ward Manor estate, including the main manor house. The rest of the Ward Manor estate is now the {{convert|900|acre|adj=on}} Tivoli Bays [[nature preserve]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/links.htm |title=Bard College Archives |publisher=Bard College |access-date=July 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601141058/http://www.bard.edu/archives/links.htm |archive-date=June 1, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite report |author=John Milner Associates Inc. |date=December 2008 |title=Bard College Master Preservation Plan |page=34 }}</ref>

In 1919, Fr. [[Bernard Iddings Bell]] became Bard's youngest president at the age of 34. His adherence to classical education, decorum, and dress eventually clashed with the school's push towards [[Deweyism]] and secularization, and he resigned in 1933.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Confessions of a Bohemian Tory|last=Kirk|first=Russell|publisher=Fleet Publishing Corporation|year=1963|pages=162}}</ref>

In 1928, Bard merged with [[Columbia University]], serving as an undergraduate school similar to [[Barnard College]]. Under the agreement, Bard remained affiliated with the Episcopal Church and retained control of its finances. The merger raised Bard's prestige; however, it failed to provide financial support to the college during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/about/history/ |title=About Bard &#124; History of Bard |publisher=Bard.edu |date=May 21, 2011 |access-date=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614212715/http://www.bard.edu/about/history/ |archive-date=June 14, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> So dire was Bard's financial situation that in 1932, then-Governor of New York and College trustee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a telegram to the likes of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[George Eastman]] and [[Frederick William Vanderbilt]] requesting donations for the college.<ref>{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=99 |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/voices/Kline-Education/Chap6.pdf
}}</ref>

On May 26, 1933, Dr. Donald Tewksbury, a Columbia professor, was appointed dean of the College. Although dean for only four years, Tewksbury had a lasting impact on the school. Tewksbury, an educational philosopher, had extensive ideas regarding higher education. While he was dean, Tewksbury steered the college into a more secular direction, and changed its name from St. Stephen’s to Bard. He also placed a heavy academic emphasis on the arts, something atypical of colleges at the time, and set the foundations for Bard's Moderation and Senior Project requirement.<ref name="history"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=104 |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/voices/Kline-Education/Chap6.pdf}}</ref> While Tewksbury never characterized Bard's curriculum as "[[progressive education|progressive]]," the school would later be considered an early adopter of progressive education. In his 1943 study of early progressive colleges, titled ''General Education in the Progressive College'', [[Louis T. Benezet]] used Bard as one of his three [[case study|case studies]].<ref name="history"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=106 |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/voices/Kline-Education/Chap6.pdf}}</ref>

During the 1940s, Bard provided a haven for intellectual refugees fleeing Europe. These included [[Hannah Arendt]], the political theorist, [[Stefan Hirsch]], the [[Precisionism|precisionist]] painter; [[Felix Hirsch]], the political editor of the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''; the violinist Emil Hauser; the linguist [[Hans Marchand]]; the noted psychologist Werner Wolff; and the philosopher [[Heinrich Blücher]].<ref name="history"/>
Arendt is buried at Bard, as is eminent novelist [[Philip Roth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hac.bard.edu/news/post/?item=19726|title=Hannah Arendt Center News|website=hac.bard.edu|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> 

In 1944, as a result of [[World War II]], enrollment significantly dropped putting financial stress on the college. In order to increase enrollment, the college became co-educational, thereby severing all ties with Columbia. The college became an independent, secular, institution in 1944. Thus enrollment more than doubled, from 137 students in 1944, to 293 in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |title=Education for the Common Good: A History of Bard College The First 100 Years, 1860-1960 |last=Kline |first=Reamer |year=1982 |publisher=Bard College |location=Annandale-on-Hudson, NY |page=120 |url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/voices/Kline-Education/Chap7.pdf
}}</ref>  In the 1950s, with the addition of the Blithewood estate and Tewksbury Hall, the college would increase its enrollment by 150 students.

=== Late twentieth and early twenty-first century ===

The experiences of [[Donald Fagen]] and [[Walter Becker]] while at Bard caused them to write the 1973 song "[[My Old School]]" for their rock group, [[Steely Dan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The origins of Steely Dan |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174152_5,00.html |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |last=Brunner |first=Rob |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref>  Fagen wrote another Steely Dan song, "[[Rikki Don't Lose That Number]]", about novelist, artist and former Bard faculty spouse [[Rikki Ducornet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/70442-the-burden-of-strangeness-rikki-ducornet.html|title=The Burden of Strangeness: Rikki Ducornet|publisher=PWxyz, LLC |last=McCormack|first=J.W.|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, Bard College, along with [[Central European University]], became the founding members of the Open Society University Network, a collaborative global education initiative endowed with $1 billion USD. As part of this new initiative, the college received a $100 million USD gift from the [[Open Society Foundations]] which ranks among the largest financial contributions to a U.S. institution in recent history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/07/02/open-society-foundations-gives-bard-100-million|title=Open Society Foundations Gives Bard $100 Million &#124; Inside Higher Ed|website=www.insidehighered.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Major-Private-Gifts-to-Higher/128264}}</ref>

The campus of Bard College is in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York|Annandale-on-Hudson]], a hamlet in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], in the town of [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]]. It contains more than 70 buildings with a total gross building space of 1,167,090 square feet and was listed as a census-designated place in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rs.acupcc.org/ghg/2544/ |title=GHG Report for Bard College |publisher=American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment |access-date=April 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127042323/http://rs.acupcc.org/ghg/2544/ |archive-date=January 27, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/Files/bas20/tigerweb_bas20_cdp_ny.html |title=State of New York Census Designated Places - Current/BAS20 - Data as of January 1, 2019 |date=January 1, 2019 |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> Campus buildings represent varied [[architectural style]]s, but the campus remains heavily influenced by the [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] and [[postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] styles.

Bard's historic buildings are associated with the early development of the college and the history of the Hudson River estates ([[#History|see Bard College History]]).<ref name="Kline 1982"/> During a late twentieth-century building boom, the college embraced a trend of building signature buildings designed by prominent architects like [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]], [[Frank Gehry|Gehry]], and [[Rafael Viñoly|Viñoly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bard.edu/campus/facilities/ |title=Facilities |publisher=Bard College |access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2016, Bard purchased [[Montgomery Place]], a 380-acre estate adjacent to the Bard campus, with significant historic and cultural assets. The estate consists of a historic mansion, a farm, and some 20 smaller buildings. The College purchased the property from Historic Hudson Valley, the historical preservation organization that had owned Montgomery Place since the late 1980s. The addition of this property brings Bard's total campus size to nearly 1,000 acres along the Hudson River in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bard College completes $18M purchase of Montgomery Place|first=William J.|last=Kemble|date=January 13, 2016|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/article/DF/20160113/NEWS/160119874|website=dailyfreeman.com|publisher=Daily Freeman|access-date=February 29, 2016}}</ref>

== Academics ==
Bard is a college of the liberal arts and sciences. In the undergraduate college, Bard offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees. There are 23 academic departments that offer over 40 [[academic major|major programs]], as well as 12 interdisciplinary [[minor (academic)|concentrations]]. The college was the first in the nation to offer a [[human rights]] major.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bard.edu/catalogue/index.php?aid=10935&sid=669164|title=Bard College Catalogue |publisher=Bard College |access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> In the 2011–2012 academic year, the college held 1,345 classes.

In the three weeks preceding their first semester, first-year students attend the Language and Thinking (L&T) program, an intensive, writing-centered introduction to the liberal arts. The interdisciplinary program, established in 1981, aims to "cultivate habits of thoughtful reading and discussion, clear articulation, accurate self-critique, and productive collaboration."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://languageandthinking.bard.edu/about/|title=Language and Thinking |publisher=Bard College |access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> The program covers [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[science]], [[poetry]], [[fiction]], and [[religion]]. In 2011, the core readings included works by [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Frans de Waal]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[M. NourbeSe Philip]], and [[Sophocles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languageandthinking.bard.edu/2011-anthology|title=Language and Thinking Anthology|publisher=Bard College|access-date=July 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123030235/http://languageandthinking.bard.edu/2011-anthology/|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

The capstone of the Bard undergraduate experience is the Senior Project, commonly referred to as SPROJ amongst its students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bard.edu/academics/curriculum/|title=Undergraduate Curriculum at Bard College|first=Bard|last=College|website=www.bard.edu}}</ref> As with moderation, this project takes different forms in different departments. Many students write a paper of around eighty pages, which is then, as with work for moderation, critiqued by a board of three professors. Arts students must organize a series of concerts, recitals, or shows, or produce substantial creative work; math and science students, as well as some social science students, undertake research projects.

The [[Hannah Arendt]] Center for Politics and Humanities is located at Bard College. The Center hosts an annual public conference, offers courses, runs various related academic programs, and houses research fellows,<ref>[http://hac.bard.edu Hannah Arendt Center], January 5, 2018</ref> and is directed by Dr. Roger Berkowitz, a legal scholar and an associate professor of politics, philosophy, and human rights.<ref>[http://hac.bard.edu/about Hannah Arendt Center: About], January 5, 2018</ref>

In February 2009, Bard announced the first dual degree program between a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] university and an American institution of higher education. The college entered into a collaboration with [[Al-Quds University]] involving an honors college, a master's program in teaching and a model high school.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/world/middleeast/15quds.html Palestinian Campus Looks to East Bank (of Hudson)], ''New York Times'', February 14, 2009</ref>

In accordance with AlQuds-Bard requirements, students are not allowed to decide their major during the first year of their studies; instead, as a liberal arts college, students are advised to diverge in different classes that would allow them to decide what program they would like to take interest in as in the following year. Students are encouraged to look upon different classes to help them decide the subject they would mostly enjoy studying. Bard gives students the opportunity to dissect different programs before committing to a specific major. As a policy, throughout a student's undergraduate years, they must distribute their credits among different courses so that they can liberally experience the different courses Bard has to offer.<ref>[http://www.bard.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/requirements/ AlQuds Bard Requirements], March 29, 2017</ref>

Bard has a strong independent music scene considering its isolation and size. The college's Old Gym was once a popular location for concerts and parties in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. In 2004, the Old Gym was shut down and in spring 2006 transformed into a student-run theater by students Brel Froebe, Julie Rossman, and Kell Condon. Many activities that once took place there now occur in the smaller SMOG building. SMOG is now primarily used as a music venue featuring student-run bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://student.bard.edu/clubs/smog/ |title=SMOG |publisher=Student.bard.edu |access-date=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211055429/http://student.bard.edu/clubs/smog/ |archive-date=December 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Student-run theater is also popular: dozens of student directed and written productions are put on each semester and a 24 Hour Theater Festival is held at least once a year.
