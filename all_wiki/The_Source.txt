'''''The Source''''' is an American [[hip hop]] and entertainment website, and a magazine that publishes annually or {{wt|en|Semiannual|semiannually}}. It is the world's longest-running rap periodical, being founded as a [[newsletter]] in 1988.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|author=Ogunnaike, Lola|title=War of the Words at Hip-Hop Magazines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/29/arts/war-of-the-words-at-hip-hop-magazines.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 1, 2019|date=January 29, 2003}}</ref>

==History==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Dave Mays.JPG|right|thumb|Dave Mays founder of ''The Source''{{rfu-c|2006-12-23}}]] -->
''The Source'' was started by [[David Mays]], a Jewish Harvard University student in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Mays decided to hire his friends, [[Jonathan Shecter]] (as [[editor-in-chief]]), James Bernard (as [[senior editor]]) and Ed Young (as associate [[publisher]]), and the four men immediately became shareholders in the ownership of the magazine. At the time, Mays handled duties as the publisher for the magazine. The magazine's offices were moved from Massachusetts to New York City in 1990, a move that was made with the intention to expand the magazine into a mainstream market publication.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The magazine's annual awards show, known as ''The Source Awards'', ran from 1994 to 2004 and honored both hip-hop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] performers for their contributions to hip-hop. The Lifetime Achievement Award was the highest award given to an emcee who has contributed his/her time to succeeding in the hip-hop music industry.

''The Source'' also released a compilation album of hip-hop hits. The magazine expanded overseas with a French-language version, alongside ''The Source [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]'' and ''The Source Japan'' magazine franchises. The company invested in mobile phones and [[ringtones]] under The Source Mobile Channel moniker, in which subscribers are offered their favorite choice of hip-hop ringtones. ''The Source'' also invested in its own urban clothing apparel company.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

''The Source'' announced in a press conference that the magazine was in possession of an old tape in which a young Eminem was rapping [[racial slurs]] against Black women.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eminem Racial Slurs Come Back To Haunt|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-20/news/0311200360_1_ray-benzino-scott-eminem-raps-stupidity-and-frustration|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 20, 2003}}</ref> For his part, Eminem did not deny making the tapes; he claimed that he made them after a bitter break up with a black girlfriend (a situation upon which he elaborates on "Yellow Brick Road" on his ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'' album). He apologized for making the tapes but also exhorted the public to consider the origin of the allegations.

Nevertheless, Eminem sued ''The Source'' for defamation and copyright infringement. The federal courts ruled in The Source's favor, and allowed a limited distribution of the tape's music and lyrics under Fair Use law. In 2005, after Eminem's motions against ''The Source'' were dismissed in federal court, lawyers for Eminem abruptly withdrew his lawsuit against ''The Source'', stating that the rapper no longer had any issue with ''The Source''. Mays and [[Benzino]] both countered the withdrawal of the lawsuit, calling it a "cowardly" move. They both claimed they could finally expose the truth about Eminem and planned to eventually release the racist tapes in a future magazine. It devoted its February 2004 issue to the discovery of the tapes, and included a CD of the early Eminem songs with the magazine.

Later, Benzino and ''The Source'' would urge video and radio stations to ban Eminem's video, "[[Just Lose It]]", and issue an apology to Michael Jackson. The video depicts Jackson in a negative light and the publication wanted to boycott the rapper. In spite of their efforts, [[BET]] was the only network to ban the video. BET claimed Benzino was not the reason for the banning, but rather that it was out of admiration of Jackson. Eminem released the single "Like Toy Soldiers" from Encore, in which he states he'll "walk away from it all before it gets any further". Benzino responded with the "diss" track, "Look Into My Eyes", in which he claims Eminem does not want to fight anymore because he was "scared".{{cn|date=May 2020}}

In 2005, after [[Kimberly Osorio]] had been unlawfully terminated, Mays and Benzino appointed Joshua "Fahiym" Ratcliffe to the E.I.C. post at the publication, but Ratcliffe abruptly resigned that same year after he was ordered to lower the rating of [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]]'s ''[[The Minstrel Show]]'' from four and a half to four, with  [[Lil' Kim]]'s album ''[[The Naked Truth (Lil' Kim album)|The Naked Truth]]'', receiving the five-mic rating instead.{{cn|date=October 2020}} Although critics{{who|date=October 2020}} speculated that Lil' Kim's manager was dating Dave Mays, this was the first time that a female rapper ever received the highest rating in the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bomanijones.com/bomani%20on%20benzino.pdf|title=Just Leave, Ray|year=2005|accessdate=August 19, 2009|author=Bomani Jones|authorlink=Bomani Jones|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023200934/http://www.bomanijones.com/bomani%20on%20benzino.pdf|archivedate=October 23, 2007}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=Lil Kim not mentioned in source|date=October 2020}}

In 2006, Benzino formally announced his resignation as chief operations officer and co-owner of the magazine under the claim that his battle with the publishers and Eminem were hurting revenue, but several days later he returned as co-owner. Industry insiders{{who|date=October 2020}} believed that ''The Source'' had staged a fake event in order to encourage advertisers to invest in the controversial magazine. The rapper refuted his claims about saving ''The Source'', and instead blamed [[Interscope]]'s chairman [[Jimmy Iovine]]. Benzino believed that Iovine was pressuring to fire rap mogul [[Antonio Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]] if he didn't have [[Def Jam]] advertising removed from ''The Source''. Benzino claimed he stepped down in order to save Reid's position as president of Island Def Jam.{{cn|date=October 2020}} He then went on radio denouncing Def Jam founder [[Russell Simmons]] for not participating in his smear campaign to antagonize Eminem. He had used racial comments about Simmons in the past, forcing Def Jam to pull a vast majority of their ads from ''The Source''.  Later that year, Benzino and David Mays were forced out of ''The Source'' by its private-equity investors Black Enterprise / Greenwich Street Corporate Growth Partners.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Kim Osorio returns to ''The Source'' after lawsuit===
In January 2012, ''The Source'' and L. Londell McMillan held a press conference to announce that [[Kimberly Osorio]] was returning to the magazine as the Editor-In-Chief and VP of Content and Editorial of the Northstar Group.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kim Osorio Returns To The Source Magazine|url=https://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/01/11/kim-osorio-returns-to-the-source-magazine.html|work=[[BET]]|date=January 11, 2012}}</ref> Her return came over five years after she sued the magazine and its former owners, Dave Mays and Raymond "Benzino" Scott for sexual harassment, gender discrimination, retaliation and defamation. The jury ruled that she was fired without following proper procedures (retaliation) and found that Benzino's public reference to her as trying to "extort" the company was defamatory.<ref name=WP>{{cite news|title=Hip-Hop Editor Wins Suit over Her Firing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/24/AR2006102401500.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 25, 2006|author=Carlson, Peter|accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref> In her suit, Osorio claimed that Benzino harassed her and other women on the staff. She also complained that Benzino and his friends were treated more favorably in pay and perks than the females on staff. Her suit also stated that numerous complaints of harassment of female staffers were not followed up on by Mays, Benzino or senior management.<ref name=WP/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10252006/news/regionalnews/editors_new_source_of_woe_regionalnews_leonard_greene.htm|title=Editor's New 'Source' of Woe|author=Greene, Leonard|work=The New York Post|date=October 25, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117201112/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10252006/news/regionalnews/editors_new_source_of_woe_regionalnews_leonard_greene.htm|archivedate=November 17, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnbc.com/entertainment/10146836/detail.html|title=Source Magazine Must Pay $14.5M To Former Editor|publisher=WNBC|date=October 24, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108010548/http://www.wnbc.com/entertainment/10146836/detail.html|archivedate=November 8, 2006}}</ref>

==''The Source''{{'}}s Five-Mic albums==
The Record Report is a section in the publication in which the magazine's staff rates hip-hop albums. Ratings range from one to five [[microphone|mics]], paralleling a typical [[star (classification)|five-star rating scale]]. An album that is rated at four-and-a-half or five mics is considered by ''The Source'' to be a superior hip hop album. Over the first ten years or so, the heralded five-mic rating only applied to albums that were universally lauded hip hop albums.<ref>{{cite web|author=Osorio, Kim|url=http://thesource.com/2012/05/14/5micswhogotnext/|title=5 Mics: Who Got Next?|work=The Source|date=May 14, 2012|accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref> A total of 45 albums have been awarded five mics; a complete, chronological list is below.<ref>[http://rateyourmusic.com/list/scottbdoug/the_source_magazines_5_mic_rap_albums "5 Mic Albums"].
