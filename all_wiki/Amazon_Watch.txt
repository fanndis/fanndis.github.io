{{Indigenous rights}}
'''Amazon Watch''' is a [[nonprofit organization]]<ref>http://www.amazonwatch.org</ref> founded in 1996, and based in [[Oakland]], [[California]], it works to protect the [[Amazon rainforest|rainforest]] and advance the [[indigenous rights|rights]] of [[indigenous people in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] in the [[Amazon Basin]]. It partners with indigenous and environmental organizations in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and Brazil in campaigns for [[human rights]], [[corporate accountability]] and the preservation of the Amazon's ecological systems.

==Campaigns==
In 1964, the Texaco Petroleum Company, in partnership with Gulf Oil, began exploring for oil in Northeast Ecuador.  In 1974, the Government of the Republic of Ecuador, acting through the state-owned oil agency [[Petroecuador]], obtained a 25% interest.  Two years later, Petroecuador acquired Gulf Oil's interest and became a 62.5% owner of the [[Lago Agrio oil field]].  By 1993, Petroecuador had also acquired Texaco's interest.  After Texaco completed environmental remediation, the Government of Ecuador inspected and certified the work and ”absolved, liberated and forever freed” Texaco Petroleum from “any claim or litigation by the Government of Ecuador.” <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Aguinda v.

After extensive litigation, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed in Aguinda v. Texaco an earlier court's dismissal on the basis of "[[forum non conveniens]]."  <ref name=":0" /> Thus, legal proceedings were started in Ecuador in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Texaco/Chevron lawsuits (re Ecuador) {{!}} Business & Human Rights Resource Centre|url = http://business-humanrights.org/en/texacochevron-lawsuits-re-ecuador|website = business-humanrights.org|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref>

Amazon Watch supports the Ecuadorian plaintiffs by publishing a press kit alleging that [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (corporate successor to Texaco) should be held accountable for the dumping of {{convert|18|e9USgal|m3}} of toxic waste water into a region of Ecuador's Amazon rainforest inhabited by more than 30,000 people – purported to be one of the largest oil related contaminations ever, far exceeding that of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon Valdez disaster]].<ref>http://www.chevrontoxico.com and www.texacotoxico.org/eng</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Amazon Watch - Press Kit for Landmark Legal Case, Aguinda v.

Ecuador's Supreme Court in 2013 affirmed the trial court judgment in a 222-page decision that documented the extensive and life-threatening levels of oil pollution at dozens of former Chevron well sites in the jungle. In all, eight appellate judges in Ecuador reviewed the evidence against Chevron and affirmed the judgment, as well as dismissing Chevron's allegation of fraud. When Chevron refused to comply with the $9.5 billion judgment against it for contamination in the [[Lago Agrio oil field]], the plaintiffs' lead attorney, [[Steven R. Donziger]], attempted to collect the judgment in Brazil, Argentina, and Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Yaiguaje v.

Amazon Watch's web page describes its activities in Ecuador as going "beyond supporting indigenous efforts to keep their territories intact and win greater rights guarantees, Amazon Watch is also promoting visionary alternatives that could protect the Amazonian environment and local communities. The Yasuni ITT initiative is one such initiative for which we have actively campaigned. The proposal seeks to keep some 900 million barrels of heavy crude that lies underneath Yasuni National Park permanently in the ground in exchange for half of the forgone oil revenues. If done right, the proposal is an important first step towards keeping oil reserves in [[culturally sensitive]] and fragile [[ecosystem]]s in Ecuador and beyond".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Amazon Watch - Ecuador|url = http://amazonwatch.org/work/ecuador|website = Amazon Watch|access-date = 2016-01-19|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314051503/http://amazonwatch.org/work/ecuador|archive-date = 2016-03-14|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Additionally, Amazon Watch is a [[plaintiff]] in a case against the US oil company [[Occidental Petroleum|Occidental]] for its damage to the Peruvian rainforest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.earthrights.org/feature/a_legacy_of_harm.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091103/http://www.earthrights.org/feature/a_legacy_of_harm.html |archive-date=2009-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The District Court initially granted Occidental's motion to dismiss without ruling on whether Amazon Watch had standing to sue.

In Brazil, the Brazilian government is building the world's third largest hydroelectric dam on the Xingu River, one of the Amazon's major tributaries. The Belo Monte dam complex would divert 80 percent of the Xingu River's flow, devastating an area of over 1,500 square kilometers of rainforest, and resulting in the forced displacement of up to 40,000 people. With the people of the Xingu and a network of Brazilian and international NGOs, Amazon Watch is working to document and publicize the dam's drastic impacts on local and indigenous populations.

Amazon Watch reports that the current rate of [[deforestation]] threatens to push the Amazon past a tipping point from which it cannot recover. Reports say that in the last 30 years, 20 percent of the Amazon has been deforested and another 20 percent degraded – all fueled by clearing land for [[agriculture]] and large-scale industrial projects such as oil and [[gas pipeline]]s, dams and roads.

In September 2016 Amazon Watch released a report which concludes that imports of crude oil by the US are driving rainforest destruction in the Amazon and releasing significant greenhouse gases.<ref name="milman-2016">

On 6 February 2020, the environmental organization [[Mobilize Earth]] debuted ''Guardians of Life'', the first of twelve short films that highlight the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project will go to Amazon Watch and [[Extinction Rebellion]].<ref name="Reuters 6 Feb 2020">{{cite web
