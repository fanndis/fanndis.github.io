The song's appearance in ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' came about after filmmakers approached Swift about using her music in the film. Film officials emailed her asking for a song "that was perfect to fall in love to" and "sort of a country [[waltz]]".<ref name="prod" /> Although it was not written intentionally for the film, Swift sent in "Crazier" and the filmmakers "loved it".<ref name="prod">{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2009/hanna_montana/notes.pdf |title=Hannah Montana The Movie Production Notes |publisher=VisualHollywood.com |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lNC4Dlzi?url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2009/hanna_montana/notes.pdf |archivedate=November 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> In addition, Swift offered to perform the song in the film herself as a [[cameo appearance]].
