Midway through the [[116th United States Congress]], the CPC had 97 members, making it the second largest ideological caucus in the Democratic Party and the third largest ideological caucus overall. The CPC is co-chaired by U.S. Representatives [[Mark Pocan]] (D-WI) and [[Pramila Jayapal]] (D-WA).

== History ==
The CPC was established in 1991 by U.S. Representatives [[Ron Dellums]] (D-CA), [[Lane Evans]] (D-IL), [[Thomas Andrews (politician)|Thomas Andrews]] (D-ME), [[Peter DeFazio]] (D-OR), [[Maxine Waters]] (D-CA) and [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT). Additional Representatives joined soon thereafter, including [[Major Owens]] (D-NY), [[Nydia Velázquez]] (D-NY), [[David Bonior]] (D-MI), [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA), [[Barney Frank]] (D-MA), [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY), [[Jim McDermott]] (D-WA), [[Jerry Nadler]] (D-NY), [[Patsy Mink]] (D-HI), [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), [[Pete Stark]] (D-CA), [[John Olver]] (D-MA), [[Lynn Woolsey]] (D-CA) and [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-CA). Sanders was the first CPC Chairman.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Talbot |first1=Margaret |title=The Populist Prophet |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=19 May 2020}}</ref>

The founding CPC members were concerned about the economic hardship imposed by the deepening recession and the growing inequality brought about by the timidity of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] response in the early 1990s. On January 3, 1995, at a standing room only news conference on Capitol Hill, they were the first group inside Congress to chart a comprehensive legislative alternative to U.S. Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican [[Contract with America]]. The CPC's ambitious agenda was framed as "The Progressive Promise: Fairness."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brodey |first1=Sam |title=How Keith Ellison made the Congressional Progressive Caucus into a political force that matters |url=https://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2015/07/how-keith-ellison-made-congressional-progressive-caucus-political-force-matter/ |website=MinnPost |accessdate=19 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Budget proposal for 2012 ===
In April 2011, the Congressional Progressive Caucus released a proposed "People's Budget" for fiscal year 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=The People's Budget|publisher=Congressional Progressive Caucus|url=http://grijalva.house.gov/uploads/The%20CPC%20FY2012%20Budget.pdf|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Two of its proponents stated: "By implementing a fair tax code, by building a resilient American economy, and by bringing our troops home, we achieve a budget surplus of over $30 billion by 2021 and we end up with a debt that is less than 65% of our GDP. This is what sustainability looks like".<ref>{{citation|last=Honda|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Honda|last2=Grijalva|first2=Raul|author2-link=Raul Grijalva|title=The only real Democratic budget|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=April 11, 2011|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/155221-the-only-real-democratic-budget|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref>

The CPC advocates "universal access to affordable, high quality healthcare" ([[universal healthcare]] or [[single-payer healthcare]]),{{Clarify|reason="access" and "affordable" make it seem as though the model suggested is not universal, as universal healthcare would likely be free at the point of service and paid for through taxes|date=October 2020}} [[fair trade]] agreements, [[living wage]] laws, the right of all workers to organize into [[trade union|labor unions]] and engage in [[collective bargaining]], ending certain provisions of the [[Patriot Act]], U.S. participation in international treaties, responsible reductions in military expenditure, strict [[campaign finance reform]] laws, a crackdown on corporate influence, and protection of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits.<ref name="cpcpromise">{{cite web|publisher=Congressional Progressive Caucus|title=The Progressive Promise|accessdate=September 28, 2018|url=https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/the-progressive-promise/}}</ref>
