Michael Radutzky, a producer of CBS ''[[60 Minutes]]'', said his show considers fake news to be "stories that are probably false, have enormous traction [popular appeal] in the culture, and are consumed by millions of people." These stories are not only found in politics, but also in areas like vaccination, stock values and nutrition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lazer|first1=David M.

The intent and purpose of fake news is important. In some cases, what appears to be fake news may be [[news satire]], which uses exaggeration and introduces non-factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point, rather than to deceive. [[Propaganda]] can also be fake news.<ref name=Guardian12.17.16/> Some researchers have highlighted that "fake news" may be distinguished not just by the falsity of its content, but also the "character of [its] online circulation and reception".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bounegru |first1=Liliana |last2=Gray |first2=Jonathan |last3=Venturini |first3=Tommaso |last4=Mauri |first4=Michele |date=January 8, 2018|title=A Field Guide to "Fake News" and Other Information Disorders |url=http://fakenews.publicdatalab.org/ |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Public Data Lab |page=8}}</ref>

Claire Wardle of ''[[First Draft News]]'' identifies seven types of fake news:<ref>{{cite web|author= Wardle, Claire|title= Fake news. It's complicated|url= https://firstdraftnews.org/fake-news-complicated/|publisher= firstdraftnews.org|date= February 16, 2017|access-date= April 22, 2017}}</ref>

# satire or parody ("no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool")
# false connection ("when headlines, visuals or captions don't support the content")
# misleading content ("misleading use of information to [[Spin (public relations)|frame an issue]] or an individual")
# false context ("when genuine content is shared with false contextual information")
# impostor content ("when genuine sources are impersonated" with false, made-up sources)
# manipulated content ("when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive", as with a "doctored" photo)
# fabricated content ("new content is 100% false, designed to deceive and do harm")

In the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the 2010s, fake news generated considerable controversy and argument, with some commentators defining concern over it as [[moral panic]] or [[mass hysteria]] and others worried about damage done to public trust.<ref>{{cite news|last1= Shafer|first1= Jack|title= The Cure for Fake News Is Worse Than the Disease|url= http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/the-cure-for-fake-news-is-worse-than-the-disease-214477|access-date= February 19, 2017|newspaper= [[Politico]]|date= November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last1= Gobry|first1= Pascal-Emmanuel|title= The crushing anxiety behind the media's fake news hysteria|url= http://theweek.com/articles/666395/crushing-anxiety-behind-medias-fake-news-hysteria|access-date= February 19, 2017|magazine=[[The Week]] |date= December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=Matt |title=Fake news as an informational moral panic: the symbolic deviancy of social media during the 2016 US presidential election |journal=Information, Communication & Society |date=August 2018 |pages=374–388 |doi=10.1080/1369118X.2018.1505934 |volume=23|issue=3 |s2cid=149496585 }}</ref>

Some, most notably United States President [[Donald Trump]], have broadened the meaning of "fake news" to include news that was negative of his presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cognitive-ability-and-vulnerability-to-fake-news/|title=Cognitive Ability and Vulnerability to Fake News|first=David Z.

In November 2017, Claire Wardle (mentioned above) announced she has rejected the phrase "fake news" and "censors it in conversation", finding it "woefully inadequate" to describe the issues. She now speaks of "information pollution" and distinguishes between three types of problems: 'mis-information', 'dis-information', and 'mal-information':
# [[Misinformation|Mis-information]]: false information disseminated without harmful intent.
# [[Disinformation|Dis-information]]: created and shared by people with harmful intent.
# Mal-information: the sharing of "genuine" information with the intent to cause harm.<ref>{{cite news |last=Giuliani-Hoffman |first=Francesca |date=November 3, 2017 |title='F*** News' should be replaced by these words, Claire Wardle says |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/media/claire-wardle-fake-news-reliable-sources-podcast/index.html |work=Money.CNN |access-date=November 24, 2018 }}</ref>

Author [[Terry Pratchett]], who had a background as a journalist and press officer, was among the first to be concerned about the spread of fake news on the Internet. In a 1995 interview with [[Bill Gates]], founder of [[Microsoft]], he said "Let's say I call myself the Institute for Something-or-other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the second world war and [[the Holocaust]] didn't happen and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone [[peer review]] and so on. There's a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net. It's all there: there's no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up". Gates was optimistic and disagreed, saying that authorities on the Net would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print. But it was Pratchett who had "accurately predicted how the internet would propagate and legitimize fake news".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/terry-pratchett-predicted-rise-of-fake-news-in-1995-says-biographer |title=Terry Pratchett predicted rise of fake news in 1995, says biographer |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Alison Flood |date= 30 May 2019}}</ref>

Here are a few examples of fake news and how they are viewed:
* Clickbait
* Propaganda
* Satire/parody
* Sloppy journalism
* Misleading headings
* Manipulation
*Rumor Mill
*Misinformation
*Media Bias
*Audience Bias
*Content farm

These are features of fake news and may help to identify and avoid instances of fake news.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Downey|first=Beth|title=Research Guides: Evaluating False News and Misinformation: Types of False News|url=https://guides.library.msstate.edu/c.php?g=672253&p=4772779|access-date=2020-11-15|website=guides.library.msstate.edu|language=en}}</ref>

Websites such as "[[Snopes]]" try to detect this information manually, while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves.<ref name=":03" />

In the 13th century BC, [[Rameses the Great]] spread lies and propaganda portraying the [[Battle of Kadesh]] as a stunning victory for the Egyptians; he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples.

=== Early modern period ===

After the invention of the [[printing press]] in 1439, publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow. By the 17th century, historians began the practice of citing their sources in [[Note (typography)|footnotes]]. In 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] went on trial, the demand for verifiable news increased.<ref name=politico />

During the 18th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands; one man, Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht, was banned four times by Dutch authorities—and four times he moved and restarted his press.<ref name=FiveThirtyEight /> In the American colonies, [[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote fake news about murderous "scalping" Indians working with King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution.<ref name=politico />

[[wikt:canard|Canards]], the successors of the 16th century [[pasquinade]], were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries, starting in the 17th century.

Rumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period, despite the only major uprising occurring in the 19th century. One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in 1730. The serving governor of Virginia at the time, Governor William Gooch, reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down—although this never happened. After Gooch discovered the falsehood, he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished, tortured, and made prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/winter05-06/conspiracy.cfm|title=Slave Conspiracies in Colonial Virginia|website=history.org|access-date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>

During the [[First World War]], an example of fake news was the [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] [[atrocity propaganda]] regarding an alleged "[[German Corpse Factory]]" in which the German battlefield dead were supposedly rendered down for fats used to make [[nitroglycerine]], candles, lubricants, [[Soap made from human corpses|human soap]] and boot dubbing. Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] press starting in 1915, and by 1917 the English-language publication ''[[North China Daily News]]'' presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort; this was based on new, allegedly true stories from ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' that turned out to be forgeries. These false allegations became known as such after the war, and in the [[Second World War]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] used the story in order to [[Holocaust denial|deny the ongoing massacre of Jews]] as British propaganda. According to [[Joachim Neander]] and [[Randal Marlin]], the story also "encouraged later disbelief" when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Dachau concentration camp]]s.<ref name="BBC fake news">{{cite news|title=The corpse factory and the birth of fake news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38995205|access-date=March 5, 2017 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 17, 2017}}</ref>

[[Brendan Nyhan]], one of the researchers, emphatically stated in an interview on NBC News: "People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites—full stop."<ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"/>

NBC NEWS: "It feels like there's a connection between having an active portion of a party that's prone to seeking false stories and conspiracies and a president who has famously spread conspiracies and false claims. In many ways, demographically and ideologically, the president fits the profile of the fake news users that you're describing."

NYHAN: "It's worrisome if fake news websites further weaken the norm against false and misleading information in our politics, which unfortunately has eroded. But it's also important to put the content provided by fake news websites in perspective.

A 2019 study by researchers at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[New York University]] found that a person's likelihood of sharing fake-news articles correlated more strongly with age than it did education, sex, or political views. 11% of users older than 65 shared an article consistent with the study's definition of fake news.

Another issue in mainstream media is the usage of the [[filter bubble]], a "bubble" that has been created that gives the viewer, on social media platforms, a specific piece of the information knowing they will like it. Thus creating fake news and biased news because only half the story is being shared, the portion the viewer liked.

==== How fake news spreads and goes viral ====

Fake news has the tendency to become viral among the public. With the presence of social media platforms like [[Twitter]], it becomes easier for false information to diffuse quickly. Research has found that false political information tends to spread "3 times" faster than other false news.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/2017%20IDE%20Research%20Brief%20False%20News.pdf|title=The Spread of True and False News Online|last=Vosoughi|first=Soroush|publisher=MIT Digital|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> On Twitter, false tweets have a much higher chance of being retweeted than truthful tweets. More so, it is humans who are responsible in disseminating false news and information as opposed to bots and click-farms. The tendency for humans to spread false information has to do with human behavior; according to research, humans are attracted to events and information that are surprising and new, and, as a result, causes high-arousal in the brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jonahberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ViralityB.pdf|title=What Makes online Content Viral?|last=Berger|first=Jonah|date=5 March 2019|publisher=American Marketing Association|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ilab.usc.edu/publications/doc/Itti_Baldi06nips.pdf|title=Bayesian Surprise Attracts Human Attention|last=Itti|first=Laurent|journal=Vision Research|date=2005|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1295–1306|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2008.09.007|pmid=18834898|pmc=2782645|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> Besides, motivated reasoning was found to play a role in the spread of fake news.<ref name=":6" /> This ultimately leads humans to retweet or share false information, which are usually characterized with [[clickbait]] and eye-catching titles. This prevents people from stopping to verify the information. As a result, massive online communities form around a piece of false news without any prior fact checking or verification of the veracity of the information.
The question of how fake news and real news propagate in social network has been studied by Zhao et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fake news propagates differently from real news even at early stages of spreading 7 |title=Zilong Zhao, Jichang Zhao, Yukie Sano, Orr Levy, Hideki Takayasu, Misako Takayasu, Daqing Li, Junjie Wu, Shlomo Havlin |journal=EPJ Data Science |date=2020 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=7}}</ref> and by Vosoughi et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vosoughi S, Roy D, Aral S |title=The spread of true and false news online. |journal=Science |date=2019 |volume=359 |issue=6380 |pages=1146–1151|doi=10.1126/science.aap9559 |pmid=29590045 |s2cid=4549072 |url=http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/share/papershredder/vosoughi2018a.pdf }}</ref>
Both studies found difference between propagation of fake news and real news.

==== Popularity of fake news ====

Fake news has become popular with various media outlets and platforms. Researchers at [[Pew Research Center]] discovered that over 60% of Americans access news through social media compared to traditional newspaper and magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/|title=News Use Across Social Media Platforms 2016 |work=Pew Research Center|date=2016-05-26|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> With the popularity of social media, individuals can easily access fake news or similar content. One study looks at the number of fake news articles being accessed by viewers in 2016 and found that each individual was exposed to at least one or more fake news articles daily.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}<!--Empty reference <ref name=":04" />{{better source|date=May 2019}}--> As a result, fake news is omnipresent among the viewer population and results in its ability to spread across the internet.

==== Bots on social media ====

In the mid 1990s, [[Nicholas Negroponte|Nicolas Negroponte]] anticipated a world where news through technology become progressively personalized. In his 1996 book&nbsp;''Being Digital''&nbsp;he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences. This prediction has since been reflected in news and social media feeds of modern day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spohr|first=Dominic|date=August 23, 2017|title=Fake news and ideological polarization|journal=Business Information Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=150–160|doi=10.1177/0266382117722446|s2cid=158078019}}</ref>

Bots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news, as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like, without taking into account the authenticity of an article. Bots mass-produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of the sources, allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news, as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers, recognition, and authority. Additionally, almost 30% of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burkhardt|first=Joanna M.|date=2017|title=Can Technology Save Us?|journal=Library Technology Reports|volume=53|page=14|id={{ProQuest|1967322547}}}}</ref>

In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories.<ref name="Allcott"/>

By August 2017 Facebook stopped using the term "fake news" and used "false news" in its place instead. Will Oremus of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that because supporters of [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] had redefined the word "fake news" to refer to mainstream media opposed to them, "it makes sense for Facebook—and others—to cede the term to the right-wing trolls who have claimed it as their own."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Oremus, Will|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/08/08/facebook_has_stopped_saying_fake_news_is_false_news_any_better.html|title=Facebook Has Stopped Saying "Fake News"|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=August 8, 2017|access-date=August 11, 2017}}</ref>

Research from [[Northwestern University]] concluded that 30% of all fake news traffic, as opposed to only 8% of real news traffic, could be linked back to Facebook. The research concluded fake news consumers do not exist in a [[filter bubble]]; many of them also consume real news from established news sources. The fake news audience is only 10 percent of the real news audience, and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news compared with real news consumers—with the exception of [[Drudge Report]] readers, who spent more than 11 times longer reading the website than other users.<ref name=ColumbiaJReview>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/fake-news-facebook-audience-drudge-breitbart-study.php|title=Is 'fake news' a fake problem?|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref>

==== Internet trolls ====

In [[Internet slang]], a [[Internet troll|troll]] is a person who sows discord on the [[Internet]] by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, [[wikt:Extraneous#Adjective|extraneous]], or [[off-topic]] messages in an online community (such as a [[newsgroup]], forum, [[chat room]], or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an [[emotion]]al response or off-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement. Internet trolls also feed on attention.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Joel|date=August 2016|title=How Trolls Are Ruining the Internet|url=http://libraryproxy.tulsacc.edu:2076/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=dd6805bc-c41e-45e6-a288-a838d36989d8%40sessionmgr4006&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=117537299&db=aph|website=Time.com|page=106|via=Ebscohost}}</ref>

The idea of internet trolls gained popularity in the 1990s, though its meaning shifted in 2011. Whereas it once denoted provocation, it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet. Trolling comes in various forms, and can be dissected into abuse trolling, entertainment trolling, classical trolling, flame trolling, anonymous trolling, and kudos trolling. It is closely linked to fake news, as internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information, information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Binns|first=Amy|date=August 2012|title=Don't Feed the Trolls!|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8377/1/8377_Binns.pdf|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=4|pages=547–562|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1080/17512786.2011.648988|s2cid=143013977}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499442453/the-twitter-paradox-how-a-platform-designed-for-free-speech-enables-internet-tro|title=The Twitter Paradox: How A Platform Designed For Free Speech Enables Internet Trolls|last=Gross|first=Terry|date=October 2016|website=NPR|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref>

In March 2018, [[Google]] launched Google News Initiative (GNI) to fight the spread of fake news. It launched GNI under the belief that quality [[journalism]] and identifying truth online is crucial.

The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news. To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers, Google created Subscribe with Google. Additionally, they have created a dashboard, News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics.

Media scholar Dr. Nolan Higdon argues that relying on tech-companies to solve the issues with false information will exacerbate the problems associated with fake news.<ref name="Higdon"/> Higdon contends that tech-companies lack an incentive for solving the problem because they benefit from the proliferation of fake news.

=== Donald Trump ===
[[File:Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|Donald Trump frequently mentions fake news on Twitter to criticize the media in the United States, including [[CNN]] and [[New York Times]].]]

President Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media regularly reports fake news. His use of the term has increased distrust of the American media globally, particularly in Russia. His claims have given credibility to the stories in the Russian media that label American news, especially news about atrocities committed by the Syrian regime against its own people, where it was quoted that "munitions at the air base had as much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq", as just more fake American news.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/business/media/vladimir-putin-moscow-press-trump.html|title=A Lesson in Moscow About Trump-Style 'Alternative Truth'|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|date=April 16, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref>

Author and literary critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] has described developments in the right-wing media and websites:
{{quotebox| "FOX News and the planetary system of right-wing news sites that would orbit it and, later, Breitbart, were particularly adept at weaponizing such arguments and exploiting the increasingly partisan fervor animating the Republican base: They accused the media establishment of "liberal bias", and substituted their own right-wing views as "fair and balanced"—a redefinition of terms that was a harbinger of Trump's hijacking of "fake news" to refer not to alt-right conspiracy theories and Russian troll posts, but to real news that he perceived as inconvenient or a threat to himself."<ref name="Woods_6/20/2018">{{cite web |last=Woods |first=Sean |title=Michiko Kakutani on Her Essential New Book 'The Death of Truth' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 20, 2018 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/michiko-kakutani-on-her-essential-new-book-the-death-of-truth-666137/ |access-date=July 23, 2018}}</ref>}}

In September 2018, [[National Public Radio]] noted that Trump has expanded his use of the terms "fake" and "phony" to "an increasingly wide variety of things he doesn't like": "The range of things Trump is declaring fake is growing too. Last month he tweeted about "fake books," "the fake dossier," "fake CNN," and he added a new claim—that Google search results are "RIGGED" to mostly show only negative stories about him." They graphed his expanding use in columns labeled: "Fake news", "Fake (other) and "Phony".<ref name="Keith_9/4/2018">{{cite web |last=Keith |first=Tamara |title=President Trump's Description of What's 'Fake' Is Expanding |website=[[NPR]] |date=September 2, 2018 |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/643761979/president-trumps-description-of-whats-fake-is-expanding |access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref>

=== Criticism of the term ===

Because of the manner in which Trump has co-opted the term, ''[[Washington Post]]'' media columnist [[Margaret Sullivan (journalist)|Margaret Sullivan]] has warned fellow journalists that "It's time to retire the tainted term 'fake news'. Though the term hasn't been around long, its meaning already is lost."<ref name="Gendreau_2/25/2017"/> By late 2018, the term "fake news" had become ''verboten'' and U.S. journalists, including the [[Poynter Institute]] were asking for apologies and for product retirements from companies using the term.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keith McMillan |last2=Cleve R.

In October 2018, the British government decided that the term "fake news" will no longer be used in official documents because it is "a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes." This followed a recommendation by the [[House of Commons]]' [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to avoid the term.<ref name="telegraphoct18">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/22/government-bans-phrase-fake-news/|title=Government bans phrase 'fake news'|first=Margi|last=Murphy|date=October 23, 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

== By country ==

=== Armenia ===
According to a report by [[openDemocracy]] in 2020, the Armenian website Medmedia.am was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, calling [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] a “fake pandemic” and warning Armenians to refuse future vaccine programmes.  The website is led by Gevorg Grigoryan, a doctor who has been critical of the Armenian government's health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in which he called for gay people to be burned. The Guardian newspaper said the site was launched with the unwitting help of a US State Department grant intended to promote democracy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=US government is funding website spreading Covid-19 disinformation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/us-funding-website-spreading-covid-19-disinformation|date=28 May 2020|website=The Guardian|access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Australia ===

A well-known case of fabricated news in [[Australia]] happened in 2009 when a report ''Deception Detection Across Australian Populations'' of a "Levitt Institute" was widely cited on news websites across the country, claiming that [[Sydney]] was the most naive city, despite the fact that the report itself contained a clue: amidst the mathematical gibberish, there was a statement: "These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2698835.htm "Deception Detection Deficiency"], ''Media Watch'', episode 34, September 28, 2009, [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]</ref>
The Australian Parliament initiated investigation into "fake news" regarding issues surrounding fake news that occurred during the 2016 United States election. The inquiry looked at several major areas in Australia to find audiences most vulnerable to fake news, by considering the impact on traditional journalism, and by evaluating the liability of online advertisers and by regulating the spreading the hoaxes. This act of parliament is meant to combat the threat of social media power on spreading fake news as concluded negative results to the public.<ref>Remeikis, A. (2017).

=== Austria ===

Politicians in Austria dealt with the impact of fake news and its spread on social media after the 2016 presidential campaign in the country. In December 2016, a court in Austria issued an injunction on Facebook Europe, mandating it block negative postings related to [[Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek]], [[Austrian Green Party]] Chairwoman.

The peace accord would end five decades of war between paramilitary groups (rebel forces) and the Colombian government that resulted in millions of deaths and displaced citizens throughout the country.

=== Indonesia ===

Recently, Indonesia has seen an increase in the amount of fake news circulating social media. The problem first arose during their [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|2014 presidential election]], where the eventual-winning candidate [[Joko Widodo]] became a target of a smear campaign by [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s supporters which falsely claimed he was the child of [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] members, of [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese descent]], and a [[Christians|Christian]].<ref name="auto4">{{cite news|last1=Kwok|first1=Yenni|title=Where Memes Could Kill: Indonesia's Worsening Problem of Fake News|url=http://time.com/4620419/indonesia-fake-news-ahok-chinese-christian-islam/|website=Time.com|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref> Unlike the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the sharing of fake news resulted in increased social-media engagement than real news, inflaming ethnic and political tensions could be potentially deadly in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], [[Persecution of Christians in the modern era|anti-Christian]] and [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese]] pogroms cultivated by [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|U.S.-backed right-wing dictatorship]] which ran the country for thirty-some years.<ref name="auto4"/> Suharto was also Prabowo's father in-law for the last 15 years of the regime. The government, watchdog groups, and even religious organizations have taken steps to prevent its spreading, such as blocking certain websites and creating fact-check apps. The largest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], has created an anti-fake news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while other Islamic groups have defined such propagation as tantamount to a sin.<ref name="auto4"/> While the government currently views criminal punishment as its last resort, officials are working hard to guarantee law enforcement will respect the freedom of expression.

The fake news campaign rose again in the [[2019 Indonesian general election|2019 presidential election]], which involved the same sides competing last time out. For years, most fake news circulated in Indonesia are related to alleged [[Chinese imperialism]] (including [[Sinicization]]), [[communization]], and [[Christianization]]. It was made worse by the [[2016–17 Jakarta protests]] led by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] groups such as the [[Islamic Defenders Front]] (FPI) which successfully imprisoned Jakarta Governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], who happens to be a Chinese-Christian.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== Mexico ===

{{Main|Peñabot}}
The PRI political party has been reported to use fake news since before [[Enrique Peña Nieto|Peña Nieto]]. The main tactic originally was to spread such propaganda through open radio and television networks. Such tactic was effective in Mexico, because newspaper readership is low and cable TV is largely limited to the middle classes; consequently, the country's two major television networks – Televisa and [[TV Azteca]] – exert a significant influence in [[Politics of Mexico|national politics]]. [[Televisa]] itself, not only owns around two-thirds of the programming on Mexico's TV channels, making it not only Mexico's largest television network, but also is the largest media network in the Spanish-speaking world.

This was done to weaken criticism of Russia's involvement in the war.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Emma |title=Inside the Conspiracy Theory That Turned Syria's First Responders Into Terrorists |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/white-helmets-conspiracy-theory/ |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref> The United Nations and international chemical inspectors found [[Bashar al-Assad]] responsible for use of chemical weapons,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/26/middleeast/syria-khan-sheikhoun-chemical-attack-sarin/index.html |title=UN: Syria responsible for sarin attack that killed scores |author1=Steve Almasy |author2=Richard Roth |publisher=CNN |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612174315/https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/26/middleeast/syria-khan-sheikhoun-chemical-attack-sarin/index.html |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> which was called "fake news" by Russia.

=== Taiwan ===

In a report in December 2015 by ''[[The China Post]]'', a fake video shared online showed people a light show purportedly made at the [[Shihmen Reservoir]]. The Northern Region Water Resources Office confirmed there was no light show at the reservoir and the event had been fabricated. The fraud led to an increase in tourist visits to the actual attraction.

According to the news updated paper from the Time World in regards the global threat to free speech, the Taiwanese government has reformed its policy on education and it will include "media literacy" as one part of school curriculum for the students. It will be included to develop the [[critical thinking]] skills needed while using social media. Further, the work of media literacy will also include the skills needed to analyze propaganda and sources, so the student can clarify what is fake news.<ref>Smith, N. (2017).

=== Ukraine ===

Since the [[Euromaidan]] and the beginning of the [[Ukrainian crisis]] in 2014, the Ukrainian media circulated several fake news stories and misleading images, including a dead rebel photograph with a Photoshop-painted tattoo which allegedly indicated that he belonged to Russian Special Forces<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stopfake.org/en/ukrainian-site-censor-net-published-edited-photo-of-a-russian-soldier/ |title= Ukrainian site Censor.net published edited photo of a Russian soldier |website= StopFake.org |date= July 30, 2014 }}</ref> and the threat of a Russian nuclear attack against the Ukrainian troops.<ref name=BlackJohns>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=131740954X |title=The Return of the Cold War: Ukraine, The West and Russia|author=J.

In 2015 the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] published a report criticizing Russian disinformation campaigns to disrupt relations between Europe and Ukraine after ouster of [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. According to ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', similar tactics were used by fake news websites during the U.S. elections. A website, [http://www.StopFake.org StopFake] was created by Ukrainian activists in 2014 to debunk fake news in Ukraine, including [[media portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis]].<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/fake-news-medias-post-truth-problem/a-36428321 "Fake news: Media's post-truth problem"], [[Deutsche Welle]], retrieved November 24, 2016.</ref>

On May 29, 2018, the Ukrainian media and state officials announced that the Russian journalist [[Arkady Babchenko]] was assassinated in his apartment in Kiev. Later, Babchenko appeared to be alive, and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] claimed that the staged assassination was needed to arrest a person who allegedly was planning a real assassination. [[Alexander Baunov]], writing for Carnegie.ru, mentioned that the staged assassination of Babchenko was the first instance of fake news delivered directly by the highest officials of a state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://carnegie.ru/commentary/76478|script-title=ru:Репортеры без берегов.

=== United Arab Emirates ===

The [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) had been funding [[non-profit organizations]], [[think tanks]] and [[Freelancer|contributors]] of [[journalism]], including [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] (FDD) and the [[Middle East Forum]] (MEF), which further paid journalists spreading fake information to defame countries like [[Qatar]]. In 2020, a researcher at FDD, Benjamin Weinthal, and fellow at MEF, [[Jonathan Spyer]], contributed an article on ''[[Fox News]]'' to promote a negative image of Qatar, in an attempt to stain its [[diplomatic relations]] with the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/aug/7/trump-complains-about-fox-news/|title=Trump complains about Fox News, and he may be right|access-date=7 August 2020|website=The Washington Times}}</ref>

In 1702 [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of England]] issued a proclamation "for restraining the spreading false news, and printing and publishing of irreligious and seditious papers and libels".<ref>{{cite book|author=Queen Anne|title=By the Queen, a proclamation, for restraining the spreading false news, and printing and publishing of irreligious and seditious papers and libels|date=1702|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2JZAQAACAAJ}}</ref>

On December 8, 2016, [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) [[Alex Younger]] delivered a speech to journalists at the [[SIS Building|MI6 headquarters]] where he called fake news and propaganda damaging to democracy. Younger said the mission of MI6 was to combat propaganda and fake news in order to deliver to his government a strategic advantage in the [[information warfare|information-warfare]] arena, and to assist other nations including Europe. He called such methods of fake-news propaganda online a "fundamental threat to our sovereignty". Younger said all nations that hold democratic values should feel the same worry over fake news.<ref>Waterson, Jim (December 8, 2016), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/mi6-chief-says-fake-news-and-online-propaganda-is-a-threat-t "MI6 Chief Says Fake News And Online Propaganda Are A Threat To Democracy"], [[BuzzFeed]], retrieved December 11, 2016.</ref>

However, definitions of "fake news" have been controversial in the UK, with [[political satire]] being seen{{by whom|date=January 2020}} as a key element of [[British humour]].<ref>O'Grady, Sean (February 9, 2017). [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/corbyn-keunssberg-trump-fake-news-danger-to-democracy-a7572176.html "The term 'fake news' isn't just annoying, it's a danger to democracy"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved March 5, 2017.</ref> Dr Claire Wardle advised some UK Members of Parliament against using the term in certain circumstances "when describing the complexity of information disorder", as the term "fake news" is "woefully inadequate":

<blockquote>Neither the words 'fake' nor 'news' effectively capture this polluted information ecosystem. Much of the content used as examples in debates on this topic are not fake, they are genuine but used out of context or manipulated. Similarly, to understand the entire ecosystem of polluted information, we need to consider far more than content that mimics 'news'.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Hern |first1= Alex |title= MPs warned against term 'fake news' for first live committee hearing outside UK |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/07/commons-committee-must-not-use-term-fake-news-in-us-hearing |access-date= 1 August 2018 |work= The Guardian |date= 7 February 2018 }}</ref></blockquote>

In October 2020, a hoax claim made by a spoof [[Twitter]] account, about the supposed reopening of [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] stores, was repeated without verification by news sites including the [[Daily Mail]] and [[Daily Mirror]] (and the latter's regional sister titles).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waterson |first1=Jim |title=Sixth-form student revealed to be behind 'Woolworths reopening' fake news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/28/sixth-form-student-revealed-behind-woolworths-reopening-fake-news |access-date=28 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=28 October 2020}}</ref>
