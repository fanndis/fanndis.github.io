The '''Ministry of Culture''' of Brazil ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Ministério da Cultura, MinC) was a [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]]-level [[federal government of Brazil|federal]] [[list of federal institutions of Brazil|ministry]] created in 1985, in the first month of president's [[José Sarney]] government and dissolved by [[Jair Bolsonaro]] in 2019.

==Dissolution and reinstatement==
In April 1990, it was dissolved by president [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and transformed into a Culture Secretary, directly linked to the presidency. This situation was reverted two years later, but, in the meantime, in 1991, the law called popularly ''Lei Rouanet'' was created by the secretary of Culture, Sérgio Paulo Rouanet. It is a law that allows companies and individuals  to sponsor cultural products, up to respectively 4% and 6% of their income tax. It is a law of incentive to the culture, the most important instrument of the ministry, frequently contested.

In 1999, president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] expanded the scope of the law, with more financial resources and a reorganization of its structure. Again, in 2003, president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva restructured the ministry.

The Ministry of Culture was dissolved again on 12 May 2016 by the [[acting president]] of [[Brazil]], [[Michel Temer]]. Its functions were merged into a new  Ministry of Education and Culture. The dissolution of the ministry immediately sparked protests in numerous Brazilian cities, and included the occupation of the [[Gustavo Capanema Palace]] in Rio de Janeiro, and [[National Foundation of the Arts]] (FUNARTE) offices in Belo Horizonte, Brasília and São Paulo. Artists such as the singer [[Otto (singer)|Otto]] and [[Arnaldo Antunes]] participated in the protests. The Ministry of Culture was reinstated by the Temer government on 23 May 2016.<ref name="r"/>

It was dissolved by president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] in his first day of presidency.
