<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Neuroblastoma''' ('''NB''') is a type of [[cancer]] that forms in certain types of [[nerve tissue]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> It most frequently starts from one of the [[adrenal gland]]s but can also develop in the [[neck]], [[chest]], [[abdomen]], or [[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> Symptoms may include [[bone pain]], a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.<ref name=NCI2016Pt>{{cite web|title=Neuroblastoma Treatment|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/neuroblastoma/patient/neuroblastoma-treatment-pdq#section/all|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=9 November 2016|date=20 January 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110050003/https://www.cancer.gov/types/neuroblastoma/patient/neuroblastoma-treatment-pdq#section/all|archive-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Typically, neuroblastoma occurs due to a [[genetic mutation]] occurring [[Development of the human body|during early development]].<ref name="Lancet2007" /> Rarely, it may be due to a mutation [[heredity|inherited from a person's parents]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> Environmental factors have not been found to be involved.<ref name=NCI2016Pro/> Diagnosis is based on a [[tissue biopsy]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> Occasionally, it may be found in a baby by [[ultrasound]] during [[pregnancy]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> At diagnosis, the cancer has usually already [[Metastasis|spread]].<ref name=NCI2016Pt/> The cancer is divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on a child's age, [[cancer stage]], and what the cancer looks like.<ref name=NCI2016Pt/>

<!-- Treatment and prognosis -->

==Signs and symptoms==
The first [[symptom]]s of neuroblastoma are often vague, making diagnosis difficult. [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]], [[loss of appetite]], [[fever]], and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Childrenscancers/Typesofchildrenscancers/Neuroblastoma.aspx |title=Neuroblastoma in children |date=January 1, 2013 |first=Kate |last=Wheeler |publisher=Macmillan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005221946/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Childrenscancers/Typesofchildrenscancers/Neuroblastoma.aspx |archive-date=October 5, 2015 }}</ref>

* In the [[abdomen]], a tumor may cause a [[swollen belly]] and [[constipation]].
* A tumor in the [[chest]] may cause [[breathing problems]].
* A tumor pressing on the [[spinal cord]] may cause [[weakness]], thus an inability to stand, crawl, or walk.
* Bone lesions in the legs and hips may cause pain and limping.
* A tumor in the bones around the eyes or [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] may cause distinct bruising and swelling.
* Infiltration of the bone marrow may cause [[pallor]] from [[anemia]].

Neuroblastoma often spreads to other parts of the body before any symptoms are apparent, and 50 to 60% of all neuroblastoma cases present with [[metastasis|metastases]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch285/ch285b.html |title=Neuroblastoma: Pediatric Cancers: Merck Manual Professional |access-date=2008-01-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218193442/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch285/ch285b.html |archive-date=2007-12-18 }}</ref>

The most common location for neuroblastoma to originate (i.e., the primary tumor) is in the adrenal glands.  This occurs in 40% of localized tumors and in 60% of cases of widespread disease. Neuroblastoma can also develop anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system chain from the neck to the pelvis.  Frequencies in different locations include: neck (1%), chest (19%), abdomen (30% nonadrenal), or pelvis (1%). In rare cases, no primary tumor can be discerned.<ref name="pmid17943963">{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman GK, Castleberry RP | title = Changing trends of research and treatment in infant neuroblastoma | journal = Pediatric Blood & Cancer | volume = 49 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 1060–5 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17943963 | doi = 10.1002/pbc.21354 }}</ref>

Rare but characteristic presentations include transverse [[myelopathy]] (tumor spinal cord compression, 5% of cases), treatment-resistant diarrhea (tumor [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] secretion, 4% of cases), [[Horner's syndrome]] (cervical tumor, 2.4% of cases), [[opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome]]<ref name="pmid19430769">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothenberg AB, Berdon WE, D'Angio GJ, Yamashiro DJ, Cowles RA | title = The association between neuroblastoma and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome: a historical review | journal = Pediatric Radiology | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 723–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19430769 | doi = 10.1007/s00247-009-1282-x | s2cid = 24523263 }}</ref> and [[ataxia]] (suspected [[paraneoplastic]] cause, 1.3% of cases), and [[hypertension]] ([[catecholamine]] secretion or kidney artery compression, 1.3% of cases).<ref>{{cite book |last=Cheung |first=Nai-Kong |title=Neuroblastoma |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=66–7 |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-40841-3 }}</ref>

==Cause==
The cause of neuroblastoma is not well understood. The great majority of cases are sporadic and nonfamilial. About 1–2% of cases run in families and have been linked to specific gene mutations.  Familial neuroblastoma in some cases is caused by rare germline mutations in the [[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]] (''ALK'') gene.<ref name="pmid18724359">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mossé YP, Laudenslager M, Longo L, Cole KA, Wood A, Attiyeh EF, Laquaglia MJ, Sennett R, Lynch JE, Perri P, Laureys G, Speleman F, Kim C, Hou C, Hakonarson H, Torkamani A, Schork NJ, Brodeur GM, Tonini GP, Rappaport E, Devoto M, Maris JM | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of ALK as a major familial neuroblastoma predisposition gene | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7215 | pages = 930–5 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18724359 | pmc = 2672043 | doi = 10.1038/nature07261 | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..930M }}</ref> Germline mutations in the ''[[PHOX2B]] ''or ''[[KIF1B]]'' gene have been implicated in familial neuroblastoma, as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of [[neurofibromatosis type 1]] and the [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]].

''[[MYCN]]'' [[oncogene]] amplification within the tumor is a common finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of amplification shows a bimodal distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brodeur GM, Seeger RC, Schwab M, Varmus HE, Bishop JM | title = Amplification of N-myc in untreated human neuroblastomas correlates with advanced disease stage | journal = Science | volume = 224 | issue = 4653 | pages = 1121–4 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6719137 | doi = 10.1126/science.6719137 | bibcode = 1984Sci...224.1121B }}</ref>

Several risk factors have been proposed and are the subject of ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset, many studies have focused on parental factors around [[fertilisation|conception]] and during [[gestation]]. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy, and birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olshan |first1=Andrew F |last2=Bunin |first2=Greta R. | name-list-style = vanc |year=2000 |chapter=Epidemiology of Neuroblastoma |editor1-last=Brodeur |editor1-first=Garrett M. |editor2-first=Tadashi |editor2-last=Sawada |editor3-first=Yoshiaki |editor3-last=Tsuchida |editor4-first=P.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Neuroblastoma mets.JPG|thumb|MRI showing orbital and skull vault metastatic NB in 2-year-old]]
The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a [[anatomical pathology|surgical pathologist]], taking into account the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any [[neural crest]] element of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS).

[[Esthesioneuroblastoma]], also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the [[olfactory epithelium]] and its classification remains controversial. However, since it is not a sympathetic nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is not to be confused with neuroblastoma.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|278047|Esthesioneuroblastoma}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cheung |first=Nai-Kong |title=Neuroblastoma |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |page=73 |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-40841-3 }}</ref>

===Biochemistry===
In about 90% of cases of neuroblastoma, elevated levels of [[catecholamines]] or their metabolites are found in the urine or blood. Catecholamines and their metabolites include [[dopamine]], [[homovanillic acid]] (HVA), and/or [[vanillylmandelic acid]] (VMA).<ref name="pmid16732582">{{cite journal | vauthors = Strenger V, Kerbl R, Dornbusch HJ, Ladenstein R, Ambros PF, Ambros IM, Urban C | title = Diagnostic and prognostic impact of urinary catecholamines in neuroblastoma patients | journal = Pediatric Blood & Cancer | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 504–9 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 16732582 | doi = 10.1002/pbc.20888 }}</ref>

===Imaging===
Another way to detect neuroblastoma is the [[mIBG|meta-iodobenzylguanidine]] scan, which is taken up by 90 to 95% of all neuroblastomas, often termed "mIBG-avid".<ref name="pmid17544628"/> The mechanism is that mIBG is taken up by sympathetic neurons, and is a functioning analog of the neurotransmitter [[norepinephrine]]. When it is radio-iodinated with [[I-131]] or I-123 (radioactive iodine [[isotopes]]), it is a very good [[radiopharmaceutical]] for diagnosis and monitoring of response to treatment for this disease. With a [[half-life]] of 13 hours, I-123 is the preferred isotope for imaging sensitivity and quality. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days and at higher doses is an effective therapy as targeted radiation against relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma.<ref name="pmid15653652">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pashankar FD, O'Dorisio MS, Menda Y | title = MIBG and somatostatin receptor analogs in children: current concepts on diagnostic and therapeutic use | journal = Journal of Nuclear Medicine | volume = 46 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 55S–61S | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15653652 | url = http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15653652 }}</ref> As mIBG is not always taken up by neuroblastomas, researchers have explored in children with neuroblastoma whether another type of nuclear imaging, fluoro-deoxy-glucose - positron emission tomography, often termed "F-FDG-PET", might be useful.<ref name=Blee2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bleeker G, Tytgat GA, Adam JA, Caron HN, Kremer LC, Hooft L, van Dalen EC | title = 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and 18F-FDG-PET imaging for diagnosing neuroblastoma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD009263 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26417712 | pmc = 4621955 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd009263.pub2 }}</ref> Evidence suggests that this might be advisable to use in children with neuroblastoma for which mIBG does not work, but more research is needed in this area.<ref name=Blee2015/>

===Histology===
[[File:Neuroblastoma.jpg|thumb|Microscopic view of stroma-rich ganglioneuroblastoma]]
On microscopy, the tumor cells are typically described as small, round and blue, and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] patterns ([[Homer Wright pseudorosettes]]) may be seen. Homer Wright pseudorosettes are tumor cells around the [[neuropil]], not to be confused with a true rosettes, which are tumor cells around an empty lumen.<ref>{{cite book |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1455726134 |edition=9}}</ref> They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two).<ref>{{EMedicine|article|277621|Ependymoma}}</ref> A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[lymphoma]] and [[Wilms' tumor]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter RL, al-Sams SZ, Corbett RP, Clinton S | title = A comparative study of immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase, protein gene product 9.5 and S-100 protein in neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and other round cell tumours in children | journal = Histopathology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 461–7 | date = May 1990 | pmid = 2163356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1990.tb01545.x }}</ref>

Neuroblastoma is one of the peripheral neuroblastic [[tumors]] (pNTs) that have similar origins and show a wide pattern of differentiation ranging from [[benign]] [[ganglioneuroma]] to [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]-rich [[ganglioneuroblastoma]] with neuroblastic cells intermixed or in nodules, to highly malignant neuroblastoma. This distinction in the pre-treatment tumor pathology is an important prognostic factor, along with age and [[mitosis]]-[[karyorrhexis]] index (MKI). This pathology classification system (the Shimada system) describes "favorable" and "unfavorable" tumors by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee (INPC) which was established in 1999 and revised in 2003.<ref name="pmid14601099">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peuchmaur M, d'Amore ES, Joshi VV, Hata J, Roald B, Dehner LP, Gerbing RB, Stram DO, Lukens JN, Matthay KK, Shimada H | display-authors = 6 | title = Revision of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification: confirmation of favorable and unfavorable prognostic subsets in ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular | journal = Cancer | volume = 98 | issue = 10 | pages = 2274–81 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14601099 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.11773 | s2cid = 27081822 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03500f75a146ff420becfd3492bd1a8edee8e460 }}</ref>

*Stage 1: Localized tumor confined to the area of origin.
*Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with incomplete gross resection; identifiable ipsilateral and contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.
*Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with complete or incomplete gross resection; with ipsilateral lymph node positive for tumor; identifiable contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.
*Stage 3: Tumor infiltrating across midline with or without regional lymph node involvement; or unilateral tumor with contralateral lymph node involvement; or midline tumor with bilateral lymph node involvement.
*Stage 4: Dissemination of tumor to distant lymph nodes, bone marrow, bone, liver, or other organs except as defined by Stage 4S.
*Stage 4S: Age <1 year old with localized primary tumor as defined in Stage 1 or 2, with dissemination limited to liver, skin, or bone marrow (less than 10 percent of nucleated bone marrow cells are tumors).

Although international agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, the need for an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 people with neuroblastoma treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-''myc'' (also commonly referred to as [[MYCN]]) amplification to intermediate risk category.<ref name="pmid16116154">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt ML, Lal A, Seeger RC, Maris JM, Shimada H, O'Leary M, Gerbing RB, Matthay KK | display-authors = 6 | title = Favorable prognosis for patients 12 to 18 months of age with stage 4 nonamplified MYCN neuroblastoma: a Children's Cancer Group Study | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 27 | pages = 6474–80 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16116154 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.183 }}</ref>

The new INRG risk assignment will classify neuroblastoma at diagnosis based on a new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS):

*Stage L1: Localized disease without image-defined risk factors.
*Stage L2: Localized disease with image-defined risk factors.
*Stage M: Metastatic disease.
*Stage MS: Metastatic disease "special" where MS is equivalent to stage 4S.

The new risk stratification will be based on the new INRGSS staging system, age (dichotomized at 18 months), tumor grade, [[N-myc]] amplification, unbalanced 11q aberration, and [[ploidy]] into four pre-treatment risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high risk.<ref name=Lancet2007/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohn SL, London WB, Monclair T, Matthay KK, Ambros PF, Pearson AD |year=2007 |title=Update on the development of the international neuroblastoma risk group (INRG) classification schema |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=25 |issue=18 Suppl |pages=9503 |doi=10.1200/jco.2007.25.18_suppl.9503 |url=http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/18_suppl/9503 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110164845/http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/18_suppl/9503 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-10 }}

With current treatments, people with low and intermediate risk disease have an excellent prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk.

Chemotherapy agents used in combination have been found to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds ([[cisplatin]], [[carboplatin]]), alkylating agents ([[cyclophosphamide]], [[ifosfamide]], [[melphalan]]), [[topoisomerase]] II inhibitor ([[etoposide]]), [[anthracycline]] antibiotics ([[doxorubicin]]) and vinca [[alkaloids]] ([[vincristine]]). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors ([[topotecan]] and [[irinotecan]]) in induction which have been found to be effective against recurrent disease.

*Tumors presenting exclusively with whole chromosome copy number changes were associated with excellent survival.
*Tumors presenting with any kind of segmental chromosome copy number changes were associated with a high risk of relapse.
*Within tumors showing segmental alterations, additional independent predictors of decreased overall survival were [[N-myc]] amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain.

*Subtype 1: favorable neuroblastoma with near triploidy and a predominance of numerical gains and losses, mostly representing non-metastatic NB stages 1, 2 and 4S.

[[Virtual Karyotype|Virtual karyotyping]] can be performed on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci. SNP array virtual karyotyping is preferred for tumor samples, including neuroblastomas, because they can detect copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (acquired uniparental disomy).

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow.jpg|thumb|[[Rudolf Virchow]]: the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a "glioma"]]
In 1864 German physician [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a "glioma".  The characteristics of tumors from the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla were then noted in 1891 by German pathologist [[Felix Jacob Marchand|Felix Marchand]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Berthold |first2=Thorsten |last2=Simon | name-list-style = vanc |chapter=Clinical Presentation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4f-IkKNSKMC&pg=PA63 |pages=63–85 |editor1-first=Nai-Kong V. |editor1-last=Cheung |editor2-first=Susan L. |editor2-last=Cohn |year=2006 |title=Neuroblastoma |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-26616-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckwith JB, Perrin EV | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 43 | pages = 1089–104 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14099453 | pmc = 1949785 | title = In Situ Neuroblastomas: A Contribution to the Natural History of Neural Crest Tumors }}</ref> In 1901 the distinctive presentation of stage 4S in infants (liver but no bone metastases) was described by William Pepper.

===Legislative efforts===
[[U.S. Representative]] [[Chet Edwards]] of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], successfully introduced legislation to earmark $150 million toward a cure for neuroblastoma and other cancers. The measure was signed into law in July 2008 by [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997–2009) of [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], daughter of one of his constituents, [[Walter L. Buenger]], head of the history department at [[Texas A&M University]].<ref name=eagle>{{cite web|url=http://www.theeagle.com/editorial/Erin-Buenger-had-a-zest-for-living-life-fully|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110611084936/http://www.theeagle.com/editorial/Erin-Buenger-had-a-zest-for-living-life-fully|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2011|title=Erin Buenger had a zest for living life fully |date=April 12, 2009 |work=The Bryan College Station Eagle}}</ref>

===Treatments===
Recent focus has been to reduce therapy for low and intermediate risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curesearch.org/our_research/index_sub.aspx?id=1767 |title=Neuroblastoma Committee—Current Focus of Research |access-date=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925060348/http://www.curesearch.org/our_research/index_sub.aspx?id=1767 |archive-date=September 25, 2006 }}</ref> A study of 467 people that are at intermediate risk enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those people with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes as well as for those who lack early response to treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker DL, Schmidt ML, Cohn SL, Maris JM, London WB, Buxton A, Stram D, Castleberry RP, Shimada H, Sandler A, Shamberger RC, Look AT, Reynolds CP, Seeger RC, Matthay KK | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcome after reduced chemotherapy for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 14 | pages = 1313–23 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20879880 | pmc = 2993160 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1001527 | url = http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/18_suppl/9504 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130113023927/http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/18_suppl/9504 | archive-date = 2013-01-13 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20879880">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker DL, Schmidt ML, Cohn SL, Maris JM, London WB, Buxton A, Stram D, Castleberry RP, Shimada H, Sandler A, Shamberger RC, Look AT, Reynolds CP, Seeger RC, Matthay KK | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcome after reduced chemotherapy for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 14 | pages = 1313–23 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20879880 | pmc = 2993160 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1001527 }}</ref>

By contrast, focus the past 20 years or more has been to intensify treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma. Chemotherapy induction variations, timing of surgery, stem cell transplant regimens, various delivery schemes for radiation, and use of monoclonal antibodies and retinoids to treat minimal residual disease continue to be examined. Recent phase III [[clinical trials]] with randomization have been carried out to answer these questions to improve survival of high-risk disease:

===Refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma===
Chemotherapy with topotecan and cyclophosphamide is frequently used in refractory setting and after relapse.<ref name="MorgensternBaruchel2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morgenstern DA, Baruchel S, Irwin MS | title = Current and future strategies for relapsed neuroblastoma: challenges on the road to precision therapy | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–47 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23703550 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318299d637 | s2cid = 5529288 }}</ref>
