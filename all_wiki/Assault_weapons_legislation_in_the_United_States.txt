'''Assault weapons legislation in the United States''' refers to [[Bill (law)|bill]]s and [[Law of the United States|law]]s (active, expired, proposed or failed) that define and restrict or make illegal the manufacture, transfer, and possession of [[assault weapon]]s. How these firearms are defined and regulated varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] enacted in 1994 expired in 2004. Attempts to renew this ban have failed, as have attempts to pass a new ban, such as the [[Assault Weapons Ban of 2013]] (AWB 2013). Seven U.S. states have assault weapons bans: three were enacted before the 1994 federal ban and four more passed before the federal ban expired. The majority of states (43) have no assault weapons ban, although two, [[Minnesota]], have training and background check requirements for purchasers of assault weapons that are stricter than those for ordinary firearms. While there are no statewide assault weapon bans in [[Colorado]] and [[Illinois]], local bans exist in certain cities or counties in each of these states. In 2018, most Americans who were polled supported a ban on assault weapons.<ref name=politico20180228>{{cite news |title=Gun control support surges in polls |first=Steven |last=Shepard |date=February 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Politico]] |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/gun-control-polling-parkland-430099 |accessdate=March 19, 2018|quote=Seventy percent of voters support a ban on high-capacity magazines, and 68 percent want to ban assault-style weapons.}}</ref><ref name=npr20180302>{{cite news |title=NPR Poll: After Parkland, Number of Americans Who Want Gun Restrictions Grows |date=March 2, 2018 |first=Asma |last=Khalid |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589849342/npr-poll-after-parkland-number-of-americans-who-want-gun-restrictions-grows |accessdate=March 19, 2018 |agency=[[NPR]] |work=[[Morning Edition]] |quote=Eight-in-10 Americans told the pollsters they favor bans on assault weapons, high-capacity ammunition magazines and "bump stocks," an accessory used by the Las Vegas shooter that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon.}}</ref><ref name=qu20180220>{{cite news |date=February 20, 2018 |title=U.S. Support For Gun Control Tops 2-1, Highest Ever, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds |url=https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521 |agency=[[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |quote=Support for gun control on other questions is at its highest level since the Quinnipiac University Poll began focusing on this issue in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre: 67 - 29 percent for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons; 83 - 14 percent for a mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases.}}</ref>

The 1994 federal and 1989 state ban in California were prompted by the 1989 [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (Stockton)|Cleveland Elementary School shooting]] in Stockton, California. Existing and proposed weapon bans come under renewed interest in the wake of [[mass shooting]]s, most recently after the December 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in Newtown, Connecticut. In addition to state bans, [[Washington, D.C.]] and some U.S. counties and municipalities have assault weapons laws.

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly called the federal [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] (AWB and AWB 1994), was enacted in September 1994. The ban, including a ban on [[high-capacity magazine]]s, became defunct (expired) in September 2004 per a 10-year [[sunset provision]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===California===
{{See also|Gun laws in California}}
California restricts the possession, sale, transfer or import of defined assault weapons to those individuals who possess a Dangerous Weapons Permit issued by the California Department of Justice. In practice, very few Dangerous Weapons Permits are issued, and only under a very limited set of circumstances defined in state DOJ regulations.

====1989====

Since the Department of Justice generally does not give Dangerous Weapons Permits to ordinary citizens, the Roberti-Roos Act amounts to an effective ban on defined assault weapons in California. It also banned [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] that it classified as large capacity (those able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition).

The United States Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the Maryland ban in November 2017. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond had upheld the ban, stating that: "[A]ssault weapons and large-capacity magazines are not protected by the Second Amendment." Attorneys general in 21 states and the NRA had asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-wont-review-marylands-law-banning-sales-of-assault-weapons/2017/11/27/ad68ce42-d380-11e7-95bf-df7c19270879_story.html Washington Post-Robert Barnes-Supreme Court wonâ€™t review Marylandâ€™s law banning sales of â€˜assault weaponsâ€™-November 27, 2017]</ref>

Massachusetts law bans the sale, transfer, or possession of assault weapons not otherwise lawfully possessed on September 13, 1994. Massachusetts defines "assault weapon" by the definition of "semiautomatic assault weapon" in the federal assault weapons ban of 1994. That definition included:
*A list of firearms by name and copies of those firearms; 
*Semi-automatic rifles and pistols capable of accepting a detachable magazine and having at least two specified characteristics; and 
*Semi-automatic shotguns having at least two specified characteristics.<ref name="SGLAW-MA"/>

Although it is commonly referred to as an assault weapons ban, New Jersey's law actually uses the term "assault firearm" to define banned and regulated guns. Among the list of firearms identified as 'assault firearms' are the Colt AR-15, AK variants and all 'M1 Carbine Type' variants. Some New Jersey gun advocates have called its laws "draconian." Attorney Evan Nappen, author of several books on New Jersey gun laws, says the term is "misapplied and carries with it a pejorative meaning."<ref name=Record120721/>

===New York===
{{See also|Gun laws in New York}}
New York law bans the manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of an assault weapon in the state. It defines an "assault weapon" as:
*A semi-automatic rifle or pistol able to accept a detachable magazine and that has at least one from a list of characteristics; 
*A semi-automatic shotgun that has at least one from a list of characteristics; or
*A revolving cylinder shotgun.<ref name="SGLAW-NY"/>
In tandem with the assault weapons ban is a law that bans the manufacture, transport, disposal or possession of a "large capacity ammunition feeding device," defined as: "a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device that: 1) has a capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than ten rounds of ammunition; 2) contains more than seven rounds of ammunition; or 3) is obtained after January 15, 2013 and has a capacity of, or can be readily restored or converted to accept more than seven rounds of ammunition."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-new-york/ |title=Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines in New York |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 2, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173037/http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-in-new-york/ |archivedate=March 9, 2014 }}</ref>

In January 2016 the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association sued and a Federal Judge ruled that "the seven round limit is arbitrary and unenforceable," because of this, the limit in NY is now 10 rounds.

==Local assault weapons bans==
Some local governments have laws that ban or restrict the possession of assault weapons.
