==Early life==

After reading playwright [[Moss Hart]]'s autobiography ''[[Act One (book)|Act One]]'' at the age of twelve, Meyers became interested in theater and started to act in local stage productions. Her interest in screenwriting did not emerge until she saw [[Mike Nichols]]' film ''[[The Graduate]]'' in 1967.<ref name="tdt"/> Meyers attended [[Lower Merion High School]] in [[Lower Merion, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=TCMdb-Meyers-Entry>{{cite web|title=Nancy Meyers|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/130761&#124;0/Nancy-Meyers/|website=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCMDb]]|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> In 1970, Meyers graduated from [[American University]] with a degree in journalism.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.american.edu/alumni/news/bristol-baughan.cfm|title = Filmmaker Baughan '03 Gets Green Light from DreamWorks Pictures|last = Patterson|first = Sonja|date = July 6, 2010|accessdate = August 8, 2019|website = [[American University]]|quote =  A friend that worked at Sony Entertainment introduced me to director Nancy Meyers, SOC/BA ’70, and I worked as her assistant for six months.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://jwa.org/people/meyers-nancy|title = Nancy Meyers|accessdate = August 8, 2019|website = [[Jewish Women's Archive]]}}</ref>

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Meyers spent a year working in [[public television]] in Philadelphia. When she was 22 years old, Meyers moved to Los Angeles, living with her sister, Sally, in the [[Coldwater Canyon]] area.<ref name="tdt"/> She quickly got a job as a Production Assistant on the [[CBS]] game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]].''<ref name=Vulture-Intern-InConversation-2015 /><ref name="tnyt"/>

Inspired by the popular TV show, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]],'' Meyers decided she wanted to write. She eventually got work as a story editor where she read scripts, wrote coverage, and worked with screenwriters on projects that the producers were developing. One of the companies she worked at was producer [[Ray Stark]]'s company, [[Rastar]].<ref name=TCMdb-Meyers-Entry /> She worked her way up from there to writing her own scripts.<ref name=Vulture-Intern-InConversation-2015 /> Two years after coming to Los Angeles, Meyers was able to quit her job to focus on a career in screenwriting and took film-making classes where she connected with directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref name="tdt"/> To support herself, she started a small [[cheesecake]] business after seeing the reactions to a cake she made for a dinner party.<ref name="tnyt"/> She was eventually hired as a [[story editor]] by film producer [[Ray Stark]], who later fired her after she objected to the fact that two writers were each working on the same script without the other knowing.<ref name="tnyt"/>

===1980s===
In the late 1970s, Meyers started work with [[Charles Shyer]] when she was a story editor in the film division at [[Motown]]. The pair became friends and, along with Harvey Miller, created the script for the comedy ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'' (1980) together, a film about a spoiled young woman who joins the U.S. Army after her husband dies on their wedding night during sex.<ref name="tnyt"/> Starring actress [[Goldie Hawn]], who along with Meyers and Shyer executive produced the project, it was Hawn's agent who made [[Warner Brothers]] executive [[Robert Shapiro (film producer)|Robert Shapiro]] buy the script after practically "everybody [had] turned it down. Everybody. More than once," according to Meyers.<ref name="tnyt"/> Meyers described how hard it was to get the film made, noting, "Every single studio in Hollywood read it and passed on it... One studio called Goldie and said 'if you make this movie it’s a career ender.'”<ref>{{cite web

It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-ubK7kpi6M Ordinary People and Melvin and Howard Win Writing Awards: 1981 Oscars]</ref> as were Hawn and her co-star, [[Eileen Brennan]], for their performances,<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1981 1981|Oscars.org]</ref> and won the team a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for [[Best Original Screenplay]].<ref name="tnyt"/> In addition, the film spawned a same-titled short-lived but [[Golden Globe]]-winning television series that aired from 1981 until 1983.<ref>{{cite web|last=IMDB|first=Staff|title=''Private Benjamin'' (1981)|url=http://www.imdb.de/title/tt0081918/|accessdate=February 12, 2008}}</ref>

Meyers and Shyer's next project, ''[[Irreconcilable Differences]]'' (1984), marked Shyer's directorial debut. [[Shelley Long]] and [[Ryan O'Neal]] played a Hollywood couple whose obsession with success destroys their relationship with their daughter, played by eight-year-old [[Drew Barrymore]]. Released to a mixed reception by critics, the collaboration became a moderate box office with a gross of $12.4 million,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The-Numbers.com]]|title=''Irreconcilable Differences'' (1984)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1984/0IRDI.php|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> but received multiple Golden Globe nominations, including Best Actress nods for Long and Barrymore.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Internet Movie Database|title=Awards for ''Irreconcilable Differences'' (1984)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087482/awards|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> Also in 1984, Meyers, Shyer and Miller penned ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'', another comedy starring Goldie Hawn, in which she portrayed a cocktail waitress who prevents the assassination of a visiting Arab Emir, and thus is offered a job with the [[United States Department of State]] as a protocol official.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[IMDb]]|title=''Protocol'' (1984)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087951/|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> Hawn reportedly disliked their screenplay and hired [[Buck Henry]] for a major overhaul, prompting the trio to go into arbitration to settle their differences.<ref name="ss"/> While neither Meyers nor Shyer became involved in producing or directing the film, it fared slightly better at the box office than '' Irreconcilable Differences'', garnering $26.3 million in total.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The-Numbers.com|title=''Protocol'' (1984)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1984/0PTCL.php|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref>

Meyers eventually returned to producing with ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]'' (1987), a film about a New York City female executive, who out of the blue becomes the guardian of her distant cousin's 14-month-old daughter. The film marked her debut collaboration with [[Diane Keaton]]. The catalyst for the project was a series of situations that Meyers and Shyer and their friends had experienced while managing a life with a successful career and a growing family.<ref name="ss">{{cite web|first=Candice|last=Russell|title=Bringing Up ''Baby Boom''|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-08/features/8702040515_1_baby-boom-nancy-meyers-meyers-and-shyer/|date=November 8, 1987|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> ''Baby Boom'' was favorably received by critics and audiences alike.

===1990s===
In 1990, Meyers and Shyer, working from earlier material for the first time, re-teamed with Keaton to remake the 1950 [[Vincente Minnelli]] film ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]''. Starring [[Steve Martin]] as a father losing his daughter and his bank account at the same time, [[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|their 1991 version]] was released to generally positive reception.

Also in 1991, Meyers contributed to the script for the ensemble comedy ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992), directed by [[Eugene Levy]], and became one out of several [[script doctor]]s consulted to work on the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] comedy ''[[Sister Act]]'' (1992).<ref>{{cite web|first=Jess|last=Cagle|title=The Prayer|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310617,00.html| date=May 29, 1992 |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Her next project with Shyer was ''[[I Love Trouble (1994 film)|I Love Trouble]]'' (1994), a comedy thriller about a cub reporter and a seasoned columnist who go after the same story, that was inspired by [[screwball comedies]] of the 1930s and 1940s such as ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' and ''[[Woman of the Year]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Julia and Nick look for trouble|first=Peter|last=Sorel|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=Herald-Journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_LYeAAAAIBAJ&pg=2964,1448426&dq=i-love-trouble+meyers&hl=en|date=June 5, 1994|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Written for and starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Nick Nolte]], the film was not well received by critics but grossed over $30 million in box-office receipts in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=''I Love Trouble'' (1994) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_love_trouble/|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The-Numbers.com |title=''I Love Trouble'' (1994)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0ILTR.php|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> While the script for ''Toast of the Town'', another Meyers/Shyer collaboration, that Meyers described as "a [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era comedy about a small-town girl who comes to the big city, loses her values and then finds them again," found no buyers, another project called ''Love Crazy'' failed to materialize after lead actor [[Hugh Grant]] dropped out of the project after months of negotiations.<ref>{{cite news| first= Andy| last= Marx| title= Sequelitis| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-02/entertainment/ca-2076_1_steve-martin|date=February 2, 1992|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ew1">{{cite web|first=Rebecca|last=Ascher-Walsh| title= Lady and the Chump| work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20279475,00.html| date=December 8, 2000 |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

Having turned down [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] CEO [[Sherry Lansing]]'s offer to direct the 1996 comedy blockbuster ''[[The First Wives Club]]'',<ref name="tnyt"/> Meyers eventually agreed on making her directorial debut with ''[[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1998), following the signing of a development deal with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 1997.<ref name="dga">{{cite web| first= Amy| last= Dawes| title= Head of the Table| work= DGA Quarterly| url= http://www.dgaquarterly.org/BACKISSUES/Spring2009/DGAInterviewNancyMeyers.aspx| date= April 1, 2009| accessdate= February 2, 2010| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100216225605/http://www.dgaquarterly.org/BACKISSUES/Spring2009/DGAInterviewNancyMeyers.aspx| archivedate= February 16, 2010| df= mdy-all}}</ref> A remake of [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|the same-titled 1961 original]] based on [[Erich Kästner]]'s novel ''[[Lottie and Lisa]]'', it starred [[Lindsay Lohan]] in her motion picture debut, in a dual role of estranged twin sisters who try to reunite their long-divorced parents, played by [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]].<ref name="dga"/> Lohan's casting as twins forced Meyers to shoot the film in [[motion control]], a requirement she considered rather complicated. "I really didn't know how to do it," she said. "We had a prep day to go over the process, and by the end of the day I had a little better understanding. But I approached the movie like it wasn't an effects film; I just tried to make it authentic."<ref name="dga"/> Released to positive reviews from critics, ''The Parent Trap'' brought in $92 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title= ''The Parent Trap'' (1998) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=parenttrap98.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 1998, following the success of ''The Parent Trap'' and her separation from Shyer, Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] chairman Joe Roth asked Meyers to reconstruct an original script named ''Head Games'' about a man who gains the power to hear everything women are thinking, an idea originally conceived by ''[[The King of Queens]]''  producers Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith.<ref name="ew1"/> Subsequently, Meyers penned two drafts of the script before agreeing to direct, but as Roth left the studio in January 1999, Disney dismissed the film and the project eventually went to Paramount.<ref name="tnyt9">{{cite news|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|title=Out on Her Own Now, and Feeling Liberated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/movies/film-out-on-her-own-now-and-feeling-liberated.html?pagewanted=1|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 10, 2000|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> By the following year, [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Helen Hunt]] had signed on to star in leading roles and the project had been retitled ''[[What Women Want]]''.<ref name="tnyt9"/> Released in 2000 to mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nancy|last=Griffin|title=Diane Keaton Meets Both Her Matches|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/movies/film-diane-keaton-meets-both-her-matches.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 14, 2003|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|title=No Complications For Meyers|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/01/01/nothing_complicated_about_director_meyerss_attention_to_detail/|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref>

Following her divorce, Meyers wrote and directed the post-divorce comedy ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' (2003), starring [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] as a successful 60-something and 50-something, who find love for each other at a different time of life, despite being complete opposites. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 63 and 57 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy, and [[20th Century Fox]], the film's original distributor, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. As a result, the film ended up as a co-production between [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. While critical reaction to the film as a whole was more measured,<ref name="one">{{cite web|title=''Something's Gotta Give''|work=Rottentomatoes|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/somethings_gotta_give/|accessdate=February 17, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503040155/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/somethings_gotta_give/|archivedate=May 3, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Something's Gotta Give'' received generally favorable notice and became a surprise box-office hit following its North American release, eventually grossing US$266,600,000 worldwide, mostly from its international run.<ref name="two">{{cite web|title=''Something's Gotta Give'' @ Numbers|work=The-Numbers.com|url=https://the-numbers.com/movies/2003/SGGIV.php/|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> In 2005, her Waverly Films production company signed a deal with Sony.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fritz|first=Ben|last2=Fritz|first2=Ben|date=2005-11-07|title=Sony rockin’ with Meyers|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/sony-rockin-with-meyers-1117932475/|access-date=2020-10-18|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref>

Meyer's next film was ''[[The Holiday]]'' (2006), a romantic comedy starring [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as two lovelorn women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who arranges a [[home exchange]] to escape heartbreak during the [[Christmas and holiday season]]. [[Jude Law]] and [[Jack Black]] co-starred as their [[love interest]]s. Released to mixed reviews from critics, the film became a global box office success, grossing $205 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Holiday'' (2006)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/HOLID.php |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2009}}</ref> The film won the [[Teen Choice Awards|2007 Teen Choice Award]] in the Chick Flick category.<ref name="awards">{{cite web | title=Awards for ''The Holiday'' | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457939/awards | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>
