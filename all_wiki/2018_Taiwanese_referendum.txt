A multi-question referendum was held in [[Taiwan]] on 24 November 2018 alongside [[2018 Taiwanese local elections|local elections]]. The referendum was the first since the December 2017 reform to the Referendum Act, which reduced the threshold for submitting questions to the ballot; under the new system, signatures from 1.5 percent of the electorate (around 280,000 people) were required to successfully put a question on the ballot, reduced from 5 percent previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3549016|title=Taiwan to hold 7 referendums during Nov. local elections|date=10 October 2018|work=[[Taiwan News]]}}</ref>

A total of ten questions appeared on the ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/10/25/2003702997|title=ELECTIONS: CEC raises incentives for poll monitors, volunteers|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=25 October 2018}}</ref> Under Taiwanese law, for their initiative to be presented to the voters, a total of 280,000 signatures (1.5% of eligible voters) were required for a question to be considered by the [[Central Election Commission (Taiwan)|Central Election Commission]] (CEC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201802090038.aspx|title=Group proposes referendum for special law for same-sex couples|work=[[Focus Taiwan News Channel]]|date=9 February 2018}}</ref>  Five of the questions reviewed and approved by the CEC were about [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|LGBT rights]], [[LGBT sex education]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]]. Four other questions on the ballot concerned [[Chinese Taipei|international games representation]], [[nuclear power in Taiwan|nuclear power]], [[Fossil fuel power station|coal power]] and a ban on imports of agricultural products and food from areas affected by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201810090026.aspx|title=CEC approves 7 referendums alongside local elections|date=9 October 2018|work=[[Focus Taiwan]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201810160023.aspx|title=CEC approves 2 more referendum proposals, making 9 in total|work=[[Focus Taiwan]]|date=16 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/10/24/momentum-builds-for-nuclear-power-with-referendum-approved-in-taiwan-and-pride-fest-in-germany/#27e646fb7584|title=Momentum Builds For Nuclear Power With Referendum Approved In Taiwan And "Pride Fest" in Germany|work=[[Forbes]]|date=24 October 2018}}</ref> The tenth question asked voters to reject Article 95-1 of the Electricity Act, which stipulated that all of the country's [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power generating facilities]] should be decommissioned by 2025.<ref name=Hight>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/10/24/2003702941|title=CEC passes referendum on nuclear-free homeland|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=24 October 2018}}</ref> This question had originally been rejected by the CEC, though the commission reversed its decision after being ordered by the Taipei High Administrative Court to accept an additional 24,000 signatures added to the petition.<ref name=Hight/>

For a proposal to be approved, at least 25 percent of the eligible voters had to vote in favour of the question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/12/13/2003683881|title=Referendum Act amendments approved|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=13 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0020050|title=Art. 29 of the Referendum Act|work=Laws & Regulations Database of the Republic of China}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage proposals===
In February 2018, a Taiwanese [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] group opposed to same-sex marriage (the Alliance for Next Generation's Happiness) proposed holding a referendum on the issue, aiming to overturn a May 2017 ruling by the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] that mandated the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Taiwan within two years. The Central Election Commission reviewed and accepted the group's proposals in April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201804180011.aspx|title=CEC passes review of same-sex marriage referendum proposals|work=[[Focus Taiwan]]|date=18 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://newbloommag.net/2018/04/18/anti-gay-referendum-threshold/|title=Referendum Against Gay Marriage Reaches Necessary Threshold|date=18 April 2018|work=newbloommag.net}}</ref> Two of their approved questions were related to [[same-sex marriage]]; one on whether marriage should be limited to a bond between a man and a woman and one on whether there should be a special law to protect same-sex couples' right to a "permanent union" (effectively introducing [[civil unions]]). A third question will ask voters whether to prevent the implementation of laws mandating the inclusion of information about homosexuality in sexual education classes at schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/10/taiwan-to-hold-gay-marriage-referendum.html|title=Taiwan to hold same-sex marriage referendum|work=News Hub|date=9 October 2018|access-date=12 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013014459/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/10/taiwan-to-hold-gay-marriage-referendum.html|archive-date=13 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/taiwan-referendum-special-law-same-sex-marriage-lgbt-10807084|title=Taiwan to hold public vote on special law for same-sex marriage|work=Channel News Asia|date=9 October 2018}}</ref>
 
In September 2018, a group in favor of same-sex marriage announced that it had collected enough signatures to submit its own questions to a referendum. The group's questions would require the legislature to amend the Civil Code to expressly allow same-sex couples to marry and also mandated the inclusion of [[gender diversity]] in [[sex education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3519385|title=With 9,000 signatures per day, Taiwan petition for marriage equality passes referendum threshold|date=1 September 2018|work=Taiwan News}}</ref>
