The '''Ten Commandments''' ({{lang-he-n|עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת}}, Aseret ha'Dibrot; {{lang-ar|وصايا عشر}}), also known as the '''Decalogue''', are a set of [[biblical]] principles relating to [[ethics]] and [[worship]]. These are fundamental to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity. The text of the Ten Commandments appears twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]]: at [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:2-17|HE}} and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|5:6-17|HE}}.

Modern scholarship has found likely influences in [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Mesopotamian]] laws and treaties. Scholars disagree about when the Ten Commandments were recorded and by whom.

==Terminology==

In [[Biblical Hebrew]], the Ten Commandments, called {{Hebrew|עשרת הדיברות}} ([[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dibrot}}), are mentioned at [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|34:28|HE}}.<ref name="ex34-28" /> and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|10:4|HE}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://studybible.info/compare/Deuteronomy%2010:4 |title=Deuteronomy 10:4 – multiple versions and languages |publisher=Studybible.info |accessdate=9 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021123919/http://studybible.info/compare/Deuteronomy%2010:4 |archive-date=21 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In both sources, the terms are translatable as "the ten words", "the ten sayings", or "the ten matters".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WUzUAdWRVUC&pg=PA3|title=The Ten Commandments: Ethics for the Twenty-First Century|first=Mark|last=Rooker|year=2010|publisher=B&H Publishing Group|location=Nashville, Tennessee|page=3|isbn=978-0-8054-4716-3|accessdate=2 October 2011|quote=The Ten Commandments are literally the 'Ten Words' (''ăśeret hadděbārîm'') in Hebrew. In [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic Hebrew]], they are called {{Hebrew|עשרת הדברות}} (transliterated {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dibrot}}). The use of the term ''dābār'', 'word,' in this phrase distinguishes these laws from the rest of the commandments (''mişwâ''), statutes (''hōq''), and regulations (''mišpāţ'') in the Old Testament.}}</ref>

In the [[Septuagint]] (or LXX), the  "ten words" was translated as "Decalogue", which is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δεκάλογος}}, ''dekalogos'', the latter meaning and referring<ref name="LSJ_Dekalogos">{{LSJ|deka/logos|δεκάλογος|ref}}</ref> to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] translation (in [[Accusative case|accusative]]) {{lang|grc|δέκα λόγους}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|deka logous}}. This term is also sometimes used in English, in addition to Ten Commandments. The [[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale]] and [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale]] English biblical translations used "ten verses". The [[Geneva Bible]] used "tenne commandements", which was followed by the [[Bishops' Bible]] and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (the "King James" version) as "ten commandments". Most major English versions use the word "commandments".<ref name="ex34-28">{{cite web |url=http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2034:28 |title=Exodus 34:28 – multiple versions and languages |publisher=Studybible.info |accessdate=9 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011335/http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2034:28 |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The stone tablets, as opposed to the commandments inscribed on them, are called {{Hebrew|לוחות הברית}}, ''Lukhot HaBrit'', meaning "the tablets of the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]".

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:The Giving of the Law.jpg|thumb|260 px|1896 illustration depicting Moses receiving the commandments]]
The biblical narrative of the revelation at Sinai begins in {{Bibleref|Exodus|19}} after the arrival of the children of Israel at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] (also called [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]]). On the morning of the third day of their encampment, "there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud", and the people assembled at the base of the mount. After "the {{LORD}}<ref>When {{LORD}} is printed in small caps, it typically represents the so-called ''[[Tetragrammaton]]'', a Greek term representing the four Hebrews YHWH which indicates the divine name. This is typically indicated in the preface of most modern translations. For an example, see {{citation|author=Crossway Bibles|title=Holy Bible: English Standard Version|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co2PZwEACAAJ|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 December 2011|publisher=Crossway|location=Wheaton|isbn=978-1-4335-3087-6|page=IX|chapter=Preface|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612030255/http://books.google.com/books?id=co2PZwEACAAJ|archive-date=12 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> came down upon mount Sinai", [[Moses]] went up briefly and returned with stone tablets and prepared the people, and then in {{Bibleref|Exodus|20}} "God spoke" to all the people the words of the covenant, that is, the "ten commandments"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy.4:13;5:22||9|Deuteronomy 4:13, 5:22}}</ref> as it is written.  Modern biblical scholarship differs as to whether {{Bibleref|Exodus|19-20}} describes the people of Israel as having directly heard all or some of the decalogue, or whether the laws are only passed to them through Moses.<ref>Somer, Benjamin D. ''Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and Tradition'' (The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library). pg = 40.</ref>

The people were afraid to hear more and moved "afar off", and Moses responded with "Fear not." Nevertheless, he drew near the "thick darkness" where "the presence of the Lord" was<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|20:21|}}</ref> to hear the additional statutes and "judgments",<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|21–23|9|Exodus 21–23}}</ref> all which he "wrote"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:4|9}}</ref> in the "[[Covenant Code|book of the covenant]]"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:7|9}}</ref> which he read to the people the next morning, and they agreed to be obedient and do all that the {{LORD}} had said. Moses escorted a select group consisting of [[Aaron]], [[Nadab and Abihu]], and "seventy of the elders of Israel" to a location on the mount where they worshipped "afar off"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1,9|9}}</ref> and they "saw the God of Israel" above a "paved work" like clear sapphire stone.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1–11|9}}</ref>

{{quote|1=And the {{LORD}} said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tablets of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. <sup>13</sup> And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.|2=First mention of the tablets in {{bibleref2|Exodus|24:12–13}}}}

The mount was covered by the cloud for six days, and on the seventh day Moses went into the midst of the cloud and was "in the mount [[forty days and forty nights]]."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:16–18|9}}</ref> And Moses said, "the {{LORD}} delivered unto me two tablets of stone written with the [[finger of God]]; and on them was written according to all the words, which the {{LORD}} spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}</ref> Before the full forty days expired, the children of Israel collectively decided that something had happened to Moses, and compelled Aaron to fashion a [[golden calf]], and he "built an altar before it"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:1–5|9|Ex. 32:1–5}}</ref> and the people "worshipped" the calf.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:6–8|9|Ex. 32:6–8}}</ref>

After the full forty days, Moses and Joshua came down from the mountain with the [[Tablets of Stone|tablets of stone]]: "And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:19|9|Ex.32:19}}</ref> After the events in chapters 32 and 33, the {{LORD}} told Moses, "Hew thee two tablets of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tablets the words that were in the first tablets, which thou brakest."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|34:1|9|Ex. 34:1}}</ref> "And he wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the {{LORD}} spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the {{LORD}} gave them unto me."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|10:4|9}}</ref> These tablets were later placed in the [[ark of the covenant]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|4:10–13|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|Deut.|5:22|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|Deut.|9:17|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|Deut.|10:1–5|HE}}</ref>

== Numbering{{anchor|Numbering schemes}}==<!-- Do not change translation without discussion in Talk  -->
Though both the [[Masoretic Text]] and the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] show the passages of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 divided into ten specific commandments with spaces between them,<ref>Mechon Mamre, {{Bibleverse|Exodus|20|HE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/image/B-314643 |title=Dead Sea Scrolls Plate 981, Frag 2, B-314643 ManuScript 4Q41-4Q Deut |access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref> many [[Modern English Bible translations]] give the appearance of more than ten imperative statements in each passage.

Different religious traditions divide the seventeen verses of {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:1–17}} and their parallels in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:4–21}} into ten commandments in different ways, shown in the table below. Some suggest that the number ten is a choice to aid memorization rather than a matter of theology.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |last=Chan |first=Yiu Sing Lúcás |year=2012 |location=Lantham, MA |pages=38, 241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ITxsMU-7sIC&pg=PA37 |isbn=9781442215542 |access-date=20 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424074528/https://books.google.com/books?id=4ITxsMU-7sIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA37 |archive-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Block />

* All scripture quotes above are from the [[King James Version]] unless otherwise stated.

Traditions:
* '''T''': Jewish [[Talmud]], makes the "prologue" the first "saying" or "matter" and combines the prohibition on worshiping deities other than Yahweh with the prohibition on idolatry.
* '''R''': [[Reformed Christian]]s follow [[John Calvin]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', which follows the Septuagint; this system is also used in the [[Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fincham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Lake |first2=Peter (editors) |date=2006 |title=Religious Politics in Post-reformation England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ozTiFBvdDTIC&q=ten+commandments+anglican+numbering&pg=PA42 |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |publisher=The Boydell Press |page=42 |isbn=1-84383-253-4}}</ref>
* '''LXX''': [[Septuagint]], generally followed by Orthodox Christians.
* '''P''': [[Philo]], same as the Septuagint, but with the prohibitions on killing and adultery reversed.
* '''L''': [[Lutherans]] follow [[Luther's Large Catechism]], which follows Augustine but subordinates the prohibition of images to the sovereignty of God in the First Commandment<ref name="LC" /> and uses the word order of Exodus 20:17 rather than Deuteronomy 5:21 for the ninth and tenth commandments.
* '''S''': [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], with an additional commandment about [[Mount Gerizim]] as 10th.
* '''A''': [[Augustine]] follows the Talmud in combining verses 3–6, but omits the prologue as a commandment and divides the prohibition on coveting in two and following the word order of Deuteronomy 5:21 rather than Exodus 20:17.
* '''C''': ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', largely follows Augustine.

==Religious interpretations==
The Ten Commandments concern matters of fundamental importance in Judaism and Christianity: the greatest obligation (to worship only God), the greatest injury to a person (murder), the greatest injury to family bonds (adultery), the greatest injury to commerce and law (bearing false witness), the greatest inter-generational obligation (honour to parents), the greatest obligation to community (truthfulness), the greatest injury to movable property (theft).<ref name=Huffmon>Herbert Huffmon, "The Fundamental Code Illustrated: The Third Commandment," in ''The Ten Commandments: The Reciprocity of Faithfulness'', ed.

According to [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], Ten Commandments are virtually entwined, in that the breaking of one leads to the breaking of another. Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained—there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: "I am the Lord, thy God," corresponds to the sixth: "Thou shalt not kill," for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: "Thou shalt have no strange gods before me," corresponds to the seventh: "Thou shalt not commit adultery," for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain," corresponds to the eighth: "Thou shalt not steal," for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," corresponds to the ninth: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother," corresponds to the tenth: "Covet not thy neighbor's wife," for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>

The traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments. In the era of the [[Sanhedrin]] transgressing any one of six of the Ten Commandments theoretically carried the [[death penalty]], the exceptions being the First Commandment, honouring your father and mother, saying God's name in vain, and coveting, though this was rarely enforced due to a large number of stringent evidentiary requirements imposed by the [[oral Torah|oral law]].<ref>Talmud Makkos 1:10</ref>

====Two tablets====
{{Main|Tablets of Stone}}
The arrangement of the commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways in the classical Jewish tradition. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that each tablet contained five commandments, "but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other", that is, that the tablets were duplicates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mekhilta |author=Rabbi Ishmael |editor=Horowitz-Rabin |pages=233, Tractate ''de-ba-Hodesh'', 5|title-link=Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael }}</ref> This can be compared to diplomatic treaties of the ancient Near East, in which a copy was made for each party.<ref>{{cite web |title=What was Written on the Two Tablets? |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html |last=Margaliot |first=Dr. Meshulam |date=July 2004 |publisher=Bar-Ilan University |accessdate=20 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426185437/http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html |archive-date=26 April 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the [[Talmud]], the compendium of traditional [[Rabbinic Jewish]] law, tradition, and interpretation, one interpretation of the biblical verse "the tablets were written on both their sides",<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:15}}</ref> is that the carving went through the full thickness of the tablets, yet was miraculously legible from both sides.<ref>''[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]'', tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104a.</ref>

====Use in Jewish ritual====
[[File:5493 - Venezia - Ghetto Nuovo - Negozio ebraico - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 1-Aug-2008.jpg|thumb|The Ten Commandments on a glass plate]]
The [[Mishna]] records that during the period of the [[Second Temple]], the Ten Commandments were recited daily,<ref name=Glustrom /> before the reading of the [[Shema Yisrael]] (as preserved, for example, in the [[Nash Papyrus]], a Hebrew manuscript fragment from 150–100 BCE found in Egypt, containing a version of the ten commandments and the beginning of the Shema); but that this practice was abolished in the synagogues so as not to give ammunition to heretics who claimed that they were the only important part of Jewish law,<ref>Yerushalmi Berakhot, Chapter 1, fol. 3c. See also Rabbi David Golinkin, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Shavuot/In_the_Community/Torah_Reading_and_Haftarah/The_Ten_Commandments/In_Liturgy.shtml Whatever Happened to the Ten Commandments?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615182833/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Shavuot/In_the_Community/Torah_Reading_and_Haftarah/The_Ten_Commandments/In_Liturgy.shtml |date=15 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>''Talmud''. tractate [https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.12a Berachot 12a.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612151250/https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.12a |date=12 June 2018 }}</ref> or to dispel a claim by early Christians that ''only'' the Ten Commandments were handed down at Mount Sinai rather than the whole Torah.<ref name=Glustrom />

In later centuries rabbis continued to omit the Ten Commandments from daily liturgy in order to prevent confusion among Jews that they are ''only'' bound by the Ten Commandments, and not also by many other biblical and Talmudic laws, such as the requirement to observe holy days other than the sabbath.<ref name=Glustrom />

Today, the Ten Commandments are heard in the synagogue three times a year: as they come up during the readings of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of [[Shavuot]].<ref name=Glustrom /> The Exodus version is read in ''[[parasha]]t [[Yitro]]'' around late January–February, and on the festival of Shavuot, and the Deuteronomy version in ''parashat [[Va'etchanan]]'' in August–September. In some traditions, worshipers rise for the reading of the Ten Commandments to highlight their special significance<ref name=Glustrom>Simon Glustrom, ''The Myth and Reality of Judaism'', [https://archive.org/details/mythrealityofj00glus/page/113 pp 113–114]. Behrman House (1989). {{ISBN|0-87441-479-2}}</ref> though many rabbis, including [[Maimonides]], have opposed this custom since one may come to think that the Ten Commandments are more important than the rest of the [[Mitzvot]].<ref>[http://oldweb.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1872 Covenant & Conversation Yitro 5772] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524100757/http://oldweb.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1872 |date=24 May 2015 }} Chief Rabbi. Retrieved 24 May 2015</ref>

In printed [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumashim]], as well as in those in manuscript form, the Ten Commandments carry two sets of [[cantillation]] marks. The ''ta'am 'elyon'' (upper accentuation), which makes each Commandment into a separate verse, is used for public Torah reading, while the ''ta'am tachton'' (lower accentuation), which divides the text into verses of more even length, is used for private reading or study. The verse numbering in Jewish Bibles follows the ''ta'am tachton''. In Jewish Bibles the references to the Ten Commandments are therefore {{bibleverse|Exodus||20:2–14}} and {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||5:6–18}}.

====Samaritan====
The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] varies in the Ten Commandments passages, both in that the Samaritan Deuteronomical version of the passage is much closer to that in Exodus, and in that Samaritans count as nine commandments what others count as ten. The Samaritan tenth commandment is on the sanctity of [[Mount Gerizim]].

The text of the Samaritan tenth commandment follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Samaritan Tenth Commandment |url=http://shomron0.tripod.com/update12.19.2002o.html |last=Gaster |first=Moses |work=The Samaritans, Their History, Doctrines and Literature |publisher=The [[Schweich Lectures]] |year =1923 |authorlink=Moses Gaster |access-date=26 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727202827/http://shomron0.tripod.com/update12.19.2002o.html |archive-date=27 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Moses and Aaron with the 10 Commandments 1674.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Moses and Aaron with the Ten Commandments'' (painting circa 1675 by Aron de Chavez)]]
During his [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus explicitly referenced the prohibitions against murder and adultery. In {{bibleref|Matthew|19:16-19}} [[Jesus]] repeated five of the Ten Commandments, followed by that commandment called "the second" ({{bibleref|Matthew|22:34-40}}) after the [[Great Commandment|first and great commandment]].

{{Quote|And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? ''there is'' none good but one, ''that is'', God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and ''thy'' mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.|{{bibleref|Matthew|19:16-19|KJV}}}}

In his [[Epistle to the Romans]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also mentioned five of the Ten Commandments and associated them with the neighbourly love commandment.

{{Quote|1=<poem>Romans 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if ''there be'' any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love ''is'' the fulfilling of the law.</poem>|2={{bibleref|Romans|13:8-10|KJV}} KJV}}

====Moses and the Tablets====
{{Main|Tablets of Stone#In the Quran}}
The receiving of the Ten Commandments by Prophet [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] (Moses) is dealt with in much detail in Islamic tradition<ref>''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya|Qasas ul Anbiya]]'' (Stories of the Prophets) ''Ibn Kathir''</ref> with the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai described in Surah [[A'raf]] (7:142-145). The Revealing of the Tablets on which were the Commandments of God is described in the following verse:
{{quote|And We wrote for him (Moses) on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things (and said): Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein. I shall show you the home of ''Al-Fasiqun'' (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).<ref>''The Noble Quran'', trans. Muhsin Khan; Taqi-ud-Din Hilali. Verse 7:145</ref>}}

The Tablets are further alluded to in verses 7:150, when Moses threw the Tablets down in anger at seeing the Israelites' worshipping of the golden calf, and in 7:154 when he picked up the Tablets having recovered from his anger: 
{{quote|And when the anger of Musa (Moses) was appeased, he took up the Tablets, and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.<ref>''The Noble Quran'', trans. Muhsin Khan; Taqi-ud-Din Hilali. Verse 7:154</ref>}}

Quranic reference to the ten commandments can be found in chapter 2 verses 83 and 84 "And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], "Do not worship except Allah (1) ; and to parents do good (2) and to relatives (3), orphans (4), and the needy (5). And speak to people good words (6) and establish prayer (7) and give Zakat (8)." Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing." "And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], "Do not shed each other's blood (9) or evict one another from your homes (10)." Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing"{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

====Classical views====
Three verses of Surah [[An'am]] (6:151-153) are widely taken to be a reinstatement (or revised version) of the Ten Commandments<ref>[http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 ''Tafsir ibn Kathir''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404143941/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 |date=4 April 2013 }}, see Chapter heading for the Commentary of Verse 6:151</ref><ref>"In the Quran, the Ten Commandments are discussed in Surah Al-An'am, 6:151-153": {{cite book|author1=Hillary Thompson|author2=Edward F.

Evidence for these verses having some relation to Moses and the Ten Commandments is from the verse which immediately follows them:
{{quote|Then, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book, to complete (Our Favour) upon those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail and a guidance and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.<ref>''The Noble Quran'', trans. Muhsin Khan; Taqi-ud-Din Hilali. Verse 6:154</ref>}}

According to a narration in [[Mustadrak Hakim]], [[Ibn Abbas]], a prominent narrator of [[Israiliyat]] traditions said, "In Surah Al-An`am, there are clear Ayat, and they are the Mother of the Book (the Qur'an)." He then recited the above verses.<ref name="Tafsir ibn Kathir">[http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 ''Tafsir ibn Kathir''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404143941/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 |date=4 April 2013 }}, Commentary of verse 6:151. [[Al-Hakim Nishapuri|Al-Hakim]] said, "Its chain is Sahih, and they ([[Sihah Sitta]]) did not record it."</ref>

Also in Mustadrak Hakim is the narration of [[Ubada ibn as-Samit]]:
{{quote|The Messenger of Allah said, "Who among you will give me his pledge to do three things?"

He then recited the (above) Ayah (6:151-153).

He then said, "Whoever fulfills (this pledge), then his reward will be with Allah, but whoever fell into shortcomings and Allah punishes him for it in this life, then that will be his recompense. Whoever Allah delays (his reckoning) until the Hereafter, then his matter is with Allah. If He wills, He will punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him."<ref name="Tafsir ibn Kathir"/>}}

[[Ibn Kathir]] mentions a narration of [[Abdullah ibn Mas'ud]] in his [[Tafsir]]:
{{quote|"Whoever wishes to read the will and testament of the Messenger of Allah on which he placed his seal, let him read these Ayat (6:151-153)."<ref>[http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 ''Tafsir ibn Kathir''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404143941/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=953&Itemid=61 |date=4 April 2013 }}, Commentary of verse 6:151.

===Main points of interpretative difference===

====Sabbath day====
{{See also|Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Biblical Sabbath|Shabbat|Judaizers}}
The Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways. In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk). In [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christianity]], it is sometimes [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|observed on Saturday]], sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all ([[non-Sabbatarianism]]). Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] onward.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the [[Council of Laodicea]] (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: "It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them" and "It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety".<ref name="newadvent.org">[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm Synod of Laodicea (4th Century)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615085940/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm |date=15 June 2006 }} – New Advent</ref> Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: "Christians must not judaize by resting on the [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ."<ref name="newadvent.org" />

====Killing or murder====
{{Main|Thou shalt not kill}}
[[File:Sixth Commandment (Temple Church, London).jpg|right|thumb|The Sixth Commandment, as translated by the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (1549).<br />The image is from the altar screen of the [[Temple Church]] near the Law Courts in London.]]

Multiple translations exist of the fifth/sixth commandment; the Hebrew words {{Hebrew|לא תרצח}} (''lo tirtzach'') are variously translated as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder".<ref>[http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2020:13 Exodus 20:13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021073544/http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2020:13 |date=21 October 2011 }} Multiple versions and languages.</ref>

The imperative is against unlawful killing resulting in [[Bloodguilt in the Hebrew Bible|bloodguilt]].<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html Bloodguilt, Jewish Virtual Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910071944/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html |date=10 September 2015 }}, Genesis 4:10, Genesis 9:6, Genesis 42:22, Exodus 22:2–2, Leviticus 17:4, Leviticus 20, Numbers 20, Deuteronomy 19, Deuteronomy 32:43, Joshua 2:19, Judges 9:24, 1 Samuel 25, 2 Samuel 1, 2 Samuel 21, 1 Kings 2, 1 Kings 21:19, 2 Kings 24:4, Psalm 9:12, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 106:38, Proverbs 6:17, Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 26:21, Jeremiah 22:17, Lamentations 4:13, Ezekiel 9:9, Ezekiel 36:18, Hosea 4:2, Joel 3:19, Habakkuk 2:8, Matthew 23:30–35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50–51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24</ref> The Hebrew Bible contains numerous prohibitions against unlawful killing, but does not prohibit killing in the context of [[warfare]] ({{bibleref|1Kings|2:5-6}}), [[capital punishment]] ({{bibleref|Leviticus|20:9-16}}) or a [[Thou shalt not kill#Justified killing: intruder in the home|home invasion during the night]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|22:2–3}}), which are considered justified. The New Testament is in agreement that murder is a grave moral evil,<ref>Matthew 5:21, Matthew 15:19, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:7, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20, Romans 13:9, 1 Timothy 1:9, James 2:11, Revelation 21:8</ref> and references the Old Testament view of bloodguilt.<ref>Matthew 23:30–35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50–51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24</ref>

====Theft====
{{Main|Thou shalt not steal}}
German Old Testament scholar [[Albrecht Alt]]: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953), suggested that the commandment translated as "thou shalt not steal" was originally intended against stealing people—against abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as "thou shalt not kidnap" (Sanhedrin 86a).

====Idolatry====
{{Main|Idolatry|Idolatry in Judaism|Idolatry in Christianity}}
In Judaism there is a prohibition against ''worshipping'' an idol or a representation of God, but there is no restriction on art or simple ''depictions''. Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning representations of God, and in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.

In the non-canonical [[Gospel of Barnabas]], it is claimed that Jesus stated that idolatry is the greatest sin as it divests a man fully of faith, and hence of God.<ref>[http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh Chapter 32: Statues of Flesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071747/http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh |date=15 January 2018 }} ''Barnabas.net''</ref> The words attributed to Jesus prohibit not only worshipping statues of wood or stone; but also statues of flesh. ''"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner."''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref> Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=Évangile de Barnabé |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref> so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.

In Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].

In 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council "emanated from Satan".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction<ref name=Hore>Alexander Hugh Hore, [https://archive.org/details/eighteencenturi00horegoog/page/n265 <!-- pg=353 quote="flat pictures". --> ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J. Parker and co. (1899)<br />"The images or Icons, as they are called, of the Greek Church are not, it must be remarked, sculptured images, but flat pictures or mosaics; not even the Crucifix is sanctioned; and herein consists the difference between the Greek and Roman Churches, in the latter of which both pictures and statues are allowed, and venerated with equal honour." [https://archive.org/details/eighteencenturi00horegoog/page/n265 <!-- quote="orthodox church" "statues". --> p.353]</ref> as a reminder of this theological aspect. Icons depict the spiritual dimension of their subject rather than attempting a naturalistic portrayal.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In modern use (usually as a result of Roman Catholic influence), more naturalistic images and images of the Father, however, also appear occasionally in Orthodox churches, but statues, i.e. three-dimensional depictions, continue to be banned.<ref name=Hore />

====Adultery====
Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married nor [[Engagement|betrothed]] was not considered adultery.<ref>Collins, R. F. (1992). "Ten Commandments." In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 6, p. 386). New York: Doubleday</ref> This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adultery.html |title=''Encyclopedia Judaica'' vol01 p. 424 |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070025/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adultery.html |archive-date=2 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Louis Ginzberg argued that the tenth commandment (''Covet not thy neighbor's wife'') is directed against a sin which may lead to a trespassing of all Ten Commandments.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The other Commandments Revealed on Sinai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>

==Critical historical analysis==
[[File:Monheim Town Hall 5.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Moses receiving the tablets ([[Monheim Town Hall]])]]

===Early theories===
Critical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.

[[Julius Wellhausen]]'s [[documentary hypothesis]] suggests that Exodus 20-23 and 34 "might be regarded as the document which formed the starting point of the religious history of Israel."<ref>Julius Wellhausen 1973 ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' Glouster, MA: Peter Smith. 392</ref> Deuteronomy 5 then reflects King Josiah's attempt to link the document produced by his court to the older Mosaic tradition.

In a 2002 analysis of the history of this position, [[Bernard M. Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mount Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the "ethical" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). "Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis". ''Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 114 (2): 212–223</ref>

By the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion. Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2–17 and Exodus 34:10–28 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that "had already been normalized in the period of the Judges" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

===Hittite treaties===
According to John Bright, however, there is an important distinction between the Decalogue and the "book of the covenant" (Exodus 21-23 and 34:10–24). The Decalogue, he argues, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p., 146–147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.150–151] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>

"The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts.. (compare with Exodus 20:2 "I am the {{LORD}} your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery"). The Hittite treaty also stipulated the obligations imposed by the ruler on his vassals, which included a prohibition of relations with peoples outside the empire, or enmity between those within."<ref>Cornfeld, Gaalyahu Ed ''Pictorial Biblical Encyclopedia'', MacMillan 1964 p. 237</ref> (Exodus 20:3: "You shall have no other gods before Me"). Viewed as a treaty rather than a law code, its purpose is not so much to regulate human affairs as to define the scope of the king's power.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p., 165 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.169–170] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>

Julius Morgenstern argued that Exodus 34 is distinct from the Jahwist document, identifying it with king Asa's reforms in 899 BCE.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{citation |first=Julius |last=Morgenstern |year=1927 |title=The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch |publisher=HUAC |volume=IV}}</ref> Bright, however, believes that like the Decalogue this text has its origins in the time of the tribal alliance. The book of the covenant, he notes, bears a greater similarity to Mesopotamian law codes (e.g. the [[Code of Hammurabi]] which was inscribed on a stone [[stele]]). He argues that the function of this "book" is to move from the realm of treaty to the realm of law: "The Book of the Covenant (Ex., chs. 21 to 23; cf. ch. 34), which is no official state law, but a description of normative Israelite judicial procedure in the days of the Judges, is the best example of this process."<ref>Bright, John, 2000, ''A History of Israel'' 4th ed. p.173.</ref> According to Bright, then, this body of law too predates the monarchy.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p. 166 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.170+] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>

===The Ritual Decalogue===
{{Main|Ritual Decalogue}}
[[File:Mozes toont de Tien Geboden.jpg|thumb|360x360px|Print of Moses showing the Ten Commandments. Made at the end of the sixteenth century]]
Some proponents of the [[Documentary hypothesis]] have argued that the biblical text in Exodus 34:28<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:28}}</ref> identifies a different list as the ten commandments, that of Exodus 34:11–27.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:11–27}}</ref> Since this passage does not prohibit murder, adultery, theft, etc., but instead deals with the proper worship of [[Yahweh]], some scholars call it the "[[Ritual Decalogue]]", and disambiguate the ten commandments of traditional understanding as the "Ethical Decalogue".<ref>''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, 2007</ref><ref>''The Hebrew Bible: A Brief Socio-Literary Introduction''. Norman Gottwald, 2008</ref><ref>''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch''. T. Desmond Alexander and David Weston Baker, 2003</ref><ref>''Commentary on the Torah''. Richard Elliott Friedman, 2003</ref>

According to these scholars the Bible includes multiple versions of events. On the basis of many points of analysis including linguistic it is shown as a patchwork of sources sometimes with bridging comments by the editor (Redactor) but otherwise left intact from the original, frequently side by side.<ref>Friedman, Richard Elliott. ''[[The Bible with Sources Revealed]]'', 2003 p. 7</ref>

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] argues that the Ten Commandments at Exodus 20:1–17 "does not appear to belong to any of the major sources. It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor."<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. "In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered."<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>

He writes that Exodus 34:14–26 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: "The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments. (Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5). … The other seven commandments here are completely different."<ref>Friedman, p. 179</ref> He suggests that differences in the J and E versions of the Ten Commandments story are a result of power struggles in the priesthood. The writer has Moses smash the tablets "because this raised doubts about the Judah's central religious shrine".<ref>Friedman, Richard Elliott. "Who Wrote The Bible?" 1987 pp. 73–74</ref>

According to Kaufmann, the Decalogue and the book of the covenant represent two ways of manifesting God's presence in Israel: the Ten Commandments taking the archaic and material form of stone tablets kept in the [[ark of the covenant]], while the book of the covenant took oral form to be recited to the people.<ref name=Kaufmann1960>Yehezkal Kaufmann 1960 ''The Religion of Israel: From its beginnings to the Babylonian Exile'' trans. and Abridged by Moshe Greenberg.

European Protestants replaced some visual art in their churches with plaques of the Ten Commandments after the Reformation. In England, such "Decalogue boards" also represented the English monarch's emphasis on rule of royal law within the churches. The United States Constitution forbids establishment of religion by law; however images of Moses holding the tablets of the Decalogue, along other religious figures including Solomon, Confucius, and Muhammad holding the Quran, are sculpted on the north and south friezes of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|pediment of the Supreme Court building in Washington]].<ref>Office of the Curator, {{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf |title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls |access-date=5 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713031226/https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf |archive-date=13 July 2019 |url-status=live }} Supreme Court of the United States, 5 August 2003.</ref> Images of the Ten Commandments have long been contested symbols for the relationship of religion to national law.<ref name="moses.creighton.edu">Watts, {{cite web |url=http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2004/2004-13.pdf |title=Ten Commandments Monuments |access-date=27 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214132154/http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2004/2004-13.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2015 |url-status=live }} 2004</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]] placed possibly thousands of Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and school rooms, including many stone monuments on courthouse property.<ref>Emmet V. Mittlebeeler, (2003) "Ten Commandments." P. 434 in ''The Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics''. Edited by P. A. Djupe and L. R. Olson. New York: Facts on File.</ref> Because displaying the commandments can reflect a sectarian position if they are numbered (see above), the Eagles developed an ecumenical version that omitted the numbers, as on the monument at the Texas capitol (shown here). Hundreds of monuments were also placed by [[film director|director]] [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as a [[publicity stunt]] to promote his 1956 [[film]] ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200109/10_schmitzr_laxten-m/ |title=MPR: The Ten Commandments: Religious or historical symbol? |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=10 September 2001 |accessdate=9 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129065822/http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200109/10_schmitzr_laxten-m/ |archive-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Placing the plaques and monuments to the Ten Commandments in and around government buildings was another expression of mid-twentieth century U.S. [[civil religion]], along with adding the phrase "under God" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]].<ref name="moses.creighton.edu" />

By the beginning of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, "[http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments]," (16 May 2003) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.

Those who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name="moses.creighton.edu" />

[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]
U.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.

One result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.

Both ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it. He then presents the remaining tablets, proclaiming Ten Commandments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-WdAwVg9c/ |title=Fifteen Commandments |publisher=YouTube.com |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>

In ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', a 1998 animated film that depicted the early life of Moses (voiced by [[Val Kilmer]]), the final shot depicts him with the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, accompanied by a reprise of "[[Deliver Us (The Prince of Egypt)|Deliver Us]]".

The story of Moses and the Ten Commandments is discussed in the Danish stageplay ''[[Biblen]]'' (2008).

In the [[The Seven Deadly Sins (manga)|Seven Deadly Sins]] manga-franchise, there is an elite force of ten demons called Ten Commandments, where each has a special curse from a Demon King (commandment). The effects of each Commandment is loosely based on the real Ten Commandments from the Abrahamic Religions.

In [[The Simpsons (season 2)]] episode [[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]], Homer Simpson violated the 8th Commandment after he stole cable TV, so Lisa urged him to get rid of it.
