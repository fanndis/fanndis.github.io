'''CBS Radio''' was a radio broadcasting company and radio network operator owned by [[CBS Corporation]], and consolidated radio station groups owned by CBS and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse Broadcasting/Group W]] since the 1920s and [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting]] since the 1970s. The broadcasting company was sold to [[Entercom]] on November 17, 2017.<ref name="entercom-8k-20171116">{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | title = Form 8-K | author = Entercom Communications Corp. | publisher = Securities and Exchange Commission | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-17 }}</ref>

Although CBS's involvement in radio dates back to the establishment of the original [[CBS Radio Network]] in 1927, the most recent radio division was formed by the 1997 acquisition of [[Infinity Broadcasting]] by CBS owner [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. In 1999, Infinity became a division of the original [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]]; in 2005, Viacom spun CBS and Infinity Broadcasting back into a separate company, and the division was renamed CBS Radio. It was the last radio group left to be tied to a major broadcast television network, as [[NBC]] divested its radio interests in the 1980s, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sold off its division to [[Citadel Broadcasting]] (now part of [[Cumulus Media]]) in 2007.

== Early origins ==
CBS Radio is one of the oldest units within CBS Corporation, and has been around since 1928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbscorporation.com/portfolio/cbs-television-network/|title=CBS Television Network {{!}} CBS Corporation|website=www.cbscorporation.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> However, the actual CBS Radio Network (now [[CBS News Radio]]) was launched in 1927, when CBS itself was known as United Independent Broadcasters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/25/archives/cbs-radio-to-scan-50-years.html|title=CBS Radio to Scan 50 Years|last=Brown|first=Les|date=August 25, 1977|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Columbia Records]] later joined in and that company was renamed the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System. In September 1927, Columbia Records sold the company to [[William S. Paley]] and in 1928, Paley streamlined the corporate name to Columbia Broadcasting System.

== History ==
The company that would become CBS Radio was founded in 1972 as '''Infinity Broadcasting Corporation''' by [[Michael A. Wiener]] and [[Gerald Carrus]], with the acquisition of [[KOME]], an FM radio station that served the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It became a publicly traded company twice, in 1986, and again in 1992.

[[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired CBS, Inc. in 1995 and then acquired Infinity Broadcasting in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2017/03/29/timeline-westinghouse-electric-co.html|title=Timeline: Westinghouse Electric Co.|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> Westinghouse, which produced the first radio broadcast on November 2, 1920, with [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2012/03/08/kdkas-historic-broadcast/|title=KDKA's Historic Broadcast|date=2012-03-08|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref> would later change its name to CBS Corporation,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/06/business/westinghouse-electric-to-rename-itself-cbs.html|title=Westinghouse Electric to Rename Itself Cbs|last=News|first=Bloomberg|date=1997-02-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and reorganize all of its radio properties (including its own [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] stations), as well as its outdoor advertising business, under the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation name.

In August 2006, CBS Radio announced the sale of its 15 radio stations in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Austin, Texas]]; and [[Rochester, New York]] to [[Entercom Communications]]. This group deal was granted [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approval in mid-November 2007 after it faced regulatory review and numerous challenges for over a year, and officially closed on November 30. Several other stations, most in smaller markets, were also sold to companies like [[Border Media Partners]] and Peak Media Corporation.

On April 30, 2008, CBS Radio and [[AOL]] entered a partnership (following the dissolution of partnership between AOL and [[XM Satellite Radio]] due to the change in Internet royalty rates). The AOL Radio player powered by CBS Radio features over 200 CBS Radio stations, along with over 200 AOL Radio stations, combining two of the largest online radio networks and giving millions of listeners unlimited and free access to a diverse array of music and programming including news, sports and talk. These stations were folded into the [[AOL Radio]] mobile app.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/aol-turns-the-iphone-into-an-expensive-radio/?_r=0|title=AOL Turns the iPhone Into an Expensive Radio|last=Hansell|first=Saul|newspaper=Bits Blog|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/cbs-yahoo-internet-radio,news-3076.html|title=CBS Radio to Power Yahoo's Launchcast|date=December 3, 2008|newspaper=Tom's Guide|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, CBS started the process of paring down its station holdings, with a particular focus on ridding itself of stations in mid-sized markets, and markets where there are no television stations for synergistic advantages.<ref name="variety-cbssell" /> On July 31, 2008, CBS Radio announced that it would sell 50 more radio stations in 12 mid-size markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/first-bids-on-cbs-radio-selloffs-due-today |title=First bids on CBS Radio selloffs due today |date=September 22, 2008 |work=Radio-Info.com |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011022158/http://www.radio-info.com/news/first-bids-on-cbs-radio-selloffs-due-today |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> however some companies like [[RBC Capital Markets]] said CBS Radio is a "melting icecube" and that CBS Corporation would be better off selling the entire radio unit rather than "waiting a couple of years and selling the rest for less."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2008/09/22/cbs-kicks-off-radio-station-auction/|title=CBS KICKS OFF RADIO STATION AUCTION|last=Lauria|first=Peter|date=September 22, 2008|website=New York Post|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref>

On December 15, 2008, CBS Radio and Clear Channel Communications reached an agreement to swap seven stations. In this deal, Clear Channel acquired [[WQSR]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, [[KBKS]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[KLTH]] and [[KXJM]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[KYRV|KQJK]] in [[Sacramento, California]]; and CBS Radio would get [[KHMX]] and [[KLOL]] in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease102342-12-15-2008.html CBS Radio to Swap Five Mid-Size Market Stations for Two Large Market Stations with Clear Channel Communications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219194540/http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease102342-12-15-2008.html |date=December 19, 2008 }} (retrieved December 15, 2008)</ref> The deal closed on April 1, 2009. On December 20, 2008, CBS Radio announced that it would sell the entire [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] cluster (this includes three radio stations) to [[Wilks Broadcasting]] for $19.5 Million, including [[KIMN]], [[KKSE-FM|KWOF]], and [[KXKL-FM|KXKL]].<ref>[http://www.rttnews.com/ArticleView.aspx?Id=809272 CBS to sell three Denver radio stations to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 Mln cash – Update] – [[RTTNews]] (released December 22, 2008)</ref>

On August 10, 2009, CBS Radio announced that it would sell the entire [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] cluster (this includes four radio stations) to [[Alpha Broadcasting]] for $40 Million.

On February 4, 2010, all CBS Radio stations, as well as AOL Radio and Yahoo! Music Radio restricted all non U.S. listeners from streaming online content. CBS Radio redirected to sister property [[Last.fm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/newsletter/html/tri-02152010.html |title=CBS Radio cuts off streaming access beyond U.S. borders. |last=Taylor |first=Tom |date=February 15, 2010 |work=Taylor on Radio-Info |publisher=Radio-Info.com |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006171209/http://www.radio-info.com/newsletter/html/tri-02152010.html# |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In July 2010, CBS Radio launched [[Radio.com]].

2011 saw the biggest AC format removal of the company dropping AC for [[hot adult contemporary]] on [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[WIAD]] in March, followed by [[New York City]]'s [[WNEW-FM|WWFS]] on October 12 (both in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]). On August 1, [[WCFS-FM]] [[Chicago]] removed its AC format for all-news to simulcast [[WBBM (AM)]]. By November 2011, WLTE in [[Minneapolis]]/[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] removed the AC format for [[Christmas music]], only to transition to [[country music]] as [[KMNB]] on December 26.

On April 9, 2012, CBS Radio announced that it was selling its West Palm Beach cluster of stations to Palm Beach Broadcasting for $50 Million.<ref>[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/104667/cbs-sells-west-palm-beach-cluster CBS Sells West Palm Beach Cluster] – All Access Music Group (released April 10, 2012)</ref>

On December 1, 2014, CBS Radio traded 14 stations—its [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] clusters as well as WIP-AM (now [[WTEL (AM)]]) in [[Philadelphia]]—to [[Beasley Broadcast Group]] in exchange for WRDW-FM (now [[WTDY-FM]]) and [[WXTU]] in Philadelphia and [[WKIS]], [[WPOW]], and [[WQAM]] in [[Miami]].<ref name=ri-cbsbeasleycomplete>{{cite news|last1=Venta|first1=Lance|title=CBS Beasley Deal Closes|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91003/cbsbeasley-swap-updates/|accessdate=December 1, 2014|work=RadioInsight|date=December 1, 2014}}</ref>

In May 2016, [[Percy Anderson (judge)|Judge Percy Anderson]] ruled in favor of CBS Radio in a lawsuit filed by ABS Entertainment over the use of pre-1972 sound recordings, which are subject to [[common law copyright|common law state copyright]] and not federal law, on CBS Radio's oldies stations. ABS argued that because pre-1972 works are not subject to federal copyright, they are not subject to the federal laws providing [[compulsory license]]s for performing the recordings on terrestrial radio and via non-interactive digital streams, and require permission. CBS, however, argued that it did not play pre-1972 sound recordings, but remastered versions of recordings published from compilations with copyrights registered after 1972, making them separate works subject to federal copyright and eligible for compulsory licenses. The court ruled that the remastered recordings contained "multiple kinds of creative authorship, such as adjustments of equalization, sound editing and channel assignment", with [[Threshold of originality|a level of creativity]] suitable enough to generate a new copyright.<ref name="thr-cbsremaster">{{cite web|title=CBS Radio Has Novel Argument to Legal Demand to Stop Playing Pre-1972 Songs|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-radio-has-novel-argument-833596|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="thr-cbs1972">{{cite web|title=CBS Beats Lawsuit Over Pre-1972 Songs With Bold Copyright Argument|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-beats-lawsuit-pre-1972-898633|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>

== Howard Stern and Free FM ==
{{details|The Howard Stern Show|Free FM}}

From 1985 to 2005, Infinity/CBS Radio was the home of controversial and top-rated talk show host [[Howard Stern]], who left for subscription-based satellite radio due to increasing [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and station censorship. In January 2006, rock star [[David Lee Roth]], [[Rover's Morning Glory]], and talk show host [[Adam Carolla]] replaced [[Howard Stern|Stern]] in most major radio markets, and CBS Radio launched its new "[[Free FM]]" [[hot talk]] format in many of these markets. [[David Lee Roth|Roth]]'s show was cancelled four months later and CBS Radio announced that [[Opie and Anthony]] of [[XM Radio]] would replace Roth on the stations that carried him, despite the irony that the two were fired after the sex act controversy inside of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]. Adam Carolla's show was also later canceled.

On February 28, 2006, CBS Radio announced it had filed a lawsuit against Stern, his agent Don Buchwald, and Sirius, arguing that Stern promoted Sirius "to enrich himself unfairly."<ref name="CBS-Tapes">{{cite news | title=Stern Gets Old Tapes, CBS Gets $2M | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/25/entertainment/main1654391.shtml?source=RSS&attr=Business_1654391 | publisher=CBS News | date=May 25, 2006| accessdate=September 18, 2008}}</ref> It also claimed that Stern "repeatedly and willfully" breached his contract with CBS, "misappropriated millions of dollars worth [of airtime]" for his own benefit and "fraudulently concealed" his performance-related interests in Sirius stock. The suit, filed in New York State Court, sought [[Compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]]. Stern anticipated the suit, and earlier that day, prior to CBS' announcement, held a press conference, discussing how CBS added to the media attention, even booking him for appearances on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[60 Minutes]]''. "I made them millions of dollars," Stern argued. "If I was hurting them, why did they keep me on the air for fourteen months? How can you have it both ways?"<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/01/stern-lawsuit-cbs.html CBS Radio files lawsuit against Stern, Sirius] CBC March 1, 2006</ref> When a settlement was announced on May 26, 2006, Sirius gained exclusive rights to Stern's back catalogue of radio broadcasts at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] from November 1985 to December 2005, totalling almost 23,000 hours.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=222720# |title=FMQB: Howard Stern Attains Broadcast Archives From CBS Radio, Settles Suit |access-date=May 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206152324/http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=222720# |archive-date=February 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The rights, costing Sirius approximately $2 million, equates to approximately $87 per-hour of tape.<ref>{{cite news | title=Stern Gets Old Tapes, CBS Gets $2M |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/25/entertainment/main1654391.shtml?source=RSS&attr=Business_1654391 | work=CBS News | date=May 25, 2006| accessdate=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

{{As of|2009}}, the Free FM branding has been discontinued in all markets, and no former Free FM station continues to have a hot talk format. The only remaining show still on air is The Sports Junkies on WJFK 106.7 FM DC. All other shows broke up or were canceled. Some, including The Big O & Dukes Show and The Mike O'Meara Show, have been reborn as podcasts.

== Jack FM ==
{{main|Jack FM}}

CBS Radio owned the majority of stations in the [[United States]] that broadcast the [[Jack FM]] format, a radio format that incorporates all types of [[popular music]] from the mid-50s to the present. These included stations in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Seattle]], [[Minneapolis]] and many other cities. [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and [[Houston]] had Jack FM stations, too; the New York City station, [[WCBS-FM]] has reverted to its traditional oldies format, and Jack (which had been renamed ToNY) was carried on its HD2 subchannel.

== Major League Baseball ==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}
CBS Radio was the largest broadcaster of local [[Major League Baseball]] broadcasts. In 2005 and 2007 respectively, CBS dropped the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from KMOX and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] from KDKA, ending two long relationships between the teams and their flagship stations. However, KMOX reacquired the Cardinals' broadcast rights in 2011, and KDKA's [[KDKA-FM|FM sister all-sports station]] acquired the Pirates' broadcast rights in 2012, in addition to [[New York Yankees]] games being renewed on WCBS after the conclusion of the 2011 season, they would have the rights until the end of the 2013 season.

CBS's [[WFAN]] is the flagship station of the [[New York Yankees]] (they had broadcast the [[New York Mets|Mets]] until 2014) and [[WSCR]] is the flagship station of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. In Philadelphia, [[WPHT]], a frequency that had been the longtime home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] before parting ways after the 2001 season, reacquired the team's broadcast rights in 2005. As of 2012 those games are now simulcast on sister station [[WIP-FM]]. [[KRLD-FM]] in Dallas was the flagship station for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] before the 2011 season.

In 2015, the [[Chicago Cubs]] moved its radio broadcasts to CBS property [[WBBM (AM)]] from its longtime home of [[WGN (AM)]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Bruce|title=Levine: CBS Radio Gains Cubs Broadcasting Rights|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/06/04/cbs-radio-gains-cubs-broadcasting-rights/|website=chicago.cbslocal.com|publisher=(CBS Chicago)|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}</ref> That same year, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] began its second stint on all-sports [[WJZ-FM]], four years after it was moved back to its traditional home of [[WBAL (AM)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/01/13/orioles-return-to-cbs-radio/|title=Orioles Return to CBS Radio|last1=Viviano|first1=Mark|website=CBS Baltimore|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref> In 2016 the Cubs rights moved to sister station WSCR as part of a pre-arrangement in the 2015 agreement where WSCR would take over airing games after letting the rights to the [[Chicago White Sox]] go after the 2015 season (which now broadcast on [[WGN (AM)]]).

==All-news radio stations==
Prior to the merger with Entercom, CBS Radio operated nearly all of the [[all-news]] radio stations in the United States.

They included:
*[[KCBS (AM)]] in San Francisco
*[[KMOX]] in St. Louis (partial all-news)
*[[KNX (AM)]] in Los Angeles
*[[KRLD (AM)]] in Dallas (partial all-news)
*[[KYW (AM)]] in Philadelphia
*[[WPHT (AM)]] in Philadelphia (not an all-news station, but its sister-station)
*[[WBBM (AM)]] in Chicago
*[[WBZ (AM)]] in Boston
*[[WCBS (AM)]] in New York
*[[WINS (AM)]] in New York
*[[WWJ (AM)]] in Detroit

As part of the merger and in order to comply with FCC Regulations, CBS Radio divested WBZ and ownership of that station was transferred to [[iHeartMedia]].
