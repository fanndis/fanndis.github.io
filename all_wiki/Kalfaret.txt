'''Kalfaret''' is a neighborhood in the city of [[Bergen]] in [[Vestland]] county, [[Norway]].  The neighborhood is located in the borough of [[Bergenhus]], just north of the [[Store Lungegårdsvannet]] bay, east of the city centre.  The area is an [[affluent]] neighborhood, although it is close to the main train line that runs into [[Bergen Station]].<ref name="snl">{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Kalfaret|title=Kalfaret|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref>

==History==
Prior to the end of the 19th century, the prominent citizens of Bergen had lived side by side with the rest of the city's population. However, as they became increasingly wealthy and influenced by international ideas and fashions, the upper classes sought to distance themselves from the dirt and the bustle of the city.<ref>{{cite book | title=[[Bergen byleksikon]]| last=Hartvedt| first=Gunnar Hagen| year=1994| publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget}}</ref>

Kalferet, located along the main route to Bergen, presented a more [[genteel]] but still convenient location and soon became the natural choice for the well-to-do. It is still a well-heeled neighbourhood to this day and most of the large villas built around 1900 remain intact.<ref>{{cite book | title=En kort beretning om Kalfaret : med hovedvekt på eiendommen Lille Kalfaret : et bidrag til Bergens kulturhistorie| last=Gjerstad| first=Jo| year=2007| publisher=Bodoni| location=Bergen| isbn=9788271284664}}</ref>

The [[Hansa Brewery]] was formerly situated in Kalfaret.<ref name="snl" />
