An '''in-joke''', also known as an '''inside joke''' or a '''private joke''', is a [[joke]] whose [[humour]] is understandable only to members of an [[ingroup]], that is, people who are ''in'' a particular social group, occupation, or other community of shared interest. It is an [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] joke, i.e., it is humorous only to those who are aware of the circumstances behind it.

In-jokes may exist within a small social clique, such as a group of friends, or extend to an entire profession. An example is:
::Q: What's yellow and equivalent to the [[Axiom of choice|Axiom of Choice]]?
::A: Zorn's lemon.	
This joke is so esoteric that most outsiders could not even confidently guess to which group it might be funny, let alone why. In fact, it is a [[mathematical humor|mathematics joke]],<ref>{{cite journal

Ethnic or religious groups may also have their own in-jokes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/tm_headline%3Dare-the-welsh-really-funny-%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D17932085%26siteid%3D50082-name_page.html |title=Wales Online: "Are the Welsh Really Funny?", 14 October 2006.

==Philosophy==
In-jokes are cryptic allusions to shared [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] that act as triggers; only those who have shared the common ground provide an appropriate response.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communication and Group Decision Making|author=Randy Y. Hirokawa and [[Marshall Scott Poole]]|pages=96|year=1996|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=076190462X}}</ref> An in-joke works to build community, sometimes at the expense of outsiders. Part of the power of an in-joke is that its audience knows that there are those who do not understand the joke.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rides the Beast?: Prophetic Rivalry and the Rhetoric of Crisis in the Churches of the Apocalypse|author=Paul Brooks Duff|pages=81|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019513835X}}</ref>

An in-joke can also be used as a [[subtext]], where people in the know may find humour in something not explicitly spoken. They may even apologize for doing so to a [[rookie]], directly or indirectly stating that what they were laughing at was an in-joke.<ref>{{cite book|title=Acting Your Dreams: Use Acting Techniques to Interpret Your Dreams|author=Ben Tousey|pages=118&ndash;119|year=2003|publisher=Ben Tousey|isbn=1-4140-0542-3}}</ref>
