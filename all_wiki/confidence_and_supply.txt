{{Short description|Political arrangement allowing a minority government in parliamentary democracies}}

In a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] based on the [[Westminster system]], '''confidence and supply''' are required for a [[minority government]] to retain power in the [[lower house]].

A '''confidence-and-supply agreement''' is one whereby a party or independent members of parliament will support the government in [[motion of no confidence|motions of confidence]] and [[appropriation bill|appropriation or budget (supply) votes]], by either voting in favour or abstaining. However, parties and independent members normally retain the right to otherwise vote in favour of their own policies or on [[Conscience vote|conscience]] on [[bill (law)|legislative bills]].<ref>James Cook, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/scotland/8668008.stm Governments, coalitions and border politics], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 May 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/why-the-pm-is-safe-in-no-10-for-the-moment-1968190.html Why the PM is safe in No 10 for the moment], ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 May 2010</ref><ref>https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/IfG%20Insight%20Confidence%20and%20Supply%20final.pdf</ref>

A [[coalition government]] is a more formal arrangement than a confidence-and-supply agreement, in that members from junior parties (i.e., parties other than the largest) gain positions in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], [[Minister (government)|ministerial roles]] and may be expected to hold the government [[Whip (politics)|whip]] on passing legislation.

==Confidence==
{{Main|Motion of no confidence}}

In most parliamentary democracies, members of a parliament can propose a motion of confidence<ref>Otherwise, when it is proposed by the Government itself upon a piece of legislation, "the Chambers are enslaved in the exercise of their principal function just because it was thought that their being master of the fiduciary relationship were to be reaffirmed on each bill": {{cite journal|last1=Argondizzo|first1=Domenico|last2=Buonomo|first2=Giampiero |title=Spigolature intorno all'attuale bicameralismo e proposte per quello futuro |journal=Mondoperaio.net|date=April 2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210301}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> or of no confidence in the government or executive. The results of such motions show how much support the government currently has in parliament. Should a motion of confidence fail, or a motion of no confidence pass, the government will usually either resign and allow other politicians to form a new government, or call an election.

==Supply==
{{Main|Appropriation bill|Loss of supply}}

Most parliamentary democracies require an annual state budget, an [[appropriation bill]], or occasional financial measures to be passed by parliament in order for a government to pay its way and enact its policies. The failure of a supply bill is in effect the same as the failure of a confidence motion. In early modern England, the withholding of funds was one of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s few ways of controlling the [[list of English monarchs|monarch]].

Subsequently, Premier [[Brian Gallant]] indicated his intention to resign the premiership and recommend to the lieutenant governor that PC leader [[Blaine Higgs]] be given the mandate to form a minority government: "I will go see the lieutenant governor at her earliest convenience to inform her that I will be resigning as premier, and I will humbly suggest to her honour to allow the leader of the Conservative Party to attempt to form a government and attempt to gain the confidence of the house." [[People's Alliance of New Brunswick|People's Alliance]] leader [[Kris Austin]] said he would work with the new government "in the areas we agree on," and reiterated his promise to support the Progressive Conservatives on confidence votes for a period of 18 months.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, confidence and supply arrangements are common due to the [[mixed-member proportional|MMP]] system used in the country. The parties providing confidence and supply have a more prominent role than in other countries, with MPs from the support parties often being appointed to [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministerial portfolios]] outside of Cabinet.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/what-is-confidence-and-supply-and-how-does-it-differ-from-a-coalition.html|title=What is confidence and supply… and how does it differ from a coalition?|date=2017-04-10|work=Newshub|access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref> New Zealand codified the procedures it used to form these Governments in its Cabinet Manual.<ref name="dpmc nz">{{cite web |title=CO (17) 10: Labour-New Zealand First Coalition, with Confidence and Supply from the Green Party: Consultation and Operating Arrangements |url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/publications/co-17-10-labour-new-zealand-first-coalition-confidence-and-supply-green-party |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>

[[John Key]]'s [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] administration formed a minority government in [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], [[United Future]] and the [[Māori Party]].<ref name=bryant>{{cite news |last1=Bryant |first1=Nick |title=Lessons from New Zealand in art of coalition building |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8665835.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 May 2010}}</ref> A similar arrangement in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]] had led to [[Helen Clark]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] forming a coalition government with the [[Jim Anderton's Progressive Party|Progressive Party]], with support on confidence and supply from [[New Zealand First]] and [[United Future]]. After the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014]] election, National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with United Future, the ACT Party, and the Māori Party. In 2017, despite National winning more votes than Labour in the election, New Zealand First chose to enter coalition with Labour to help them change the government, with support on confidence and supply from the left-wing [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]].<ref name="dpmc nz"/>

===United Kingdom===
Between 1977 and 1978, [[Jim Callaghan|Jim Callaghan's]] [[British Labour Party|Labour Party]] stayed in power thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], in a deal which became known as the [[Lib-Lab Pact]].

In the aftermath of the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] which left [[Theresa May]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] without a majority, a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] was agreed with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peck|first1=Tom|title=Theresa May to enter into 'confidence and supply' arrangement with the Democratic Unionists|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservative-dup-confidence-and-supply-coalition-formal-cabinet-positions-northern-irish-a7783741.html|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The Independent|date=10 June 2017}}</ref>
