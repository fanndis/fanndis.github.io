Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the [[South China Sea]], and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of {{convert|35|°C}}+ temperatures.<ref name = "SZMB via 21CMA"/> The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have {{convert|50|mm|2|abbr=on}} or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least {{convert|100|mm|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "SZMB via 21CMA"/> The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around {{convert|1970|mm|0|abbr=on}}, some of which is delivered in [[typhoon]]s that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|0.2|°C|0}} on 11 February 1957 to {{convert|38.7|°C|0}} on 10 July 1980.<ref name = Mherrera>{{cite web|url= http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|title= Extreme Temperatures Around the World|access-date= 4 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140804202145/http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|archive-date= 4 August 2014|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

'''Special Economic Zone Border'''

To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line ({{zh|c=二线关|t=|s=|p=}}).<ref name=":12" /><ref name="exg1" /> Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering.<!-- source: https://web.archive.org/web/20110822011808/http://jt.sz.bendibao.com/news/201068/210926_2.htm --> Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.<!-- source: https://web.archive.org/web/20110822011808/http://jt.sz.bendibao.com/news/201068/210926_2.htm -->

===Historic===
There had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the [[Southern Song dynasty]] (1127–1279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.

Shenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of ''the world's factory''.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012–13, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a year over year increase of 500,000.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sohu.com/a/309371540_119778 |script-title=zh:深圳户籍人口增幅有所放缓 2018年年末常住人口1302万人_移民城市}}</ref>

===Other statistics===
At present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/4_9_age_composition_and_dependency_ratio.html|title=Age Composition and Dependency Ratio of Population by Region (2004)|work=China Statistics 2005|access-date=5 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204033531/http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/4_9_age_composition_and_dependency_ratio.html|archive-date=4 December 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.

According to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://journalism.hkbu.edu.hk/feed/?p=3034|title=Cross-border Commuters Live Hard between Hong Kong and Shenzhen {{!}} Feed Magazine - HKBU MA International Journalism Student Stories|website=journalism.hkbu.edu.hk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322095624/http://journalism.hkbu.edu.hk/feed/?p=3034|archive-date=22 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|date=18 March 2014}}</ref> Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (SAR) is restricted.

{{Asof|2007}} there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the [[Nanshan District, Shenzhen|Nanshan]] and [[Futian District|Futian]] districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000<!--"According to Kang, half of the city’s 20,000 Koreans live at Overseas Chinese Town, [...]" from source--> lived in [[Overseas Chinese Town]] (OCT).

South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.<ref name="Donghai" />

In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.<ref name="2ndhometown" />

There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, [[Korean International School in Shenzhen]].<!--Not cited from 2ndhometown--> {{Asof|2007}} there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals.<ref name="2ndhometown" /> {{Asof|2014}} spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools.<ref name="Donghai" /> In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in [[Luohu District]], and 200 enrolled at the [[Baishizhou]] Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.<ref name="2ndhometown" />

Hong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below.

As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the [[Shenzhen Bay Port]], [[Futian Port]], [[Huanggang Port]], [[Man Kam To Control Point|Man Kam To Port]], [[Luohu Port]] and [[Shatoujiao Port]]. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.szonline.net/pg/by/a2872.html|title=Archived copy|script-title=zh:深圳九大口岸通关攻略|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905095300/http://life.szonline.net/pg/by/a2872.html|archive-date=5 September 2016|url-status=live|access-date=9 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="HKG Monthly Digest of Statistics">HKG Monthly Digest of Statistics</ref>

In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.<ref>HKG Traffic and Transport Digest</ref>  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 [[teus]]/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary,<ref>HKG Cross Boundary Survey 2004</ref> while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.<ref>HKG Shipping Statistics</ref>

Trade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333&nbsp;billion of imports of which US$298&nbsp;billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.<ref>HKG Trade and Industry Statistics</ref>  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.<ref name="hongkongairport.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkongairport.com|title=Hong Kong International Airport – Your Regional Hub with Worldwide Connections and Gateway to China|publisher=Hongkongairport.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106112338/http://www.hongkongairport.com/|archive-date=6 January 2010|url-status=live|access-date=5 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.<ref name="HKG Monthly Digest of Statistics" />  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card ([[Home Return Permit]]) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.<ref name="hongkongairport.com" />

Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon{{when|date=October 2014}}. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.<ref>HKG Cross Boundary Survey 1999 & 2003</ref>

After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of [[Zhongshan]] on the Western side: the [[Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge]].

Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tse|first1=Constant|title=State Council Approves Preferential Policies for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone|journal=Deloitte|volume=169}}</ref> With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from [[HSBC]], "This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence."<ref name="nzcta.co.nz3" />
