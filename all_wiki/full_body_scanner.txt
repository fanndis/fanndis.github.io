A '''full-body scanner''' is a device that detects objects on or inside a person's body for security screening purposes, without physically removing clothes or making physical contact. Depending on the technology used, the operator may see an alternate-wavelength image of the person's naked body, merely a cartoon-like representation of the person with an indicator showing where any suspicious items were detected or full [[X-ray]] image of the person. For privacy and security reasons, the display is generally not visible to other passengers, and in some cases is located in a separate room where the operator cannot see the face of the person being screened. Unlike [[metal detector]]s, full-body scanners can detect non-metal objects, which became an increasing concern after various airliner bombing attempts in the 2000s. Transmission X-ray body scanners can also [[Mule (smuggling)|detect swallowed items]] or [[Body cavity search|hidden in body cavities]] of a person.  

Starting in 2007, full-body scanners started supplementing metal detectors at [[Airport security|airports]] and train stations in many countries.

Three distinct technologies have been used, though the use of [[Backscatter X-ray]] has now been discontinued in many countries:
* [[Millimeter wave scanner]]s use non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation similar to that used by wireless data transmitters, in the [[Extremely high frequency|Extremely High Frequency (EHF)]] radio band (which is a lower frequency than visible light). The health risks posed by these machines are still being studied, and the evidence is mixed, though millimeter wave scanners do not generate [[ionizing radiation]]. <ref name="health_privacy">{{cite web|url=http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |work=Security Management |title=Companies Seek Full-Body Scans That Ease Health, Privacy Concerns |author=Harwood, Matthew |date=March 5, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006112416/http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |archivedate=October 6, 2014  }}</ref> 
* [[Backscatter X-ray]] machines use low dose penetrating radiation for detecting suspicious metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing or in shoes and in the cavities of the human body.<ref>{{cite web|title='AMAZING RESULTS' OF THE SCANNER THAT 'SEES EVERYTHING' |url=http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |work=Moscow Domodedovo Airport |date=October 2, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303102333/http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |archivedate=March 3, 2016  }}</ref> Considerable debate regarding the safety of this method sparked investigations, ultimately leading multiple countries to ban the usage of them.
* Transmission (Penetrating) [[X-Ray|X-ray]] security scanners. In these scanners, X-ray radiation passes through the human body and then is captured by a detector or array of detectors. It is this type of full body scanners that allows you to detect objects hidden not only under clothes, but also inside the human body (for example, drugs carried by drug couriers in the stomach) or in its natural cavities. The dose received is usually not higher than 0.25 μSv and is mainly regulated by the American radiation safety standard for personal search systems using gamma or X-ray radiation ANSI 43.17.2009.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|date=2019-06-20|title=Products for Security Screening of People|url=https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/security-systems/products-security-screening-people|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Due to the low dose, the resulting image could not have a diagnostic quality for medical purposes but is quite enough to detect items not characteristic for human biology which could be a contraband.[[File:X-ray Drugs in Stomach.jpg|alt=Transmission X-ray Full Body Scanner|thumb|230x230px|X-ray image taken by a transmission security scanner of a man with drugs in his stomach]]
Passengers and advocates have objected to images of their naked bodies being displayed to screening agents or recorded by the government. Critics have called the imaging virtual strip searches without probable cause, and have suggested they are illegal and violate basic human rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/10/AR2011031003628.html|title=Group says body scanners an 'unreasonable search'|author=Pickler, Nedra |work=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2011}}</ref> However, current technology is less intrusive and because of [[privacy]] issues most people are allowed to refuse this scan and opt for a [[Frisking|traditional pat-down]]. Transmission X-ray scanners claim to be more privacy neutral as there is almost no way to distinguish a person but they also have a software able to hide privacy issues.

==History (US)==
The first full body security scanner was developed by Dr. Steven W Smith,<ref name="Tek84.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tek84.com/company.html |title=Steven W.

National Public Radio</ref> who developed the Secure 1000 whole body scanner in 1992. He subsequently sold the device and associated patents to [[Rapiscan Systems]], who now manufacture and distribute the device.

The first passive, non-radiating full body screening device was developed by [[Lockheed Martin]] through a sponsorship by the National Institute of Justice ([[NIJ]])'s Office of Science and Technology and the [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory]]. Proof of concept was conducted in 1995 through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Rights to this technology were subsequently acquired by [[Brijot|Brijot Imaging Systems]], who further matured a commercial-grade product line and now manufacture, market and support the passive millimeter wave devices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brijot Acquires Rights to Lockheed Martin-Developed Technology for Design and Development of Concealed Weapons Detection Camera, Supporting Counter-Terrorism and Homeland Security Efforts |work=Business Wire |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90526909.html | location=Orlando | date=August 20, 2002}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Safety aspects of the Secure 1000 have been assessed in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] and other independent sources since the early 1990s. <ref>J.

[[Schiphol]] in the [[Netherlands]] was the first [[airport]] in the world to implement this device on a large scale after a test with flight personnel the previous year. On May 15, 2007 two of 17 purchased security scans were installed. 

The Italian government had planned to install full-body scanners at all airport and train stations throughout the country, but announced in September 2010 plans to remove the scanners from airports, calling them "slow and ineffective."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/italy-to-abandon-airport-body-scanners-20100924-15pgu.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Italy to abandon airport body scanners | date=September 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Health concerns===
There have been health concerns relating to the use of full body scanning technology, especially the use of X-ray scanners. Mainly the issue is regulated by ANSI 43.17.2009 making a limitation to the dose per one person. However this document is referred mainly to airport security of year of 2010 and not adopted to modern threats and terrorist detection in high security (prisons, airports) or military institutions and correspondent threats like liquid bombs inside body cavities, swallowed drugs which are not possible to detect by any other means but transmission X-ray by technology limitations. 

From the other side, transmission X-ray with 0.25 μSv per scan alongside with yearly limit at 250 µSv (by same ANSI) lets a person for max 1000 scans per year. Therefore counting all medical X-ray procedures and assuming the dose per year to be not more than 250 µSv in total, one can say that it will shorten the amount of flights/scans dramatically for a person if X-ray transmission technology will be used under current limitations.

====Millimeter wave scanners====
{{Main article|Millimeter wave scanner}}
Currently adopted millimeter wave scanners operate in the millimeter or sub-terahertz band, using [[non-ionizing radiation]], and have no proven adverse health effects, though no long term studies have been done.<ref name="businessweek.com" /> Thomas S. Tenforde, president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, said in 2010 that millimeter wave scanners are probably within bounds [of standards for safe operation], but there should be an effort to verify that they are safe for frequent use.<ref name="businessweek.com" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Hayes |first=John C. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/safety/content/article/113619/1509059 |title=Whole-body airport scanners are basically safe—or are they? |publisher=Diagnosticimaging.com |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> WHO (World Health Organization) in 2011 categorized RF (radio frequency) radiation as a possible carcinogen. <ref>{cite web|url=https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr208_E.pdf}</ref>

Numerical simulations of [[terahertz radiation]], which active millimeter wave scanners do not operate at, have produced mixed results. Researchers at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico have used simulations to show a way that terahertz radiation may affect DNA,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alexandrov|first1=B.S.|title= DNA Breathing Dynamics in the Presence of a Terahertz Field|journal=Physics Letters A|date=October 29, 2009|volume=374|issue=10|pages=1214–1217|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2009.12.077|pmid=20174451|pmc=2822276|arxiv=0910.5294 |bibcode=2010PhLA..374.1214A}}</ref> However, this has not been verified.

====Backscatter X-ray scanners====

"I am very interested in performing a National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements study on the use of millimeter-wave security screening systems," said Thomas S. Tenforde, council president. However, no long-term studies have been done on the health effects of millimeter wave scanners.

Perhaps the most notable and debated professional opinion in regard to the safety of scanners is the so-called "Holdren Letter" from a number of world-renowned biochemists and biophysics researchers from the University of California to the Assistant to the US President for Science and Technology, Dr. John P. Holdren (Co-author of EcoSolutions). The opening paragraph of their letter of concern reads: "We, a number of University of California, San Francisco faculty, are writing—see attached memo—to call your attention to our concerns about the potential serious health risks of the recently adopted whole body back scatter X-ray airport security scanners. This is an urgent situation as these X-ray scanners are rapidly being implemented as a primary screening step for all air travel passengers."<ref>[https://shadowproof.com/letter-from-john-w-sedat-et-al-on-the-dangers-of-tsa-backscatter-scanners/ Letter from John W.

Critics of backscatter x-ray scanners, including the head of the [[Center for Radiological Research]] at [[Columbia University]], say that the radiation emitted by some full-body scanners is as much as 20 times stronger than officially reported and is not safe to use on large numbers of persons because of an increased risk of cancer to children and at-risk populations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport-body-scanners-could-give-you-cancer.html|title=Airport body scanners 'could give you cancer'|author=Bloxham, Andy |publisher=The Telegraph|location=London|date=June 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/health/Some |title=Some full-body scanners not without cancer risk: Experts |publisher=Canwest News Service |author=Tam, Pauline |date=January 22, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115144315/http://www.canada.com/health/Some+full+body+scanners+without+cancer+risk+Experts/2472370/story.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292414|date=May 23, 2010 |title=Radiation from airport scanners may increase cancer risk|author=Lindner, Bill |publisher=Digital Journal}}</ref>
Researchers at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], (UCSF) have argued that the amount of radiation is higher than claimed by the TSA and body scanner manufacturers because the doses were calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, but the radiation from backscatter x-ray scanners is focused on just the skin and surrounding tissues:<ref name="scribd.com" /><ref>Carmichael, Scott. (May 18, 2010) [http://www.gadling.com/2010/05/18/scientists-question-safety-of-airport-full-body-scanners/ Scientists question safety of airport full body scanners]. Gadling.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/radiation The risk of 'low dose radiation is controversial']. Radiology.ucsf.edu (February 14, 2010). Retrieved on November 1, 2011.</ref>

<blockquote>The majority of [the scanners'] energy is delivered to the skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.

The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.

In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant radiation quantity, the Flux [photons per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device)] has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.</blockquote>

However other professors in the UCSF radiology department disagree, saying that the radiation dose is low.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/11/tsa_scanner_controversy_ucsf_r.php|title=TSA Scanners: U.C. San Francisco Radiologists Debunk Radiation Fears|author=Smiley, Lauren |date=November 2010|publisher=SFWeekly}}</ref> "The conclusions are wrong," Ronald Arenson, professor of radiology, tells SF Weekly of his own institution's letter. "People who are totally unrelated to radiation wrote it. ... It was senior faculty at UCSF. They're smart people and well-intended, but their conclusions, I think, were off-base. They don't understand how radiation translates to an actual dose in the human body".

Dr. Steve Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, and president of Tek84, one of the companies that produces the machines, has stated that the concerns of Dr. Brenner and UCSF Scientists regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners are incorrect. He states the values used for X-ray penetration were incorrectly based on the description of the imaging depth which describes what the instrument sees and is a few mm into the skin and the dosage depth which is deeper. He describes experimental proof that the X-rays have the same properties as any other X-Rays and the penetration is correct to be averaged over the whole body. Dr. Smith has provided measured data from an operating body scanner to explain his position.<ref>[http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf re: Misinformation on airport body scanner radiation safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203604/http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}.

Scanners also concentrate the dose in time, because they deliver a high dose-rate at the moment of exposure. High dose-rate exposure has been shown to cause greater damage than the same radiation dose delivered at lower rates.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8140(86)80181-5|title=Dose-rate effects and the repair of radiation damage|year=1986|last1=Gordonsteel|first1=G|last2=Down|first2=J|last3=Peacock|first3=J|last4=Stephens|first4=T|journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=321–31|pmid=3726169}}</ref> This raises further questions about comparisons to background radiation.

The FDA report states:

<blockquote>Since general-use x-ray systems emit ionizing radiation, the societal benefit of reliably detecting threats must be sufficient to outweigh the potential radiation risk, if any, to the individual screened. The dose from one screening with a general-use x-ray security screening system is so low that it presents an extremely small risk to any individual. To put the radiation dose received into perspective:
* Naturally occurring ionizing radiation is all around us. We are continuously exposed to this background radiation during ordinary living. In 42 minutes of ordinary living, a person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources than from screening with any general-use x-ray security system.
* The national radiation safety standard (see below) sets a dose per screening limit for the general-use category. To meet the requirements of the general-use category a full-body x-ray security system must deliver less than the dose a person receives during 4 minutes of airline flight. TSA has set their dose limit to ensure a person receives less radiation from one scan with a TSA general-use x-ray security system than from 2 minutes of airline flight.
* A person would have to be screened more than a thousand times in one year in order to exceed the annual radiation dose limit for people screening that has been set by expert radiation safety organizations (see below).
* Millimeter wave security systems which comply with the limits set in the applicable national non-ionizing radiation safety standard (see below) cause no known adverse health effects.</blockquote>

Dr. David Brenner, head of Columbia University's center for radiological research, said although the danger posed to the individual passenger is "very low", he is urging researchers to carry out more tests on the device to look at the way it affects specific groups who could be more sensitive to radiation. 

Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University, has made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:<ref name="businessweek.com" /> "A passenger would need to be scanned using a backscatter scanner, from both the front and the back, about 200,000 times to receive the amount of radiation equal to one typical CT scan," said Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. "Another way to look at this is that if you were scanned with a backscatter scanner every day of your life, you would still only receive a tenth of the dose of a typical CT scan," he said. "By comparison, the amount of radiation from a backscatter scanner is equivalent to about 10 minutes of natural background radiation in the United States", Einstein said. "I believe that the general public has nothing to worry about in terms of the radiation from airline scanning," he added. "For moms-to-be, no evidence supports an increased risk of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities from these scanners", Einstein added. "A pregnant woman will receive much more radiation from cosmic rays she is exposed to while flying than from passing through a scanner in the airport," he claimed.

In May 2010 the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements issued a press release in response to the health risk claims from UCSF and Columbia University (claims of excessive skin dose and risks to large populations vs. individuals). The NCRP claims that cancer risks cited by opponents are completely inaccurate, stating that:<ref>[http://www.ncrponline.org/Press_Rel/Commentaries/Comm_16_Press_Release.pdf Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage Radiotherapy Facilities].

<blockquote> the summation of trivial average risks over very large populations or time periods into a single value produces a distorted image of risk, completely out of perspective with risks accepted every day, both voluntarily and involuntarily.</blockquote>

and that

<blockquote>general-use systems should adhere to an effective dose of 0.1 microsievert (μSv) (0.01 millirem) or less per scan, and can be used mostly without regard to the number of individuals scanned or the number of scans per individual in a year. An effective dose of 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem) per scan would allow 2,500 scans of an individual annually [i.e., if each scan required 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem)] without exceeding the administrative control of 0.25 mSv (25 mrem) to a member of the general public for a single source or set of sources under one control. Assuming 250 workdays per year, this would correspond to an average of 10 scans each day, a frequency that is unlikely to be encountered.</blockquote>

All the same the Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safety which includes the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] and the [[World Health Organization]], reported that, "Pregnant women and children should not be subject to scanning, even though the radiation dose from body scanners is 'extremely small'".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aoG.YbbvnkzU&pos=11|title=Airport Body Scanning Raises Radiation Exposure, Committee Says|author=Tirone, Jonathan |publisher=Bloomberg|date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

It has also been suggested that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. The researchers write:<ref name="scribd.com">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35498347/UCSF-letter-to-Holdren-concerning-health-risks-of-full-body-scanner-TSA-screenings-4-6-2010 UCSF letter to Holdren concerning health risks of full body scanner TSA screenings 4-6-2010].

<blockquote>Moreover, there are a number of 'red flags' related to the hardware itself. Because this device can scan a human in a few seconds, the X-ray beam is very intense. Any glitch in power at any point in the hardware (or more importantly in software) that stops the device could cause an intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin. Who will oversee problems with overall dose after repair or software problems? The TSA is already complaining about resolution limitations; who will keep the manufacturers and/or TSA from just raising the dose, an easy way to improve signal-to-noise and get higher resolution? Lastly, given the recent incident (on December 25th), how do we know whether the manufacturer or TSA, seeking higher resolution, will scan the groin area more slowly leading to a much higher total dose?</blockquote>

Proponents of backscatter X-ray scanners argue that the ANSI N43.17 standard addresses safety requirements and engineering design of the systems to prevent the occurrence of accidental high radiation due to defects and errors in hardware and software. Safety requirements include "fail-safe" controls, multiple overlapping interlocks and engineering design to ensure that failure of any systems result in safe or non-operation of the system to reduce the chance of accidental exposures. Furthermore, TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.<ref>ANSI N43.17 (2009) section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} But there are cases where types of medical scanning machines, operated by trained medical personnel, have malfunctioned, causing serious injury to patients that were scanned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/health/01radiation.html|title=After Stroke Scans, Patients Face Serious Health Risks|author=Bogdanich, Walt |work=New York Times|date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> Critics of full-body scanners cite these incidents as examples of how radiation-based scanning machines can overdose people with radiation despite all safety precautions.<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-stanley/full-body-scanners-from-a_b_694466.html Jay Stanley: Full Body Scanners: From Airports to the Streets?].

==== Transmission (penetrating) ====
[[File:Artificial Intelligence for X-ray inspection.png|thumb|190x190px|Artificial Intelligence software detecting objects on the human body X-ray image in transmission (penetrating) body scanner]]
Unlike the above, transmission technology allows to detect objects swallowed or hidden inside the objects. This is the main reason it is commonly used in prisons and jails. However the current technology does not allow the dual-energy body scanning (and detecting the object by its atomic number like it is used in baggage or vehicle X-ray scanners) which could give the image the same detection effectiveness as regular black and white X-ray. This leads to the idea that human-held detection (finding threats by looking at the image and finding non-common to the human body items) is the most effective way to find a contraband. However counting a human factor (fatigue, decreased attention) threats still could be missed. Modern software based on [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] in full body scanners is designed to minimize human faults and rise the detection effectiveness of this method.

New software for scanners has been applied by US Aviation Security so that the scanner will not show a [[Nudity|nude]] image to the operator, but only a featureless male or female figure. Opponents of full body scanners still consider this an unconstitutional strip search, because even though the operator sees only an edited version of the image, a naked image is still captured by the machine, and there is no guarantee the Government or a private company won't store it in the case that a terrorist attack were successful.

This type of software has been applied at Washington, Atlanta and Las Vegas airports.<ref>{{cite web|last=Halsey |first=Ashley |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2015670654_nudescanners21.html |title=New airport software to end naked scanner images |publisher=Seattletimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref>

"Our top priority is the safety of the traveling public, and TSA constantly strives to explore and implement new technologies that enhance security and strengthen privacy protections for the traveling public," TSA Administrator John Pistole stated. "This software upgrade enables us to continue providing a high level of security through advanced imaging technology screening, while improving the passenger experience at checkpoints." <ref>{{cite news|last=Hachman|first=Mark|title=No more 'naked' full body airport scans after TSA upgrade|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388855,00.asp|publisher=PCMAG|accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref>

==Technical countermeasures==
Some people wish to address privacy and health problems that might be associated with a backscatter scan. One company sells underwear that is said to provide X-ray absorption equivalent to 0.5&nbsp;mm of lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockyflatsgear.com/ |title=Rocky Flats Gear X-ray protection |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901143535/http://www.rockyflatsgear.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2013  }}</ref> Another product, Flying Pasties, is "designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners", but it claims no protection from X-rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingpasties.com/ |title=Flying Pasties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601134012/http://flyingpasties.com/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}</ref>
