==Life and career==
Bob Doris was born in the [[Vale of Leven]], [[Dunbartonshire]] and educated at the [[University of Glasgow]] earning an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] in Social Sciences. At the 2007 election Doris contested the Glasgow Maryhill Scottish Parliament constituency, finishing second to Patricia Ferguson, majority 2,300.

Prior to the election Doris had acted as campaign manager to Bill Wilson when Wilson challenged [[John Swinney]] for the SNP leadership in 2003. Doris convened the SNP Maryhill Constituency Branch and Glasgow Regional Association SNP (GRA) for a number of years. Before the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections Doris was set to be council candidate for the Maryhill/Kelvin ward at the Glasgow City Council elections of 2007. He resigned his nomination for the Council seat to avoid the possibility of being elected on a dual mandate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Since his election, Doris campaigned successfully on a number of issues including [[free school meal]]s, kinship care payments and Town Centre Regeneration Fund money for Glasgow. He was a leading campaigner against Glasgow City Council's closure of 20 primary and nursery schools, and supported the parental occupation of Wyndford Primary School and St Gregory's Primary School, both in Maryhill. Doris convenes the Scottish Parliament's cross party group on Racial Equality in Scotland and the cross-party group on Rare, Genetic And Undiagnosed Conditions.<ref>https://www.parliament.scot/msps/rare-genetic-and-undiagnosed-conditions.aspx</ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]], Doris was the SNP candidate for the redrawn seat of [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn]]. He was also placed 3rd on the SNP regional list for [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow]] behind [[Nicola Sturgeon]] and [[Humza Yousaf]].
