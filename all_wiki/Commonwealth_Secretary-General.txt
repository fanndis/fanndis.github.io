The '''Commonwealth [[Secretary-General]]''' is the head of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the central body which has served the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since its establishment in 1965, and responsible for representing the Commonwealth publicly.<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/169940/role_of_the_commonwealth_secretary_general/ |title=Role of the Secretary-General |accessdate=5 April 2008 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029114459/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/169940/role_of_the_commonwealth_secretary_general/ |archive-date=29 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Commonwealth Secretary-General should not be confused with the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], who is currently [[Elizabeth II]].

==Role==
The position was created, along with the Secretariat itself, after [[1965 Commonwealth Prime Ministers%27 Conference|the fourteenth]] [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference]] in London in 1965, issued a memorandum describing the role of the Secretary-General:
{{cquote|Both the Secretary-General and his/her staff should be seen to be the servants of Commonwealth countries collectively. They derive their functions from the authority of [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]]; and in the discharge of his/her responsibilities in this connection the Secretary-General should have access to Heads of Government...<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General" />}}

The headquarters of the Secretary-General, as with the Secretariat generally, is [[Marlborough House]], a former royal residence in London, which was placed at the disposal of the Secretariat by Queen Elizabeth II.  However, as the building cannot house all of the Secretariat's staff in London, additional space is rented elsewhere in London.<ref name="Doxey">{{cite journal |last=Doxey |first=Margaret |date=January 1979 |title=The Commonwealth Secretary-General: Limits of Leadership |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=67–83 |doi=10.2307/2617133}}</ref> From this operational base, a large part of the Secretary-General's work involves travelling around the Commonwealth keeping in personal contact with those at the heart of the governments of member states.<ref name="Doxey" />

The Secretary-General receives a salary of nearly £160,000 (2015) and a four‑storey mansion, Garden House, in [[Mayfair]] as an official residence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baroness Patricia Scotland becomes first UK citizen to be elected secretary‑general of Commonwealth|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/baroness-patricia-scotland-becomes-first-uk-citizen-to-be-elected-secretary-general-of-commonwealth-a6752211.html|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=27 November 2015}}</ref>

==Staff and responsibility==
The Secretary-General leads the Commonwealth Secretariat, and all Secretariat staff are responsible and answerable to him or her.  He or she is supported by three [[Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General|Deputy Secretaries-General]], which are elected by the Heads of Government via the members' High Commissioners in London.<ref name="Doxey" /> Currently, the three Deputy Secretaries-General are Deodat Maharaj, Gary Dunn and Josephine Ojiambo.  Until 2014, only two Deputy Secretaries-General were appointed along with an Assistant Secretary-General for Corporate Affairs. The Secretary-General may appoint junior staff at their own discretion, provided the Secretariat can afford it, whilst more senior staff may be appointed only from a shortlist of nominations from the Heads of Government.<ref name="Doxey" /> In practice, the Secretary-General has more power than this; member governments consult the Secretary-General on nominations, and the Secretary-General has also at times submitted nominations of his own.<ref name="Doxey" />

Formally, the Secretary-General is given the same rank as a [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] or ambassador.  However, in practice, his or her rank is considerably higher.<ref name="Doxey" /> At CHOGMs, he or she is the equal of the Heads of Government, except with preference deferred to the longest-serving Head of Government.  At other ministerial meetings, he or she is considered ''[[primus inter pares]]''.<ref name="Doxey" /> But for the first 3 years (of the job's existence) the Foreign Office refused to invite the Secretary-General to the Queen's annual diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace, much to [[Arnold Smith]]'s irritation, until in 1968 this refusal was over-ridden by the Queen herself<ref> ''Final Approaches: A Memoir'' by Gerald Hensley, page 99 (2006, Auckland University Press, New Zealand) {{ISBN|1-86940-378-9}} </ref>

The Secretary-General was originally required to submit annual reports to the Heads of Government, but this has since been changed to reporting at biennial [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s (CHOGM).<ref name="Doxey" /> The Secretary-General is held responsible by the Commonwealth's Board of Governors in London.<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General" />

==Election==
Since the 1993 CHOGM, it has been decided that the Secretary-General is elected to a [[term limit|maximum]] of two four-year terms.<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General" /> The election is held by the assembled Heads of Government and other ministerial representatives at every other CHOGM.  Nominations are received from the member states' governments, who sponsor the nomination through the election process and are responsible for withdrawing their candidate as they see fit.<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General" />

The election is held in a Restricted Session of the CHOGM, in which only Heads of Government or ministerial representatives thereof may be present.  The Chair of the CHOGM (the Head of Government of the host nation) is responsible for ascertaining which candidate has the greatest support, through the conduct of negotiations and [[secret ballot|secret]] [[straw poll]]s.<ref name="Role of the Secretary-General" />

There is usually a convention that an incumbent seeking a second term in office is elected unopposed for his or her second term.<ref>{{cite news |first=Amit |last=Baruah |title= PM, Blair for representative government in Iraq soon |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/12/07/stories/2003120705120100.htm |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=7 December 2003 |accessdate=27 July 2007 }}</ref> However, this was broken by a [[Zimbabwe]]-backed bid for Sri Lankan [[Lakshman Kadirgamar]] to displace New Zealand's [[Don McKinnon]] in 2003.  At the vote, however, Kadirgamar was easily defeated by McKinnon, with only 11 members voting for him against 40 for McKinnon.<ref name="Editorial: CHOGM 2003">{{cite journal |date=January 2004 |title=Editorial: CHOGM 2003, Abuja, Nigeria |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=373 |pages=3–6 |doi=10.1080/0035853042000188139 }}</ref>

At the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|2011 CHOGM]], India's [[Kamalesh Sharma]] was re-elected to his second term unopposed.  Sharma had won the position at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007|2007 CHOGM]], when he defeated [[Malta]]'s [[Michael Frendo]] to replace McKinnon, who had served the maximum two terms.

At the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015|2015 CHOGM]], [[Patricia Scotland]], a former British cabinet minister, was nominated for Commonwealth Secretary-General by her native country of [[Dominica]] and defeated [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antiguan]] diplomat Sir [[Ronald Sanders (diplomat)|Ronald Sanders]] and former [[Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General|deputy secretary-general for political affairs]] [[Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba]] of [[Botswana]] to become the 6th Commonwealth Secretary-General and the first woman to hold the post. She took office on 1 April 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Commonwealth elects first woman secretary general|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151127/local/commonwealth-elects-first-woman-secretary-general.593722|accessdate=27 November 2015|work=Times of Malta|date=27 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Scotland vies to be next Commonwealth secretary general|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/24/lady-scotland-vying-next-commonwealth-secretary-general|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 November 2015}}</ref>
