The '''Edmund Pettus Bridge''' carries [[U.S. Route 80 Business (Selma, Alabama)|U.S. Route&nbsp;80 Business]] (US&nbsp;80 Bus.) across the [[Alabama River]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. Built in 1940, it is named after [[Edmund Pettus|Edmund Winston Pettus]], a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[brigadier general (CSA)|brigadier general]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]], and leader of the Alabama [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The bridge is a steel [[through arch bridge]] with a central span of {{convert|250|ft}}. Nine large concrete arches support the bridge and roadway on the east side.

The Edmund Pettus Bridge was the site of the conflict of [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] on March 7, 1965, when police attacked [[Civil Rights Movement]] demonstrators with horses, billy clubs, and tear gas<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/places/alabama-the-selmatomontgomery-march.htm |title=We Shall Overcome – Selma-to-Montgomery March |publisher=National Park Service |date=April 23, 2020 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref> as they were [[Selma to Montgomery marches|attempting to march]] to the state capital, [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The marchers crossed the bridge again on March 21 and walked to the [[Alabama State Capitol|Capitol building]].

The bridge was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on February 27, 2013.<ref name="nps_nhl"/><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/americas-great-outdoors-secretary-salazar-director-jarvis-designate-13-new-national-historic-landmarks.cfm |title=America's Great Outdoors: Secretary Salazar, Director Jarvis Designate 13 New National Historic Landmarks |publisher=US Department of the Interior |date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate=July 26, 2020}}</ref>

== Design ==
The bridge carries four lanes of U.S. Route 80 Business (formerly the mainline [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|U.S. Route 80]]<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. 80 |url=https://www.aaroads.com/guides/us-080-al/ |access-date=July 26, 2020 |website=AARoads |language=en-US}}</ref>) over the Alabama River, from Selma on the west side, to points east. The bridge has a total of 11 spans. It has 10 smaller concrete spans, while the main span in the center, over the river, is made of steel. Because Selma is built on a bluff over the river, the west side of the bridge is higher than the east side. The center of the bridge is {{Convert|100|feet|meters|abbr=on}} over the river. In 2011, the bridge was listed as [[functionally obsolete]], meaning that it does not meet current design standards for its current traffic load.<ref name=":0" />

==Name==
[[File:E W Pettus CSA ACW.JPG|left|thumb|150px|[[Edmund Winston Pettus]]]]
The bridge is named after [[Edmund Winston Pettus]], a lawyer, judge, Confederate brigadier general, state-level leader ("[[Grand dragon|Grand Dragon]]") of the Alabama [[Ku Klux Klan]], and U.S. senator.<ref>{{cite web| last=Watson| first=Elbert L.| title=Edmund Pettus| url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2962| url-status=live| date=January 5, 2015| accessdate=July 21, 2020| website=[[Encyclopedia of Alabama]]| language=en}}</ref>

Because of Pettus' role in supporting [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racism in the United States]], there have been efforts to rename the bridge, including one coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in 2015. Changing the name would require approval from the [[Alabama Legislature]]. <ref name=":1">{{cite news |last=Peeples |first=Melanie |date=March 5, 2015 |title=The Racist History Behind The Iconic Selma Bridge |series=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/edmund-pettus-the-man-and-namesake-of-the-iconic-selma-bridge/ |accessdate=July 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Desmond-Harris| first=Jenee| date=March 9, 2015| title=Inside the fight to strip a KKK leader's name from Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge| journal=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]| url=https://www.vox.com/2015/3/7/8164801/selma-edmund-pettus-bridge-kkk| access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> One proposed alternative namesake is [[John Lewis]], a civil rights leader who played a prominent role in the Selma to Montgomery marches and later a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]].

== History ==
=== Construction ===
An earlier bridge was built in 1885 by the [[Milwaukee Bridge & Iron Works]] one block east of the current bridge to carry traffic over the river at the foot of Washington Street.  It was an iron camelback [[truss bridge|truss]] bridge with three spans, supported on stone piers.  The northernmost span swung open to allow boats to pass.  It had to be operated by a bridge tender, whose house remains at the bridge site to the present day.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Walter Mahan| last1=Jackson| title=The Story of Selma| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5s2YtIJLAC&q=Milwaukee+Bridge+%26+Iron+Works+selma+alabama&pg=PA324| accessdate=July 26, 2020| year=1957| publisher=Birmingham Printing Co| pages=323–326}}</ref>

The Edmund Pettus Bridge was designed by Selma native Henson Stephenson and opened to traffic in 1940.<ref name=":0">{{cite news| url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/03/06/selma_anniversary_how_the_edmund_pettus_bridge_design_influenced_the_bloody.html| title=How the Design of a Selma Bridge Became a Metaphor for the Civil Rights Movement| last=O'Neill| first=Connor| date=March 6, 2015| magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

In 1965, voting rights for  African Americans were a contentious issue. In Selma, voting rolls were 99% White and 1% African American, while the 1960 Census found that the population of Alabama was 30% nonwhite.<ref name=Time>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,833543-1,00.html |title=Nation: The Central Points |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 19, 1965 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37721510v1p2.pdf |title=Census of Population: 1960 |publisher=Bureau of the Census |year=1963 |accessdate=July 26, 2020}}</ref> In February 1965, state troopers and locals in Marion, Alabama, started an armed confrontation with some 400 African-American unarmed demonstrators. [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]] was shot in the stomach, and he died eight days later. As word spread of the shooting and of Jackson's condition the case alarmed civil rights activists, including [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC']]s Director of Direct Action [[James Bevel]]. Director Bevel planned a peaceful march from Selma to the Alabama capitol building in Montgomery, which first required crossing the Pettus bridge leading out of Selma and onto the state highway.<ref name=Time/>

On March 7, 1965, armed police attacked the unarmed peaceful civil rights demonstrators [[Selma to Montgomery marches|attempting to march]] to the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in an incident that became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]. Because of the design of the bridge, the protesters were unable to see the police officers on the east side of the bridge until after they had reached the top of the bridge. The protesters first saw the police while at the center of the bridge, {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the Alabama River. Upon seeing them, protester [[Hosea Williams]] asked his fellow protester [[John Lewis]] if he knew how to swim. Despite the danger ahead, the protesters bravely continued marching.<ref name=":0" /> They were then attacked and brutally beaten by police and the state troopers on the other side.

Televised images of the attack presented Americans and international audiences with horrifying images of marchers left bloodied and severely injured, and roused support for the [[Selma Voting Rights Movement]]. [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]], who had helped organize the march as well as participated in it, was beaten unconscious. A photograph of her lying on Edmund Pettus Bridge appeared on the front page of newspapers and news magazines around the world.<ref name="HardyHardy2008">{{cite book| first1=Sheila Jackson| last1=Hardy| author2=P.

Since 1965, many marches have commemorated the events of Bloody Sunday. On its 30th anniversary, Rep. [[John Lewis]], former president of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and a prominent activist during the Selma to Montgomery marches, said, "It's gratifying to come back and see the changes that have occurred; to see the number of registered voters and the number of Black elected officials in the state of Alabama to be able to walk with other members of Congress that are African Americans."<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTkDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22edmund+pettus+bridge%22&pg=PA22| title=Demonstrators in Selma Mark 30th Anniversary of March Across Edmund Pettus Bridge| magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]| pages=22–25| date=March 27, 1995| volume=87| issue=20| publisher=Johnson Publishing Company| issn=0021-5996| accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> On the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, over 10,000 people, including Lewis, again marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrUDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22edmund+pettus+bridge%22&pg=PA6 |title=Thousands Cross Edmund Pettus Bridge During 40th Anniversary of Selma-to-Montgomery March's 'Bloody Sunday'| magazine=Jet| date=March 28, 2005| pages=6–8| volume=107| issue=13|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company| accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

An estimated 40,000 people attended to commemorate the 1965 march, and to reflect on and speak about its impact on history and continuing efforts to address and improve U.S. civil rights.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Baker| first1=Peter| last2=Fausset| first2=Richard| title=Obama, at Selma Memorial, Says, 'We Know the March Is Not Yet Over'| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/us/obama-in-selma-for-edmund-pettus-bridge-attack-anniversary.html| accessdate=March 10, 2015| newspaper=The New York Times| date=March 7, 2015| url-access=subscription}}</ref>
