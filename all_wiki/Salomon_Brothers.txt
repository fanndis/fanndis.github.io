'''Salomon Brothers, Inc.''', was an American multinational [[bulge bracket]] [[investment bank]] headquartered in [[New York City|New York]]. It was one of the five [[List of investment banks|largest investment banking enterprises]] in the United States<ref>[https://fortune.com/1997/10/27/warren-buffett-salomon/ Carol J. Loomis: "Warren Buffet's Wild Ride at Salomon" in ''Fortune'', October 27, 1997]</ref> and the most profitable firm on [[Wall Street]] during the 1980's and 1990's.

==History==
===Founding===
Founded in 1910 by Arthur, Herbert and Percy Salomon and a clerk named Ben Levy, it remained a [[partnership]] until the early 1980s. [[William Salomon]], the son of Percy Salomon, became a managing partner and the head of the company in 1963.<ref>Company Profiles – FundingUniverse 1992">{{cite web | title=History of Salomon Inc. – FundingUniverse | website=Search Thousands of Company Profiles – FundingUniverse | date=November 23, 1992 | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/salomon-inc-history/ | access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref> In 1978, John Gutfreund became a managing partner, and succeeded William Salomon as head of the company.<ref>Michael Lewis, [http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom.html The End], ''Portfolio.com'', 11 November 2008</ref> In 1981, it was acquired by the [[commodity trading]] firm [[Phibro Corporation]] and became ''Salomon Inc''. It was with the [[reverse merger]] which enabled Gutfreund to take the company public. Gutfreund became the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of the company following the reverse merger.<ref>http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Salomon-Inc-Company-History.html</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Lewis |title=[[Liar's Poker|Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street]] |location=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=1989 |page=228 }}</ref>

===Salomon Brothers during the 1980s===
During the 1980s, Salomon was noted for its innovation in the [[Bond (finance)|bond]] market, selling the first [[mortgage-backed security]], a hitherto obscure species of [[financial instrument]] created by [[Government National Mortgage Association|Ginnie Mae]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hojnicki |first1=Carrie |title=The Spectacular Rise And Fall of Salomon Brothers |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/salomon-brothers-treasury-bond-scandal-2012-7 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=11 November 2020}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Salomon purchased [[Mortgage loan|home mortgages]] from [[Savings and loan association|thrifts]] throughout the United States and packaged them into mortgage-backed securities, which it sold to local and international investors. Later, it moved away from traditional investment banking (helping companies raise funds in the [[capital market]] and negotiating [[mergers and acquisitions]]) to almost exclusively [[proprietary trading]] (the buying and selling of [[stock]]s, bonds, [[option (finance)|option]]s, etc. for the profit of the company itself). Salomon had expertise in [[fixed income]] securities and trading based on daily swings in the [[bond market]].<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/10/magazine/too-far-too-fast-salomon-brothers-john-gutfreund.html|title= TOO FAR, TOO FAST; Salomon Brothers' John Gutfreund |first=James|last=Sterngold|work= [[The New York Times]] |date = January 10, 1988 }}</ref>

During this period, the upper management became dissatisfied with the firm's performance. Profits were small and the company's traders were paid in a way that was disconnected from true profitability. There were debates as to which direction the firm should head, whether it should prune down its activities to focus on certain areas. For example, the [[commercial paper]] business unit (providing short term day-to-day financing for large companies) was apparently unprofitable, although some in the firm argued that it was a good activity because it kept the company in constant contact with other businesses' key financial personnel.<ref>{{Cite news| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/salomon-brothers-treasury-bond-scandal-2012-7?op=1|title= The Spectacular Rise And Fall of Salomon Brothers|first=Carrie|last=Hojnicki |publisher= [[Business Insider]] |date = July 3, 2012}}</ref>

Finally, the firm decided to imitate [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], using its investment bankers and its own money to urge companies to restructure or engage in [[leveraged buyout]]s. As a result, the firm competed for the leveraged buyout of [[RJR Nabisco]] and the leveraged buyout of [[Revco]] stores (which ended in failure).<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/02/business/history-of-the-rjr-nabisco-takeover.html|title= History of the RJR Nabisco Takeover|work= [[The New York Times]] |date = December 2, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/31/business/rite-aid-seeks-to-buy-revco-as-salomon-settles-lawsuit.html|title= Rite Aid Seeks to Buy Revco As Salomon Settles Lawsuit|first=Kurt|last=Eichenwald |work= [[The New York Times]] |date = October 31, 1991}}</ref>

Salomon Brothers' success in the 1980s is documented in [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]' 1989 book, ''[[Liar's Poker]]''. Lewis went through Salomon's training program and then became a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers in [[London]]. Lewis presented an insider description of life at Salomon Brothers, and his book became a seminal work in terms of understanding the corporate culture at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s. 

Lewis on the concept of a "Big Swinging Dick":

{{quote|A new employee, once he reached the trading floor, was handed a pair of telephones. He went on-line almost immediately. If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging Dick. After the sale of a big block of bonds and the deposit of a few hundred thousand dollars into the Salomon till, a managing director called whoever was responsible to confirm his identity: "Hey, you Big Swinging Dick, way to be."<ref>Lewis, p. 46</ref>}}

Lewis described the trading floor at Salomon:

{{quote|Because the forty-first floor was the chosen home of the firm's most ambitious people, and because there were no rules governing the pursuit of profit and glory, the men who worked there, including the more bloodthirsty, had a hunted look about them. The place was governed by the simple understanding that the unbridled pursuit of perceived self interest was healthy. Eat or be eaten. The men of 41 worked with one eye cast over their shoulders to see whether someone was trying to do them in, for there was no telling what manner of man had levered himself to the rung below you and was now hungry for your job. The of acceptable conduct within Salomon Brothers was wide indeed. It said something about the ability of the free marketplace to mold people's behavior into a socially acceptable pattern. For this was capitalism at its most raw, and it was self-destructive...<ref>Lewis, pp. 69-70</ref>}}

===1990s treasury bonds scandal===
In 1991, [[U.S. Treasury]] Deputy Assistant Secretary Mike Basham learned that Salomon trader Paul Mozer had been submitting false bids in an attempt to purchase more [[treasury bond]]s than permitted by one buyer during the period between December 1990 and May 1991. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Salomon was fined $190 million for this infraction, and required to set aside $100 million in a restitution fund for any injured parties. CEO Gutfreund left the company in August 1991 and a [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) settlement resulted in a fine of $100,000 and him being barred from serving as a chief executive of a brokerage firm.<ref name=nyt>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DF1639F93AA2575BC0A962958260 Ex-Salomon Chief's Costly Battle], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 19, 1994</ref> The scandal was then documented in the 1993 book ''Nightmare on Wall Street''. The firm was weakened by the scandal, which led to its acquisition by [[Travelers Group]] in 1998. 

While not definitive, it is likely that the corporate culture of Salomon Brothers created the environment for the U.S treasury bonds scandal. While Salomon Smith Barney became notorious by the early 1990s for a collective "[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha male]]" mentality present among its employees and "a cutthroat corporate culture that rewarded risk-taking with massive bonuses, punishing poor results with a swift boot."<ref>[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salomon-brothers.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,backed%20security%20in%20the%201980s. James Chen, "What was Salomon Brothers?" in ''Investopedia'', 16 March 2020]</ref> The firm's top bond traders called themselves "Big Swinging Dicks," and were the inspiration for the book ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', by [[Tom Wolfe]]. The expression "Big Swinging Dick(s)" itself was used to refer to the Salomon bankers who dominated the game of extraordinary profit-making.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00scur/page/262|title=Conversations with Tom Wolfe|date=1990|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Scura, Dorothy McInnis.|isbn=087805426X|location=Jackson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00scur/page/262 262]|oclc=20630163}}</ref><ref>[https://slate.com/business/2008/09/the-end-of-the-bsd.html Daniel Gross, "The end of the BSD" in ''Slate'', 25 September 2008]</ref> 

Some members of the Salomon Brothers' [[fixed income arbitrage|bond arbitrage]], such as [[John Meriwether]], [[Myron Scholes]] and [[Eric Rosenfeld]] later became involved with [[Long-Term Capital Management]], a [[hedge fund]] that collapsed in 1998.<ref>[[When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management]]</ref> The last years of Salomon Brothers, culminating in its involvement with [[Long-Term Capital Management]], is chronicled in the 2007 book ''[[A Demon of Our Own Design]]''.

===Acquisition by Citigroup===
Salomon (NYSE:SB) was acquired by [[Travelers Group]] in 1998; and, following the latter's merger with [[Citicorp]] that same year, Salomon became part of [[Citigroup]]. The combined investment banking operations became known as "[[Salomon Smith Barney]]"<ref>{{cite news |title=A timeline of Salomon brothers |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/salomon-brothers-treasury-bond-scandal-2012-7?op=1#and-now-the-fabulous-life-of-a-former-salomon-bond-salesman-17 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |publisher=Business Insider}}</ref> After the acquisition, the parent company (Travelers Group, and later [[Citigroup]]) proved culturally averse to the volatile profits and losses caused by proprietary trading, instead preferring slower and more steady growth.  Salomon suffered a $100 million loss when it incorrectly positioned itself for the merger of [[MCI Communications]] with [[British Telecom]] which never occurred.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Subsequently, most of its proprietary trading business was disbanded.
 
Although the Salomon name carried on as Salomon Smith Barney-the investment banking operations of Citigroup, the division was renamed on 7 April 2003 to "Citigroup Global Markets Inc." <ref>[http://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/k04cgm.pdf?ieNocache=32]</ref> The name change from Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc. to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc was done in order to replace the tarnished Salomon Smith Barney name with Citigroup branding. This was done with the hope of presenting a sense of unity among Citigroup's various business divisions. In addition, Citigroup wanted to separate Citigroup Global Markets from it's Salomon Smith Barney past. Today, the Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney names remain as service marks belonging to Citigroup Global Markets.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125417931158647695 Deep Within Citi, the Death of Salomon].
