'''Sidwell Friends School''' is a [[Quaker]] school located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], offering pre-kindergarten through high school classes. Founded in 1883 by Thomas W. Sidwell, its motto is ''{{lang|la|"Eluceat omnibus lux"}}'' ({{lang-en|Let the light shine out from all}}), alluding to the Quaker concept of [[inner light]]. All Sidwell Friends students attend Quaker [[meeting for worship]] weekly, and middle school students begin every day with five minutes of silence.<ref>http://www.sidwell.edu/middle_school/grades-78/typical-day/index.aspx</ref>

The school's admissions process is merit-based. As documented on the school's website, it gives preference in admissions decisions to members of the Religious Society of Friends, but otherwise does not discriminate on the basis of religion.  Sidwell "accepts only 7 percent of its applicants".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Magazine/September-October-2013/Tom-Gibian-and-Tom-Farquhar/|title='Friends' for Life|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}</ref>  The school accepts vouchers under the [[School voucher#School voucher public policy in the United States|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program]].

== History ==
Thomas Sidwell started a "Friends' Select School" in 1883 on I Street in [[Downtown Washington, D.C.|downtown Washington]], four blocks from the White House.<ref name="Smith-6">{{Cite book|author=Smith.

Beginning in 1911, Sidwell began buying property between Wisconsin Avenue and 37th St. Initially, the new property was used for athletic fields—and, with the central campus' downtown location—meant students had to shuttle between the two sites by [[tram|streetcar]]. However, in 1923, Sidwell built a building for school dances and other social gatherings on what came to be known as the Wisconsin Avenue campus.<ref name="Williams" />

In 1925, the school added a kindergarten, making it the first K–12 school in Washington.<ref name="Williams" /> In 1934, the name of the school was changed to "Sidwell Friends School", and began its gradual re-location to the Wisconsin Avenue building.<ref name="Williams" /><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Education: Friends' Jubilee |date=29 May 1933|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=80 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753721,00.html |url-access=subscription }}</ref> By 1938, the transition to the new building had been completed, and the I Street property was sold.

At the urging of the students, the school briefly adopted a dress code in 1955, which included a coat and tie for all male high school students. The dress code was later dropped—again at the urging of students—in the 1970s.

Previously all grade levels were in Washington, DC. In 1963 the elementary school moved to the former Longfellow School for Boys, purchased by Sidwell Friends.<ref name=Historyasof2020>{{cite web|url=https://www.sidwell.edu/about/history|title=History|publisher=Sidwell Friends School|accessdate=2020-10-16}}</ref>

Sidwell became racially integrated in 1964.<ref name="Smith-6" /> Before 1964 it was a white-only school.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zug|first=James|title=The Long Conversation – 125 Years of Sidwell Friends School – 1883–2008|publisher=Sidwell Friends School|location=Washington, DC|year=2008|page=177|chapter=The Color of Our Skin|isbn=978-0-615-17854-7}}</ref>

Since 2005, the Wisconsin Avenue campus has seen the completion of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) platinum Middle School; a new indoor athletic facility; underground parking garage; and two turf fields. A new Quaker Meeting House facility is located in the newly renovated Arts Center.

Thomas B. Farquhar was removed from his position as the Head of School after the 2013–2014 school year. He became the Head of School after the retirement of former Head of School Bruce Stewart at the end of the 2008–2009 school year.<ref>[http://www.sidwell.edu/documents/headsearch/12-01-08_announcement.pdf Sidwell Head of School Search Committee Report]</ref> Bryan K. Garman, the current Head of School, took office beginning with the 2014–2015 school year.

In April 2020, the school received $5.2 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the [[Paycheck Protection Program]]. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary [[Steven Mnuchin]] tweeted that the schools should return the money, but the school stated they were keeping it, despite having a $53 million endowment.<ref name="nyti_Thin">{{Cite web |title=Think Twice, Mnuchin Tells Prep Schools Seeking Virus Loans |author= |work=nytimes.com |date= |access-date=13 May 2020 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/prep-schools-coronavirus-loans.html |quote=Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a post on Twitter, instructed wealthy schools that had accepted the loans to give them back. “It has come to our attention that some private schools with significant endowments” have taken the loans, he said. “They should return them.” }}</ref><ref name="nyti_Elit">{{Cite web |title=Elite Prep Schools, Set Back by Virus, Face a Quandary on Federal Aid |author= |work=nytimes.com |date= |access-date=13 May 2020 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/prep-schools-coronavirus-loans.html |quote=Sidwell Friends in Washington, the alma mater of President Obama’s daughters, decided to keep i }}</ref>

In 2016, the school revised its policy on sexual misconduct after reports that a teen had been raped by her ex-boyfriend on the school's campus. No charges were filed against the teen, and the school installed more security cameras to deter future assaults.<ref name=misconduct>{{cite news  |date=June 17, 2016 |title= Sidwell Friends to Revise Sex Misconduct Policy After Rape Report|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/local/dc-wtop-sidwell-friends-to-revise-sex-misconduct-policy-after-rape-report/1997770/ |work=NBC 4 Washington |location=Washington DC |access-date= June 17, 2020}}</ref> Despite the measures, a year later another student reported sexual assault on the campus grounds.

=== Boys' soccer  ===
Over the past decade, the Sidwell Friends Boys' Soccer program has become one of the best programs in the Washington, DC metro area. In fall, 2006, the boys' varsity soccer team compiled a 19–2 record and was recognized as No. 9 in the Washington Post Top Ten soccer schools in the metropolitan area. The 2007 Boys Varsity Soccer team again won the MAAC Boys' Soccer championship and achieved a second consecutive Washington Post Top Ten ranking, reaching No. 3 in the final poll with a 20–2 record. The 2008 team continued their recent success by winning the third consecutive MAAC title, and their 4th in 5 years, with an undefeated 16–0–1 record for the season. Again, the Quakers finished the season ranked No. 3 in the area by the Washington Post and No. 36 nationally by ESPNRise.com. The 2009 squad began the season ranked No. 22 in the country by ESPN. After failing to capture the MAAC tournament trophy in two consecutive seasons, the 2013 team was the first team in Sidwell Friends History to win the MAAC league, tournament, and DC state championships finishing 3rd in the Washington Post Top Ten rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/highschool/rise/fab50?sportId=10020040&seasonType=1&season=2009&week=0 |title=Home – Espn Rise |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref> In October 2009 the squad achieved a prestigious No. 1 Washington Post ranking.

On the interior, the building uses thermal chimneys and louvers that admit diffuse light to limit the need for artificial light and thermal control. Lastly, the building contains a centralized mechanical plant that uses less energy than normal, much of which is produced by [[photovoltaic panel|photovoltaic]] banks on the roof. The materials used and the environmental technology are referenced architecturally and made accessible to students, either physically, or by explanatory signs, as an educational feature.
