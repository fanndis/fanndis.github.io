The '''University of Arizona''' ('''Arizona''', '''U of A''', '''UArizona''', or '''UA''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2019}}, the university enrolled 45,918 students<ref name="Facts"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of 65 elected members of the prestigious [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.

Known as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to "Cats"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.

==History==
[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Old Main in 1889]]
After the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's "[[Thieving Thirteenth]]" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name="History 3a">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name="History 3">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In response to COVID-19, The University of Arizona announced temporary pay cuts and furloughs to its 15,000 employees on April 17, 2020, as its Tucson campus shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For all employees making up to $150,000 per year, they were ordered to take furloughs, with the length determined by each employees' salary. For employees making more than $150,000 per year, pay cuts of 17% or 20% were instituted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2020/04/18/university-of-arizona-sets-pay-cuts-furloughs-for.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> Also in 2020, University of Arizona announced that it had purchased [[Ashford University]] from [[Zovio]] and renamed it University of Arizona Global Campus. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Zovio |title=Zovio Announces Historic Higher Education Transaction |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/zovio-announces-historic-higher-education-transaction-2020-12-01?tesla=y |website=marketwatch.com |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref>

==Academics==

UA is a member of the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]], a consortium of institutions pursuing research in astronomy. The association operates observatories and [[telescopes]], notably [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] just outside Tucson. UA is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]], and the sole representative from Arizona to this group. Led by [[Roger Angel]], researchers in the [[Steward Observatory]] Mirror Lab at UA are working in concert to build the world's most advanced telescope.

===Libraries===
[[File:UAmainlibr 1008.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the U of A main library, before renovation work began in 2019.]]
According to the 2015-2016 Association of Research Libraries' "Spending by University Research Libraries" report, UA libraries are ranked as the 37th overall university library in North America (out of 114) for university investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Spending-by-University/240829|title=Spending of University Research Libraries (2015-16)|website=chronicle.com|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>

The Main Library is on the southeast quadrant of campus near [[McKale Center]] and [[Arizona Stadium]].

In 2002, the Integrated Learning Center (ILC) was completed as a $20&nbsp;million, {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|-4|adj=on}} computer facility intended for use by incoming students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uanews.arizona.edu/story/integrated-learning-center-opens-doors-students|title=Integrated Learning Center Opens Doors to Students|date=January 10, 2002|work=US News|publisher=University of Arizona|access-date=September 16, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The ILC features classrooms, auditoriums, a courtyard with vending machines, and an expanded computer lab with several dozen workstations and [[3D printing]].

The ILC connects to the basement floor of the Main Library. As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor.

The Special Collections Library is adjacent to the Main Library. It was established in 1958, and it houses materials primarily concerned with Arizona and Southwestern history, borderlands studies, and literature.

The Weaver Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a small library at the [[Center for Creative Photography]], also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law) at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue.

The Arizona Health Sciences Library, built in 1996, is on the Health Sciences Center on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, in the Health Sciences Education Building (HSEB). The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for health professionals and citizens across the state.

The main campus' 179 buildings sit on {{convert|380|acre|km2|1}} in central Tucson, about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) northeast of downtown. [[Roy Place]], a prominent [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] architect, designed many of the early buildings, including the [[Arizona State Museum]] buildings (one of them the 1927 main library) and Centennial Hall. Place's use of red brick set the tone for the red brick facades that are a basic part of nearly all UA buildings: almost every UA building has red brick as a major component of the design, or at the very least, a stylistic accent to harmonize it with the other campus buildings.<ref>[http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/2000-10-12/curr4.html "The Big Build-Up", Margaret Regan, ''Tucson Weekly'', October 12, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090913/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/2000-10-12/curr4.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/180648 "UA buildings ditch red brick to symbolize, inspire, teach", Tom Beal, ''Arizona Daily Star'', April 29, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516065853/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/180648 |date=May 16, 2007 }}</ref> In the early 1930s, Place updated the campus master plan, conceived by his architectural partner John Lyman in 1919 and modeled after the [[University of Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/AZ-01-019-0090|title=University of Arizona|last=Jeffery|first=R.

The campus is roughly divided into quadrants. The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north–south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).

The science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.
[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]

Speedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east–west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed directly on, and north of, this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.

Park Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996. 

The Stevie Eller Dance Theater, opened in 2003 (across the Mall from [[McKale Center]]) as a {{convert|28600|sqft|m2|-1|adj=on}} dedicated performance venue for the UA's dance program, one of the most highly regarded university dance departments in the United States. Designed by Gould Evans, a Phoenix-based architectural firm, the theater was awarded the 2003 Citation Award from the [[American Institute of Architects]], Arizona Chapter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/dance/visit/dancetheatre.php|title=CFA.arizona.edu|website=CFA.Arizona.edu|access-date=July 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707075758/http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/dance/visit/dancetheatre.php|archive-date=July 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The oldest campus buildings are west of Old Main. Most of the buildings east of Old Main date from the 1940s to the 1980s (a period of tremendous growth on campus and in Tucson in general), with a few recent buildings constructed in the years since 1990.

The Student Union Memorial Center, on the north side of the Mall east of Old Main, was completely reconstructed between 2000 and 2003. It replaced a {{convert|270000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} structure originally opened in 1951 with additions during the 1960s. The student union has {{convert|405000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space on four levels, and includes 14 restaurants, a grocery market, a two-level bookstore with an office supplies section, 23 meeting rooms, eight lounge areas (including one dedicated to the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']]), a computer lab, a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]], and a copy center.

The building was designed to mirror the USS ''Arizona'' (BB-39). A variety of sculptures pepper the premises, decorating the air with the chimes of dog tags or the colors of refracted light in honor of those who have served. A [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] housed on the USS ''Arizona'', one of the two bells rescued from the ship after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], has a permanent home in the clock tower of the Student Union Memorial Center. The bell arrived on campus in July 1946. The bell is rung seven times on the third Wednesday of every month at 12:07&nbsp;pm – symbolic of the battleship's sinking on December 7, 1941 – to honor individuals at the UA, as well as after home [[Arizona Wildcats football|football]] victories, over any team except other Arizona schools.<ref name="U.S.S.

==Organization==

The University of Arizona, like its sister institutions [[Arizona State University]] and [[Northern Arizona University]], is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] or the ABOR, a 12-member body. Eight volunteer members are appointed by the Governor to staggered eight-year terms; two students serve on the board for two-year appointments, with the first year being a nonvoting apprentice year. The Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction serve as voting ex-officio members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azregents.edu/board/board-members|title=Board Members {{!}} Arizona Board of Regents|website=Arizona Board of Regents|language=en|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> The ABOR provides "policy guidance" and oversight to the three major degree-granting universities, as provided for by Title 15 of the [[Arizona Revised Statutes]].

[[Robert C. Robbins]], M.D., was named the 22nd president of the UA on March 7, 2017.<ref name="auto1"/> He began his term on June 1, 2017. Previously, he was the president and CEO of [[Texas Medical Center]] in Houston from 2012 to 2017. In prior roles, Robbins was professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], founding director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, president of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation and president of the Western Thoracic Surgical Association.

Robbins replaced [[Ann Weaver Hart]], M.A., Ph.D., who was the university's first female president. He was named the lone finalist to succeed as UA president after Hart announced she would not seek to extend to her contract past its June 30, 2018 end date.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2016/06/10/university-arizona-president-ann-weaver-hart-wont-seek-contract-extension/85705736/|title=University of Arizona President Ann Weaver Hart won't seek contract extension|last=Ryman|first=Anne|date=June 10, 2016|work=The Arizona Republic}}</ref> During her tenure, Hart led the university's first integrated strategic academic and business plan and agreement with Banner Health to support the UA's biosciences research and medical education initiatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://president.arizona.edu/person/ann-weaver-hart|title=Ann Weaver Hart {{!}} President|website=Executive Office of the President | publisher=University of Arizona |language=en|access-date=6 June 2017}}</ref>

==Athletics==
{{main|Arizona Wildcats}}
Like many large public universities in the U.S., sports are a major activity on campus, and receive a large operating budget. Arizona's athletic teams are nicknamed the '''Wildcats''', a name derived from a 1914 football game with then California champions [[Occidental College]], where the [[L.A. Times]] asserted, "the Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats."<ref name="History 8">{{cite web | title=The McKale Era – Building an Athletic Tradition | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history8.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701032943/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history8.php |archive-date=July 1, 2007 }}</ref> The University of Arizona participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I-A in the [[Pac-12 Conference]], which it was admitted in 1978.

====Men's basketball====
{{main|Arizona Wildcats men's basketball}}
The [[basketball|men's basketball]] team has been one of the nation's most successful programs since [[Lute Olson]] was hired as head coach in 1983, and is still known as a national powerhouse in Division I men's basketball.<ref>via ''[[Associated Press]]''.

In 1997, Arizona defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats|University of Kentucky]], the then defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship ([[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]) by a score of 84–79 in overtime; Arizona's first national championship victory. The 1997 championship team became the first and only in [[NCAA]] history to defeat three number-one seeds en route to a national title (Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky—the North Carolina game being the final game for longtime UNC head coach Dean Smith). Point guard [[Miles Simon]] was chosen as 1997 [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Final Four MVP]] (Simon was also an assistant coach under Olson from 2005 to 2008). The Cats also boast the third highest winning percentage in the nation over the last twenty years. Arizona has won a total of 28 regular season conference championships in its programs history, and 6 PAC-12 tournaments.

The Wildcats play their home games at the [[McKale Center]] in Tucson. A number of former Wildcats have gone on to pursue successful professional NBA careers (especially during the Lute Olson era), including [[Gilbert Arenas]], [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Mike Bibby]], [[Jason Terry]], [[Sean Elliott]], [[Damon Stoudamire]], [[Khalid Reeves]], [[Luke Walton]], [[Hassan Adams]], [[Salim Stoudamire]], [[Andre Iguodala]], [[Channing Frye]], Brian Williams (later known as [[Bison Dele]]), [[Sean Rooks]], [[Jud Buechler]], [[Michael Dickerson]], [[Chase Budinger]], [[Jordan Hill (basketball)|Jordan Hill]], [[Jerryd Bayless]], [[Derrick Williams (basketball)|Derrick Williams]], [[Kadeem Allen]], [[Aaron Gordon]], [[Solomon Hill (basketball)|Solomon Hill]], [[Rondae Hollis-Jefferson]], [[Stanley Johnson (basketball)|Stanley Johnson]], [[T.

[[Kenny Lofton]], now best known as a former Major League Baseball star, was a four-year letter winner as a Wildcat basketball player (and was on the 1988 Final Four team), before one year on the Arizona baseball team. Another notable former Wildcat basketball player is [[Eugene Edgerson]], who played on the 1997 and 2001 Final Four squads, and spent some of his professional career as one of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] as "Wildkat" Edgerson.

Before Lute Olson's hire in 1983, Arizona was the first major Division I school to hire an African American head coach in [[Fred Snowden]], in 1972. After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008. After two seasons of using interim coaches, Arizona named [[Sean Miller]], head coach at [[Xavier University]], as its new head basketball coach in April 2009. During his tenure to date, Miller has led the Wildcats to seven conference championships and six appearances in the NCAA tournament. Miller has served as head coach for four of the seven seasons in Arizona history in which the Wildcats have won 30 or more games.

====Football====
{{main|Arizona Wildcats football}}
[[File:Arizona Stadium East Side.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona Stadium]] has a total capacity of 55,675]]
The [[American Football|football]] team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname "Varsity" (a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the "Wildcats").<ref name="History 7">{{cite web | title=The First Football Team – 1899 | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701033605/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archive-date=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>

The football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach [[Dick Tomey]]; his "Desert Swarm" defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed tactics. In 1993, the team had its first 10-win season and beat the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] Hurricanes in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] by a score of 29–0. It was the bowl game's only shutout in its then 23-year history. In 1998, the team posted a school-record 12–1 season and made the [[Holiday Bowl]] in which it defeated the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]]. Arizona ended the season ranked 4th nationally in the coaches and API poll. The 1998 Holiday Bowl was televised on [[ESPN]] and set the now-surpassed record of being the most watched of any bowl game in the network's history. From November 2003 until October 2011, the program was led by [[Mike Stoops]], brother of [[Bob Stoops]], the head football coach at the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]] (the 2000 [[BCS National Championship|BCS national champions]]); Stoops was fired on October 10, 2011. Former Michigan and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] head coach [[Rich Rodriguez]] was hired on November 21, 2011 to lead the Wildcats. The announcement was made by UA athletic director [[Gregory Byrne|Greg Byrne]] via Twitter. In his first season, Rodriguez took the Wildcats to the [[2012 New Mexico Bowl]], where they defeated the [[Nevada Wolfpack football|University of Nevada]] Wolf Pack. In his third season, the Wildcats won the Pac-12 South and played in the [[2014 Fiesta Bowl (December)|2014 Fiesta Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildcats Stick a Fork in ASU|url=http://uanews.org/photos/wildcats-stick-fork-asu|website=UA News|publisher=UA News |access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> In 2015, the Wildcats played in their fourth consecutive bowl game, defeating the University of New Mexico in the New Mexico Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gildan New Mexico Bowl Info - The University of Arizona Official Athletic Site|url=http://www.arizonawildcats.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210498669|website=Arizona Official Athletic Site|access-date=January 22, 2016}}</ref> In 2017, they lost to the Purdue Boilermakers in the Foster Farms Bowl, the Wildcats 21st bowl game.[http://tucson.com/sports/arizonawildcats/only-victory-in-foster-farms-bowl-would-ensure-arizona-wildcats/article_8fa2f6b2-e297-5634-8185-93700506c36c.html]

The University of Arizona women's soccer [http://arizonawildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wsoc team] wrapped up their 2017 season on Nov. 17 in the second round of the [[NCAA Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA]] Tournament, finishing with an 11-5-4 record, and seven Pac-12 wins, the most in program history.

Led by coach Tony Amato, Arizona's seniors became the first group in program history to make three [[NCAA Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA]] Tournament appearances, winning at least one match in each Tournament. The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.

====Softball====
{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}

The Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

====Golf====
The university's golf teams have also been notably successful.

The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika Sörenstam]], [[Lorena Ochoa]], and [[Erica Blasberg]].

====Men's lacrosse====
The [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the "Laxcats". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name="LaxCats">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |access-date=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

====Other====
Many other Wildcats have met with success at the university. Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (’84, ’86, ’87, ’88, ’91, ’93, ’94, ’97) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>

Three national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007–2008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>

===Individual national championships===
A number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika Sörenstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.

===Rivalries===
A strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149–83), as well as in football (49–42–1). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as "The Duel in the Desert." The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.

===Mascot===
[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]
The university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the [[cheerleading]] squad at most Wildcat sporting events.<ref name="Wilber">{{cite web | title=Wilbur & Wilma Wildcat | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=Traditions Tour | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214175921/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archive-date = February 14, 2006}}</ref> Arizona's first mascot was a real desert [[bobcat]] named "Rufus Arizona", introduced in 1915.<ref name="History 10">{{cite web | title=Rufus Arizona | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060226193333/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = February 26, 2006}}</ref>

Wilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the university's humor magazine, ''Kitty Kat''. From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.

===Fight song===
In 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading "BEAR DOWN." Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed "Bear Down, Arizona!" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, "Bear Down, Arizona!" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name="Berger Memorial Fountain">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = May 4, 2006}}</ref>

Officially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics. The ZonaZoo program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) and Arizona Athletics yet run by a team of individuals called the ZonaZoo Crew. In 2014, ESPN ranked ZonaZoo as the top student cheering section in the PAC 12 conference and in 2015, and in 2018, ZonaZoo received the Best Student Section of the Year award from the National Collegiate Student Section Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2015/04/zonazoo-named-top-student-section-by-ncssa|title=ZonaZoo named top student section by NCSSA|last=Payne|first=Roberto|date=April 8, 2015|work=The Daily Wildcat|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Notable venues===
The [[McKale Center]], which opened in 1973, is used by men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball. The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri ("The Ooh-Aah Man") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258–139–12. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.

The tradition of the Territorial Cup goes all the way back to 1899, the year the University of Arizona first fielded a football team. In 2009, Arizona schools began competing in the Territorial Cup Series. It's a yearlong competition that includes multiple sports. The Territorial Cup trophy wasn't shared between the two rival universities, Arizona State University and University of Arizona, until 2001. Presidents of both schools signed an agreement that the winner of the annual "Duel in the Desert" football game would take possession of the trophy for the ensuing year. The teams usually play the Friday or Saturday after Thanksgiving.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arizonaalumni.com/news-multimedia/traditions/territorial-cup|title=Arizona Alumni - Territorial Cup|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>

===Student government===
====Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA)====
Overall, students at the University of Arizona have been represented by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) since 1913. Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====
In 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.

====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====
On-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body, and the 24 individual hall councils.
