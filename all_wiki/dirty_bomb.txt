{{terrorism}}
A '''dirty bomb''' or '''radiological dispersal device''' is a speculative [[radiological weapon]] that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives. The purpose of the weapon is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material, serving primarily as an [[area denial]] device against civilians. It is, however, not to be confused with a nuclear explosion, such as a [[fission bomb]], which by releasing nuclear energy produces [[explosion|blast]] effects far in excess of what is achievable by the use of conventional explosives.

Although a radiological dispersal device is designed to disperse radioactive material over a large area, a [[bomb]] that uses conventional explosives and produces a [[blast wave]] would be far more lethal to people than the hazard posed by radioactive material that may be mixed with the explosive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioterrorism.slu.edu/bt/products/ahec_rad/ppt/Dirty%20Bomb.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020010837/http://bioterrorism.slu.edu/bt/products/ahec_rad/ppt/Dirty%20Bomb.ppt |archive-date=2011-10-20 }}</ref> At levels created from probable sources, not enough [[radioactive contamination|radiation]] would be present to cause severe illness or death.

Since a dirty bomb is unlikely to cause many deaths by radiation exposure, many do not consider this to be a [[weapon of mass destruction]].<ref name="nrc.gov"/> Its purpose would presumably be to create psychological, not physical, harm through ignorance, [[mass panic]], and terror. For this reason dirty bombs are sometimes called "weapons of mass disruption". Additionally, containment and [[Human decontamination|decontamination]] of thousands of victims, as well as decontamination of the affected area might require considerable time and expense, rendering areas partly unusable and causing economic damage.

== Dirty bombs and terrorism ==
{{Further|Nuclear terrorism}}

Since the [[9/11]] attacks, the fear of terrorist groups using dirty bombs has increased immensely, which has been frequently reported in the media.<ref name="Petroff 2007">Petroff (2007)</ref> The meaning of terrorism used here, is described by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s definition, which is "the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological objectives".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/t/05436.html|title=404w DTIC Maintenanc|accessdate=30 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325074626/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/t/05436.html|archive-date=25 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
There have only ever been two cases of caesium-containing bombs, and neither was detonated. Both involved [[Chechnya]]. The first attempt of radiological terror was carried out in November 1995 by a group of [[Chechen–Russian conflict|Chechen separatists]], who buried a [[caesium-137]] source wrapped in explosives at the [[Izmaylovsky Park]] in [[Moscow]]. A Chechen rebel leader alerted the media, the bomb was never activated, and the incident amounted to a mere [[publicity stunt]].<ref>King (2004); [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/dirtybomb/chrono.html NOVA, Chronology of events]</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Moscow dirty bomb.jpg|thumb|right|The caesium-filled package uncovered in Moscow’s [[Izmaylovsky Park]].]] -->
In December 1998, a second attempt was announced by the Chechen Security Service, who discovered a container filled with radioactive materials attached to an explosive mine. The bomb was hidden near a railway line in the suburban area [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]], ten miles east of the Chechen capital of [[Grozny]]. The same Chechen separatist group was suspected to be involved.<ref>Edwards (2004); [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/dirtybomb/chrono.html NOVA, Chronology of events]</ref>
Despite the increased fear of a dirty bombing attack, it is hard to assess whether the actual risk of such an event has increased significantly.<ref name="Frost">Frost (2005)</ref> The following discussions on implications, effects and probability of an attack, as well as indications of terror groups planning such, are based mainly on [[statistics]], qualified guessing and a few comparable scenarios.

=== Effect of a dirty bomb explosion ===
When dealing with the implications of a dirty bomb attack, there are two main areas to be addressed: (i) the [[civilian]] impact, not only dealing with immediate casualties and long term health issues, but also the [[psychological]] effect and then (ii) the economic impact. With no prior event of a dirty bomb detonation, it is considered difficult to predict the impact. Several analyses have predicted that radiological dispersal devices will neither sicken nor kill many people.<ref>Reshetin (2005); Dingle (2005)</ref>

=== Accidents with radioactives ===
The effects of uncontrolled [[radioactive contamination]] have been reported several times.
{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}

One example is the [[Goiania accident|radiological accident]] occurring in [[Goiânia]], [[Brazil]], between September 1987 and March 1988: Two metal scavengers broke into an abandoned [[radiotherapy]] clinic and removed a [[teletherapy]] source capsule containing powdered caesium-137 with an activity of 50 TBq. They brought it back to the home of one of the men to take it apart and sell as scrap metal. Later that day both men were showing acute signs of radiation illness with [[vomiting]] and one of the men had a swollen hand and [[diarrhea]]. A few days later one of the men punctured the 1&nbsp;mm thick window of the capsule, allowing the [[caesium chloride]] powder to leak out and when realizing the powder glowed blue in the dark, brought it back home to his family and friends to show it off. After 2 weeks of spread by contact contamination causing an increasing number of adverse health effects, the correct diagnosis of acute [[radiation sickness]] was made at a hospital and proper precautions could be put into procedure. By this time 249 people were contaminated, 151 exhibited both external and internal contamination of which 20 people were seriously ill and 5 people died.<ref>King (2004); Zimmerman and Loeb (2004); Sohier and Hardeman (2006)</ref>

The Goiânia incident to some extent predicts the contamination pattern if it is not immediately realized that the explosion spread radioactive material, but also how fatal even very small amounts of ingested radioactive powder can be.<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb">Zimmerman and Loeb (2004)</ref> This raises worries of terrorists using powdered [[alpha particle|alpha]] emitting material, that if ingested can pose a serious health risk,<ref>Mullen et al. (2002); Reshetin (2005)</ref> as in the case of deceased former [[K.G.B.]] spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]], who either ate, drank or inhaled [[polonium-210]]. "Smoky bombs" based on alpha emitters might easily be just as dangerous as [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] emitting dirty bombs.<ref>Zimmerman (2006)</ref>
{{Main|Goiânia accident}}

=== Public perception of risks ===
For the majority involved in a radiological dispersal device incident, the radiation health risks (i.e. increased probability of developing cancer later in life due to radiation exposure) are comparatively small, comparable to the health risk from smoking five packages of cigarettes.<ref>Ring (2004)</ref> The [[radiophobia|fear of radiation]] is not always logical. Although the exposure might be minimal, many people find radiation exposure especially frightening because it is something they cannot see or feel, and it therefore becomes an unknown source of danger. Dealing with public fear may prove the greatest challenge in case of a radiological dispersal device event.<ref>Johnson (2003)</ref> Policy, science and media may inform the public about the real danger and thus reduce the possible psychological and economic effects.

Statements from the U.S. government after 9/11 may have contributed unnecessarily to the public fear of a dirty bomb. When [[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] on June 10, 2002, announced the arrest of [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], allegedly plotting to detonate such a weapon, he said:

{{Quotation|[A] radioactive "dirty bomb" (...) spreads radioactive material that is highly toxic to humans and can cause mass death and injury.|Attorney General John Ashcroft<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb"/>}}

This public fear of radiation also plays a big role in why the costs of a radiological dispersal device impact on a major metropolitan area (such as lower Manhattan) might be equal to or even larger than that of the 9/11 attacks.<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb"/> Assuming the radiation levels are not too high and the area does not need to be abandoned such as the town of [[Prypiat (city)|Pripyat]] near the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl reactor]],<ref>"The Lifeless Silence of Pripyat", ''Time Magazine'', June 23, 1986 [http://www.time.com/time/daily/chernobyl/860623.pixact.html Online article from Time Magazine]</ref> an expensive and time-consuming cleanup procedure will begin. This will mainly consist of tearing down highly contaminated buildings, digging up contaminated soil and quickly applying sticky substances to remaining surfaces so that radioactive particles adhere before radioactivity penetrates the building materials.<ref>Vantine and Crites (2002); Zimmerman and Loeb (2004); Weiss (2005)</ref> These procedures are the current state of the art for [[radioactive contamination]] cleanup, but some experts say that a complete cleanup of external surfaces in an urban area to current decontamination limits may not be technically feasible.<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb"/> Loss of working hours will be vast during cleanup, but even after the radiation levels reduce to an acceptable level, there might be residual public fear of the site including possible unwillingness to conduct business as usual in the area. [[tourism|Tourist traffic]] is likely never to resume.<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb"/>

There is also a [[psychological warfare]] element to radioactive substances. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by the daily emissions from coal burning, for example, even though a [[National Academy of Sciences]] study found this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the United States ([[Demographics of the United States|population]] 317,413,000). [[Medical error#Impact|Medical errors]] leading to death in U.S. hospitals are estimated to be between 44,000 and 98,000. It is "only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden — for it carries a unique historical legacy".<ref name=riv12>{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=Andrew C.

=== Constructing and obtaining material for a dirty bomb ===
In order for a terrorist organization to construct and detonate a dirty bomb, it must acquire radioactive material. Possible radiological dispersal device material could come from the millions of radioactive sources used worldwide in the industry, for medical purposes and in academic applications mainly for research.<ref>Ferguson et al. (2003); Frost (2005)</ref> Of these sources, only nine reactor produced [[isotope]]s stand out as being suitable for radiological terror: [[americium-241]], [[californium-252]], [[caesium-137]], [[cobalt-60]], [[iridium-192]], [[plutonium-238]], [[polonium-210]], [[radium-226]] and [[strontium-90]],<ref name="Frost"/> and even from these it is possible that radium-226 and polonium-210 do not pose a significant threat.<ref name="Ferguson">Ferguson et al. (2003)</ref> Of these sources the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has estimated that within the U.S., approximately one source is lost, abandoned or stolen every day of the year. Within the [[European Union]] the annual estimate is 70.<ref>Ferguson et al. (2003); Zimmerman and Loeb (2004)</ref> There exist thousands of such "orphan" sources scattered throughout the world, but of those reported lost, no more than an estimated 20 percent can be classified as a potential high security concern if used in a radiological dispersal device.<ref name="Ferguson"/> Especially [[Russia]] is believed to house thousands of orphan sources, which were lost following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. A large but unknown number of these sources probably belong to the high security risk category. Noteworthy are the beta emitting strontium-90 sources used as [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s for [[beacon]]s in lighthouses in remote areas of Russia.<ref>Burgess (2003); Van Tuyle and Mullen (2003); Sohier and Hardeman (2006)</ref> In December 2001, three [[Georgians|Georgian]] woodcutters stumbled over such a power generator and dragged it back to their camp site to use it as a heat source. Within hours they suffered from acute radiation sickness and sought hospital treatment. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) later stated that it contained approximately {{convert|40|kCi|PBq|lk=on}} of strontium,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/dirtybomb/chrono.html|title=NOVA - Dirty Bomb - Chronology of Events - PBS|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> equivalent to the amount of radioactivity released immediately after the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl accident]] (though the total radioactivity release from Chernobyl was 2500 times greater at around {{convert|100|MCi|PBq|abbr=on}}<ref name="Hyperphysics">{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/cherno2.html|title=Chernobyl|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>).

Although a terrorist organization might obtain radioactive material through the "[[black market]]",<ref>King (2004); Hoffman (2006)</ref> and there has been a steady increase in illicit trafficking of radioactive sources from 1996 to 2004, these recorded trafficking incidents mainly refer to rediscovered orphan sources without any sign of criminal activity,<ref name="Frost"/> and it has been argued that there is no conclusive evidence for such a market.<ref>Belyaninov (1994); Frost (2005)</ref> In addition to the hurdles of obtaining usable radioactive material, there are several conflicting requirements regarding the properties of the material the terrorists need to take into consideration: First, the source should be "sufficiently" radioactive to create direct radiological damage at the explosion or at least to perform societal damage or disruption. Second, the source should be transportable with enough shielding to protect the carrier, but not so much that it will be too heavy to maneuver. Third, the source should be sufficiently dispersible to effectively contaminate the area around the explosion.<ref name="Sohier and Hardeman">Sohier and Hardeman (2006)</ref>

An example of a worst-case scenario is a terror organization possessing a source of very highly radioactive material, e.g. a strontium-90 thermal generator, with the ability to create an incident comparable to the Chernobyl accident. Although the detonation of a dirty bomb using such a source might seem terrifying, it would be hard to assemble the bomb and transport it without severe radiation damage and possible death of the perpetrators involved. Shielding the source effectively would make it almost impossible to transport and a lot less effective if detonated.

Due to the three constraints of making a dirty bomb, radiological dispersal devices might still be defined as "high-tech" weapons and this is probably why they have not been used up to now.<ref name="Sohier and Hardeman"/>

'''Difference between Dirty Bomb and Fission Bomb'''
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Dirty bomb:'''
* Explosives combined with radioactive materials
* Detonation vaporizes or aerosolizes radioactive material and propels it into the air
* Not a nuclear detonation
|'''Fission bomb: one example'''
* Caused by an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction with uranium-235 or plutonium-239
* This example has pyramids of plutonium with surrounding explosives
* Initial explosion produces imploding shock wave that drives plutonium pieces inward into central sphere containing pellet of berylliu/polonium, creating "critical mass"
* Resulting fission reaction causes bomb to explode with tremendous force: nuclear detonation

=== Possibility of terrorist groups using dirty bombs ===
The present assessment of the possibility of terrorists using a dirty bomb is based on cases involving [[ISIS]]. This is because the attempts by this group to acquire a dirty bomb coming to light in all forms of media, in part due to the attention this group received for their involvement in the London bridge attack.

On 8 May 2002, [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]] (a.k.a. Abdulla al-Muhajir) was arrested on suspicion that he was an Al-Qaeda terrorist planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the U.S. This suspicion was raised by information obtained from an arrested top Al-Qaeda official in U.S. custody, [[Abu Zubaydah]], who under interrogation revealed that the organization was close to constructing a dirty bomb. Although Padilla had not obtained radioactive material or explosives at the time of arrest, law enforcement authorities uncovered evidence that he was on reconnaissance for usable radioactive material and possible locations for detonation.<ref>Ferguson et al. (2003); Hosenball et al. (2002)</ref> It has been doubted whether José Padilla was preparing such an attack, and it has been claimed that the arrest was highly politically motivated, given the pre-9/11 security lapses by the [[CIA]] and [[FBI]].<ref>Burgess (2003); King (2004)</ref>

Later, these charges against José Padilla were dropped. Although there was no hard evidence for Al-Qaeda possessing a dirty bomb, there is a broad agreement that Al-Qaeda poses a potential dirty bomb attack threat<ref>King (2004); Ferguson et al. (2003)</ref> because they need to overcome the alleged image that the U.S. and its allies are winning the [[War on Terror|war against terror]].<ref name="Petroff 2007"/> A further concern is the argument, that "if suicide bombers are prepared to die flying airplanes into building, it is also conceivable that they are prepared to forfeit their lives building dirty bombs".<ref>Burgess (2003)</ref> If this would be the case, both the cost and complexity of any protective systems needed to allow the perpetrator to survive long enough to both build the bomb and carry out the attack, would be significantly reduced.<ref name="Zimmerman and Loeb"/>

Several other captives were alleged to have played a role in this plot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/10/31/1031gitmo.html |title=Judge in Guantanamo case questions dirty bomb allegations |newspaper=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2008-11-01 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

[[Guantanamo military commission]] prosecutors continue to maintain the plot was real, and charged Binyam for his alleged role in 2008. However they dropped this charge in October 2008, but maintain they could prove the charge and were only dropping the charge to expedite proceedings.
[[US District Court Judge]] [[Emmet G. Sullivan]] insisted that the administration still had to hand over the evidence that justified the dirty bomb charge, and admonished [[United States Department of Justice]] lawyers that dropping the charge "raises serious questions in this court's mind about whether those allegations were ever true."

In 2006, [[Dhiren Barot]] from North London pleaded guilty of conspiring to murder innocent people within the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] using a radioactive dirty bomb. He planned to target underground [[car park]]s within the UK and buildings in the U.S. such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]] buildings in [[Washington D.C.]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[Citigroup]] buildings and the [[Prudential Financial]] buildings in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He also faces 12 other charges including, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[public nuisance]], seven charges of making a record of information for terrorist purposes and four charges of possessing a record of information for terrorist purposes. Experts say if the plot to use the dirty bomb was carried out "it would have been unlikely to cause deaths, but was designed to affect about 500 people."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6044938.stm | work=BBC News | title=Man admits UK-US terror bomb plot | date=2006-10-12 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}</ref>

In January 2009, a leaked FBI report described the results of a search of the Maine home of James G. Cummings, a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] who had been shot and killed by his wife. Investigators found four one-gallon containers of 35 percent hydrogen peroxide, uranium, thorium, lithium metal, aluminum powder, [[beryllium]], boron, black iron oxide and magnesium as well as literature on how to build dirty bombs and information about cesium-137, strontium-90 and cobalt-60, radioactive materials.<ref>[http://www.bangornews.com/detail/99263.html Report: 'Dirty bomb' parts found in slain man's home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214140020/http://bangornews.com/detail/99263.html |date=2009-02-14 }}, ''Bangor Daily News'', 10 February 2009</ref> Officials confirmed the veracity of the report but stated that the public was never at risk.<ref>[http://www.bangornews.com/detail/99310.html Officials verify dirty bomb probe results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213211427/http://bangornews.com/detail/99310.html |date=2009-02-13 }}, ''Bangor Daily News'', 11 February 2009</ref>

In April 2009, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] announced the arrest of a legislator and two businessmen from the [[Ternopil Oblast]]. Seized in the undercover [[sting operation]] was 3.7 kilograms of what was claimed by the suspects during the sale as [[plutonium-239]], used mostly in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, but was determined by experts to be probably [[americium]], a "widely used" radioactive material which is commonly used in amounts of less than 1 milligram in [[smoke detector]]s, but can also be used in a dirty bomb. The suspects reportedly wanted [[United States dollar|US$]] 10 million for the material, which the Security Service determined was produced in Russia during the era of the [[Soviet Union]] and smuggled into Ukraine through a neighboring country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/15/content_11186744.htm |title=Three arrested in Ukraine for trying to sell radioactive material |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date=2009-04-25 |accessdate=2009-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904060636/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/15/content_11186744.htm |archive-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gH_89sNbRUaG-_lfZN4aiuWyYoawD97I9GPO0 |title=Ukraine arrests 3 in radioactive material sale |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

In July 2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria|ISIS]] militants seized {{convert|88|lb}} of uranium compounds from [[Mosul University]]. The material was unenriched and so could not be used to build a conventional fission bomb, but a dirty bomb is a theoretical possibility. However, uranium's relatively low radioactivity makes it a poor candidate for use in a dirty bomb.<ref name="isis">{{cite web|url=http://time.com/2972050/iraq-terrorist-nuclear-materials-isis/|title=Iraqi 'Terrorist Groups' Have Seized Nuclear Materials}}</ref><ref name="isis2">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/10/isis-seized-uranium-compounds-from-lab-experts-downplay-threat/|title=ISIS seizes uranium from lab; experts downplay 'dirty bomb' threat}}</ref>

Little is known about civil preparedness to respond to a dirty bomb attack. The [[Boston Marathon]] appeared to many to be a situation with high potential for use of a dirty bomb as a terrorist weapon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2004/09/15/terror_response_study_spurs_concern/|title=Terror response study spurs concern|work=Boston.com|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> However, [[Boston Marathon bombing|the bombing attack that occurred on April 15, 2013]] did not involve use of dirty bombs. Any radiological testing or inspections that may have occurred following the attack were either conducted [[sub rosa]] or not at all. Also, there was no official dirty bomb "all clear" issued by the [[Obama administration]]. [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] had, apparently under their own disaster plan, issued instructions to their emergency room to be prepared for incoming radiation poisoning cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://giving.massgeneral.org/boston-marathon-bombing-response/|title=Determined Response: MGH and the Boston Marathon Bombing|work=Massachusetts General Hospital Giving|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Terrorist organizations may also capitalize on the [[Radiophobia|fear of radiation]] to create weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction. A fearful public response may in itself accomplish the goals of a terrorist organization to gain publicity or destabilize society.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Countering nuclear and radiological terrorism|last1=Samuel.|first1=Apikyan|last2=J.|first2=Diamond, David|last3=Greg.|first3=Kaser|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=140204920X|oclc=209940539}}</ref> Even simply stealing radioactive materials may trigger a panic reaction from the general public. Similarly, a small-scale release of radioactive materials or a threat of such a release may be considered sufficient for a terror attack.<ref name=":02"/> Particular concern is directed towards the medical sector and healthcare sites which are "intrinsically more vulnerable than conventional licensed nuclear sites".<ref name=":02"/> Opportunistic attacks may range to even kidnapping patients whose treatment involve radioactive materials. Of note is the public reaction to the [[Goiânia accident]], in which over 100,000 people admitted themselves to monitoring, while only 49 were admitted to hospitals. Other benefits to a terrorist organization of a dirty bomb include economic disruption in the area affected, abandonment of affected assets (such a buildings, subways) due to public concern, and international publicity useful for recruitment.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=Terrorist "Dirty Bombs": A Brief Primer|last=Medalia|first=Jonathan|publisher=Congressional Research Service|pages=3–6}}</ref>

==Dirty bomb tests==
Israel carried out a four-year series of tests on nuclear explosives to measure the effects were hostile forces ever to use them against Israel, Israel's Haaretz daily newspaper reported June 8, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/video/israel-tested-dirty-bombs-negev-032510477.html|title=Israel tested 'dirty bombs' in the Negev Desert|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>

== Detection and prevention ==
Dirty bombs may be prevented by detecting illicit radioactive materials in shipping with tools such as a [[Radiation Portal Monitor]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=United States Customs and Border Protection's Radiation Portal Monitors at Seaports|last=Richards|first=Anne|publisher=Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General|year=2013}}</ref> Similarly, unshielded radioactive materials may be detected at checkpoints by [[Geiger counter|Geiger Counters]], gamma-ray detectors, and even Customs and Border Patrol (CBS) pager-sized radiation detectors.<ref name=":12"/> Hidden materials may also be detected by x-ray inspection and heat emitted may be picked up by infrared detectors. Such devices, however, may be circumvented by simply transporting materials across unguarded stretches of coastline or other barren border areas.<ref name=":12" />

One proposed method for detecting shielded Dirty Bombs is Nanosecond Neutron Analysis (NNA).<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Prevention, detection and response to nuclear and radiological threats|last1=Samuel.|first1=Apikyan|last2=J.|first2=Diamond, David|last3=Ralph.|first3=Way|last4=Organization.|first4=North Atlantic Treaty|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402066573|oclc=171556526}}</ref> Designed originally for the detection of explosives and hazardous chemicals, NNA is also applicable to fissile materials. NNA determines what chemicals are present in an investigated device by analyzing emitted γ-emission neutrons and α-particles created from a reaction in the neutron generator. The system records the temporal and spatial displacement of the neutrons and α-particles within separate 3D regions.<ref name=":3" /> A prototype dirty-bomb detection device created with NNA is demonstrated to be able to detect uranium from behind a 5&nbsp;cm-thick lead wall.<ref name=":3" /> Other radioactive material detectors include Radiation Assessment and Identification (RAID) and Sensor for Measurement and Analysis of Radiation Transients, both developed by Sandia National Laboratories.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chad|date=February 2006|title=Transcendental Terrorism And Dirty Bombs: Radiological Weapons Threat Revisited|journal=Occasional Paper: Center for Strategy and Technology|volume=No. 54|pages=24–27}}</ref>

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) recommends certain devices be used in tandem at country borders to prevent transfer of radioactive materials, and thus the building of dirty bombs.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Detection of radioactive materials at borders|last=atomique.|first=Agence internationale de l'énergie|date=2002-01-01|publisher=IAEA|isbn=9201161026|oclc=856404390}}</ref> They define the four main goals of radiation detection instruments as detection, verification, assessment and localization, and identification as a means to escalate a potential radiological situation. The IAEA also defines the following types of instruments:<ref name=":5" />
* Pocket-Type Instruments: these instruments provide a low-power, mobile option to detection that allows for security officers to passively scan an area for radioactive materials. These devices should be easily worn, should have an alarm threshold of three times normal radiation levels, and should have a long battery life - over 800 hours.
* Handheld Instruments: these instruments may be used to detect all types of radiation (including neutron) and may be used to search specific targets flexibly. These instruments should aim for ease of use and speed, ideally weighing less than 2&nbsp;kg and being able to make measurements in less than a second.
* Fixed, installed instruments: these instruments provide a continuous, automatic detection system that can monitor pedestrians and vehicles that pass through. To work effectively pedestrians and vehicles should be led close to the detectors, as performance is directly related to range.
Legislative and regulatory actions can also be used to prevent access to materials needed to create a dirty bomb. Examples include the 2006 U.S. Dirty Bomb Bill, the Yucca Flats proposal, and the Nunn-Lungar act.<ref name=":4" /> Similarly, close monitoring and restrictions of radioactive materials may provide security for materials in vulnerable private-sector applications, most notably in the medical sector where such materials are used for treatments.<ref name=":02"/> Suggestions for increased security include isolation of materials in remote locations and strict limitation of access.

One way to mitigate a major effect of a radiological weapons may also be to educate the public on the nature of radioactive materials. As one of the major concerns of a dirty bomb is the public panic proper education may prove a viable counter-measure.<ref name=":12" /> Education on radiation is considered by some to be "the most neglected issue related to radiological terrorism".<ref name=":02" />

== Personal safety ==
{{See also|Acute radiation syndrome}}

The Dirty Bomb Fact Sheet from FEMA states that the main danger of a dirty bomb comes from the initial blast rather than the radioactive materials<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1621-20490-3999/dirtybombfactsheet_final.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: Dirty Bomb|date=June 2007|website=www.fema.gov|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> To mitigate the risk of radiation exposure, however, FEMA suggests the following guidelines:
* Covering the mouth/nose with cloth to reduce risk of breathing in radioactive materials.
* Avoiding touching materials touched by the explosion.
* Quickly relocating inside to shield from radiation.
* Remove and pack up clothes. Keep clothes until instructed by authorities how to dispose of them.
* Keep radioactive dust outside.
* Remove all dust possible by showering with soap and water.
* Avoid taking [[potassium iodide]], as it only prevents effects from radioactive iodine and may instead cause a dangerous reaction.

==Other uses of the term==
The term has also been used historically to refer to certain types of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Due to the inefficiency of early nuclear weapons, only a small amount of the [[nuclear material]] would be consumed during the explosion. [[Little Boy]] had an efficiency of only 1.4%. [[Fat Man]], which used a different design and a different [[fissile]] material, had an efficiency of 14%. Thus, they tended to disperse large amounts of unused [[fissile material]], and the [[fission product]]s, which are on average much more dangerous, in the form of [[nuclear fallout]]. During the 1950s, there was considerable debate over whether "clean" bombs could be produced and these were often contrasted with "dirty" bombs. "Clean" bombs were often a stated goal and scientists and administrators said that high-efficiency [[nuclear weapon design]] could create explosions which generated almost all of their energy in the form of [[nuclear fusion]], which does not create harmful fission products.

But the ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' accident of 1954, in which a [[nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapon]] produced a large amount of fallout which was dispersed among human populations, suggested that this was not what was actually being used in modern thermonuclear weapons, which derive around half of their yield from a final fission stage of the fast fissioning of the uranium tamper of the secondary. While some proposed producing "clean" weapons, other theorists noted that one could make a nuclear weapon intentionally "dirty" by "salting" it with a material, which would generate large amounts of long-lasting fallout when [[irradiation|irradiated]] by the weapon core. These are known as [[salted bomb]]s; a specific subtype often noted is a [[cobalt bomb]].
