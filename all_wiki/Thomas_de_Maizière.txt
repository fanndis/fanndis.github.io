He previously served as [[Heads of the German Chancellery|Head of the Chancellery]] and [[Federal Minister for Special Affairs of Germany|Federal Minister for Special Affairs]] in the [[First Merkel cabinet]] from 2005 to 2009. Since 2009, he has been a member of the [[Bundestag]] for [[Meissen (district)|Meißen]].

Along with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], De Maizière was one of only three ministers to have continuously served in [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s cabinets from 2005 until 2018.<ref name="businessweek.com">Arne Delfs (22 January 2014), [https://archive.is/20140323130000/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-22/merkel-succession-beckons-after-von-der-leyen-s-defense-posting Merkel Succession Beckons After von der Leyen’s Defense Posting] ''[[Businessweek]]''.</ref> Together with Von der Leyen, he was widely looked on as a possible future successor to Merkel.<ref>Arne Delfs (17 July 2014), [https://archive.is/20141101131059/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-07-16/merkel-at-60-seen-avoiding-kohl-s-fate-as-ratings-hold-up Merkel at 60 Says No Rest on Laurels as Power Uncontested] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> Before his appointment to the federal cabinet, he served as a minister in the state government of [[Saxony]], including as chief of staff to the [[List of Ministers-President of Saxony|Minister-President]], State Minister of Finance and State Minister of Justice.

He graduated at the [[Aloisiuskolleg]] in Bonn and studied law and history at the [[Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität]] in [[Münster]] and the [[University of Freiburg]]. He passed his first state examination in law in 1979 and his second 1982, earning his [[Doctor of law]] (Dr. jur.) in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/Federal-Government/Cabinet/ThomasDeMaiziere/thomas-de-maiziere.html |title=Thomas de Maizière (CDU) |publisher=Federal Government |accessdate=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805131628/http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/Federal-Government/Cabinet/ThomasDeMaiziere/thomas-de-maiziere.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 }}</ref>

He belongs to a noble family originally from [[Maizières-lès-Metz]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12712012/Die-Familie-de-Maiziere-eine-deutsche-Dynastie.html|title=Die Familie de Maizière, eine deutsche Dynastie|language=German|publisher=Welt|date=2011-03-06|accessdate=2017-11-14}}</ref> who, as [[Huguenot]]s, had fled France for asylum in [[Prussia]] in the late 17th century.<ref name="Quick Fill">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/world/europe/03iht-germany03.html|title=Merkel Is Quick to Fill Open Cabinet Position|last=Dempsey|first=Judy|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref> The [[De Maizière (disambiguation)|Maizière family]] still attended French-language schools and Huguenot churches in Berlin until the beginning of the 20th century. His cousin [[Lothar de Maizière]] is also a CDU politician and was the last, and only democratically elected, [[Leadership of East Germany#Heads of government|Premier]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]], who later served as Federal Minister of Special Affairs in the [[Helmut Kohl|Kohl]] government.<ref name="Quick Fill" />

==Political career==
===Early career in state politics===
Maizière worked for the governing mayor (prime minister) of [[West Berlin]] (Baron [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] and [[Eberhard Diepgen]]),<ref name="Merkel shares history with aide">Judy Dempsey (18 October 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/world/europe/18iht-germany.html Merkel shares history with aide] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> before becoming a member of the West German team in the negotiations on [[German reunification]]. After 1990 he worked with re-establishing democratic structures in states that were part of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]. He became secretary of state at the ministry of culture of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in November 1990. From December 1994 to 1998 he was chief of staff of the Chancellery of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

He served as the chief of the [[Sächsische Staatskanzlei|Saxon Chancellery]] from 1999 to 2001, with the rank of cabinet minister. As chief of staff to [[Kurt Biedenkopf]], he helped negotiate the special Solidarity Pact designed to finance the reconstruction of the former East Germany.<ref name="Merkel shares history with aide"/> From 2001 to 2002 he served as the minister of finance of Saxony, from 2002 to 2004 minister of justice, and from 2004 to 2005 as minister of the interior.<ref name="nytimes.com">Judy Dempsey (2 March 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/world/europe/03iht-germany03.html Merkel Is Quick to Fill Open Cabinet Position] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

===Chief of Staff at the Federal Chancellery (2005–2009)===
On 17 October 2005, Maizière was nominated as a member of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]] as chief of the Chancellor's office and as federal minister for special affairs in the [[first Merkel cabinet]].<ref name="nytimes.com"/> He took office on 22 November 2005, after Merkel's election as Chancellor by the [[Bundestag]]. In his capacity as chief of staff of the chancellery, he also functioned as deputy president of the [[German Institute for International and Security Affairs]] (''Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik'').

Between 2007 and 2009, Maizière was one of 32 members of the [[Federalism commission (Germany)|Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state]], which was established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

===Federal Minister of the Interior (2009–2011)===
In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Maizière led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on taxes, national budget, and financial policy; with [[Hermann Otto Solms]] of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] as joint chairman. Following the formation of the [[Second Merkel cabinet]], he took office as [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]].

As Interior Minister, Maizière long played down security worries, but he abruptly changed course late in 2010, giving warnings that there were serious indications of terror attacks being prepared in Europe and the United States.<ref>Erik Kirschbaum and Eric Kelsey (2 March 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/02/germany-merkel-cabinet-idUSLDE7211TG20110302 German ministers in cabinet reshuffle] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In July 2010, he outlawed the [[Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.|Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation]] (IHH), a charity registered in [[Frankfurt]], because of its alleged links to the militant Palestinian organization [[Hamas]], arguing that "the IHH has, under the cover of humanitarian aid, supported [[Gaza Strip]]-based so-called social associations which are attributable to Hamas, for a long period of time and to a considerable financial extent."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-outlaws-charity-over-alleged-hamas-links-1.301483 Germany outlaws charity over alleged Hamas links] ''[[Haaretz]]'', 12 July 2010.</ref> That same month, Maizière announced that Germany would take over and release two prisoners of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/prisoner-plans-germany-agrees-to-take-two-inmates-from-guantanamo-a-705220.html Prisoner Plans: Germany Agrees to Take Two Inmates from Guantanamo] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 7 July 2010.</ref>

In October 2010, Maizière and Transport Minister [[Peter Ramsauer]] banned arrivals of all air cargo from [[Yemen]], after the German authorities had been tipped off by a foreign intelligence service that there were explosives inside a U.S.-bound parcel trans-shipped at [[Cologne Bonn Airport]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/germany-tipped-off-britain-about-mail-bomb-minister-says-1.322159 Germany tipped off Britain about mail bomb, minister says] ''[[Haaretz]]'', 31 October 2010.</ref>

===Minister of Defence (2011–2013)===
[[File:120216-D-TT977-152 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|De Maizière as Minister of Defence at a news conference in 2012]]

On 2 March 2011, Merkel announced that Maizière was to take over from [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]], the federal defence minister who had resigned from office the previous day.<ref name=hel2mar>{{cite news|last=Pidd|first=Helen|title=Angela Merkel appoints her closest adviser as defence minister|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/angela-merkel-appoints-adviser-defence-minister|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011}}</ref> On 3 March, he was formally appointed to this post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1264/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/03/2011-03-02-bk-neue-minister.html |title=Neue Minister ernannt |work=[[Cabinet of Germany]] |accessdate=3 March 2011 |date=3 March 2011 |language=German |trans-title=New ministers appointed }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He held the defence ministry portfolio until 17 December 2013.

Signaling one of the biggest shake-ups in decades for the German military, in 2011 Maizière unveiled plans to reduce troop numbers, cut bureaucracy, and eliminate duplication inside the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]]. Under these proposals, the army was to be turned into a wholly professional force.<ref>Judy Dempsey (18 May 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/world/europe/19iht-germany19.html Germany Plans Deep Cuts to Its Armed Forces] [[International Herald Tribune]].</ref>

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the [[Germany–India relations|diplomatic relations]] between German and [[India]], Maizière participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries’ governments in [[Delhi]] in May 2011.<ref>Günther Bannas (30 May 2011), [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/hoffnung-auf-eurofighter-geschaeft-erste-deutsch-indische-regierungskonsultationen-1640384.html Hoffnung auf „Eurofighter"-Geschäft: Erste deutsch-indische Regierungskonsultationen] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref> On 7 June 2011, he attended the [[state dinner]] hosted by President [[Barack Obama]] in honor of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] at the [[White House]].<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/07/expected-attendees-tonights-state-dinner Expected Attendees at Tonight's State Dinner] [[Office of the First Lady of the United States]], press release of 7 June 2011.</ref>

Speaking to the German newspaper  ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' in February 2012, Maizière said that an [[Israel Defense Forces]] strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was "highly unlikely" to succeed, and noted that such a strike would cause "obvious political damage."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-israeli-military-strike-on-iran-unlikely-to-succeed-1.412501 Germany: Israeli military strike on Iran unlikely to succeed] ''[[Haaretz]]'', 12 February 2012.</ref> During a meeting in Berlin in March 2012, he warned [[Israel]]’s [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] against an attack on [[Iran]], joining other Western countries which were applying heavy international pressure on Israel to prevent it from attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities.<ref>Ofer Aderet (27 March 2012), [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-official-meeting-with-israel-s-barak-left-me-more-concerned-of-war-with-iran-1.421058 Germany official: Meeting with Israel's Barak left me 'more concerned' of war with Iran] ''[[Haaretz]]''.</ref><ref>Barak Ravid (31 March 2012), [http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/diplomania/australia-joins-list-of-countries-warning-against-israeli-strike-on-iran-1.421769 Australia joins list of countries warning against Israeli strike on Iran] ''[[Haaretz]]''.</ref>

In 2012, Maizière told a gathering of army reservists that he considered the U.S. strategy of using [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drones]] for [[targeted killing]]s a "strategic mistake". According to the online news edition of the German public television broadcaster ''[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'', Maizière had said he thought it was unwise to have U.S. commanders direct such attacks from their bases in the United States.<ref>Judy Dempsey (11 June 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/world/europe/12iht-letter12.html Europe Stays Quiet Despite Unease About Drones] [[International Herald Tribune]].</ref>

[[File:Minniti and De Maizière.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Thomas de Maizière with his Italian counterpart [[Marco Minniti]], 2017]]
In the negotiations to form a government following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], Maizière led the CDU/CSU members in the working group on foreign affairs, defense, and development cooperation; his co-chair from the SPD was [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]]. On 17 December 2013, he was appointed as Federal Minister of the Interior for a second time.<ref name="Bio">{{cite news|title=Minister|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/Ministry/Minister/minister_node.html|accessdate=24 February 2014|publisher=Federal Ministry of the Interior|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206035143/http://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/Ministry/Minister/minister_node.html|archivedate=6 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In addition, he co-chairs the [[European People's Party|EPP Justice and Home Affairs Ministers Meeting]], alongside [[Esteban González Pons]].<ref>[http://www.epp.eu/about-us/structure/ Council of the EU and Ministerial meetings] [[European People’s Party]] (EPP).</ref>

On 23 February 2014, ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' reported that Maizière and other members of the government, as well as leading figures in business, were under [[NSA]] surveillance. The newspaper report, quoting an unnamed NSA official, said the U.S. was particularly interested in the interior minister "because he is a close aide of Merkel, who seeks his advice on many issues and was rumored to be promoting his candidacy for the post of [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO secretary-general]]."<ref name="ReutersMerkel+">{{cite web|title=U.S. now bugging German ministers in place of Merkel: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/23/us-germany-usa-spying-idUSBREA1M0IK20140223|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="MerkelAideTargetedByNSA">{{cite news|title=Merkel's aides now on NSA radar, claims Dutch news report|url=http://www.germanynews.net/index.php/sid/220216286/scat/0b761d844c35f1be/ht/Merkels-aides-now-on-NSA-radar-claims-Dutch-news-report|accessdate=24 February 2014|publisher=Germany News.Net}}</ref> From the beginning of 2015, the left-wing opposition and media commentators have repeatedly criticized de Maizière over his record as chief of staff in 2005-09, and over what he knew about Germany's [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|Federal Intelligence Service]] (BND) helping U.S. agencies to spy on European firms such as the defence manufacturer [[Airbus]].<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (29 April 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/29/us-germany-politics-minister-idUSKBN0NK1QD20150429?feedType=RSS&feedName=everything&virtualBrandChannel=11563 Close Merkel ally de Maiziere rejects charges he lied] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In late 2014, Maizière proposed a law according to which the government would have the power to withdraw the [[German identity card|identity card]]s of potential foreign fighters and replace them with another form of identification; this was meant to allow government agencies to prevent Germans from leaving the country to join groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] in Iraq and Syria.<ref>Rainer Buergin and Arne Delfs (17 October 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-17/germany-clamps-down-on-flow-of-fighters-to-islamic-state.html Germany Clamps Down on Flow of Fighters to Islamic State] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> In May 2015, he banned ''Yuruyus'', a leftist-terrorist newspaper published by the Turkish extremist group [[Revolutionary People's Liberation Party–Front|DHKP-C]], and had his ministry order raids across the country in connection with this ban.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/06/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-turkey-paper-banned.html Germany Bans Extremist Turkish Paper, Conducts Raids] ''[[New York Times]]'', 6 May 2015.</ref>

By late 2015, amid the [[European migrant crisis]], de Maizière urged that Europe should set a limit on the number of refugees it takes in and seek out those most clearly entitled to protection.<ref>Francois Murphy (26 November 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/26/us-europe-migrants-germany-idUSKBN0TF0II20151126  German interior minister calls for European refugee cap: newspaper] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> His critics say he failed to fight for more staff and budget for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), which falls under his ministry, despite years of warnings from German states that the agency was being overwhelmed with asylum applications.<ref>Noah Barkin (17 September 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/17/us-europe-migrants-germany-minister-idUSKCN0RH2BV20150917 Loyal Merkel ally in firing line over refugee crisis] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In an effort to better detect the identities of migrants arriving from Syria, Afghanistan and other trouble spots, de Maizière later spearheaded the introduction of an identity card for refugees.<ref>Caroline Copley (9 December 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-idUSKBN0TS1K620151209#ODikvJ2zgKwilx4w.97 German cabinet approves identity card for refugees] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2016, Maizière banned the neo-Nazi group "White Wolves Terror Crew" (WWT) following raids on 15 properties across the country as worries were growing about a rise in right-wing sentiment after the influx of more than a million migrants the previous year.<ref>Madeline Chambers (16 March 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-neonazis-idUSKCN0WI24W Germany bans neo-Nazi group as fears of far-right grow] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In January 2016, Maizière participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and [[Turkey]] in Berlin.<ref>[https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2016/01/2015-01-15-deu-tuerk-regierungskonsultationen-breg.html Erste Deutsch-Türkische Regierungskonsultationen in Berlin] [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government of Germany]], press release of 15 January 2016.</ref>
