'''''All of Us''''' is an American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] television series that premiered on the [[UPN]] network in the United States on September 16, 2003, where it aired for its first three seasons. On October 1, 2006, the show moved to [[The CW]], a new network formed by the merger of UPN and [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] (whose sister company [[Warner Bros. Television]] produced this series), where it aired for one more season before being cancelled on May 14, 2007.<ref name=variety />

==Synopsis==
The series, which was loosely based on creator and executive producers [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] and [[Will Smith]]'s own [[blended family]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-collegian.com/issues/2ndsem07/will_smith.htm |title=Will Smith in Pursuit of  Excellence |accessdate=2007-10-23 |author=Williams, Jean A. |date=March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025040916/http://www.black-collegian.com/issues/2ndsem07/will_smith.htm |archivedate=25 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> revolved around Robert James ([[Duane Martin]]), a divorced television entertainment reporter with a young son, Robert "Bobby" James, Jr. ([[Khamani Griffin]]), and his fiancée, Tia Jewel ([[Elise Neal]]), a kindergarten teacher who helped him through the breakup of his first marriage.

Robert shares custody of his son with his ex wife Neesee ([[LisaRaye McCoy]]), with whom he shares a tenuously friendly relationship for the sake of their son.

Robert also finds himself in a difficult situation, attempting to maintain the peace, however uneasy, between his ex wife and his fiancée. Friends of the couple included Dirk Black ([[Tony Rock]]), Robert's single best friend and producer, and Tia's best friend and fellow teacher Jonelle Abrahams ([[Terri J. Vaughn]]).

In season three, Tia breaks off her engagement to Robert, leaving a newly single Robert faced with a situation wherein Neesee must move in with him and Bobby temporarily after her apartment building is destroyed by fire. In addition to Tia, two other supporting characters, Jonelle and Turtle (James Vincent), were written out of the series. In season four, [[Laivan Greene]] joined the cast as Courtney, Dirk's long lost daughter.

===Cast changes===
In June 2005, [[Elise Neal]], who portrayed Tia Jewel, announced that she would not be returning for the third season of the series due to the salary imbalance between her and co star [[LisaRaye]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In August 2005, [[Terri J. Vaughn]] who played Jonelle Abrahams, and James Vincent, who played Turtle, also announced they would not be returning to the series due to contract issues.

In November 2005, Terri J. Vaughn returned to play Jonelle in a guest appearance for the third season's two part "Legal Affairs" episodes. James Vincent returned to play Turtle in a guest appearance in the third season episode "Creeping With The Enemy".

===Cancellation===
On May 15, 2007, The CW canceled ''All of Us''.<ref name=variety>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2007/tv/features/cw-picks-up-dramas-1117964957/ |title=CW picks up dramas |author=Adalian, Josef |work=Variety |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref> The CW was transitioning to shows that showcased more teenage and young adult dramas as well as Reality, (since ''ANTM'' was the highest rated show on the entire network) and steering away from sitcoms altogether.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm| title=New CW network: who wins, who loses| work=[[CNNMoney.com]]| last=La Monica| first=Paul R.| date=January 25, 2006| accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> While the last season of ''All of Us'' averaged about the same viewers as the third season of ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' or the last four seasons of ''[[Smallville]]'', it, like every other sitcom, be it an original UPN or WB show, was cancelled, as apparent by the CW not acquiring many sitcoms after the merger and slowly cancelling all sitcoms and not funding any after 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2012/05/sitcomsonlinecom-2012-13-upfront_11.html| title=

==Broadcast==

===First run===
''All of Us'' debuted on UPN on September 16, 2003. The series aired on Tuesdays at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. EST for its first season. The show's second season aired on Tuesday nights at 8pm and was paired up with fellow UPN sitcom [[Eve (U.S. TV series)|''Eve'']].

For its third season, UPN moved the series to Mondays at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. EST airing after ''[[One on One (TV series)|One on One]]''. After three seasons of average ratings, and with the fall 2006 launch of The CW necessitating the cancellations of many of UPN and The WB's lower-rated programs, ''All of Us'' was originally slated to be cancelled after the 2005-2006 television season. However, the series was saved at the last minute and placed on The CW's fall 2006 lineup, airing on Sundays at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. EST after ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''.

Due to lackluster ratings, the show moved back to its former Monday night time slot in the beginning of October 2006. During its single season on The CW, ''All of Us'' averaged around 2.74 million viewers per week. ''All of Us'' finished the season at #140 in the ratings, surpassing only ''[[The Game (US TV series)|The Game]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' (encore presentations), and the now cancelled ''[[Runaway (2006 TV series)|Runaway]]''.

===Syndication and reruns===
On September 24, 2007, The CW began airing reruns of ''All of Us'' as part of the network's [[The CW Daytime|daytime programming block]]. Reruns of the show aired weekdays at 3 p.m. EST until September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2007/08/wpix-fall-2007-schedule-fox-revamps.html |title=WPIX Fall 2007 Schedule; Fox Revamps Fall Schedule|accessdate=2007-10-23 |author= Sitcomsonline.com News Blog |date=2007-08-03<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The series is currently airing on ''[[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]''.
