'''France 2''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃s dø|pron}}) is a French public national television channel. It is part of the [[Public broadcasting|state-owned]] [[France Télévisions]] group, along with [[France 3]], [[France 4]], and [[France 5]]. France Télévisions also participates in [[Arte|ARTE]] and [[EuroNews]].

Since 3:20 CET on 7 April 2008, all France 2 programming has been broadcast in 16:9 widescreen format<ref>[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=3897 France 2 goes 16:9 widescreen : Broadband TV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> over the French [[terrestrial television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial television]]. An HD simulcast feed of France 2 has been broadcasting on satellite provider [[CanalSat]] since 1 July 2008 and on digital terrestrial television since 30 October 2008.<ref>[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=5306 France 2 HD launches on CanalSat : Broadband TV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
Originally under the ownership of the [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]], the channel went on the air for the first time on 18 April 1964 as ''[[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]] Télévision 2''. Within a year, [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française|ORTF]] rebranded that channel as ''La deuxième chaîne'' (The Second Channel). Originally, the network was broadcast on 625-line transmitters only in preparation for the discontinuation of [[Analog high-definition television system#French 819-line system|819-line]] black & white transmissions and the introduction of colour. The switch to colour occurred at 14:15 [[Central European Time|CET]] on 1 October 1967, using the [[SECAM]] system. ''La deuxième chaîne'' became the first colour television channel in France. [[TF1]] would not commence colour broadcasting on 625-lines until 1 September 1975. Such technology later allowed the network to air programming in [[NICAM]] stereo (compatible with SECAM).

The present channel is the direct successor of Antenne 2, established under a 1974 law that mandated the breakup of ORTF into seven distinct organisations. Three television "programme corporations" were established on 6 January 1975 – [[TF1]], Antenne 2 and FR3, now [[France 3]] – alongside [[Radio France]], the [[Société française de production]], the public broadcasting agency [[TDF Group|Télédiffusion de France]] and the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]] (INA). Antenne 2 and the other corporations were constituted as limited companies with the state controlling 100% of their capital. Although the three channels were set up as competitors vying for advertisers, they retained a collective monopoly over television broadcasting in France that was not repealed until 1981. Privately owned channels such as [[Canal+]] and [[La Cinq]] (now superseded by [[France 5]]) soon became major competitors to the state-owned channels after the state monopoly was lifted.<ref name="Regourd">Rigourd, Serge. "France", in ''Western Broadcasting at the Dawn of the 21st Century'', pp. 255, 270. Eds. Haenens, Leen; Saeys, Frieda. Walter de Gruyter, 2001. {{ISBN|3-11-017386-7}}</ref> The breakup of ORTF had been intended to stimulate competition between the public channels but failed in this aim; both TF1 and Antenne 2 came to rely on a diet of popular entertainment shows alongside cheap American imports, seeking to maximise ratings and attract advertisers.<ref>Looseley, David. ''Popular Music in Contemporary France: Authenticity, Politics, Debate'', p. 122. Berg Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|1-85973-636-X}}</ref>

TF1 was privatised in 1987, radically affecting the balance of the French television market. The remaining state-owned channels came under severe pressure from their private competitors and lost 30% of their market share between 1987 and 1989.<ref>Rollet, Brigitte. "Television in France", in ''Television in Europe'', pp. 39–40. Eds. Coleman, James A.; Rollet, Brigitte. Intellect Books, 1997. {{ISBN|1-871516-92-7}}</ref> In an effort to save them, a single director-general was appointed to manage both Antenne 2 and FR3 and the two channels merged to form the [[France Télévisions]] group. They were renamed on 7 September 1992 as France 2 and France 3 respectively.<ref>Hart, Jeffrey A. ''Technology, Television, and Competition: The Politics of Digital TV'', p. 46. Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-82624-1}}</ref>

By 1995, the combined audience share of the two state-owned channels was 41%, with France 2 in particular being heavily dependent on advertising and sponsorship revenues, which comprised 43.8% of its budget by 1996. The focus on ratings led to strong rivalry with TF1, for instance prompting the two channels to broadcast popular shows and news programmes in the same timeslots. TF1 and France 2 compete for the same demographics; dramas (including American imports), game shows and light entertainments form the dominant mix on both channels.<ref>Scriven, Michael; Lecomte, Monia.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by France 2}}

==Italian coverage==
From 1975, ''Antenne 2'' was available in Italy (regions of [[Tuscany]], Lazio, [[Veneto|Lower Veneto]] and parts of [[Lombardy]] and [[Liguria]]) using [[SECAM]] and since 1983 using [[PAL]] until 2003 when the frequencies were sold to various television networks like such as [[Canale Italia]] and [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]].

Since 11 December 2006, France 2 was again made available across Italy on [[Digital terrestrial television in Italy|Digital terrestrial television]] until 7 June 2007, when it was replaced by all-news French TV network [[France 24]].

France 2 is now only available in [[Aosta Valley]] due to Italian self-government laws, and in the border zones because of natural spillover.

==Controversy==

===Lebanese Civil War kidnapping of Antenne 2 news team===
In March 1986, an Antenne 2 news team was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] in [[Beirut]] while reporting on the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Philippe Rochot, Georges Hansen, Aurel Cornéa and Jean-Louis Normandin were four of many Western hostages held by terrorists during the conflict. During the opening sequences of Antenne 2 news bulletins, the headlines would be followed by a reminder of the French hostages held in Lebanon, including others such as Michel Seurat and Jean-Paul Kaufman, with names, photos and the length of their captivity. Within a year, most of the news team had been released and returned to France, but the reminders continued until all the hostages had been freed.

===Muhammad al-Durrah shooting===
On 30 September 2000, France 2 aired the famous footage of the shooting of [[Muhammad al-Durrah]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. The scene was filmed by a Palestinian journalist, [[Talal Abu Rahma]], who worked for the station.<ref>[http://www.rorypecktrust.org/Awards01/talal.htm The Rory Peck Trust: Awards 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317162040/http://www.rorypecktrust.org/Awards01/talal.htm |date=17 March 2008 }}</ref> The voiceover, blaming the killing on fire from the [[Israeli Defence Forces]], was provided by the channel's reporter [[Charles Enderlin]]. Subsequently, that account was put in doubt, with others suggesting that the fatal shots could not have come from the IDF position.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200306/fallows Who Shot Mohammed al-Dura?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  France 2 later launched [[libel]] actions against commentators who alleged that the incident was staged.

===2013 report on weapons smuggling from Serbia to France===
France 2 has been accused of knowingly producing and airing a news item whose key part it fabricated and staged.

On 7 March 2013, France 2 aired an eight-minute investigative report purporting to expose a weapons smuggling channel from Serbia to France. The report authors, journalists [[Franck Genauzeau]] and [[Régis Mathé]], traveled to Serbia in February 2013 where they filmed a story claiming that Serbia is a hub for international weapons smuggling. Among its footage, the report showed two masked men – identified as Serbian weapons smugglers – who talked about their supposed illegal activity while showing off some of the weaponry: in particular two hand guns and one [[AK-47|AK-47 Kalashnikov]]. They're also shown firing off rounds in the woods.<ref>[http://www.francetvinfo.fr/video-sur-la-piste-des-trafiquants-de-kalachnikov-de-la-serbie-a-la-france_276401.html Sur la piste des trafiquants de kalachnikovs, de la Serbie à la France];France 2, 8 March 2013</ref>

After the report aired, the [[Police of the Republic of Serbia|Serbian police]]'s criminal department (UKP) conducted a month-long investigation, revealing its findings in May 2013 that parts of the French news story were staged with full knowledge of the two France 2 journalists.<ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Tema-Dana/384489/Namestena-reportaza-Francuska-nacionalna-televizija-izmislila-da-je-Srbija-centar-sverca-oruzja Nameštena reportaža: Francuska nacionalna televizija izmislila da je Srbija centar šverca oružja];''Blic'', 26 May 2013</ref>

According to the police report, Genauzeau and Mathé arrived in Belgrade where they hired a local media fixer named Aleksandar M. who was employed at a Serbian news agency, giving him the task of finding weapons smugglers willing to go before a camera. Aleksandar M. apparently contacted his cousin Nenad Mirković and told him that the French were willing to pay €800 for weapons smugglers. At this point Mirković decided that he himself will appear on camera and also contacted his friend Žarko Blagojević to do the same. In order to make their act more credible, they then obtained two handguns – [[Zastava Arms|Zastava]] 9mm and 7.56mm – from Blagojević's father-in-law and father respectively. They also decided to get an automatic weapon by buying it from certain Milorad Novaković, a resident of [[Umka]]. Apparently, the two first offered him €200, but Novaković wanted €350, at which point they went back to two French journalists asking for more money and getting it.

Coached by Genauzeau and Mathé, the footage featuring masked Blagojević and Mirković was shot at a house owned by Blagojević's friend in Umka. Afterwards, they went into the nearby woods in Duboko near Umka where they fired off a few rounds for the cameras. They then returned the two handguns to Blagojević's father and father in law before selling the Kalashnikov for €100. According to the Serbian police report, Aleksandar M. was paid €300 by the French journalists while Mirković and Blagojević split the €800 between themselves.

Serbian foreign minister [[Ivan Mrkić]] reacted to the police report by "seeking explanations from France as the ministry looks to make sure the untruths from the report are clarified".<ref>[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2013&mm=05&dd=27&nav_id=86380 French national TV fabricates story about weapons smuggling];B92, 27 May 2013</ref>
