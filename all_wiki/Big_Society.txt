The '''Big Society''' was a political ideology<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reflections on 'The Big Society'|author=Matthew Scott|url=http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/1/132.short|journal=Community Development Journal |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=46 |issue=1|pages=132–137 |doi=10.1093/cdj/bsq057 |date=2011| accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> developed in the early 21st century. The idea proposed "integrating the [[free market]] with a theory of social solidarity based on hierarchy and [[volunteering|voluntarism]]". Conceptually it "draws on a mix of conservative [[communitarianism]] and [[soft paternalism|libertarian paternalism]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Walker and Steve Corbett|title=The 'Big Society', neoliberalism and the rediscovery of the 'social' in Britain|url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2013/03/08/big-society-neoliberalism-rediscovery-social-britain/|publisher=Sheffield Political Economy research Institute|date=8 March 2013|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Its roots "can be traced back to the 1990s, and to early attempts to develop a non-[[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]], or post-Thatcherite, brand of UK conservatism" such as [[David Willetts]]' [[Civic Conservatism]] and the revival of [[Red Tory]]ism. Some commentators have seen the Big Society as invoking [[Edmund Burke]]'s idea of [[civil society]], putting it into the sphere of [[one-nation conservatism]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Heywood|title=The Big Society: Conservatism Reinvented?|url=http://www.politicscymru.com/en/cat1/article32|publisher=Politics Cymru|date=2011|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

The term ''Big Society'' was originated by [[Steve Hilton]],<ref name=VAHS/> director of strategy for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the idea became particularly associated with the party's leader [[David Cameron]] who was a strong advocate for it. The idea formed the flagship policy of the 2010 [[List of UK Conservative Party general election manifestos|UK Conservative Party general election manifesto]] and was part of the subsequent legislative programme of the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]].<ref name = BBC18May>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8688860.stm|title=Cameron and Clegg set out 'big society' policy ideas|work=BBC News|date=18 May 2010}}</ref> The stated aim was to create a climate that empowered local people and communities, building a "big society" that would take power away from politicians and give it to people.<ref name=PM18May>{{cite news|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/big-society-50248|title=Government launches "Big Society" programme|publisher=10 Downing Street website|date=18 May 2010}}</ref>

In UK politics the Big Society concept applied to [[domestic policy]] in England only. The relevant policy areas are devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and are therefore the responsibilities of respectively the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Government]] in those countries.

==Launch==
Following the election of a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government]] at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the new Conservative Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] launched the initiative in July with a speech at [[Liverpool Hope University]]<ref name=bbcjuly19>{{cite news|title=David Cameron launches Tories' 'big society' plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10680062|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 July 2010 | date=19 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719193221/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10680062| archivedate= 19 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> accompanied by screenwriter and television producer [[Phil Redmond]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hawkins|first=Ross|title=Will the "big society" help big cuts?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10687446|accessdate=19 July 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100723021400/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10687446| archivedate= 23 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The stated priorities were:

* The [[National Citizen Service]] is a voluntary personal and social development programme for 16- and 17-year-olds in England. It was piloted in 2011 and by 2013 there were 30,000 young people taking part.
* The [[Localism Act 2011]] contained a section on community empowerment. New rights were created for [[charitable trust]]s, voluntary bodies and others to apply to councils to carry out services provided by the council. In addition, lists of ''Assets of Community Value'' were compiled. These were assets such as shops, pubs and playing fields, which were privately owned, but which were of value to the community. If such an asset was later sold, the Act made it easier for the community to bid for and take over the asset.
* [[Free school (England)|Free school]]s (otherwise known as [[charter school]]s) were introduced by the [[Academies Act 2010]] making it possible for parents, teachers, charities and businesses to set up and run their own schools.

==Response==
While some responded to the policy favourably and [[David Cameron]] continued to defend it,<ref name=Obs31Feb11>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/12/david-cameron-big-society-good|author=David Cameron|title=Have no doubt, the big society is on its way|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=13 February 2011|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> its aims were queried and disputed by other commentators from all sides of the political spectrum.

===Initial press reaction===

In March 2010, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote: "We demand vision from our would-be leaders, and here is one who offers a big one, of a society rebuilt from the ground up".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brogan|first=Ben|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/benedict-brogan/7542467/Election-2010-Eureka-At-last-I-can-see-what-David-Cameron-is-on-about.html |title=Eureka! At last, I can see what David Cameron is on about| work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 March 2010}}</ref> In April 2010 ''[[The Times]]'' described the Big Society as "an impressive attempt to reframe the role of government and unleash entrepreneurial spirit".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article7096805.ece|title=The big society|publisher=The Times Online (subscription only)| date=14 April 2010}}</ref> Later in the same year, ''[[The Spectator]]'' said that "Cameron hoped to lessen financial shortfalls by raiding dormant bank accounts. It's a brilliant idea in theory".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Blackburn |first=David |title=The age of philanthropy |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6152233/the-age-of-philanthropy.thtml |accessdate=19 July 2010 |magazine=[[The Spectator]] |date=19 July 2010 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722023703/http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6152233/the-age-of-philanthropy.thtml |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Questions concerning originality===

Two days after the initiative's launch in Liverpool, an article in ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' argued that community organisations in the city such as [[Bradbury Fields]] show that Cameron's ideas are already in action and are nothing new, and that groups of community-based volunteers have for many years provided "a better service than would be achieved through the public sector".<ref name="gleeson-daily-post">{{cite news | url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/ldpbusiness/2010/07/21/bill-gleeson-can-cameron-s-big-society-be-a-profitable-place-92534-26896101/ | title=Can Cameron's big society be a profitable place? | newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post | accessdate=4 February 2011 }}</ref>

Simon Parker, Director of the [[New Local Government Network]], argued that although "there is little in the [[coalition]] government's agenda that is entirely novel, what is new is the scale of change required." Ben Rogers, in an opinion piece published in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', suggested that "the most interesting thing about [Cameron's] speech [to the Conservative Party Conference] were its sections on the "Big Society"", and that "Most of the political problems Mr Cameron faces, from cutting crime to reducing obesity, can only be met if residents and citizens play their part". However, Rogers went on to state that "the state has so far invested very little in teaching the skills that could help people make a contribution", highlighting what he perceived to be a fundamental flaw in the programme.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4dc03ba8-d151-11df-8422-00144feabdc0.html Cameron's speech strongest on Big Society] ''[[Financial Times]]'' 6 October 2010</ref>

David Cameron responded that the policy's lack of novelty does not detract from its usefulness and that it should be judged on its results.<ref name=Obs31Feb11/>

===Small state criticism===
The implementation of the policy coincided with large-scale cuts in public expenditure programs which were implemented to address macroeconomic concerns. In 2010 David Cameron indicated that such cuts were temporary and to be enacted purely from economic necessity. However, in 2013 he said that he had no intention of resuming spending once the structural deficit had been eliminated, since his aim was to create a "leaner, more efficient state".<ref>{{cite news|author=Nicholas Watt|title=David Cameron makes leaner state a permanent goal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/david-cameron-policy-shift-leaner-efficient-state|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> This led critics to conclude that the Big Society is intended primarily as a mechanism for reducing the size of the state. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] said that the Conservatives were "cynically attempting to dignify its cuts agenda, by dressing up the withdrawal of support with the language of reinvigorating civic society"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=Cameron promises power for the 'man and woman on the street'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/19/david-cameron-big-society-cuts|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=19 July 2010 | location=London | date=19 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721070407/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jul/19/david-cameron-big-society-cuts| archivedate= 21 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> and suggested that the Big Society is a "cloak for the small state".<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/ed-miliband-the-big-society-a-cloak-for-the-small-state-2213011.html  The Big Society: a cloak for the small state] [[The Independent]] 12 February 2011</ref>

Of the political weeklies, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' said "Cameron's hope that the Big Society will replace [[Big Government]] is reminiscent of the old Marxist belief that the state will '[[withering away of the state|wither away]]' as a result of victorious socialism. We all know how that turned out.

[[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] general secretary [[Brendan Barber]] concluded that "the logic of this is that [Cameron's] ideal society is [[Somalia]] where the state barely exists".<ref name=Barber>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/8323095/Big-Society-reactions-to-David-Camerons-project.html|title=Big Society: reactions to David Cameron's project|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>

David Cameron's response was that the Big Society ideology pre-dated the implementation of cuts to public services, that the reduction in the size of the state had become inevitable, and that Big Society projects are worthwhile whatever the state of the economy.<ref name=Obs31Feb11/>

In April 2012 criticisms were raised concerning the shortage of Big Society policies across Government, such as the lack of employee-owned mutuals and social enterprises in public sector reforms as well as the introduction of a cap on tax relief for charitable giving in the 2012 Budget.<ref name=VAHS>{{Cite web|author=George Campbell Gosling|url=http://www.vahs.org.uk/2012/04/coalition-gosling/|title=Charity and the Coalition: Whatever Happened to the Big Society?|publisher=Voluntary Action History Society Blog|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> A report published in May 2012 suggested that the £3.3&nbsp;billion cuts in government funding to the voluntary sector between 2012 and 2015 had greatly reduced the capacity of voluntary groups to implement Big Society projects.<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Butler|title=Cameron's 'big society' undermined by cuts and distrust, says study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/07/david-cameron-big-society-cuts-distrust|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Bernard Collier expressed concern that the policy's lack of localism was "favouring big charities" and ignoring the "potential contribution of local voluntary and community organisations".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernard Collier|title=The big hole in 'big society'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/community-action-blog/2012/jul/16/big-hole-society-local-needs|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 July 2012|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2014 former Cameron aide Danny Kruger said that although the relevant legislation had been put in place, the policy had been downgraded from its original role due to a lack of leadership. At the same time a [[Centre for Social Justice]] report suggested that the policy was having least effect in the poorest in the country where it would be most useful.<ref>{{cite news|author=Toby Helm|title=David Cameron 'has devalued the big society idea' says his former adviser|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/05/tories-cameron-big-society-danny-kruger|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 January 2014|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

David Cameron responded that the public sector had already failed to prevent the poorest parts of the country becoming so, and that there were examples of the Big Society having been effective in poor areas.<ref name=Obs31Feb11/>

=== Decline ===
During the course of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|2010–15 government]] the Big Society declined as an instrument of government policy. David Cameron did not use the term in public after 2013 and the phrase ceased to be used in government statements.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why the 'big society' is now just a hashtag for coalition hypocrisy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/20/the-big-society-civil-exchange-audit-shows-coalition-contempt-and-hypocrisy|author=Patrick Butler|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 January 2015}}</ref> The collapse of the Big Society Network in 2014 and criticism of the Prime Minister's relationship with it<ref name=Ignored/> were followed by a critical final Big Society Audit published by ''Civil Exchange'' in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whose Society? The Final Big Society Audit|url=http://www.civilexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Whose-Society_The-Final-Big-Society-Audit_final.pdf|publisher=Civil Exchange|date= January 2015}}</ref> The audit highlighted cuts in charity grants and restrictions on the right to challenge government policy through the courts as undermining Big Society ideals. It noted that charities have had a decreasing role as government contractors due to policies which favoured the private sector and it pointed out that the centralisation of the British political system has not significantly decreased, with no noticeable upsurge in volunteering and social action concentrated in the wealthiest places. The [[Cabinet Office]] responded that the ''Civil Exchange'' report did not fairly reflect "the significant progress made". In response to a parliamentary question claiming that the Big Society had failed, the Government said that "cynics" were "entirely wrong" and that "some of the changes we have introduced are irreversible".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05883.pdf.pdf|title=The voluntary sector and the Big Society|publisher=House of Commons Library|author=John Woodhouse|date=26 March 2015}}</ref>

Shortly before the 2015 election, David Cameron proposed a law that would give some employees the right to three days of paid annual leave to do voluntary work.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cameron harks back to Big Society with voluntary work proposal|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/32a12c84-decf-11e4-852b-00144feab7de.html#axzz3X5NsQqYF|date=9 April 2015|newspaper=Financial Times|author1= George Parker|author2=Elizabeth Rigby}}</ref> The proposal appeared in the Party's manifesto, along with a guarantee of a place on the National Citizen Service for all children and an increase the use of social impact bonds.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Tories promise to build on big society in general election manifesto |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/tories-promise-build-big-society-general-election-manifesto/policy-and-politics/article/1342626 |newspaper=Third Sector |location= |date=14 April 2015 |access-date=1 June 2015 }}</ref> However, the Big Society did not form a significant part of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s election strategy, being replaced instead by an emphasis on economic stability and border controls.<ref>{{cite news|title=We need to bring back the Big Society – but without Government meddling|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/liamhalligan/11456663/We-need-to-bring-back-the-Big-Society-but-without-Government-meddling.html|author=Liam Halligan|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 March 2015}}</ref>
