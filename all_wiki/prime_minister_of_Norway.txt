{{Politics of Norway}}

The '''prime minister of Norway''' ({{lang-no|statsminister}}, which translates to the "minister of state") is the [[head of government]] and [[chief executive]] of [[Norway]]. The prime minister and [[Cabinet of Norway|Cabinet]] (consisting of all the most senior government department heads) are collectively [[Accountability#Political accountability|accountable]] for their policies and actions to the [[Monarchy of Norway|monarch]], to the [[Storting|Storting (Parliament of Norway)]], to their [[List of political parties in Norway|political party]], and ultimately the electorate.  In practice, since it is nearly impossible for a government to stay in office against the will of the Storting, the prime minister is primarily answerable to the Storting. The prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the Storting, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition.

Norway has a [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]], which was adopted on 17 May 1814.<ref name="CONSTITUTION">{{cite news |title=NORWAY'S STRUGGLE WITH HER KING.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/11/11/103426729.pdf|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 November 1882| format=PDF}}</ref> The position of prime minister is the result of legislation. Modern prime ministers have few statutory powers, but provided they can command the support of their parliamentary party, they can control both the legislature and the executive (the cabinet) and hence wield considerable ''de facto'' powers. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the prime minister of Norway is [[Erna Solberg]], of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].

Unlike their counterparts in the rest of Europe, Norwegian prime ministers do not have the option of advising the king to dissolve the Storting and call a [[snap election]]. The constitution requires that the Storting serve out its full four-year term. If the prime minister loses the confidence of the Storting, they must resign.
