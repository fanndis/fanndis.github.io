The '''National Trust for Historic Preservation''' is a privately funded, [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], that works in the field of [[historic preservation]] in the [[United States]]. The member-supported organization was founded in 1949 by [[congressional charter]] to support the preservation of America’s diverse historic buildings, neighborhoods, and heritage through its programs, resources, and advocacy.

==Overview==
[[File:WatergateFromAir.JPG|thumb|The National Trust for Historic Preservation is headquartered in the [[Watergate complex]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The National Trust for Historic Preservation aims to empower local preservationists by providing leadership to save and revitalize America's historic places, and by working on both national policies as well as local preservation campaigns through its network of field offices and preservation partners, including the [[National Park Service]], [[State historic preservation office|State Historic Preservation Offices]], and local preservation groups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://savingplaces.org/we-are-saving-places|title=We’re Saving Places {{!}} National Trust for Historic Preservation|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

The National Trust is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], with field offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Denver]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Seattle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://savingplaces.org/we-are-saving-places|title=We're Saving Places {{!}} National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=savingplaces.org|language=en-US|access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref> The organization is governed by a [[board of trustees]] and led by president & CEO, Paul Edmondson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://savingplaces.org/national-trust-leadership|title=National Trust Leadership {{!}} National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=savingplaces.org|language=en-US|access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref> As of January 2020, the National Trust reports that it has around 300,000 members and supporters.<ref>National Trust for Historic Preservation. [https://savingplaces.org/corporate-partners "Partner with US"] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved January 5, 2020.</ref>

In addition to leading campaigns and advocacy, the National Trust provides a growing educational resource through the Preservation Leadership Forum, which offers articles, journals, case studies, and conferences and training. The National Trust issues the quarterly [[Preservation (magazine)|''Preservation'']] magazine as well as online stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://savingplaces.org/stories|title=Stories {{!}} National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=savingplaces.org|language=en-US|access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref>

The National Trust’s current work focuses on building [[sustainable communities]] through the [[adaptive reuse]] of historic spaces; preserving and empowering [[cultural diversity]] through protecting sites of cultural significance; advocating for greater [[stewardship]] of historic places on [[public land]]; and leading innovation in the management of historic properties.

==History==
[[File:Andrew Mellon Building - Dupont Circle.JPG|thumb|The National Trust for Historic Preservation's former headquarters of 35 years, the [[Andrew Mellon Building]], located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]] The National Trust moved its headquarters to the [[Watergate complex]] in 2013.]]
Toward the end of the 19th century, in response to increased immigration and the broad effort of rebuilding after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the country was developing a renewed sense of national identity and history. The government began to enact legislation for the preservation of sites and objects deemed significant to the nation’s history. In 1872, an [[Act of Congress]] established the first [[National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]].<ref name="Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6">{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=6}}</ref> In 1906, the [[Antiquities Act]] enabled the President to declare landmarks or objects as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]].<ref name="Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6"/> Then in 1935, during the Great Depression, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]], which outlined programs for research and inventory of historic sites.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=8}}</ref>

Meanwhile, historic preservation initiatives existed on local and state levels. In 1931, [[Charleston, South Carolina]] created the first [[historic district]] for protection.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=7}}</ref> However, efforts to save and maintain historic sites were still largely limited to private citizens or local groups.

In the late 1940s, leaders in American historic preservation saw the need for a national organization to support local preservation efforts. In 1946, [[David E. Finley, Jr.]], [[George McAneny]], Christopher Crittenden, and Ronald Lee met at the [[National Gallery of Art]] to discuss the formation of such a national organization.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.2">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=2}}</ref> This meeting was followed by a larger gathering on April 15, 1947, attended by representatives from a number of art, architectural, and [[historical societies]], which culminated in the creation of the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.2"/> The meeting’s attendants became the first charter members of the Council.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.3">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=3}}</ref> The organization’s first headquarters was in the offices of [[Ford’s Theatre|Ford’s Theatre (Lincoln Museum)]] in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=4}}</ref>

The Council pursued the formation of a National Trust for Historic Preservation, somewhat modeled on the British [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which would be tasked with the acquisition and maintenance of historic properties.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.3"/> The creation of the National Trust was proposed as a bill to Congress, H.R. 5170, introduced by Congressman J. Hardin Peterson of Florida and passed.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.5">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=5}}</ref>

The private, non-profit National Trust for Historic Preservation was formally established by charter through the Act of Congress when President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the legislation on October 26, 1949. The charter provided that the Trust should acquire and preserve historic sites and objects of national significance and provide annual reports to Congress on its activities.<ref name="Finley, David E 1965 p.5"/> Finley served as the National Trust's first chairman of the board, remaining in the position for 12 years.<ref name="Remembering Louise Crowninshield.">Burdick, Kim (2000).

[[File:Woodlawn August 2003 A.jpg|thumb|right|[[Woodlawn (Alexandria, Virginia)|Woodlawn Plantation]] & [[Loren Pope Residence|Pope-Leighey House]], [[Alexandria, Virginia]] was the first site acquired for the National Trust portfolio.]] The National Trust and the National Council existed side by side for several years until the need to merge resources compelled the Executive Committee to integrate the two entities. In 1952, the boards of both organizations approved a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of the Council into the National Trust.<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=11}}</ref> The merger was effective the following year and was completed by 1956.<ref name="Remembering Louise Crowninshield."/> The National Trust became a membership organization and assumed all other functions of the National Council.

In its early years, the National Trust’s founders envisioned an organization whose primary purpose would be the acquisition and administration of historic sites, while encouraging public participation in their preservation.<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=1}}</ref> In 1957, the National Trust officially acquired its first property, [[Woodlawn (Alexandria, Virginia)|Woodlawn Plantation]] in northern [[Virginia]].<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=7}}</ref> Since then, the National Trust portfolio of historic properties and contracted affiliates has expanded to include twenty-seven historic sites, ranging from the 18th-century [[Drayton Hall]] in [[South Carolina]] to the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] [[Glass House]] in [[Connecticut]].<ref>National Trust for Historic Preservation (2014). [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/trustees.html "Sites."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved January 15, 2014.</ref>

Over the next decade, the National Trust grew to become the leading national organization in historic preservation. They began working with citizens and city planning officials on legislative matters, including federal, state, and municipal ordinances for historic preservation.<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=17}}</ref> National Trust staff also traveled to parts of the country to advise local communities on preservation projects.<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=16}}</ref>

In 1966, Congress passed the [[National Historic Preservation Act]], significant legislation for the preservation movement. The Act also provided federal funding in support of the National Trust’s work. The funding later ceased in 1996, at which point the National Trust became entirely privately funded.

Following the adoption of the National Historic Preservation Act, the National Trust broadened in its mission beyond administering historic sites. In 1969, the National Trust created the Preservation Services Fund to provide financial assistance to local preservation projects.<ref name="preservationnation.org">National Trust for Historic Preservation (2014). [http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/history.html "A Brief History of the National Trust."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved January 15, 2014.</ref> In 1971, the National Trust opened its first field office in San Francisco.<ref name="preservationnation.org"/> As the organization grew, the National Trust expanded its work, consisting of programs, educational resources, and advocacy. In 1980, the National Trust initiated the National Main Street Center, specializing in revitalizing historic business districts, which has since transitioned into a subsidiary.<ref name="preservationnation.org"/>

[[File:Glasshouse-philip-johnson.jpg|thumb|The portfolio of National Trust sites has expanded to include Phillip Johnson's [[Glass House]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut]].]]
In 2010, [[Stephanie K. Meeks|Stephanie Meeks]] became the organization’s president, replacing [[Richard Moe]], who had led the organization for 17 years.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline (June 15, 2010). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/14/AR2010061402717.html "Stephanie Meeks to Lead the National Trust for Historic Preservation."] ''The Washington Post.''</ref> She directed the National Trust’s work toward a more focused, cause-based approach, and conducted more robust outreach to local preservationists. As part of this new approach, the National Trust initiated the National Treasures portfolio; it specifically identifies threatened sites and creates strategies to preserve them.

In 2013, the National Trust headquarters moved from the [[Andrew Mellon Building]] on 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, NW in Washington D.C.’s [[Dupont Circle]] to the historic [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]].<ref name="washingtonpost.com">O’Connell, Jonathan (June 17, 2013).

The National Trust’s programs include National Treasures, launched in 2011, which campaigns to save threatened historic landmarks; and publication of the annual list of America's [[America's Most Endangered Places|11 Most Endangered Historic Places]], first issued in 1988, which highlights endangered sites across the country.

Meeks stepped down as president<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/07/23/stephanie-meeks-to-step-down-from-the-national.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|title=Stephanie Meeks to step down from the National Trust for Historic Preservation |date=July 23, 2018|access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref> in December 2018.

===America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places List===
{{Main|America's Most Endangered Places}}
First published in 1988, the National Trust’s list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places is an annual list that highlights endangered historic sites across the United States. The list serves to raise national awareness of these sites. The sites are nominated by the public and eventually selected based on a range of factors, including its significance, whether there is a local group engaged in its preservation, the urgency of the threat, and potential solutions to that threat.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/11-most-endangered/about-america-s-11-most-endangered-historic-places.html |title=About America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places|website=PreservationNation.org|accessdate= September 4, 2014}}</ref>

The National Trust for Historic Preservation created Historic Hotels of America in 1989, with 32 charter members.<ref name="hha"/> Historic Hotels of America identifies hotels that have maintained their authenticity, sense of place, and architectural integrity. As of June 5, 2015, the program includes over 260 members in 44 states, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<ref name=hha>{{cite web|title=About Historic Hotels of America|url=http://www.historichotels.org/about-historic-hotels/|website=Historic Hotels of America|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref>

To be included in the program, hotels must be at least 50 years old; designated by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior as a [[National Historic Landmark]] or listed in or eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]];<ref name=NRA>{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/|website=nps.gov/nr|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> and recognized as having historic significance.

===National Treasures===
Initiated in 2011, the National Treasures program identifies historically significant landmarks that face imminent threat. With the support of local preservationists, the National Trust leads direct action to save these sites through fundraising, coalition building, and legal advocacy. The sites are selected based on criteria including: integrity, contribution to America’s diverse history, and preservation strategies that can be applied to other sites.<ref>{{cite web|website=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/org-assessment-docs/NationalTreasuresSelectionProcessOverview120211.pdf |title=National Treasures: Selection Process Overview|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref>

The growing portfolio of National Treasures includes, for example:
*[[Fort Monroe]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]
*[[Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, California]]
* [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]]
*[[Miami Marine Stadium]] in [[Miami, Florida]]
*The historic [[Rosenwald School]]s built in the early 19th century to educate African-American children.<ref>{{cite web|website=National Trust for Historic Preservation|url=http://savingplaces.org/ |title=National Treasures|accessdate= January 15, 2014}}</ref>
*[[South Side Community Art Center]]

===Preservation Leadership Forum and resources===
The National Trust for Historic Preservation organizes the Preservation Leadership Forum, a network of preservation professionals.<ref>{{cite web|website=forum.savingplaces.org|title=Join|url=https://forum.savingplaces.org/join}}</ref>

==Advocacy==
The National Trust’s advocacy arm works to effect policy at the local, state, and federal level. Current advocacy priorities are:

=== Historic Tax Credit (HTC) and Creating American Prosperity through Preservation (CAPP) Act ===
The Historic Tax Credit (HTC) is the federal tax credit program that incentivizes the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The HTC, which has rehabilitated more than 38,700 buildings and leveraged about $106 billion in private investment nationwide, is in danger of being eliminated in current budget-balancing discussions in Congress.<ref>National Trust for Historic Preservation. [http://www.preservationnation.org/take-action/advocacy-center/policy-resources/historic-tax-credits.html "Historic Tax Credits."] ''PreservationNation.org.'' Retrieved January 15, 2014.</ref> The National Trust and its partners advocate for the Creating American Prosperity through Preservation (CAPP) Act to preserve the tax credit policy.

=== Federal transportation legislation ===
The federal Department of Transportation Act of 1966 included Section 4(f), which stipulates that planners must develop projects that protect or avoid historic resources. However, Section 4(f) is periodically challenged through the transportation reauthorization process, most recently during the consideration of MAP-21.<ref>National Trust for Historic Preservation. [http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/sustainable-communities/creating/transportation/section-4f.html "Section 4(f)."] ''Preservation Leadership Forum.'' Retrieved January 15, 2014.</ref> Due to work by preservationists, Section 4(f) remains intact.

=== Public lands ===
The National Trust advocates for the preservation of historic and cultural resources on federal [[public land]]s, partnering with the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], and the [[National Park Service]].<ref>National Trust for Historic Preservation.
