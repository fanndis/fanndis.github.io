*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?173693-1/arizona-gubernatorial-debate Complete video of debate], October 30, 2002

===Results===
The election was extremely close:  Napolitano won by just 11,819 votes out of 1,226,111 cast, the closest gubernatorial election in [[Arizona]] in many years.  Under Arizonan law, the losing candidate may request a recount, for which that candidate must pay, if the margin of victory is less than one percent but greater than half of one percent.  In 2002, the margin of victory in 2002 was 0.97%, barely allowing a recount.

It soon became apparent that Napolitano had won the election and would be the next [[Governor of Arizona]].  Salmon acknowledged that the chance of his prevailing in a recount was extremely small and decided not to ask for one (recounts seldom see a swing over 1,000 votes {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}; he was losing by over 10,000).  He officially called Napolitano on November 17 and congratulated her on her victory.

On November 20, [[Arizona Secretary of State]] [[Betsey Bayless]] certified the results of the election and declared Napolitano the governor-elect.
