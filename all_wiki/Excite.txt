'''Excite''' (stylized as '''excite''') is a [[web portal]] launched in 1995 that provides a variety of content including [[news]] and [[weather]], a [[metasearch engine]], a [[web-based email]], [[instant messaging]], [[Financial quote|stock quotes]], and a customizable user [[homepage]]. It is currently operated by [[IAC Applications]] (formerly Mindspark) of [[IAC (company)|IAC]], and Excite Networks. In the U.S., the main Excite site has long been a personal [[start page]] called '''My Excite'''. Excite also operates an [[e-mail]] service, registration for a new account was not obtainable for a short period but was obtainable again in late 2019.

The original Excite company was founded in 1994 and [[initial public offering|went public]] two years later. Excite was one of the most recognized brands on the [[Internet]] that decade, with the main portal site Excite.com being the sixth most visited website in 1997 and fourth by 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tech.co/news/top-20-popular-websites-1996-present-infographic-2014-12|title=Infographic: Top 20 Most Popular Websites (1996-2013)|date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> The company merged with broadband provider [[@Home Network]] but together went bankrupt in 2001. Excite's portal and services were acquired by [[iWon.com]] and then by [[Ask Jeeves]], but the website went into a steep decline in popularity afterwards.

== History ==
Excite originally started as ''Architext'' in June 1993 at a garage in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], California,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/btob/zdnet-unveils-major-redesign/265662|title=ZDNet unveils major redesign|date=December 5, 2006|website=adage.com}}</ref> by Graham Spencer, [[Joe Kraus]], Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried, who were all students at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/people/graham-spencer-joe-kraus-ben-lutch-mark-van-haren-ryan-mcintyre-martin-reinfried/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120074526/https://www.businessinsider.com/people/graham-spencer-joe-kraus-ben-lutch-mark-van-haren-ryan-mcintyre-martin-reinfried/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 20, 2009|title=Graham Spencer, Joe Kraus, Ben Lutch, Mark Van Haren, Ryan McIntyre and Martin Reinfried|date=November 20, 2009}}</ref> The goal was to create software to manage the vast information on the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name="auto">''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 71 - Supplement 34'', edited by Allen Kent</ref> In July 1994, [[International Data Group]] paid them US$80,000 to develop an online service. In January 1995, [[Vinod Khosla]] (a former Stanford student), a partner at venture capital firm [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers]] arranged a US$250,000 "first round" backing for the project, with US$1.5 million provided over a ten-month period. Soon thereafter, Geoff Yang, of [[Institutional Venture Partners]], introduced an additional US$1.5 million in financing and Excite was formally launched in October 1995.<ref name="auto"/>

In January 1996, George Bell joined Excite as its [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO). Excite also purchased two search engines ([[Magellan (search engine)|Magellan]] and [[WebCrawler]]) and signed exclusive distribution agreements with [[Netscape]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer|Apple]], in addition to other companies. [[Jim Bellows]], then 72, was hired by Excite in 1994 to figure out how to present the content in a journalistic manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/newspaper-editor-jim-bellows-dies-1118000933/|title=Newspaper editor Jim Bellows dies|first1=Pat|last1=Saperstein|date=March 6, 2009}}</ref> He paid good journalists to write brief reviews of web sites. However, users wanted to get directly to the content and skipped the reviews, so the partnership with Bellows ended in 1998. Excite's original website design was mostly based on the orange color. In 1997 it was redesigned with a black and yellow theme, which mostly continues to this day.

On April 4, 1996, Excite went public with an [[initial public offering|initial offering]] of two million shares. Its offering was however overshadowed by its biggest rival, [[Yahoo!]], which also went public at the same time. Excite's six founders became millionaires after the offering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-millionaires-next-door|title=The Millionaires Next Door|first1=Tia|last1=O'Brien|website=Stanford Magazine}}</ref> In November 1996, [[America Online]] (AOL) agreed to make Excite its exclusive search and directory service, in return of a larger 20 percent share in Excite and sale of WebCrawler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1996/11/25/technology/excite/|title=AOL gets Excited - Nov. 25, 1996|website=money.cnn.com}}</ref> In June 1997, [[Intuit]], maker of [[Quicken]] and [[TurboTax]], purchased a 19% stake in Excite and finalized a seven-year partnership deal. On October 16, 1997, Excite purchased Netbot, a [[comparison shopping agent]]. At the same time Intuit announced the launch of ''Excite Business & Investing''. Later that year a deal was finalized with [[Ticketmaster]] to provide direct online ticketing. On March 31, 1998, Excite reported a net loss of approximately $30.2 million and according to its first quarter report it had only enough available capital to meet obligations through December.<ref>[http://sec.edgar-online.com/excite-inc/10-k-annual-report/1999/02/09/section22.aspx "EXCITE INC Annual Report (10-K) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"].

A November 1997 press release showed that there were about 11.8 million unique visitors to the Excite "network" during a 28-day period from September to October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/sigdl98/sigdl98.html|title=Data and Analysis from a Large Sample of Web Queries: A focus on the failures|website=faculty.ist.psu.edu}}</ref>

In December 1998, Yahoo! was in negotiations to purchase Excite for $5.5 billion to $6 billion. However, prompted by Kleiner Perkins, [[@Home Network]]'s Chairman and [[CEO]], Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite's chairman and CEO George Bell on December 19, and Excite was subsequently acquired by @Home Network, on January 19, 1999. At this time, Excite was the sixth largest Internet portal by traffic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/1999/01/19/mu2.html|title=@Home and Excite: big news little substance|website=Forbes}}</ref> At one point, [[Microsoft]] was also interested in Excite, and had plans to merge it into its own [[MSN.com]] portal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/01/excite/|title=The $7 Billion Delusion|first=Frank|last=Rose|date=January 1, 2002|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>

{{anchor|1999: Offer by Google to sell itself rejected by Excite}}According to Justin Rohrlich, writing for Minyanville.com, later in 1999, two graduate students at [[Stanford University]], [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Larry Page]], decided that [[Google]], the search engine they had developed, was taking up time they should have been using to study. They went to Bell and offered it to him for $1 million, but Bell rejected the offer, and later threw [[Vinod Khosla]], one of Excite's venture capitalists, out of his office after he had negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. Excite's refusal to buy what became a $900 billion company by 2019 was labeled by Rohrlich a "stupid business decision".<ref name="Google refusal">{{cite web|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|title=Stupid Business Decisions: Excite Rejects Google’s Asking Price|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/excite-google-microsoft-yahoo-apple-bankruptcy/3/1/2010/id/27013/?from=msn|publisher=Minyanville.com|date=April 25, 2010|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2010/09/29/excite-passed-up-buying-google-for-750000-in-1999/|title=Excite passed up buying Google for $750,000 in 1999|website=Fortune}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/google-excite/|title=When Google Wanted To Sell To Excite For Under $1 Million — And They Passed}}</ref> In a 2014 podcast and later again to [[CNBC]], then-CEO of Excite, George Bell, said that the deal fell apart because Larry Page wanted Excite's search technologies to be replaced by Google's, to which Bell did not agree on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/11/the-real-reason-excite-turned-down-buying-google-for-750000-in-1999/|title=The Real Reason Excite Turned Down Buying Google For $750,000 In 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/02/dotcom-bubble-ceo-why-i-passed-on-buying-google.html|title=Dotcom Bubble CEO: Why I passed on buying Google|first=Bree|last=Kelly|date=March 2, 2015|website=CNBC}}</ref>

===Excite@Home===
{{Main|@Home Network}}
[[File:Excite@Home headquarters for sale.jpg|thumb|left|Excite@Home headquarters for sale. The buildings have since been re-purposed as a medical facility]]

The US$6.7 billion merger of Excite and [[@Home Network]] in 1999 became one of the largest mergers of two [[Internet]] companies at the time. @Home's high-speed Internet services and existing portal were combined with Excite's search engine and portal, with a move towards personalized web portal content following the merger.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The new company was named "Excite@Home" (the [[Ticker symbol|stock symbol]] and the company's name in regulatory filing records remained as "At Home Corporation" (ATHM)) and, six months after the merger, Tom Jermoluk stepped down as CEO of Excite@Home. Excite's George Bell, who was the President of the Excite division of @Home after the merger, became the new CEO of the combined Excite@Home, whilst Jermoluk remained [[Chairman]] of the Board. The merger was billed as a "new media network for the 21st century."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/was-excitehome-doomed-at-the-altar/|title=Was Excite@Home doomed at the altar?|first=John|last=Borland|website=CNET}}</ref>

Following the merger, the Excite division purchased iMall, as well as [[e-card|online greeting card]] company, Blue Mountain Arts. Excite also acquired [[photo sharing]] company [[Webshots]]. Excite furthermore paid for sponsorship of [[Infiniti]] [[IndyCar Series|Indy car]] driver [[Eddie Cheever, Jr.]], through the 2000 and 2001 racing seasons. However, the merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations. Online advertising revenue plummeted, while cable network ISP revenue continued to grow. On September 21, 2000, after stock value had dropped 90%, George Bell announced plans to step down as CEO within six months. On April 23, 2001, Excite@Home announced Patti S. Hart, the former CEO of Telocity, would become its third CEO in three years. In the same announcement, George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The company also reported first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the same period the prior year.

The search engine Magellan, which Excite had purchased in 1996, was closed down in May 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2003/03/04/where-are-they-now-search-engines-weve-known-loved/|title=Where Are They Now? Search Engines We've Known & Loved|date=March 4, 2003|website=Search Engine Watch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://searchengineshowdown.com/2001/05/magellan_gone_msn_review_chart/|title=Magellan Gone, MSN Review, & Chart Updates &#124; Search Engine Showdown}}</ref>

On June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced that it had raised $100 million in financing from Promethean Capital Management and [[Angelo Gordon & Co.]] Part of the deal was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by [[NASDAQ]]. The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero. By August 20 of that year, Excite@Home had replaced its auditors [[Ernst & Young]] with [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. This triggered a demand from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt. Furthermore, [[Cox Cable]] and [[Comcast]] announced that they would separate from Excite@Home by the first quarter of 2002.

On September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts to [[American Greetings]] for less than 5% of what it had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, Excite@Home filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District]] of [[California]]. The company's remaining 1,350 employees were [[layoff|laid off]] over the following months. As part of the agreement, @Home's national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to [[AT&T Corporation]]. @Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home, charged with the sale of all assets of the former company.

At the end of 2001, the Webshots assets were purchased by the company's founders for $2.4 million in cash from the Bankruptcy Court.

Despite the financial problems, the Excite network of sites continued to draw many visitors in the U.S., albeit behind [[AOL Time Warner]], [[Microsoft]]/[[MSN]] and [[Yahoo!]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/who-wants-to-buy-excite/|title=Who wants to buy Excite?|first=Jim|last=Hu|website=CNET}}</ref>

===Excite Network===
During the collapse of Excite@Home, [[IWon|iWon.com]], an Irvington, New York–based venture, had surreptitiously commenced the design of a new Excite website; iWon.com planned to acquire the Excite.com [[domain name]] and brand in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. IWon.com eventually made a joint bid with Seattle's [[InfoSpace]] to purchase the domain name and brand. On November 28, 2001, the court accepted the bid and gave iWon less than three weeks to launch a new Excite portal. Bill Daugherty, iWon's founder and co-chief executive at the time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I feel like a guy who lived through a hurricane, got pounded and pounded and managed to survive when everyone else was destroyed. Suddenly you walk outside and because of the storm you have beachfront property. That's what Excite is to us."

On December 16, 2001, iWon launched the new Excite portal and transferred millions of Excite users to its new home. iWon changed its corporate name to ''Excite Network'', and continued to operate Excite, iWon, and a third portal, MyWay. Outside of the United States, Excite Italia took control of portals in [[UK]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]]. InfoSpace, for its part, owned and operated the web search function on Excite, with Excite's own database now depreciated and instead using [[Overture Services|Overture]] and [[Inktomi]] search results, along with [[DMOZ]] (Open Directory) for the directory and [[Dogpile]] metasearch for news results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/excite/review.html|title=Excite Review on Search Engine Showdown|website=www.searchengineshowdown.com}}</ref> This proved to be a short-sighted arrangement as searching became big business on the Internet in the ensuing years.

===Acquisition by Ask Jeeves===
Excite continued to operate until the Excite Network was acquired by Ask Jeeves (now [[Ask.com]]) in March 2004. Ask Jeeves promised to rejuvenate iWon and Excite, but was not able to. Ask Jeeves management became distracted, according to the ''East Bay Business Times'', first by a search feature arms race with [[Google]] and Yahoo!, and then by its merger with [[Barry Diller]]'s [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], announced in March 2005. "Hopefully, as we start to invest more and get the staff in place and some of the changes to the portal properties that we want, we hope to see (revenue) grow back in the latter half of the year," said Ask Jeeves CEO Steve Berkowitz during a conference call with analysts on April 27, 2005.<ref>{{cite web

On May 20, 2005, Ask Jeeves made two announcements regarding the rejuvenation of the Excite brand. It first announced that it had acquired Excite Italia B.V. (the operator of Excite Europe), from [[Tiscali]], S.p.A.; and, secondly, the company reported that it had reached a comprehensive settlement with InfoSpace regarding Excite in the United States, whereby Ask Jeeves and InfoSpace would share marketing costs and revenue from the Excite web search function. Regarding the acquisition, Ask Jeeves CEO, Steve Berkowitz, said, "We look forward to working with InfoSpace to enhance the search experience on Excite, now that our interests are aligned." On October 17, 2007, [[GOADV]], a media company specializing in the generation of Internet "traffic", announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Excite group of companies.<ref>{{cite web

Excite has never managed to recover back to its heyday popularity. It remains notable in [[Japan]], however. Excite Japan, headquartered in [[Tokyo]], was founded on August 4, 1997<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Excite-Japan-Co.-Ltd|title=Excite Japan Co., Ltd.|website=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref> in a partnership with [[Itochu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/excite-partners-for-japan/|title=Excite partners for Japan|website=CNET}}</ref> After Excite@Home's collapse, Itochu became majority shareholder of Excite Japan (90 percent).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2015/06/17/search-in-asia-goes-well-beyond-google/|title=Search in Asia Goes Well Beyond Google|date=June 17, 2015|website=Search Engine Watch}}</ref>

==Other services==
===FreeLane by Excite===
[[File:Freelane logo.png|right|thumb|100px|Historical logo of the no-cost Excite '''FreeLane''' Internet service.]]

In a bid to compete against Internet Service Providers like [[NetZero]] and [[Juno Online]], which offered free or low-cost [[dial-up]] access in the United States, Excite started offering its own "no-pay" service for private customers by partnering with 1stUp.com to create FreeLane by Excite: 1stUp would allow Excite customers to [[download]] software in order for them to be able to log-on to the Internet. The software would then rotate a series of sponsored banner advertisements on the user's computer while they surfed the Internet. 1stUp.com soon went out of business, and Excite switched to another partner named WorldShare, rebranding FreeLane as FreeLane version 2.0. As of March 1, 2001 FreeLane was discontinued.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/10/excite.free.idg/index.html | work=CNN | title=Excite offers free Net access | date=January 8, 2000}}</ref>

===Ticketsmate===
Ticketsmate, in partnership with Excite, sells tickets to customers in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excite.com/events |title=Excite.com/events |publisher=Excite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> The portal is essentially a ticket selling website where users can buy tickets and search through thousands of events and venues. The powerful search engine capabilities of the Excite server are utilized on this website to help the user search for tickets and events.

===Excite Education===
Since 1999, Excite has also had an education portal that can be used by people to search for and apply for different degrees and online courses. The Excite Education<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excite.com/education |title=Excite.com/education |publisher=Excite.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref> portal features a list of thousands of educational institutes across America for prospective students to browse through and apply at.
