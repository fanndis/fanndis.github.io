==History==
[[Canada|Canadian]] [[Louise Fréchette]] was the first Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, holding the position from 1998 to 2005. She was appointed to the post by Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and assumed her duties on 2 March 1998. In 2005, partly in response to criticism by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [[Paul Volcker]] for failed management of the [[Iraq]] [[Oil-for-Food Programme]], Frechette announced her resignation. She remained at her post until 31 March 2006.<ref name="dsgwebpage"/>

On 3 March 2006 it was announced that [[Mark Malloch Brown]] from the [[United Kingdom]] would succeed Louise Fréchette as Deputy Secretary-General on 1 April 2006. Brown left his post concurrent with Kofi Annan's departure as Secretary-General on 31 December 2006.<ref name="dsgwebpage"/>
