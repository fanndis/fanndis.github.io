She worked at the [[Library of Congress]] from 1951 to 1989 and was responsible for assembling there the largest collection of Polish material in the United States.

She was born '''Janina Wanda Ewa Kozłowska''' in [[Kupowo|Kuprowo]], the daughter of Michał and Jadwiga (née Bielska).  She attended ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazjum]]'' in [[Naujoji Vilnia|Nowa Wilejka]] and [[Vawkavysk|Wołkowysk]] until she left home in 1929 for [[Białystok]].  She married {{ill|Franciszek Wójcicki|pl}} in Bielsko Podlaskie in 1931, taking the name '''Janina Wójcicka'''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />  At the time a married woman could not continue high school, so she studied privately and graduated with her ''[[matura]]'' in 1933.<ref name=":1" />

In 1934, the couple moved to Warsaw and she studied history at the [[University of Warsaw]]. They had two sons, Andrzej (born 1935) and [[Stanley Wojcicki|Stanisław]] (born 1937). In 1938, Wójcicki became a judge in [[Kraków|Cracow]] and she studied at [[Jagiellonian University]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Following the [[Invasion of Poland]], Wójcicki joined the [[Polish Land Forces|Polish Army]] and became director of the [[National Council of Poland|Polish National Council]] of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish Government in Exile]]. She remained in Cracow with their children, clandestinely teaching, studying, and aiding the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Following the end of World War II, Wójcicki returned to Poland and became a member of the [[Parliament of Poland]] for the [[Polish Peasant Party]] (PSL) and a close associate of its leader, [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]]. Wójcicka earned her master's degree from Jagiellonian in 1946 and her doctorate in 1947, with a dissertation entitled "Western cultural influences in Poland during the reign of [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir the Great]] in the fourteenth century".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In 1947, communists manipulated the elections and arrested and persecuted members of the PSL, leading many of them to flee the country, including Mikołajczyk. Janina Wójcicka and their children fled from [[Gdańsk]] in 1949 aboard a Swedish coal freighter, the SS ''Viking,'' and from Sweden emigrated to the United States with the assistance of Mikołajczyk. Franciszek Wójcicki was imprisoned by the communist government until 1955 or 1956, but after his release the government refused to allow him to leave Poland. Unable to reunite, the couple divorced in 1960. The same year, Wójcicka married Professor [[Halford L. Hoskins]] (1891-1967), a scholar of international relations, taking his last name.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

From 1950 to 1955, she worked as a translator and assistant for Mikołajczyk's friend, [[United States House of Representatives|US Representative]] [[John D. Dingell Sr.|John Dingell]], who was of Polish descent. In 1951, Dingell sponsored HR 632, legislation which granted Wójcicka and her children [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency]] in the US.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

While working for Dingell, she began volunteering to work with Polish collections at the [[Library of Congress]]. In 1952, she took a part-time position as Polish Consultant in the new Slavic and East European Division, working as a [[bibliographer]] and compiler of lists of Polish-language abbreviations and reference materials and was responsible for the ordering of thousands of books and other materials. In 1955, she became a full-time area specialist covering Poland and Bulgaria.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In addition to direct acquisitions, she supervised book exchange programs with Polish institutions. One in particular was the result of Public Law 480, in effect 1972 to 1979, in which Polish debt to the US was partially discharged by directing Polish materials to a number of American institutions. In the 1970s, the Polish collections in the Library of Congress grew to over 90 thousand books and 130 thousand periodicals. Hoskins also made four trips to Poland to arrange exchanges and other collaborative efforts with Polish libraries, in 1966 (with [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Lawrence Quincy Mumford|L. Quincy Mumford]]), 1974, 1976, and 1978. In 1963, she was awarded a Meritorious Service Award by the Library of Congress.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
