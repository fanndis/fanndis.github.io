====Databases====
* [[Oracle Database]]
** Release 10: In 2004, Oracle Corporation shipped release 10''g'' (''g'' standing for "grid") as the then latest version of [[Oracle Database]]. ([[Oracle Application Server]] 10''g'' using [[Java EE]] integrated with the server part of that version of the database, making it possible to deploy [[World Wide Web|web]]-technology applications. The application server was the first [[three-tier (computing)|middle-tier]] software designed for [[grid computing]]. The interrelationship between [[Grid computing|Oracle]] 10''g'' and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] allowed developers to set up [[stored procedure]]s written in the Java language, as well as, those written in the traditional Oracle database programming language, [[PL/SQL]].){{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}
** Release 11: Release 11g became available in 2007. Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 11g Release 2 in September 2009. This version was available in four commercial editions—Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, and Personal Edition—and in one free edition—the Express Edition.

==Marketing==

===Sales practices===
In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors.<ref name="zdnet200620"/> This crisis came about because of Oracle's "up-front" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/business/truth-or-consequences-hardly.html|first=Ree|last=Abelson|date=June 23, 1996|title=Truth or Consequences? Hardly|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) [[class action|class-action]] lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made "an incredible business mistake".<ref name="zdnet200620">[http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,39048963,00.htm Oracle cuts rewards for last-minute deals ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219065933/http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,39048963,00.htm |date=December 19, 2008 }} Gilbert, Alorie (June 20, 2002). ''CNET News.com'' via zdnetasia.com</ref>

===Competition===
In 1994, [[Informix Corporation|Informix]] overtook [[Sybase]] and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in [[Silicon Valley]] for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNET |url=http://news.cnet.com/Informix-drops-Oracle-lawsuit/2100-1023_3-200353.html |title=Informix drops Oracle lawsuit |last=Galante |first=Suzanne |date=June 9, 1997 }}</ref> In November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled ''The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White''. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software's CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.

Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until use of [[Microsoft SQL Server]] became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its DB2 database). {{As of|2008|alt= Today}} Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM's DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's DB2 {{As of|2008|alt= still}} dominates the mainframe database market.

In 2004, Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2&nbsp;billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (''InformationWeek'' – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.<ref name="Oracle.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst/reports/infrastructure/dbms/idc-201692.pdf |title=Infrastructure &#124; Oracle Analyst Reports |publisher=Oracle.com |date=September 7, 2010 |access-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031164300/http://www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst/reports/infrastructure/dbms/idc-201692.pdf |archive-date=October 31, 2008 }}</ref>
Oracle Corporation's main competitors in the database arena remain [[IBM DB2]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]], and to a lesser extent [[Sybase]] and [[Teradata]],<ref name="Oracle.com"/> with [[open-source software|open source]] databases such as [[PostgreSQL]] and [[MySQL]] also having a significant<ref>[http://db-engines.com/en/ranking DB-Engines Ranking - popularity ranking of database management systems].

In the market for [[business intelligence]] software, many other software companies—small and large—have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the "big four" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including [[Hyperion Solutions]]), and the independent "pure play" vendors such as [[MicroStrategy]], [[Actuate Corporation|Actuate]], and [[SAS Institute Inc.|SAS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=March 7, 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report}}</ref>

====Oracle and SAP====
From 1988, Oracle Corporation and the German company [[SAP AG]] had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP's [[SAP R/3|R/3]] enterprise application suite with Oracle's relational database products. Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as [[Microsoft SQL Server]], a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP's customers use Oracle databases.<ref>

</ref>

In 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably with those of [[PeopleSoft]], [[Siebel Systems]] and [[Hyperion Solutions|Hyperion]].

SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where SAP had the [[leadership]], and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.

Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get "OFF SAP" (a play on the words of the [[acronym]] for its middleware platform "Oracle Fusion for SAP"),<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2005_jun/sap.html |title=Oracle Helping SAP Customers to get 'OFF SAP' |publisher=Oracle Corporation |date=June 14, 2005}}</ref>
and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.

{{As of|2008|alt=Currently}} Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary [[TomorrowNow]]) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In [[Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG]] Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle's website and to appropriate them for SAP's use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oracle.com/sapsuit |title=Oracle sues SAP |date=July 3, 2007 |publisher=Oracle Corporation}}</ref>
Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.<ref>{{Cite journal

On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made "inappropriate downloads" from the Oracle support website. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP's CEO [[Henning Kagermann]] stated that "Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred."

On November 23, 2010, a [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. district court]] jury in [[Oakland, California]] found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3&nbsp;billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40&nbsp;million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65&nbsp;billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal.<ref>{{Cite news

==Controversies==

===Trashgate===
In 2000, Oracle attracted attention from the [[computer industry]] and the press after hiring [[private investigator]]s to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|antitrust trial involving Microsoft]].<ref>On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made "inappropriate downloads" from the Oracle support web site. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP's CEO Henning Kagermann stated that "Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred." Additionally, SAP announced that it had "instituted changes" in TomorrowNow's operational oversight
[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1580029,00.asp Oracle Rethinks Its Dumpster-Diving Ways ] April 29, 2004, Lisa Vaas, eweek.com</ref> The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company's hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a "public service". The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the [[Association for Competitive Technology]] to look through Microsoft's trash. When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle's business activities, Ellison said: "We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure."<ref>

==="Can't break it, can't break in"===
In 2002, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan "Can't break it, can't break in", or "Unbreakable".<ref>{{cite news | title=Bugs bust open 'unbreakable' Oracle 9i | url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/application-development/2002/02/07/bugs-bust-open-unbreakable-oracle-9i-2103903/ | date=February 7, 2002 | work=ZDNet | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308164139/http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/application-development/2002/02/07/bugs-bust-open-unbreakable-oracle-9i-2103903/ | archive-date=March 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> This signified a demand on [[information security]]. Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.

However, two weeks after its introduction, [[David Litchfield]], Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products.<ref>

===Relationship with John Ashcroft===
In 2004, then-[[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft's resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, [[The Ashcroft Group]], which Oracle hired in 2005.

===Expeditionary Combat Support System===
[[Computer Sciences Corporation]], as the prime contractor, reportedly spent a billion dollars developing  the [[Expeditionary Combat Support System]] for the [[United States Air Force]].

===Cover Oregon Healthcare Exchange===
Oracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon's [[Oregon Health Authority]] (OHA) to develop [[Cover Oregon]], the state's healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed.

On April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/05/cover_oregon_state_moves_to_fe.html|title=Cover Oregon: State moves to federal exchange, but Oracle technology lives on|work=The Oregonian|access-date=April 17, 2015|date=May 7, 2014}}</ref> The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at $5 million, whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another $78 million.

Oracle president [[Safra Catz]] responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site's problems were due to OHA mismanagement, specifically that a third-party [[systems integrator]] was not hired to manage the complex project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/04/oracle_blasts_oregon_for_sprea.html|title=Oracle blasts Oregon for spreading Cover Oregon 'false narrative'|work=The Oregonian|access-date=April 17, 2015|date=April 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2013/12/oregon_health_exchange_technol.html|title=Oregon health exchange technology troubles run deep due to mismanagement, early decisions|work=The Oregonian|access-date=April 17, 2015|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

===Lawsuit against Google===
{{main|Oracle v. Google}}

==== Background ====
Oracle, the plaintiff, bought the Java computer programing language when it acquired [[Sun Microsystems]] in January 2010.<ref name="ReutersJune2011" /> The Java software includes sets of pre-developed software code in order to accomplish common tasks consistently among programs and apps. The pre-developed code is organized into separate "[[Package manager|packages]]" which each contain a set of "[[Class (computer programming)|classes]]". Each class contains numerous [[Method (computer programming)|methods]], which instruct a program or app to do a certain task. Software developers "became accustomed to using Java’s designations at the package, class, and method level".<ref name="Quimbee">{{Cite web|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/oracle-america-inc-v-google-inc|title=Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.|website=Quimbee|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>

Oracle and [[Google]] (the defendant) tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google, which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[operating system]]. However, the two companies never reached an agreement. After negotiations failed, Google created its own programming platform, which was based on Java, and contained a mix of 37 copied Java packages and new packages developed by Google.<ref name="Quimbee" />

==== First trial ====
In 2010, Oracle sued Google for [[copyright infringement]] for the use of the 37 Java packages.<ref name="Quimbee" /><ref name="ReutersJune2011">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oracle-google-lawsuit/oracle-seeks-up-to-6-1-billion-in-google-lawsuit-idUSTRE75H0FP20110618|title=Oracle seeks up to $6.1 billion in Google lawsuit|date=2011-06-18|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> The case was handled in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] and assigned to Judge [[William Haskell Alsup|William H. Alsup]] (who taught himself how to code computers<ref name="verge" />).<ref name="ReutersJune2011" /> In the lawsuit, Oracle sought between $1.4 billion and $6.1 billion.<ref name="ReutersJune2011" /> In June 2011 the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle's claim for damages.<ref name="ReutersJune2011" />

By the end of the first jury trial (the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial) the arguments made by Oracle's attorneys focused on a Java function called "rangeCheck".<blockquote>"The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested—15 million in total—these were the only ones that were 'literally' copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate." – ''The Verge'', 10/19/17<ref name="verge">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber|title=How the judge on Oracle v. Google taught himself to code|last=Jeong|first=Sarah|date=2017-10-19|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref></blockquote>Although Google admitted to copying the packages, Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection, and therefore Google did not infringe.<ref name="Quimbee" />

==== First appeal ====
After the case was over, Oracle appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] (750 F.3d 1339 (2014)).<ref name="Quimbee" /><ref name="eff-org">{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google|title=Oracle v.

==== Supreme Court petition ====
On October 6, 2014, Google filed a petition to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], but the Supreme Court denied the petition.<ref name="eff-org" />

==== Second appeal ====
In February 2017, Oracle filed another appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.<ref name="eff-org" /> This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court "repeatedly undermined Oracle's case", which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision. According to ZDNet, "For example, it [Oracle] says the court wrongly bought Google's claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables."<ref name="ZDNet" />

A number of [[OpenOffice.org]] developers formed [[The Document Foundation]] and received backing by Google, Novell, Red Hat, and Canonical, as well as some others, but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice.org, causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice.org with the foundation now developing and promoting [[LibreOffice]].
