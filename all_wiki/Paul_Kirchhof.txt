'''Paul Kirchhof''' (born February 21, 1943 in [[Osnabrück]]) is a German [[jurist]] and [[tax law]] expert. He is also a professor of law, member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] and, a former judge in the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht''), the highest court in Germany.

==Career==
Kirchhof obtained a doctorate at the early age of 25 having studied law in [[Freiburg]] and [[Munich]]. He then became director of the Institute for Tax Law (''Institut für Steuerrecht'') at the [[University of Münster]]. In 1987 he was finally appointed to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in [[Karlsruhe]], where he remained a judge until 1999. He then assumed the position of professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]] [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|School of Law]].

From January until March 2000, with former [[President of Germany|President]] [[Roman Herzog]] and former [[Bundesbank]] president [[Hans Tietmeyer]], Kirchhof led an independent commission to investigate the [[CDU donations scandal]].<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/news/mn-54317 Kohl's Party Names Panel in Funds Probe] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 15 January 2000.</ref>

During the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]] campaign, [[Angela Merkel]], leader of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], announced that Kirchhof would serve as minister of finance if she formed a government. Kirchhof proposed a graduated income tax rate of 15, 20, and 25%. Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] successfully mocked Kirchhof during the SPD's campaign, calling him "that professor from Heidelberg", implying Kirchhof an ivory-towered point of view.

This proposal undermined the CDU's credibility on economic affairs and led many Germans to believe that the party's platform for deregulation would only benefit the rich. It was a major contribution to the CDU's drop in the polls, from a lead of 21% over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] at the start of the election campaign to 9%. Merkel's own popularity dropped 10% when she publicly endorsed Kirchhof's tax proposals. Although Merkel's popularity improved after she later distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, the CDU did not recover its earlier large lead in the polls. Kirchof attempted to bring the matter to a close before polling day by indicating that he would be remaining in academia and would not accept a position in government.

Kirchhof has very conservative opinions on issues such as family and feminism, although these did not become an issue during the campaign. He has been quoted as saying that "the mother's career lies in the family, which doesn't produce power, but friendship, not money, but happiness."

After the election of [[Matteo Renzi]] as Prime Minister of [[Italy]], there has been contact with Paul Kirchhof.
