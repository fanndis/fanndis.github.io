==Early life==
Lavigne was born in 1984 in [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]], Ontario, Canada. She was named ''Avril'' (the French word for the month of April) by her father.{{r|storage.canoe.ca}} He and Lavigne's mother recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" on the way home from church.{{r|sperling}} Lavigne has an older brother named Matthew and a younger sister named Michelle,{{r|peoplekappes}} both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying."{{r|sperling}} She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band [[One OK Rock]] bassist [[Ryota Kohama]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2017/02/22/one-ok-rock-bassist-and-avril-lavignes-sister-get-married |title=ONE OK ROCK bassist and Avril Lavigne's sister get married |publisher=SBS |website=sbs.com.au |date=February 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128080818/https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2017/02/22/one-ok-rock-bassist-and-avril-lavignes-sister-get-married |archive-date=November 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in [[Saint-Jérôme]], Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gen-familleritchot.blogspot.com/2010/02/avril-lavigne-origines-quebecoise-et.html |title= Avril Lavigne : origines québécoise et françaises |trans-title= Avril Lavigne: Québécoise and French origins |date= February 7, 2010 |last= Ritchot |first= Dominique |language= fr |website= gen-familleritchot.blogspot.com |access-date= December 28, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190626211039/http://gen-familleritchot.blogspot.com/2010/02/avril-lavigne-origines-quebecoise-et.html |archive-date= June 26, 2019 |url-status= live }}{{better source|date= February 2020}}</ref> A member of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of [[Morhange]], in France in 1953.

When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to [[Greater Napanee]],{{r|unofficialbiog}} Ontario, a town with a population of approximately 5,000.{{r|canoemcqueen|mtvrealdeal|ewwillman}} In school, she was sometimes removed from class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and he converted their basement into a studio. Following his own love for music, Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Centre in [[Kingston, Ontario]], where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.{{r|msnbcpauley}}

Lavigne performed at country fairs, singing songs by [[Garth Brooks]], [[the Chicks]], and [[Shania Twain]]. She began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage [[puppy love|crush]], which she described as "cheesy cute".{{r|mirrorquigley}} Lavigne also played [[ice hockey|hockey]] into high school and won MVP twice as a right [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] in a boys league.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zwerling |first1=Jared |title=Avril Lavigne recalls life as a hockey star |url=https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/girl/post/_/id/1054/avril-lavigne-recalls-life-as-a-hockey-star |access-date=November 5, 2019 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=December 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925035808/https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/girl/post/_/id/1054/avril-lavigne-recalls-life-as-a-hockey-star |archive-date=September 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Music career==
===1999–2001: Career beginnings===
In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.{{r|tracy}}{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, "[[What Made You Say That]]",{{r|unofficialbiog}} and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be "a famous singer".{{r|canoemcqueen}} During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, ''Quinte Spirit''. She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album, ''My Window to You'', in 2000.

In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters (bookstore)|Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario]].{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.{{r|sk8terfaker}} Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, [[Nettwerk]], received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.{{r|patch}} Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer [[Peter Zizzo]] during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why". Lavigne was noticed by [[Arista Records]] during a trip to New York.{{r|sk8terfaker}}

In November 2000,{{r|mtvrealdeal}} Ken Krongard, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative, invited [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25&nbsp;million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.{{r|ewwillman|unofficialbiog}} By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed [[skateboard]]ing, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.{{r|mtvrealdeal}}{{r|canadianpress|mirrorquigley}} Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the [[Canadian punk rock]] scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827104222/http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |archive-date=August 27, 2016}} Most inexperienced singers are backed by seasoned musicians, but Nettwerk chose to go with young performers who were up and coming in the Canadian punk-rock scene. As Nettwerk manager Shauna Gold told Shanda Deziel of Maclean's, "[Lavigne] is young, her music's young, we needed a band that would fit well with who she is as a person."</ref>

===2002–2003: ''Let Go''===
[[File:AvrilShow.jpg|thumb|left|Lavigne performing in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in September 2002]]
Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told [[HitQuarters]] that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]] production team—including "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'', finished in January 2002.{{r|hitquarters}}

Lavigne released ''Let Go'' in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at that time.{{r|aboutlamb}} By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and ''Let Go'' the top-selling debut of the year.{{r|riaadiamond}} By May 2003, ''Let Go'' had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]].{{r|criadiamond}} By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide.{{r|transworldnews}} By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GP_March_2018.pdf |title=RIAA GOLD & PLATINUM AWARDS March // 3/1/18 – 3/31/18 |website=[[RIAA]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423232242/http://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GP_March_2018.pdf |archive-date=April 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lavigne's debut single, "Complicated", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US.

In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for "[[Hundred Million]]" by the [[pop punk]] band [[Treble Charger]].{{r|cbcnewstreble}} In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine,{{r|rollingstonecover}} and in May she performed "[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]" during MTV's Icon tribute to [[Metallica]].{{r|mtvdowney}}{{r|mtviconmetallica}} During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered [[Green Day]]'s "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]".{{r|sfgatesullivan}}

Its opening track, "Black Star", was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name.{{r|musicmix}}{{r|rollingstoneblackstar}} Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less [[pop rock]] than her previous material, reflecting her age.{{r|rollingstoneblackstar}}{{r|departure}} The release date for ''Goodbye Lullaby'' was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label.{{r|allheadlinenews}}{{r|kingstonhart}} ''Goodbye Lullaby'' was released in March 2011,{{r|billboardlipshutz|departure}} and its lead single, "[[What the Hell]]", premiered in December 2010, ahead of the album's release.{{r|billboardlipshutz}} ''Goodbye Lullaby'' received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.<ref name=Juno>{{cite web |url=http://junoawards.ca/awards/artist-summary/?artist_name%3DAvril+%26submit%3DSearch |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125035/http://junoawards.ca/awards/artist-summary/?artist_name=Avril+&submit=Search |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> By March 2018, ''Goodbye Lullaby'' sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.<ref name=":0" />

==Acting career==
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing "Sk8er Boi"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of "Losing Grip".{{r|goingthedistance}}

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}

[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of."{{cn|date=October 2020}} Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. "[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}

In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}

Both ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part."{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}

==Fashion==
In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all."{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}

The designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease}} "It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find."{{r|inked2010}}

Lavigne released her first fragrance, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], created by [[Procter & Gamble]] Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are."{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''[[Forbidden Rose]]'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.basenotes.net/perfumenews/872-avril-lavigne-launches-wild-rose | title=Avril Lavigne launches Wild Rose | first=Grant | last=Osborne | work=[[Basenotes]] | date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.{{r|fragrantica}}

In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate ''Alice in Wonderland''-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.{{r|seacrestinterview26}} Her designs were exhibited at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]] in California beginning in May through September, alongside [[Colleen Atwood]]'s costumes from the 2010 film.{{r|ladowntownalice}}

While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14.{{r|ledgermoody}} Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles "Complicated", "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that "[N]one of those songs aren't from me".{{r|teenspirit}}

In 2007, [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism{{r|kreviazuk}} and criticized her songwriting, saying that "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/23/AR2007072300771.html |title=Singer-Songwriters, or Just Singers? |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Nekesa |last=Mumbi Moody |date=July 23, 2007 |access-date=February 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219170734/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/23/AR2007072300771.html |archive-date=February 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character.{{r|yahoomusic}} Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her."{{r|kreviazuk}} Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band [[the Rubinoos]], sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]] for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend".{{r|billboardstole}} Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a [[Sum 41]] song. It's the [[Sex Pistols]], not the Rubinoos."{{r|yahoomusic}} In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.{{r|settle}}

===Influences===

Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as [[punk subculture|punk]], something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, [[Evan Taubenfeld]], said, "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest".{{r|ultimateguitar}} Lavigne commented on the matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel&nbsp;... punk, and I am ''so'' not any of them."{{r|ledgermoody}} However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music.

When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her [[tomboy]]ish style,{{r|vancouversun}} in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.{{r|nytimesnecktie|wakeupvideo}} She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or [[Converse (shoe company)|Converses]],{{r|inked2010}} wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.{{r|msnbcpauley}} During photo shoots, instead of wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled T's".{{r|mtvrealdeal}} In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|pop punk princess]]"{{r|altman|observer}} and the female answer to [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/girls/2011/01/the-11-hottest-comeback-chicks-of-2011/avril-lavigne |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 17, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630083020/http://www.complex.com/girls/2011/01/the-11-hottest-comeback-chicks-of-2011/avril-lavigne |archive-date=June 30, 2014}} "Lavigne somehow devolved into that sk8r girl who was only relevant to the mid-2000s pop punk period as the female answer to Blink 182"</ref> Press and fans regarded her as the "anti-[[Britney Spears|Britney]]", in part because of her less commercial and "real" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not."{{r|msnbcpauley}} By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a costume".{{r|ewwillman}} Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.{{r|manilamoody}}

Lavigne eventually took on a more [[goth subculture|gothic]] style as she began her second album, ''Under My Skin'', trading her skating outfits for black [[Ballet tutu|tutus]]{{r|observer}} and developing an image marked by [[angst]].{{r|mtvundermyskin}} During ''The Best Damn Thing'' years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,{{r|imnotobsessed}} including "tight jeans and heels",{{r|inked2010}} and modelled for magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.{{r|vancouversun}} Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all&nbsp;... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".{{r|imnotobsessed}}

Lavigne has been the subject of a [[conspiracy theory]] that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some theorists.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39921209 |title=The Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory returns |last=Estatie |first=Lamia |date=May 15, 2017 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=September 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825092224/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39921209 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In an interview with Australia's [[KIIS 106.5]] in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, calling it "weird".<ref>{{cite news |first=Cydney |last=Contreras |url=https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/982961/avril-lavigne-finally-responds-to-viral-conspiracy-theory-that-she-died-years-ago |title=Avril Lavigne Finally Responds to Viral Conspiracy Theory That She Died Years Ago |work=E Online |access-date=November 30, 2018 |location=USA |date=November 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130114716/https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/982961/avril-lavigne-finally-responds-to-viral-conspiracy-theory-that-she-died-years-ago |archive-date=November 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Avril Lavigne leaning, St. Petersburg (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist]]
{{As of|2010|}}, only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.{{r|inked2010}} Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate [[Ben Moody]]'s identical tattoo.{{r|mtvaction}} In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.{{r|inked2010|ferguson2007}} Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.{{r|inked2010}} In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.{{r|dose}}

Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and [[Brody Jenner]] each got matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs.{{r|radaronlinetattoo|usweeklytattoo}} Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for [[Inked (magazine)|''Inked'' magazine]], where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the "fuck" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her "favorite word"{{r|inked2010}}) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.{{r|inkedblog}} She added that she eventually wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name&nbsp;... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life."{{r|inked2010}} In July 2010, Lavigne had her then-boyfriend's name, "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast.{{r|mtvbrodytattoo}}
