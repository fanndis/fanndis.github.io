On August 25, 2011, CNBC's Drew Sandholm  noted that "[d]espite having recently told investors Bank of America ... doesn't need to raise capital, CEO Brian Moynihan will accept $5 billion in capital from famed investor [[Warren Buffett]]. The deal not only surprised the ''Fast Money'' traders on Thursday, it also caused them to question Moynihan's credibility."<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Brian Moynihan's Credibility Hurt By Warren Buffett Deal?|publisher=CNBC|author=Drew Sandholm|date=August 25, 2011}}</ref> 
     
On September 12, 2011, [[CNBC]]'s John Carney noted that Moynihan had "once again laid out his company's plan to meet regulatory capital requirements and denied that the bank will have to issue new stock to raise capital ... [Moynihan] says that [[Warren Buffett]]'s $5 billion counts as Tier 1 Capital. But the markets have largely ignored the investment, most likely because it looks a lot more like debt than capital."<ref>{{cite web|title=Bank of America Continues to Ignore Market View of Risk|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/44485895|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=April 5, 2012|author=John Carney|date=September 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. There were  complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".<ref>{{cite web|title=BofA Chief Moynihan Faces Shareholder Ire as Protests Swirl|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/05/09/bloomberg_articlesM3PWX607SXKW01-M3RYE.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=May 16, 2012|author=Hugh Son|date=May 9, 2012}}</ref>
