In 2014, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] recruited Nyong'o in an effort to oppose development, including a new minor league baseball stadium, in the [[Shockoe Bottom]] area of [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.timesdispatch.com/ap/national/lupita-nyong-o-seeks-va-slave-trade-preservation/article_c305884e-edaf-5ea0-a80f-415a4346d6a6.html |agency= Associated Press |title= Lupita Nyong'o seeks Va. slave-trade preservation |work= [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date= 24 October 2014 |accessdate= 24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20141024180734/http://www.timesdispatch.com/ap/national/lupita-nyong-o-seeks-va-slave-trade-preservation/article_c305884e-edaf-5ea0-a80f-415a4346d6a6.html |archivedate= 24 October 2014 }}</ref> The historic neighbourhood, one of Richmond's oldest, was the site of major slave-trading before the [[American Civil War]].

In June 2015, Nyong'o returned to Kenya and announced that she will advocate globally for elephants with the international conservation organisation [[WildAid]], as well as promote women's issues, acting and the arts in Kenya. WildAid announced Nyong'o as their Global Elephant Ambassador.<ref name= wildaid>{{cite web | url=http://www.wildaid.org/news/lupita-nyong%E2%80%99o-oscar-winner-back-kenya-and-becoming-global-elephant-ambassador | title=News—Lupita Nyong'o Joins WildAid as Global Elephant Ambassador | publisher=WildAid | accessdate=30 June 2015 | author=WildAid | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011759/http://www.wildaid.org/news/lupita-nyong%E2%80%99o-oscar-winner-back-kenya-and-becoming-global-elephant-ambassador | archive-date=3 July 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Nyong'o is involved in the organisation Mother Health International, which is dedicated to providing relief to women and children in [[Uganda]] by creating locally engaged birthing centres. She said she'd never thought much about birthing practices until her sister introduced her to MHI executive director Rachel Zaslow. Nyong'o felt bringing attention to such important but overlooked issues is a mandate for her as an artist. She was honoured for her work in 2016 by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name="varietypower16">{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/lupita-nyongo-mother-health-intl-africa-1201745417/ | title=Lupita Nyong'o Backs Mother Health Intl. for African Relief | work=Variety | date=5 April 2016 | accessdate=5 April 2016 | last=Cox | first=Gordon | archive-date=6 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406023242/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/lupita-nyongo-mother-health-intl-africa-1201745417/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2016, Nyong'o launched an anti-poaching "hearts and minds" campaign with her organisation Wildaid in advance of [[Kenya Wildlife Service]]'s history-making [[Destruction of ivory|ivory burn]] that occurred 30 April. The Kenyan government burned 105 [[tonnes]] of [[ivory]] and 1.35 tonnes of [[rhino horn]] in a demonstration of their zero tolerance approach to [[poachers]] and smugglers who were threatening the survival of elephants and [[rhinoceros]] in the wild.<ref name="bik16">{{cite web | url=http://britsinkenya.com/2016/04/30/watch-lupita-nyongos-ivory-burn-message/ | title=Watch Lupita Nyong'o's ivory burn message | publisher=BritsInKenya | accessdate=11 May 2016 | last=Watt | first=Andrew | archive-date=3 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503000728/http://britsinkenya.com/2016/04/30/watch-lupita-nyongos-ivory-burn-message/ | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="wildaid1">{{cite web | url=http://wildaid.org/news/lupita-nyongo-joins-kenyan-celebrities-new-wildlife-campaign | title=Lupita Nyong'o Joins Kenyan Celebrities for New Wildlife Campaign | publisher=WildAid | date=27 April 2016 | accessdate=11 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501182216/http://wildaid.org/news/lupita-nyongo-joins-kenyan-celebrities-new-wildlife-campaign | archive-date=1 May 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In October 2017, Nyong'o wrote an [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which she revealed that Hollywood producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] had sexually harassed her twice in 2011, while she was a student at Yale. She vowed to never work with Weinstein, hence her turning down a role in ''[[Southpaw (film)|Southpaw]]'' (2015). Nyong'o also wrote about her commitment to work with female directors or male feminist directors, who had not abused their power.<ref name="WeinsteinNYT">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html |title=Lupita Nyong'o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein |last=Nyong'o |first=Lupita |date=20 October 2017 |website=New York Times |access-date=20 October 2017 |archive-date=20 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000610/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This op-ed was part of a collection of stories done by ''The New York Times'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that won the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The New York Times, for reporting led by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and The New Yorker, for reporting by Ronan Farrow |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-reporting-led-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey-and-new-yorker-reporting-ronan |publisher=[[Pulitzer Prize]] |accessdate=12 June 2018 |archive-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204070202/https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-reporting-led-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey-and-new-yorker-reporting-ronan |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nyong'o made her writing debut with a book entitled ''[[Sulwe]]'' (2019), which is published by [[Simon & Schuster#Children's publishing|Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers]].
