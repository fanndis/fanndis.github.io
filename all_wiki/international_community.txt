The '''international community''' is a vague and subjective phrase used in [[geopolitics]] and [[international relations]] to refer to a nebulous group of people and governments of the world. It does not literally refer to all nations or states in the world. The term is typically used to falsely claim the existence of a common point of view towards such matters as specific issues of [[human rights]]. Activists, politicians and commentators often use the term in calling for action to be taken; e.g., action against what is in their opinion [[political repression]] in a target country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQNYlTa1-YUC&q=international+community+term&pg=PA30|title=United States Hegemony and the Foundations of International Law|last1=Byers|first1=Michael|last2=Nolte|first2=Georg|date=2003-05-29|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781139436632|pages=30|language=en}}</ref>

The term is commonly used to claim, often without evidence, legitimacy and consensus for a point of view on a disputed issue; e.g., to enhance the credibility of a majority vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaJ9FCXnX5IC&q=%22international+community%22+general+assembly&pg=PA204|title=Law-Making in the International Community|last=Danilenko|first=Gennadiĭ Mikhaĭlovich|date=1993-01-01|publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|isbn=0792320395|pages=204|language=en}}</ref> 

==Criticism==
[[Noam Chomsky]] alleges that the use of the term is used to refer to the [[United States]] and its allies and [[client state]]s, as well as allies in the media of those states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200209--.htm|title=The Crimes of 'Intcom'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/14/israel-us-violators-of-international-law-says-noam-chomsky/|title=Israel, US violators of international law, says Noam Chomsky|work=The News Tribe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitemagazine.ca/2012/06/noam-chomsky-on-iran/|title=Noam Chomsky on Iran}}</ref> British scholar and academic [[Martin Jacques]] says: "We all know what is meant by the term 'international community', don't we? It's [[Western world|the west]], of course, nothing more, nothing less. Using the term 'international community' is a way of dignifying the west, of globalising it, of making it sound more respectable, more neutral and high-faluting."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/whatthehellistheinternati|title=What the hell is the international community?|author=Martin Jacques|work=the Guardian}}</ref>

According to [[Samuel P. Huntington]] this term is a euphemistic replacement of the earlier concept of [[Free world]].<ref>Huntington, Samuel P. The Clash of Civilizations, 72 Foreign Aff. 22 (1992–1993)</ref>

More recently, the term has been used politically to promote liberal agendas, largely promoted by Europe, as if these countries constituted an international consensus. Others dismiss the term as polemical and non-substantive.
