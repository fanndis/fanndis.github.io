[[File:Plan of Bijapur India 1911.jpg|thumb|300px|Plan of Bijapur, 1911]]

=== Early history ===
Bijapur district is historically, traditionally and legendarily, one of the richest districts in the state. The evidence found here reveals that it was an inhabited place since the Stone Age. Many places of this district have legendary history. The history of this district is divided into four periods, from the Chalukya acquisition of Badami till the Muslim invasion.

* Early Western Chalukya period lasting from about A.D. 535 to about A.D.757.
* Rastrakuta period from A.D. 757 to A.D.973
* Kalachuri and Hoysala period from A.D. 973 to about A.D.1200
* Devagiri Yadava period from A.D.1185 to the Muslim conquest of Devagiri in A.D. 1312.

=== Bahmani and Bijapur Sultanates ===
{{main|Bijapur Sultanate|Siege of Bijapur}}
Bijapur first came under the influence of [[Alauddin Khalji|Allaudin Khalji]], the Sultan of Delhi, towards the end of the 13th century, and then under the Bahamani kings of Bidar in 1347. In 1347, when the Bahamani dynasty was established, it included southern and eastern parts of Bijapur district. The supremacy of the Bahaman's may be said to have ceased by 1489. At that time five Shahi Dynasties were born and one of them was "Bijapur". The Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]] conquered Bijapur in 1686 and it was under Mughal rule up to 1723. In 1724 the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State]] established his independence in the Deccan and included Bijapur within his dominion. However, his acquisition on this portion was of brief duration, in 1760 it went into the hands of Marathas.

In 1518, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] split into five splinter states known as the [[Deccan sultanates]], one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the [[Adil Shahi]] dynasty (1490–1686). The city of Vijayapura owes much of its greatness to [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], the founder of the independent state of Bijapur.

The rule of this dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered during the reign of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Padishah|badshah]] (emperor) [[Aurangzeb]], who has in 1684 turned Bijapur into a [[subah]] (imperial top-level province).

=== British Colonial period ===
In 1724 the [[Nizam]] of Hyderabad established his independence in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], and included Bijapur within his dominions. In 1760, the Nizam suffered a defeat by the [[Marathas]], and ceded the region of Bijapur to the Maratha [[Peshwa]].{{cn|date=June 2020}}

After the 1818 defeat of the Peshwa by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], Bijapur passed into the hands of the [[British East India Company]], and was assigned to the Maratha [[princely state]] [[Satara State|Satara]].

In 1817, war broke out between the British and the Marathas. By 1818, the whole of Bijapur was occupied by the British and was included in the territory assigned to the Raja of Satara. In 1848 the territory of Satara was obtained through the failure of heir and the British rule started. Till 1884, the Bijapur district had headquarters at Kaladagi. Bijapur was made headquarters in 1885.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

=== Post-Independence ===
After Independence, the movement for re-organisation of States gained further momentum and on 1 November 1956 a separate "Mysore State" was formed. By the wish of the people it was renamed as "Karnataka". Thus, the district Bijapur along with other Kannada speaking areas became a part of "Karnataka State" on 1 November 1956.

Central government had approved the request to rename the city in October 2014 from Bijapur to "Vijayapura" on 1 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=New City|first1=Names to Karnatka|title=New name for cities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/from-bangalore-to-bengaluru/article6553314.ece|accessdate=1 November 2014|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref>

== Description ==
The city consists of three distinct portions: the citadel, [[Bijapur Fort|the fort]] and the remains of the city. The citadel, built by the Adilshahi Sultans, a mile in circuit, is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch {{convert|100|yd|m}} wide, formerly supplied with water. The fort, which was completed by the Adilshahi Sultans in 1566, is surrounded by a wall 6 m. in circumference. This wall is from 30 to {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, and is strengthened with ninety-six massive bastions of various designs. In addition there are ten others at the various gateways. The width is about {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}; from bastion to bastion runs a battlement curtained wall about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. The whole is surrounded by a deep moat 30 to {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} broad. Inside these walls the Bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. Outside the walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the ancient splendor of the place.
[[Badami]], [[Aihole]], and [[Pattadakal]], near Bijapur, are noted for their historical temples in the [[Chalukya]] architectural style.

Bijapur is nearly {{cvt|530|km}} from the state capital Bangalore. It lies between latitude 15.20 and 17.28 north and longitude 74.59 and 76.28 east. It is situated well in the interior of the Deccan Peninsula and is about 130 miles away from the west coast.

The district is bounded by [[Solapur district]] to the north and [[Sangli district]] to the north-west, [[Belgaum district]] on the west, [[Bagalkot district]] to the south, [[Gulbarga district]] to the east and [[Koppal district]] to the south-east.

==About the city==
* The place is an important tourist place in the country, the former capital of the Adilshahi dynasty, situated about {{cvt|579|km}} to the north-west of Bangalore. The Gadag-Solapur railway line traverses via this place. The Kalyani Chalukya kings made it a sub-capital according to an inscription of 1073. It is believed that Jain Poet [[Nagachandra]], 12th century, had his residence here. The place had old names like Vijayapura, Vidyapura and Mohamudpura. For nearly 200 years from 1489 to 1686, this was the seat of the Adilshahi Dynasty.
* Among the other historical attractions at Bijapur, some notable ones are the Anand Mahal, Jod Gumbaz, Jumma Masjid, Saat Manzil, and Jal Manzil. also among old houses at Bijapur, the most famous is Elavia House ( Nauzer Elavia) which is more than 100 years old.
* Bijapur City was also held by Aurangzeb, the Nizam, Savanur Nawab, Satara Chatrapati and finally the British. Foreign travellers like Duarte Barbosa, Varthema, Poser, Mandeslo and Travernier visited this place.
* The Ibrahim Rouza and the Gol Gumbaz are the most impressive monuments at Bijapur. A brief survey of spots of note in the city is given below.
* Ain-ul-mulk's tomb and mosque Lies on the eastern outskirts of the city and is the solid structure in square, surrounded by a fair proportioned dome. The tomb belongs to Ain-ul-mulk. Close by this the much adorned mosque and the building is plastered.
* [[Ali Adil Shah I]]'s tomb lies in the south-west part of the City. Ali Adilshah's Tomb is a simple modest building containing an outer row of five arches surrounding a central chamber and is the earliest royal mausoleum in Bijapur.
* Ali Adil Sha II's tomb is located to the north-west of the citadel, and is housed in a big square roofless structure consisting of incomplete arches in dark basalt. This incomplete structure is {{convert|215|ft|m}} square and on the raised platform stand the incomplete arches. In the centre on the elevated platform are the tombs.
* Ali Shahi Pir's mosque and tomb is a square massive structure, its mihrab is remarkable in some ways. The tomb of the saint is outside the north-east gate of the mosque.
* Khwaja Amin Dargah is considered as the most sacred in the city and is situated about {{cvt|1.5|km}} to the west of Bijapur.  The tomb of Khwaja Amin-ud-din is on the high ground and conspicuous landmark for considerable distance round about.
* Anand Mahal is to the west of '''Gagan Mahal''' and in the premises of the citadel stands this two-storeyed mansion. This was constructed by Ibrahim Adil Sha II in 1589, exclusively for music and dance. The roof was ornamented with stucco work. '''The Ananda Mahal''' presently is being used by the State for Government offices.
* Andu Masjid stands a little away from the citadel to the west of the Jumanal road. It is a two-storeyed structure, upper floor being a prayer chamber while the ground is a hall. There is no pulpit in the mosque and probably it was restricted to the prayer of women. A Persian inscription here quotes that the mosque was constructed in 1608 by Itbar Khan, one of the nobles in the Court of Adil Shai II.
* Aras Mahal Is to the south-east of Adalat Mahal and was once a joy resort of Ali II. It is now the residence of the District Surgeon.
* Ark-Killa the citadel is at the centre of the city. It is also most important part of Bijapur. Yusuf Adilshah chose it as the site for his fort. The present citadel is nearly circular. Its defences are a strong wall with several bastions of considerable strength on the south and east.
* Asar Mahal on the crest of the eastern glacis of the citadel is the Asar Mahal. In about 1646 it was constructed by Muhammad Shah and was earlier called as '''Adalat Mahal'''. The walls and ceilings of the rooms bear paintings of landscapes and various designs. The room of the south side of the gilded hall is a gorgeously painted apartment. These paintings had been whitewashed by the orders of Aurangzeb and later restored. There is a big square tank outside in front of the building.
* Aurangzeb Idgah Is a large square enclosure built by Aurangzeb in 1682 after the occupation of the city as a gathering place for Muslims on important days.
* Bukhari Masjid is believed to have been constructed by Chandbibi for a moulvi of the Bukhari family. On the door of the Masjid there is a Persian Inscription.
* Chand Bavadi is a well constructed by Ali Adil Shah I in honour of his wife Chand Bibi in the year 1579. It is at the west corner of the town. The entrance is spanned by a single arch, approached by a descending flight of steps.
* Chota Asar is a small building, remarkable for the amount of rich ornamentation in stucco which covers the wall, ceiling and a portion of the façade.
* Chini Mahal or Faroukh Mahal is an edifice that consists of a big lofty durbar hall in the centre and series of rooms in the wings. Yusuf Adil Shah constructed it. For its sheer size and loftiness none of the hall in any other palace of Bijapur can be compared with it.

==Sufis of Bijapur==
[[File:Dargah Murtuza Bijapur.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tomb or Dargah of Sufi Saint Hazrat Murtuza Quadri located at western side Bijapur]]
Arrival of [[Sufis]] in [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] region was started during the reign of [[Qutbuddin Aibak]]. During this period [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] was under the control of native [[Hindu]] rulers and Palegars. Shaikh Haji Roomi was the first to arrive in Bijapur with his companions. Although his other comrades like Shaikh Salahuddin, Shaikh Saiful Mulk and Syed Haji Makki were settled in [[Pune]], Haidra and Tikota respectively.

According to Tazkiraye Auliyae Dakkan i.e., Biographies of the saints of the Deccan, compiled by Abdul Jabbar Mulkapuri in 1912–1913, 
{{cquote|Sufi Sarmast was one of the earliest sufi of this region. He came to the Deccan from [[Arab]]ia in the 13th Century at a time when the Deccan was a land of unbelievers with no sign of Islam or correct faith anywhere. His companions, pupils (fakir), disciples (murid), and soldiers (ghazi), numbered over seven hundred. He settled in Sagar in Solapur district. There, a zealous and anti-Muslim raja named Kumaram (Kumara Rama) wished to expel Sufi Sarmast, and his companions having also prepared to a struggle, a bitter fight ensued. Heroes on both sides were slain. Finally the raja was killed by the hand of his daughter. Countless Hindus were killed, and at this time Lakhi Khan Afghan and Nimat Khan came from [[Delhi]] to assist him. Hindus were defeated and the Muslims were victorious. The rest of the Hindus, having accepted tributary status, made peace. Since by nature he was fundamentally not combative, Sufi Sarmast spread the religion of [[Muhammad|Mohammed]] and befriended the hearts of Hindus. Having seen his fine virtue s and uncommon justice, many Hindus of that time accepted Islam, finally he died in the year A.H.680 i.e., 1281 A.D.<ref>Richard Maxwell Eaton, Sufis of Bijapur (1300–1700), Page:22 Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey 1978,</ref>}}

After this period arrival of Sufis in Bijapur and suburbs was started. Ainuddin Gahjul Ilm Dehelvi narrates that Ibrahim Sangane was one of the early Sufis of Bijapur parish.  Sufis of Bijapur can be divided into three categories according to period of their arrival viz., Sufis before [[Bahmani]] and / or Adil Shahi Dynasty, Sufis during Adil Shahi Dynasty and Sufis after the fall of Adil Shahi Dynasty. And further it can be classified as Sufis as warriors, Sufis as social reformers, Sufis as scholars, poets and writers.

Ibrahim Zubairi writes in his book Rouzatul Auliyae Beejapore (compiled during 1895) which describes that more than 30 tombs or Dargahs are there in Bijapur with more than 300 ''Khankahs '' i.e., Islamic Missionary Schools with notable number of disciples of different lineage like ''Hasani Sadat, Husaini Sadat, Razavi Sadat, Kazmi Sadat, Shaikh Siddiquis, Farooquis, Usmanis, Alvis, Abbasees '' and other and spiritual chains like ''Quadari, Chishti, Suharwardi, Naqshbandi, Shuttari, Haidari '' etc.
