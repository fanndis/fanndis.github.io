The '''Hunting Act 2004''' (c 37) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which bans the [[hunting]] of [[Wildlife|wild]] [[mammal]]s (notably [[fox]]es, [[red deer|deer]], [[European Hare|hares]] and [[American mink|mink]]) with [[dog]]s in [[England and Wales]]; the Act does not cover the use of dogs in the process of flushing out an unidentified wild mammal,<ref name="High Court case">{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/105.html|title=Director of Public Prosecutions (Crown Prosecution Service CCU South West) v Anthony Wright; The Queen on the Application of Maurice Scott, Peter Heard & Donald Summersgill v Taunton Deane Magistrates' Court [2009] EWHC 105 (Admin)|date=4 February 2009|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=15 February 2009}}</ref> nor does it affect [[drag hunting]], where hounds are trained to follow an artificial [[Odor|scent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/f/st030225/pm/30225s12.htm|title=Official Report, Commons|date=25 February 2003|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>

The Act came into force on 18 February 2005. The pursuit of foxes with hounds, other than to flush out to be shot, had been banned in [[Scotland]] two years earlier by the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]]. Such hunting remains permitted by the law in [[Northern Ireland]], where the Act does not apply.

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|Legislation on hunting with dogs}}
Several UK laws on animal welfare, such as the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]], the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 contained specific exemptions for hunting activities, thereby preventing prosecutions of other hunts activities that might otherwise have been considered cruel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/51/crossheading/exceptions-and-licences|title=Protection of Badgers Act 1992|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/3/section/2 The National Archives: "Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996: Section 2: Exceptions from offence under the Act.]"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.theguardian.com/homeaffairs/page/0,,650062,00.html|title=Timeline: attempts to ban hunting - Special Reports - guardian.co.uk Politics|website=politics.theguardian.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwt.org.uk/node/2999|title=Wild Mammals and the Law - Northumberland Wildlife Trust|website=www.nwt.org.uk|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref>

Many earlier attempts had been made to ban hunting. Two [[private member's bill]]s to ban, or restrict, hunting were introduced in 1949, but one was withdrawn and the other defeated on its [[second reading]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].<ref name="Tichelar">{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=502052# |author=Tichelar, M. |year=2006 |title='Putting Animals into Politics: The Labour Party and Hunting in the First Half of the Twentieth Century |journal=Rural History |volume=17 |pages=213–234 |doi=10.1017/S0956793306001889 |issue=2}}</ref> The Labour government appointed the Scott Henderson Inquiry<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Scott Henderson|year=1951|title=Report of the Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals}}</ref> to investigate all forms of hunting. Opponents of hunting claimed that the membership of the committee was chosen to produce a pro-hunting report.<ref name="Tichelar"/> The inquiry reported its view that "[[Fox hunting]] makes a very important contribution to the control of foxes, and involves less cruelty than most other methods of controlling them. It should therefore be allowed to continue."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1846577.stm|publisher=BBC|date=17 February 2005|accessdate=19 February 2008|title=Timeline: Hunting row}}</ref>

Twice, in 1969 and in 1975, the House of Commons voted in favour of bills to ban [[hare coursing]], but neither bill became law. Three further private member's bills were introduced by [[Kevin McNamara (politician)|Kevin McNamara]] in 1992 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill), by [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] in 1993 (Fox Hunting (Abolition) Bill), and by [[John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith|John McFall]] in 1995 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill)—all of which failed to go on to become law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/JamieFletcher.ExecutiveSovereigntyinourConstitution.pdf |author=Fletcher, J. |title=Executive Sovereignty in our Constitution |publisher=Justice |accessdate=19 February 2008|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228182044/http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/JamieFletcher.ExecutiveSovereigntyinourConstitution.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008}}</ref>

The [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]] made it illegal to chase or deliberately kill mammals with dogs in 2002. There are a number of differences between the two Acts: The Scottish Act does not place a two dog limit on the flushing of a mammal to guns in order to shoot it; with respect to flushing foxes above ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect game birds; with respect to flushing foxes below ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect livestock. The Scottish Act allows someone convicted to be sentenced for up to six months in prison, there is no such power in the Hunting Act 2004.<ref name="Scottish Act"/>

At the time of this bill fox hunting with hounds was "not practised or is largely banned" in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden,<ref name="burns">{{cite web|date=9 June 2000 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |authors=Lord Burns, Dr Victoria Edwards, Professor Sir John Marsh, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior; Professor Michael Winter |title=The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm |accessdate=10 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410213249/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm |archivedate=10 April 2009}}</ref> but was allowed in Australia, Canada, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Russia and the USA.<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Fox hunting worldwide|date=16 September 1999|accessdate=2007-10-05|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/428122.stm}}</ref>

===Drafting===
[[Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party]] came to power in [[1997 UK general election|1997]] with a manifesto saying, "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote [[animal welfare]], including a [[Conscience vote|free vote]] in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/8labmanhertrans.html |publisher=BBC |year=1997 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |title=The Labour Party's Manifesto 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220200028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/8labmanhertrans.html |archivedate=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A new private member's bill, introduced by [[Michael Foster (Worcester MP)|Michael Foster MP]], received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/390091.stm|publisher=BBC|title=How hunting ban went to the dogs|date=9 July 1999|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The [[Burns Inquiry|Burns Report]] in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox",<ref name="burns"/> but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] also stated that "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010312/text/10312-06.htm#10312-06_para26|title=Official Report, Lords|date=12 March 2001|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=House of Lords|author=Burns, T.}}</ref> Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]]. The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] voted for a banning bill and the [[House of Lords]] for self-regulation. The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1393104.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Hunt battle set to return|date=17 June 2001|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>

In what he described as an attempt to raise animal welfare standards at the same time, and as an alternative to legislation that specifically targeted hunting, [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Lord Donoughue]] proposed the Wild Mammals (Protection) (Amendment) Bill.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805134859/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200001/ldbills/023/2001023.htm] This would have made it the case that "any person who intentionally inflicts, or causes or procures, unnecessary suffering on or to any wild mammal shall be guilty of an offence."  A matching Bill was introduced in the Commons with the support of The Middle Way Group (see below).  Both bills failed to become law as they were blocked by Labour members who wanted a specific hunting ban. [[Animal welfare]] groups such as the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] criticised the Bill on two grounds. Firstly, they opposed the exemption in the Bill for activities undertaken "in accordance with an approved code of conduct". Secondly, they argued that, if an activity was inherently cruel, it should be deemed as such by Parliament, rather than prosecutors having to argue and prove cruelty in every court case.

Following a series of evidence hearings in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/huntinghearings.htm |title=Hunting Hearings |publisher=Defra |date=10 December 2002 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113040740/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/huntinghearings.htm |archivedate=13 November 2007}}</ref> on 3 December 2002, [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]] [[Minister of State]] for Rural Affairs [[Alun Michael]] introduced a bill which would have allowed some licensed hunting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2578151.stm|title=Hunting vote sparks angry scenes|publisher=BBC|date=17 December 2002|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The Commons passed an amendment proposed by Tony Banks to ban hunting entirely in July 2003 with a majority of 208 in a free vote but was then rejected by the House of Lords by a majority of 212 in October 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3208776.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Lords rejects hunting ban|date=12 October 2003|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>

===Voting, conflict with the Lords and royal assent===
A bill identical to the one passed by the House of Commons in 2003 was reintroduced to the Commons on 9 September 2004.

On 15 September 2004, the day of the final vote (third reading) of this controversial Act, two protesters staged the first invasion of the House of Commons chamber since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1641. It was quickly quelled by Parliamentary officials, but led to a review of parliamentary security, given that it was the second breach of the security of the chamber in four months ([[Fathers 4 Justice]] activists had thrown purple flour in the Commons four months earlier).  Simultaneously, a demonstration of between 8,000 and 10,000 people, including protesters from the [[Countryside Alliance]] filled Parliament Square outside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3656524.stm|title=Pro-hunt protesters storm Commons|date=15 September 2004|accessdate=22 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref> Later, John Holliday wrote for the ''Guardian'' an essay on his actions.<ref name=holliday>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/28/houseofcommons.immigrationpolicy |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Pride not prejudice |first=John |last=Holliday |date=28 September 2004 |accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref>

On 17 November, on one of the days of the Parliamentary session, the Lords again insisted on its amendments to the main Bill. In the Commons, the Government's last-ditch attempt to compromise on a delay until 31 July 2007 won the support of only 46 MPs, although the delay until 2006 was inserted in the Bill. The Lords who would have had to have accepted the Commons' other amendments (including the principle of a ban on hunting) and dues rejected the proposal by 153 to 114.

With the Lords and Commons unable to come to agreement by the end of the Parliamentary year the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], invoked the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4015075.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Fox hunting ban looks inevitable|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions.<ref>{{cite hansard |date=8 April 2010 |place=House of Lords |speaker=Baroness Royall of Blaisdon |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-04-08a.462.0 |title=Parliament Acts |column=462–463 }}</ref> The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article507683.ece|newspaper=The Times|title=High Court upholds Hunting ban |date=28 January 2005|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London|first1=Charles|last1=Bremner|first2=David|last2=Robertson}}</ref> however, other newspapers and broadcasters condemned [[Tony Blair]]'s Labour administration for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4024503.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Hunters fall prey to Parliament |date=19 November 2004|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>

The act came into force on 18 February 2005, three calendar months after it received royal assent.<ref>The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1</ref><ref>Hare v Gocher [1962] 2 QB 641, [1962] 2 All ER 673; Trow v Ind Coope (West Midlands) Ltd [1967] 2 QB 899 at 909, [1967] 2 All ER 900, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]].</ref>

=== Failed challenges===
Challenges to the Act which questioning the legality of the [[Parliament Act 1949]] in the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] failed (for example ''[[Jackson v Attorney General]]'') The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in their judicial capacity agreed with the lower courts in a judgment delivered in October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/56.html|title=Jackson and others v.

An application for [[judicial review]] was made to the [[High Court of England and Wales]] which argued that the [[anti-hunting]] legislation contravenes individual human or [[Property|property rights]] protected in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and under [[European Community law]] and on grounds of the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement of goods and services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/images/stories/pdf/L_legal_challenges_update_19_July_2005.pdf |title=Legal challenges update |publisher=Countryside Alliance |date=19 July 2005}}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The application was dismissed by the High Court in July 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/1677.html|title=The Countryside Alliance and others v.

==Penalties and enforcement==
A person guilty of an offence under this Act is liable on [[summary offence#United Kingdom|summary conviction]] to an unlimited fine at the discretion of judges. (The provisions of the law state a penalty not exceeding level 5 on the [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|standard scale]], however, level 5 currently has no upper limit).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hunting Act 2004, section 6|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/37/section/6}}</ref>

Analysis published in 2015 by pro-hunting pressure group the [[Countryside Alliance]] of 2005-14 data from the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] shows that 378 people have been convicted of Hunting Act offences over that period, but only 24 of the offenders were involved with registered hunts. They therefore conclude that more than 94% of Hunting Act convicted offenders were not members of registered hunts but were involved in poaching or other casual hunting activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/new-survey-shows-hunting-in-good-heart/ |publisher=Countryside Alliance |title=New survey shows hunting in good heart |date=17 December 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref> Justice Minister [[Crispin Blunt]] said in a written answer to Parliament in June 2011 that "it is not possible to separately identify those specific cases proceeded against under the Hunting Act 2004 related to hunts recognised and regulated by the Council of Hunting Associations" since "statistical information available centrally does not include the circumstances of each case."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110607/text/110607w0006.htm#11060826003939|publisher=Hansard|title=Convictions: Hunting|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> In 2014, the number of successful convictions under the act had risen to 430.<ref name="Professionals">{{cite web|url=http://huntingact.org/?q=node/18|title=The hunting act: A website for enforcement professionals|accessdate=24 December 2015}}</ref>

Animal welfare groups such as the [[RSPCA]], [[IFAW]] and the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] monitor some hunts, which they believe may be breaking the law. Small, local groups of [[Hunt Monitors]], made up of independent, private individuals, also engage in regular hunt monitoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/309421.html |publisher=Horse and Hound |title=RSPCA to prosecute Heythrop huntsman |accessdate=17 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803213306/http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/309421.html |archivedate=3 August 2012}}</ref> In 2011 the League Against Cruel Sports complained that "On several occasions over the last few years, we have provided what we believed to be good evidence to Devon & Cornwall Police, but the police haven’t even moved from the starting blocks by interviewing suspects.

[[Police|Police forces]] have said, on a number of occasions, that enforcement of the Hunting Act 2004 like much wildlife crime is a low priority for them, although they say that they will enforce the law.

== Key court cases involving registered hunts==

===Tony Wright (Exmoor Foxhounds): 2006–2009===
Tony Wright, huntsman for the Exmoor Foxhounds, was convicted of illegal hunting with dogs in Barnstaple magistrates court in August 2006 in a private prosecution by the League Against Cruel Sports,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/04/hunting.ukcrime|title=Man found guilty of illegal fox hunting | location=London | work=The Guardian|date=4 August 2006}}</ref> but was then acquitted by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] on appeal.<ref name="High Court case"/> The appeal took place at the request of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] who wished to determine if it is necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate that any hunting taking place was not exempt, or for the defence to prove that it was exempt; also to define what was meant by "hunting". The High Court ruled that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the conditions of the exemption had not been met. It also ruled that for the offence of "hunting a wild mammal" to take place there must be an identifiable mammal.<ref name="High Court case"/>

=== Julian Barnfield (Heythrop Hunt): 2009 ===
Charges of illegal hunting of a fox between November 2008 and February 2009 brought against Julian Barnfield of the Heythrop Hunt by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] were dropped in March 2009 in response to the earlier High Court ruling in the Tony Wright case that 'searching' for a mammal was not hunting and that "hunting could only be an 'intentional' activity".<ref>{{cite news |title=Huntsman relieved as fox case is dropped |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/4193513.huntsman-relieved-fox-case-dropped/ |newspaper=Oxford Mail |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Crawley and Horsham Hunt: 2008–2013 ===

In 2008, the Crawley and Horsham Hunt launched a legal action in the High Court for trespass, nuisance, and harassment against Simon and Jane Wild of West Sussex Wildlife Protection and West Sussex Badger Protection Group. The hunt used Timothy Lawson-Cruttenden, an expert in the use of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in such cases. This was viewed as a test case and received support from the Countryside Alliance, the Master of Foxhounds Association and 80 landowners and if successful was planned to lead to a request for an injunction against everyone associated with these groups from interfering with the hunt. The defendants claimed to have evidence of illegal hunting taking place and were asking the court to accept this as a defence to the Harassment Act action. The original judge, Justice Cranston, stepped down in July 2008 due to earlier comments made in support of the ban made while an MP. During the second trial it was reported that the judge dismissed nuisance and trespass, because they had "fundamental defects", leaving only harassment. It was also reported that the protestors, using an undercover infiltrator, had been able to get hold of conclusive evidence that the claimants were engaged in illegal fox hunting. The principal plaintiff, Simon Greenwood, was filmed using his hounds to chase a fox to ground and then call in terrier-men to dig it out and throw it to the hounds. The plaintiffs dropped the case in July 2009, and agreed to pay costs estimated at over £120,000.<ref name=drops_court_case>{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4494900.Sussex_hunt_drops_court_case_against_activists/|title=Sussex hunt drops court case against activists}}</ref>

Officials of the [[Crawley and Horsham Hunt]] were found guilty in May 2012 of Hunting Act offences: professional huntsman Andrew Phillis, joint master Neill Millard and the hunt secretary Rachel Holdsworth were convicted on a total of five charges of illegally hunting. Millard and Holdsworth were fined £1000 each and both ordered to pay £2500 costs. Phillis was later sentenced to a £500 fine and £2500 costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/14/hunt-members-guilty-fox-hounds?newsfeed=true|title=Hunt members found guilty of illegally pursuing fox with hounds | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

In September 2013, professional huntsman Nicholas Bycroft pleaded guilty to an offence under Section 1 of the Hunting Act: he admitted illegally hunting a fox during a meet at Angmering Park, near Arundel, West Sussex, on 19 February 2013. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge, £150 costs and £15 [[victim surcharge]].

=== RSPCA vs Heythrop Hunt: 2012 ===
In December 2012 the [[RSPCA]] took out a private prosecution against Heythrop Hunt Limited. This was a landmark case, as it was the first time that an organized hunt was prosecuted as a corporate body. The Heythrop Hunt, its Huntsman, Julian Barnfield, and its Senior Master, Richard Sumner, all pleaded guilty to four charges of illegally hunting a fox at Oxford magistrates court in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10113373.update-heythrop-found-guilty-illegal-fox-hunting/ |title=UPDATE: Heythrop found guilty of illegal fox hunting |newspaper=Oxford Mail |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2020}}</ref> Barnfield, a former huntsman with the Heythrop and one of those convicted, said that the case had been politically motivated with its links with David Cameron's constituency.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/17/david-cameron-hunt-convicted-rspca|title=David Cameron's local hunt convicted after RSPCA prosecution | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Caroline|last=Davies|date=17 December 2012}}</ref> The presiding magistrate called the RSPCA's £327,000 costs "staggering";<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-20758022|title=Heythrop Hunt members admit illegal fox hunting | work=BBC News | date=17 December 2012}}</ref> however, Gavin Grant, the chief executive of the RSPCA, said that the organisation would prevent cruelty to animals by all lawful means and had prosecuted 1,341 individuals and secured 3,114 convictions in the past year with a success rate of more than 98%.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/rspca-job-to-sue-heythrop-hunt|title=Why the RSPCA pursued a Heythrop Hunt prosecution | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Gavin|last=Grant|date=19 December 2012}}</ref>

===Other cases===
Subsequently, three pending prosecutions against hunts, including one brought privately by the League Against Cruel Sports, were dropped<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/392/280580.html |author=Butcher, A. |title=Case dropped against hunting men arrested in dawn raids in 2007 |publisher=Horse and Hound |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810074926/http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/392/280580.html |archivedate=10 August 2009}}</ref> and a further two cases which did reach court were thrown out at the conclusion of the prosecution cases when the District Judges ruled that there was no case to answer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwherald.com/news/stories/cleared-huntsman-criticises-waste-of-money-20090921333539.htm |title=Cleared huntsman criticises waste of money |work=Cumberland and Westmoreland Herald|date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

From March to November 2013, staff of six separate hunts were either acquitted of Hunting Act offences or had the prosecutions against them dropped, including three foxhound packs (The York & Ainsty South, the Avon Vale and the Ledbury), a harrier pack (Weston & Banwell Harriers), a staghound pack (The Quantock Staghounds) and a beagle pack (The [[Royal Agricultural College|RAC Beagles]]).

In September 2013 David Parker, the huntsman of the Seavington Hunt, was fined after he admitted illegally hunting a fox with dogs in Dorset. The prosecution was brought by the RSPCA with evidence from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24077013|title=Somerset man pleads guilty to hunting fox with dogs| location=London | work=BBC|date=13 September 2013}}</ref>

==Perspectives==

===Public opinion===
Public opinion has tended to be in favour of the ban on fox hunting:
* A survey commissioned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2002 indicated that a majority of people (57%) agreed with the statement that 'hunting with dogs is never acceptable'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yougov.com/yougov_website/asp_besPollArchives/pdf/TEL020101010.pdf|title=Poll|publisher=Yougov}}</ref>
*A survey by MORI for [[BBC|the BBC]] carried out in February 2005 found that there was a plurality of support for the new legislation, but not an [[absolute majority]] (47% supporting, 26% opposed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2005/bbc-countryfile.shtml |publisher=Ipsos Mori |date=16 February 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |title=Attitudes to the Hunting Ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131175028/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2005/bbc-countryfile.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
*In 2009, Ipsos MORI found that a total of 75% supported the ban on fox hunting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2479/Public-Opinion-on-Hunting.aspx|title=Public Opinion on Hunting }}</ref>
* In 2010, the figure was almost identical, with 76% being opposed to repealing the Hunting Act, including with 71% of rural residents. There was 18% support for repeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2714/Public-Opinion-on-Hunting.aspx|publisher=Ipsos MORI|title=Public Opinion on Hunting |date=26 December 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>
*A poll by MORI in December 2012 showed no change on fox hunting, with 76% being opposed to moves to make it legal, rising to 81% in respect to deer hunting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/25/britons-fox-hunting-ban-survey|title=Most Britons support fox hunting ban, survey finds|quote=Poll before Boxing Day meets shows 76% are against moves to make fox hunting legal, rising to 81% for deer hunting | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|date=25 December 2012}}</ref>
*Ahead of Boxing Day 2016 a poll was released which indicated opposition to fox hunting had reached all-time highs, with 84% of voters, including 82% of those in rural areas, opposing fox hunting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/fox-hunting-boxing-day-poll-opposition-all-time-high-theresa-may-hunting-ban-act-vote-a7495336.html|title=Fox hunting opposition hits all-time high, latest poll finds|date=25 December 2016|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref>

Just 11% supported the repeal of the ban. The poll was published in the aftermath of the release of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] manifesto for the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], which promised a vote on the repeal of the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-manifesto-bring-back-fox-hunting-only-one-in-10-voters-support-a7757891.html|title=9 out of 10 voters oppose Tory manisfesto pledge on fox hunting|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> Only 16% of Conservative voters want the ban overturned, with 50% opposed.

== Proposed Coalition review ==
The [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]], agreed by the new government following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], aimed to give MPs a free vote "to express its view" on repealing the Hunting Act 2004<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8693832.stm |title=Policy-by-policy: The coalition government's plans  |date=21 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] | access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref> when parliamentary time allowed; in late 2010, it was thought this might be in "early 2012".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11692203 |title=No plans for hunting ban vote before 2012, MPs say |first=Andres |last=Sinclair |date=4 November 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> The prime minister, David Cameron, explained in January 2012 "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation&nbsp;...

== Applicability and exemptions==
The [[Countryside Alliance]] note that "The Act makes it an offence to hunt a mouse with a dog but not a rat, you can legally hunt a rabbit but not a hare. You can flush a fox to guns with two dogs legally but if you use three it's an offence. You can flush a fox to a [[bird of prey]] with as many dogs as you like."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/outdoors/8113716/The-rise-and-fall-of-Mr-Fox.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2011|title=The Rise and Fall of Mr. Fox|location=London|first=Adam|last=Edwards|date=5 November 2010}}</ref>

===Hare coursing===
{{Main|Hare coursing}}
In a private prosecution under the Act brought by the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) who had observed two [[hare coursing]] events in villages near [[Malton, North Yorkshire]] in March 2007 organised by the Yorkshire Greyhound Field Trialling Club, the District Judge in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] [[magistrate]]s court clarified that the club was mistaken in believing that because the dogs they had been using were [[Muzzle (device)|muzzled]], the practice was legal.<ref name=BBC1Sep09>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8231495.stm |title=TV chef admits hunting offences |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009  | work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Flushing wild mammals to guns===
Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by packs of dogs to be shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/welshhounds.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080730144206/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/welshhounds.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2008 |author=Jones, K. |year=2000 |title=Federation of Welsh Packs submission to Burns Inquiry |publisher=Defra |accessdate=19 February 2008 }}</ref> This activity is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002.<ref name="Scottish Act">{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020006_en_1 |title=Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act |year=2002 |publisher=HMSO |accessdate=12 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226111531/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020006_en_1 |archivedate=26 February 2008}}</ref> However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, decided that this activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least because it is more difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=it%20is%20more%20than%20twice%20as%20difficult%20to%20keep%20two%20dogs%20under%20control%20one%20dog&ALL=&ANY=&PHRASE=%22it%20is%20more%20than%20twice%20as%20difficult%20to%20keep%20two%20dogs%20under%20control%20than%20one%20dog%2e%20%22&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=muscat_highlighter_first_match&URL=/pa/cm200203/cmstand/f/st030204/pm/parti/30204s08.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match|title=Official Report, Commons|date=4 February 2003|accessdate=25 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons}}</ref>

This exemption was claimed by one [[deer hunting|stag hound]] packs in the [[Exmoor]] area. In an appeal judgment following the conviction of two [[stag hunt]] officials, the judge said that such hunting conducted primarily for recreation was illegal.<ref name="QSH appeal">{{cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_480.pdf |title=League Against Cruel Sports vs. Down & Pillivant |date=2 October 2007 |author=Williams, Judge W. |publisher=League Against Cruel Sports|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602041058/http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_480.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010}}</ref>

===Flushing a fox to a bird of prey===
Many traditional hunts have bought birds of prey and say that they are using hounds to flush foxes so that the bird of prey can hunt them. The Act requires that the intention must be "for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal".<ref name="Hunting Act">{{cite legislation UK|act=Hunting Act 2004 |type=act |year=2004 |chapter=37 |schedule=1 }}</ref> Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds. If this view proves to be correct, then it is unlikely that such a use of dogs is lawful.<ref>{{Cite magazine|author=McLeod, I.|year=2005|title=Birds of prey and the Hunting Act 2004|magazine=[[Justice of the Peace (magazine)|Justice of the Peace]] |issue=169|pages=774–775}}</ref>

Expert opinion on the limitations of flushing foxes to birds of prey will be available to advise courts considering such cases, when they are litigated. For now, the question of what is lawful remains to be determined.

===Hunting below ground===
Hunting below ground takes place with [[Working terrier|terriers]]. The Act outlaws hunting with terriers (also known as terrier work) with a narrowly drawn exemption, described by the Minister, Alun Michael MP as existing "for [[gamekeeper]]s".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030630/debtext/30630-17.htm#30630-17_spnew10|title=Official Report, Commons|publisher=House of Commons|date=30 June 2003|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The Act requires that any hunting below ground must comply with a number of conditions:
*The activity must be carried out "for the purpose of preventing or reducing serious damage to [[gamebird]]s or wild birds which a person is keeping or preserving for the purpose of their being shot."
*The person using the dog must have with them written evidence that the land used belongs to them or that they have been given permission to use the land by the occupier. This permission must be shown immediately to a [[police officer]] on request.
*Only one [[working terrier|dog]] may be used underground at any one time.
*Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that:
**the mammal is flushed as soon as found,
**the mammal is shot as soon as flushed,
**the manner in which the dog is used complies with a code of practice, and the dog must be under sufficient control so as not to prevent this, and
**the dog is not injured.<ref name="Hunting Act"/>

Despite this, many [[fox hunting|fox hunts]] continue to use terriers on a regular basis. Three people, not associated with hunts, have pleaded guilty to offences under the Hunting Act 2004 for hunting with terriers and a fourth was found guilty after a trial.<ref name="League convictions list">{{cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/convictions |title=Hunting Act convictions |publisher=League Against Cruel Sports |date=January 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722095717/http://www.league.org.uk/convictions |archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

===Hunting mice, rats and rabbits===
The Hunting Act 2004 bans some hunting but permits some activities believed to be necessary for land managers. Parliament accepted the view that the hunting of pests such as rats and rabbits was legitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021216/debtext/21216-16.htm#21216-16_spnew15|title=Official Report, Commons|date=16 December 2002|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons}}</ref> MPs did not believe that there was any necessity to use dogs to hunt mice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041028/text/41028-10.htm#41028-10_spnew3|title=Official Report, Lords|date=28 October 2004|accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref>
