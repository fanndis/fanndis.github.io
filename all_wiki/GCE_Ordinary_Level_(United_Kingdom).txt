The [[General Certificate of Education]] (GCE) '''Ordinary Level''', also called the '''O-level''' or '''O level''', was a subject-based academic qualification. Introduced in 1951 as a replacement for the 16+ [[School Certificate (United Kingdom)|School Certificate (SC)]], the O-level would act as a pathway to the new, more in-depth and academically rigorous [[A-level]] (Advanced Level), in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].{{cn|date=November 2020}} Later the complementary and more vocational [[Certificate of Secondary Education]] (CSE) was added to broaden the subjects available and offer qualifications in non-academic subjects.

The O-Level and CSE were replaced in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the [[GCSE]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Contemporary Debates in Education: An Historical Perspective |last=Brooks |first=Ron |orig-year=First published 1991 |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-582-05797-5 |ol=1863538M |chapter=A decade and more of debate |pages=21–23 |url={{Google books|MGagBAAAQBAJ|page=21|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> and later complementary [[IGCSE]] exams. The [[Scotland|Scottish]] equivalent was the [[O-grade]] (replaced, following a separate process, by the [[Standard Grade]]). An O-level branded qualification is still awarded by [[Cambridge International Examinations]] in select locations.

==Structure==
O-levels were predominantly exam-based; this had advantages for students in part-time or evening education. Some commentators criticised this mainly exam-based approach as offering only partial proof of the student's overall ability in comparison with other methods (e.g., coursework-based assessment). There was no summative 'school certificate': each subject was a separate O-level in its own right.

[[Madsen Pirie]] argued that the O-level was advantageous to boys because of exam-based learning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pirie |first1=Madsen |title=How exams are fixed in favour of girls |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/20th-january-2001/12/how-exams-are-fixed-in-favour-of-girls |accessdate=16 January 2019 |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=20 January 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923033552/http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/20th-january-2001/12/how-exams-are-fixed-in-favour-of-girls |archivedate=23 September 2017}}</ref> Pirie also observes that the [[GCSE]] focus on coursework has disadvantaged boys, reversing the gender gap in attainment, to the degree where in all subjects girls outperform boys, including traditionally male subjects such as sciences and [[physical education]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Grading==
Until 1975, candidates were awarded only a ''pass'' or ''fail'' classification. Although candidates received an approximate indication of the marks awarded, O-Level Certificates simply listed those subjects in which a pass had been awarded; subjects in which a candidate had failed were not mentioned. The independent exam boards soon offered competing numeric and alphabetic classifications, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be a pass, while grades 7, 8 and 9 were fails from the [[Joint Matriculation Board|JMB]].  From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A, B, C, D, and E were passes, and F and U (Unclassified) were fails.<ref>http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-94640.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>In particular see page 88 of the definitive [[UCAS]] document at http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ug.admissions/ucasinfo/ukquals07.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518231410/https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ug.admissions/ucasinfo/ukquals07.pdf |date=18 May 2015 }}</ref> Between 1965 and 1985 grades were allocated primarily on a [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] basis, assigning a fixed proportion of each cohort to each grade (A 10%, B 15%, C 25–30%, D 5–10%, E 5–10%, U 15–20%).<ref name=times1>{{cite news|last1=Geddes|first1=Diana|title=From borderline to pass, how O level papers are marked|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=norlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&docId=CS168001808&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=The Times|agency=Times [London, England]|issue=60319|publisher=Times [London, England]|date=1977-08-16}}</ref><ref name=times2>{{cite news|last1=Diana|first1=Geddes|title=Comparison of GCE examination standards gives reassuring evidence, review of 34 studies says.|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=norlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&docId=CS50561733&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=The Times|agency=Times [London, England]|issue=60319|publisher=Times [London, England]|date=1978-06-05|ref=p3}}</ref> Though some exceptions existed, both at the subject and Exam Board level, with Latin and Greek pass rates being consistently higher than other subjects, with 75.4% passing in 1976, in contrast to an average 59% pass rate across all subjects e.g. Biology 56.4%, History 57%. The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976, 27% of Latin entrants gained an A, and ~17% of French, German and Music candidates, this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools.<ref name=times1 /> The proportion obtaining a pass, A-D, or equivalent was initially fixed at 57% – 58%, and remained under 60% through the 1970s, though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982, the pass rates were: Northern Ireland 62%, England 58% Wales 53%.<ref name=times1 /> In 1984 a decision was taken, by the Secondary Examinations Council, to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, where 16+ and 18+ grades would in future be awarded on Examiner Judgement,<ref>{{cite web|title=THE BACKGROUND TO THE A LEVELS DEBATE|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> this change was implemented, at O-Level, in June 1986. In the final year DES statistics were available 6.8% achieved an A, and 39.8% an A-C grade.

O-levels incorporate an element of negative marking, with marks deducted for incorrect answers, poor spelling, grammar or handwriting.<ref>{{cite news|title=O-levels v GCSEs – how do they compare?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9548083/O-levels-v-GCSEs-how-do-they-compare.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=2012-09-17}}</ref>

The table below gives rough equivalences between O-Level, CSE, and GCSE grades, including later changes to GCSE grades in 1994 and the 2010s:

NB The current grade 9 is HIGHER than the previous A* grade was and hence has no equivalent.

For GCSE Mathematics from 1988 there was an extension paper allowing candidates to achieve 3 grades higher than an A (pass, merit, and distinction). This was stopped.

==Entrants==
The 1978 Waddell Report, when comparing O-Level and CSE entrants stated: "''the O Level examination tending to be aimed at the upper 20 per cent of the full ability range and CSE catering for the next 40 per cent''."<ref name=waddell>{{cite web|last1=Waddell|first=James|title=The Waddell Report – School Examinations|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/waddell/waddell1978.html|website=Education in England|publisher=London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office 1978|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> This conclusion is partially supported by the statistics. After 1976, for subjects where an equivalent O-level paper existed, approximately 36% of the pupils entered for either exam sat the O-Level; the remainder (64%) sat the CSE paper. The proportion taking CSE exams increased following the raising of the minimum school-leaving age to 16, in 1973, and the subsequent fall in the proportion sitting neither exam e.g.

==Exam boards==
The O-Level syllabi, examinations and awards were made by 9 independent boards: [[Associated Examining Board]], Durham University Examinations Board (dissolved 1964), [[Joint Matriculation Board]], Oxford and Cambridge, Oxford, Southern, Cambridge, London, and [[Welsh Joint Education Committee]].

Unlike CSE examinations the participating schools had a choice of syllabi and awarding body, and were not required to use a designated local board.

==Later developments==
The O-level qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were replaced by the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), phased in by 1986 with a couple of subjects, and completed for all subjects the following year. However, the O-level brand is still used in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Mauritius]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Singapore]], instead of or alongside the IGCSE qualifications. The Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination was also benchmarked against the O-levels for comparable subjects. But it has switched to benchmark against the [[IGCSE]]. The [[School Certificate (Mauritius)|School Certificate]] of [[Mauritius]] continues to use the O-level exams.

O-levels continue to thrive as well respected international qualifications for students in other countries, who use them for preparation for advanced study in their own country and/or access higher education overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Approximately 12 million candidates from more than 200 countries register annually for O-level examinations across the world. Institutions that offer O-levels include [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE).<ref>[http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/middlesec/olevel/overview Cambridge O Levels] described at CIE's website</ref>

Cambridge International Examinations offers curricula for approximately 40 different subjects.<ref>http://www.cie.org.uk/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-secondary-2/cambridge-o-level/</ref>
