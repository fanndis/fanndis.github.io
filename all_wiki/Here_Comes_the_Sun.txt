"'''Here Comes the Sun'''" is a song by the English rock band [[the Beatles]] from their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''. It was written by [[George Harrison]] and is one of his best-known compositions for the Beatles. Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of his friend [[Eric Clapton]], where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles' [[Apple Corps]] organisation. The lyrics reflect his relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band's business affairs. {{As of|September 2019}}, it was the most [[Streaming media|streamed]] Beatles song on [[Spotify]] globally, with over 350&nbsp;million plays.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Mark|last=Beech|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markbeech/2019/09/29/beatles-biggest-fans-revealed-by-17-billion-streams-as-abbey-road-climbs-charts/#4f8200d12d95|title=Beatles' Biggest Fans Revealed by 1.7 Billion Streams as 'Abbey Road' Climbs Charts|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=29 September 2019|access-date=13 October 2020}}</ref>

The Beatles recorded "Here Comes the Sun" at London's [[EMI Studios]] in the summer of 1969. Led by Harrison's acoustic guitar, the track features [[Moog synthesizer]], which he had introduced to the band's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California. Reflecting the continued influence of [[Indian classical music]] on Harrison's writing, the composition includes several [[time signature]] changes.

"Here Comes the Sun" has received acclaim from music critics. Combined with his other contribution to ''Abbey Road'', "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]", it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist, including at [[the Concert for Bangladesh]] in 1971 and, with [[Paul Simon]], during his appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1976. [[Richie Havens]] and [[Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel]] each had hit singles with "Here Comes the Sun" in the 1970s. [[Nina Simone]], [[George Benson]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] are among the many other artists who have covered the song.

==Composition==
[[File:Ewhurst mill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Hurt Wood Mill, Ewhurst|Hurt Wood windmill]] in [[Ewhurst, Surrey]]. Harrison wrote "Here Comes the Sun" in the garden at nearby Hurtwood Edge.]]
The early months of 1969 were a difficult period for Harrison: he had quit [[the Beatles]] temporarily, he was arrested for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] possession, and he had his [[tonsillectomy|tonsils removed]].{{sfn|Rowley|2013|pp=70–71}} Writing in ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine at the end of the year, [[Barry Miles]] commented on the "isolated life" of the individual Beatles, with "George strangely upset by his bust, uncertain about his friends but singing ''Hare Krishna''."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Miles|title=''Abbey Road'': The Beatles Come Together|date=November 1969|magazine=[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]}} Available at [https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/iabbey-roadi-the-beatles-come-together Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).</ref>

Harrison wrote "Here Comes the Sun" at the house of his friend [[Eric Clapton]], in response to the dark mood surrounding the Beatles.{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=38}} Harrison states in his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine]]'':

{{quote|text="Here Comes the Sun" was written at the time when [[Apple Corps|Apple]] was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: 'Sign this' and 'sign that.' Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton's house. The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric's acoustic guitars and wrote "Here Comes the Sun".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=144}}}}

Clapton's house at the time was Hurtwood Edge, in [[Ewhurst, Surrey]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cNS4-asm4AC |title=The Autobiography |first1=Eric |last1=Clapton |first2=Christopher Simon |last2=Sykes |year=2007 |publisher=Arrow Books |isbn=978-00995-05-495 |page=112 |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref> and he later said the month was possibly April.{{sfn|Harrison|2011|p=368}} Data from two meteorological stations in the London area show that April 1969 set a record for sunlight hours for the 1960s. The Greenwich station recorded 189 hours for April, a high that was not beaten until 1984. The Greenwich data also show that February and March were much colder than the norm for the 1960s, which would account for Harrison's reference to a "long, cold, lonely winter".{{sfn|Rowley|2013|pp=70, 71}} Harrison completed the lyrics for the song in June, while on holiday in Sardinia.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=168}}

==Musical structure==
The song is in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[A major]]. The main refrain uses a IV (D chord) to V-of-V (B chord&ndash;a [[secondary dominant]]) progression (the reverse of that used in "[[Eight Days a Week]]" and "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]").<ref name="Notes on 'Here Comes the Sun'">Pollack, Alan. "[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/hcts.shtml Notes on 'Here Comes the Sun']". Retrieved 14 February 2012.</ref> The melody in the verse and refrain follows the [[pentatonic scale]] from E up to C{{music|#}} (scale steps 5, 6, 1, 2, 3).<ref name="Notes on 'Here Comes the Sun'" />

One feature is the increasing [[syncopation]] in the vocal parts.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=258}} Another feature is the guitar [[Flatpicking|flat-picking]] that embellishes the E7 (V7) chord from 2:03 to 2:11, creating tension for resolution on the tonic A chord at "Little darlin' ".{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=10}} The bridge involves a {{music|b}}III-{{music|b}}VII-IV-I-V7 triple descending 4th (or Tri-Plagal) progression (with an extra V7) as the vocals move from "Sun" ({{music|b}}III or C chord) to "sun" ({{music|b}}VII or G chord) to "sun" (IV or D chord) to "comes" (I or A chord) and the additional 4th descent to a V7 (E7) chord.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp=249–50}} The lyric here ("Sun, sun, sun, here it comes") has been described as taking "on the quality of a meditator's mantra".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=257}}

The song features 4/4 (in the verse) and a sequence of 11/8 + 4/4 + 7/8 (which can also be transcribed as 11/8 + 15/8) in the bridge, phrasing interludes which Harrison drew from Indian music influences.<ref name="Notes on 'Here Comes the Sun'"/>{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=555}} In the second verse (0:59–1:13) the [[Moog synthesizer]] doubles the solo guitar line and in the third verse the Moog adds a counter melody an octave above.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=258}} The last four bars (2:54–3:04) juxtapose the guitar break with a repeat of the bridge.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=258}}

==Recording==
Harrison, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Ringo Starr]] recorded the rhythm track in 13 takes on 7 July 1969.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=178}} [[John Lennon]] did not contribute to the song, as he was recovering from a car crash.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=356}}{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=347}} Towards the end of the session, Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. He [[capo]]ed his guitar on the 7th [[fret]], resulting in the final key of A major (in fact, slightly above A major due to the track being [[varispeed]]ed by less than a [[semitone]]). He also used the same technique on his 1965 song "[[If I Needed Someone]]", which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=258}}

[[File:Moog Synthesizer 3P (1972), CRuNCh Lab.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|An early 1970s version of the [[Moog modular synthesizer|Moog 3-series]] synthesizer used on the song]]
A [[Pump organ|harmonium]] and [[Clapping|handclaps]] were added on 16 July.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=180}} Harrison overdubbed an [[electric guitar]] run through a [[Leslie speaker]] on 6 August, and the orchestral parts ([[George Martin]]'s score for four violas, four cellos, double bass, two piccolos, two flutes, two alto flutes and two clarinets) were added on 15 August.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=258}} He also added further acoustic guitar during the 6 and 11 August sessions.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=168}} The master tapes reveal that Harrison recorded a guitar solo that was not included in the final mix.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=andpop.com| year=2012| title=The Beatles 'Here Comes The Sun': Lost Solo Discovered| url=http://www.andpop.com/2012/01/28/the-beatles-here-comes-the-sun-lost-solo-discovered/| accessdate=28 January 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130121904/http://www.andpop.com/2012/01/28/the-beatles-here-comes-the-sun-lost-solo-discovered/| archive-date=30 January 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/28/new-george-harrison-guitar-solo|title=New George Harrison guitar solo uncovered|first=Sean|last=Michaels|date=28 March 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005157/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/28/new-george-harrison-guitar-solo|archivedate=23 February 2014}}</ref>

"Here Comes the Sun" was completed on 19 August with the addition of a [[Moog synthesizer]] part.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=190}}{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=317}} After Harrison had used the Moog on his recent experimental album, ''[[Electronic Sound]]'', the instrument had been installed at EMI Studios in August, with assistance from [[Mike Vickers]] of the band [[Manfred Mann]], and became an important addition to the sound of the Beatles' final recording project.{{sfn|Shea|Rodriguez|2007|p=179}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=185}} In the description of authors [[Trevor Pinch]] and Frank Trocco, writing in their book on the history and legacy of the Moog synthesizer, Harrison uses it throughout "Here Comes the Sun", and the instrument's "increasing brilliance of timbre" on the track serves to convey "the sun's increasing brilliance".{{sfn|Pinch|Trocco|2002|p=126}}

The mixing session on 20 August 1969, when the band oversaw the creation of the master tape for ''[[Abbey Road]]'', marked the last time that all four Beatles were together in the recording studio.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=317}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=191}} At this point, "Here Comes the Sun" was sequenced as the album's opening song.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=317–18}}

==Release and reception==
''Abbey Road'' was released on 26 September 1969{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=354}} with "Here Comes the Sun" sequenced as the first track on side two of the LP.{{sfn|Castleman|Podrazik|1976|p=81}} In the context of the late 1960s, according to cultural commentator [[Steven D. Stark]], the song's "promise of a new dawn after a lonely winter caught the wearied sensibility of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]".{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=261}} The song's affirmation of life through the natural occurrence of the sun was in keeping with a contemporary trend, following examples such as "[[Good Morning Starshine]]" and "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In]]" from the popular musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.{{sfn|Rowley|2013|p=71}} In her review of ''Abbey Road'' for ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' magazine, Ellen Sander said that "Here Comes the Sun" was "an awakening, an exaltation of the dawn" and the start of a collection of songs that represented "the [LP's] sun side, suffused with mellowed warmth, woven together with motifs, bridging, reprises, surprises, with all the songs set within one another".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sander|first=Ellen|title=The Beatles: 'Abbey Road' |date=25 October 1969|magazine=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|page=69}}</ref> Lon Goddard of ''[[Record Mirror]]'' described it as his "pet track", adding: "Nice string picking backs it as the vocals approach [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] or [[Vanity Fare]].

Along with "Something", which was issued as a single from the album, the song established Harrison as a composer to match Lennon and McCartney.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=297, 300}}{{sfn|Woffinden|1981|p=26}}{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=355–56}} According to author [[Alan Clayson]], Harrison's two ''Abbey Road'' compositions received "the most widespread syndication" of all the tracks on the album, partly through the number of cover versions they attracted.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=285}} In Japan, "Here Comes the Sun" was issued on a single in 1970, as the [[B-side]] to McCartney's ''Abbey Road'' track "[[Oh! Darling]]".{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=385, 690}} In 1973, "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something" were included on the double album ''[[The Beatles 1967–1970]]'',{{sfn|Castleman|Podrazik|1976|pp=123–24}} giving Harrison half the quota of songs representing ''Abbey Road'' on the compilation.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=232}} Although the Beatles never released the track on a single in Britain, new rules implemented to the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2007 allowed any song to enter the charts based on download sales. After the group's back catalogue became available for download on [[iTunes]] in 2010, "Here Comes the Sun" charted at number 64 in late November; it returned to the chart in April 2012, peaking at number 58.<ref name="Copsey/OCC" />{{refn|group=nb|According to author [[Kenneth Womack]], writing in 2014, the song is "consistently the best-selling individual Beatles track on iTunes".{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=386}}}} The song reached number 14 on the US [[Hot Rock Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Rock Songs]] chart in 2017. Two years later, it re-entered the list and became the Beatles' first top-ten hit on the Hot Rock Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/yesterday-beatles-us-chart-revival/|first=Paul|last=Sexton|title='Yesterday' Prompts US Chart Revival for Five Beatles Classics|publisher=uDiscover Music|date=10 July 2019|accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2002, [[Mikal Gilmore]] likened "Here Comes the Sun" to the McCartney-written "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]" and Lennon's solo hit "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", as Harrison's "graceful anthem of hope amid difficult realities".{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|pp=38–39}} In the same publication, [[Greg Kot]] described it as "simpler, but just as intoxicating [as 'Something']" and said that "Harrison's acoustic-guitar intro is a song in itself, its warmth and fragility presaging the guarded optimism of the lyric."{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=187}} While expressing regret at having underestimated Harrison as a songwriter, Martin described "Here Comes the Sun" as being "in some ways one of the best songs ever written".{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=299–300}} Harrison was one of the first musicians in the UK to own a Moog synthesizer; although the instrument had been used by many American acts since 1967, author Thom Holmes says that with ''Abbey Road'' the Beatles were "one of the first groups to effectively integrate the sounds of the Moog into their music".{{sfn|Holmes|2012|p=446}} Pinch and Trocco describe "Here Comes the Sun" as "one of the best known Beatles songs ever" and the album's "Moog ''pièce de résistance''".{{sfn|Pinch|Trocco|2002|pp=125–26}}

In 1994, when [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] published its US radio airplay figures, "Here Comes the Sun" was listed as having been played more than 2&nbsp;million times.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=245}} As of late September 2019, it was the most streamed Beatles song in the UK, with over 50&nbsp;million plays,<ref name="Myers/OCC" /> ahead of "Let It Be" with 26&nbsp;million.<ref name="Copsey/OCC">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-beatles-official-top-40-most-streamed-songs__26794/|first=Rob|last=Copsey|title=The Beatles' Official Top 60 most streamed songs|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=29 September 2019|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref> Up to that time, it was also the most downloaded song from ''Abbey Road''.<ref name="Myers/OCC">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/abbey-road-at-50-13-facts-about-the-beatles-classic-album__27300/|first=Justin|last=Myers|title=Abbey Road at 50: 13 facts about the Beatles' classic album|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=26 September 2019|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref> Music journalist Rob Copsey describes the track as a "staple of any summer playlist".<ref name="Copsey/OCC" />

==Cultural references and legacy==
In the early 1970s, "Here Comes the Sun" was adopted by [[George McGovern]] in his campaign for the US presidency, the initial success of which, according to author [[Nicholas Schaffner]], was a "triumph for the counterculture's attempt to wield power via conventional electoral politics".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=154}} In 1977, astronomer and science populariser [[Carl Sagan]] attempted to have "Here Comes the Sun" included on a disc of music accompanying the ''Voyager'' space mission.<ref name="Fontenot/About">{{cite web|last=Fontenot |first=Robert |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/The-Beatles-Songs-Here-Comes-The-Sun.htm |title=The Beatles Songs: 'Here Comes the Sun' – The history of this classic Beatles song|publisher=[[About.com|oldies.about.com]] |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> Titled the [[Voyager Golden Record]], copies of the disc were put on board both spacecraft in the [[Voyager program]] in order to provide any entity that recovered them with a representative sample of human civilization.

"Here Comes the Sun" has appeared in many critics' lists of the Beatles' best recordings.

Recalling the song's creation in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]'', Clapton said that he himself would never walk around outside playing guitar but "this is what George brought to the situation."

I felt very proud that it was my garden that was inspiring it."{{sfn|Harrison|2011|p=368}}
