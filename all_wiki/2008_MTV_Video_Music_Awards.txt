The '''2008 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]''' took place on September 7, 2008, live from [[Paramount Pictures]] Studios (which, like MTV, is owned by [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]), honoring the best [[music video]]s from the previous year. Nominations for a majority of the categories were announced on the [[MTV]] program ''[[FNMTV]]'' after being selected through viewer online voting at MTV.com. The remaining, professional categories were chosen by a panel of music industry professionals. Unlike previous editions of the show, MTV announced the winners to the professional categories three days before the ceremony (September 4) via a press release, rather than on the pre-show or main show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1594119/20080904/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West, Gnarls Barkley, White Stripes Clips Pick Up VMAs In 2008 'Professional Categories'|newspaper=MTV News|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The rest of the winners were announced during the ceremony.

This year's awards were a huge improvement ratings-wise, seeing a 19% rise on [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|last year]] with 8.4 million viewers. It was also a 23% advance over the 5.76 million who saw the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards|2006 ceremony]]. Although ratings improved, this year's video music awards was hosted at its smallest venue of its 25-year history. [[Britney Spears]] became the main winner of the night, walking away with her first three Moonmen: Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Pop Video all for "[[Piece of Me]]".

During the program, the MTV networks [[VH1]], [[NickMusic|MTV Hits]], and [[BET Jams|MTV Jams]] did not air their usual programming at all, instead displaying full-screen cards guiding viewers to watch the ceremony on MTV, with VH1 using a rotating "billboard" of sponsors to promote 'sneak peeks' of the live ceremony which appeared in the top-left corner with false crowd noise in the background. During the VMA commercial breaks, VH1 also carried regular advertising.
