'''Barclays Center''' is a multi-purpose [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] in the [[New York City]] [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]].

As a result, construction was delayed until 2010, with no secure funding for the project having been allotted.

==History==
The arena was conceived by [[Bruce Ratner]] of real estate developer [[Forest City Ratner|Forest City Ratner Companies]], the New York division of [[Forest City Enterprises]] that Ratner founded. He acquired the New Jersey Nets basketball team in 2004 for $300 million<ref name=NYm/> (he has since sold most of his shares to continue funding the project) for the purpose of moving them to the [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] development on Brooklyn's [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]] play in the arena that would be the centerpiece of the Pacific Park commercial and residential redevelopment project.<ref name="ratner04" /> The move had marked the return of [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] sports to Brooklyn, which had been absent since the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] to Los Angeles in 1957. Coincidentally, the original proposal for a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|domed stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers]] was just north of the Pacific Park Brooklyn site, where the [[Atlantic Terminal Mall]], also owned by Forest City Ratner Companies, is located.

The arena was initially projected to open in 2006, with the rest of the Pacific Park Brooklyn complex to follow. However, controversies involving local residents, the use of [[eminent domain]], potential environmental impact, lack of continued public financing, as well as a major economic downturn delayed the project.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |title=Nets Say Brooklyn Move May Be Delayed Further|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/sports/basketball/04nba.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 4, 2008|access-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Due to these legal and financial troubles, the development deal seemed headed towards failure or collapse.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Red Dawn for Ratner|first=Will|last=Leitch|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/51834/|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]|date=November 2, 2008}}</ref> [[Frank Gehry]], an architect involved in the project's initial designs said, in March 2009, "I don't think it is going to happen,"<ref name=NYm/> and Ratner at one point explored selling the team.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bruce Ratner Explored Nets Sale|first=Frank|last=Isola|author2=Lawrence, Mitch|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/2008/10/27/2008-10-27_bruce_ratner_explored_nets_sale.html|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=October 27, 2008}}</ref> The [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Ratner on May 16, 2009.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} Opponents appealed the court decision.

Russian businessman [[Mikhail Prokhorov]] agreed to a $200&nbsp;million deal on September 23, 2009, to become a principal owner of the Nets and a key investor in the Brooklyn arena.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The Nets played two preseason games at [[Prudential Center]] in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prudential Center To Host New Jersey Nets Pre-Season Basketball|url=http://www.prucenter.com/default.asp?prucenter=107&objId=73|publisher=Prudential Center's Official Website|date=March 4, 2009|access-date=March 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315001553/http://www.prucenter.com/default.asp?prucenter=107&objId=73|archive-date=March 15, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The two preseason games were successful, and a deal that would have the Nets play at the Prudential Center for the 2010–11 and 2011–12 NBA seasons became more likely. Negotiations nearly fell apart, when the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority refused to release the Nets from their lease at Izod.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deal to Move NJ Nets to Newark's Prudential Center Falls Apart|first=Ted|last=Sherman|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/newark_prudential_center_izod.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|location=Newark|date=December 16, 2009|access-date=December 19, 2009}}</ref> Negotiations resumed, and on February 18, 2010, the Nets finalized a deal that would move them to the Prudential Center in [[Newark, New Jersey]] until Barclays Center opened.

The [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in favor of the state using eminent domain for the project on November 24, 2009. [[Empire State Development Corporation]] Vice President Warner Johnston indicated that the agency was committed to seeing the project completed and said "we can now move forward with development."<ref name="nj.com">{{cite news |title=New York Court of Appeals Rules State Can Use Eminent Domain to Take Land for Atlantic Yards Arena Project|url=http://www.nj.com/nets/index.ssf/2009/11/new_york_court_of_appeals_rule.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|location=Newark|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 24, 2009|access-date=February 7, 2010}}</ref>

Another potential roadblock to this development resulted from the Appellate Court's negative decision regarding a similar eminent domain case, brought against [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite news |title=No Eminent Domain for Columbia University Expansion: Court|first1=Jose|last1=Martinez|first2=Frank|last2=Lombardi |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2009/12/04/2009-12-04_columbia_land_grab_nixed_no_eminent_domain_for_university_expansion_court.html |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 4, 2009|access-date=February 6, 2010}}</ref> This landmark case could have given new life to the case being brought by the community group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB).

[[File:Bklyn Nets arena Feb 2012 jeh.jpg|thumb|left|February 2012, just seven months before construction was finished]]
However, on March 1, 2010, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Abraham Gerges struck down a challenge by property owners, regarding the state's use of eminent domain, which allowed the private property to be condemned. Groundbreaking for the project occurred on March 11, 2010.<ref name="nydn-March 11, 2010" />

[[Barclays Bank]] agreed to a 20-year naming rights agreement for $400 million in 2007. However, two years later, due to the slump in the economy the deal was renegotiated to $200 million.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calder |first1=Rich |title=Barclays Center makes it official |url=https://nypost.com/2012/08/08/barclays-center-makes-it-official/ |website=New York Post |access-date=September 2, 2018 |date=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

The [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) announced on October 24, 2012, that the franchise would move to Barclays Center in 2015 after the expiration of their lease at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], which the team had called home since its inception in 1972. The deal did not require the involvement of the [[New York Rangers]], as the Islanders' agreement with the Rangers to share the New York area allows them to play their home games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and [[Queens]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New York Islanders Ponder Move to Willets Point|first=Connor Adams|last=Sheets |url=http://yournabe.com/articles/2010/05/20/astoria_times/news/at_islanders_willets_pt_20100520.txt|newspaper=Astoria Times|date=May 20, 2010|access-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref> While Barclays Center was conceived as a multipurpose arena that could accommodate the Nets and an NHL team, it was built mainly for basketball. While it can accommodate an NHL-size rink, the scoreboard was off-centered above the blue line that is closer to the arena's southeast end. Capacity for hockey is 15,795, the second-smallest in the league (behind [[Winnipeg Jets|Winnipeg]]'s [[Bell MTS Place]]). The seating arrangement for hockey is asymmetrical. There are only three rows of permanent seating on the northwest end of the arena, and at least 416 seats will not be sold at all due to poor sight lines.<ref>{{cite news |title=Everything You Need to Know About Barclays Center's Hockey Configuration|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/barclays-centers-hockey-details.html|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=September 13, 2013|access-date=September 13, 2010}}</ref> As a result of the signing of the lease, the two [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] games scheduled to be played in the arena on January 20 and 21, 2013 between [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] and [[SKA Saint Petersburg|SKA St. Petersburg]] were moved back to their teams' home venues. As part of the deal, the management of the Barclays Center took over the business operations of the Islanders when the team moved to Brooklyn, though [[Charles Wang]] remained principal owner and continued to oversee hockey operations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kosman |first=Josh |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/so_like_isles_start_lookin_like_CXMENQtTB5PWxOamOgIYLO |title=Islanders may change team colors with move to Brooklyn |work=New York Post |date=April 25, 2013 |access-date=August 13, 2013}}</ref> This arrangement continued after Wang sold controlling interest in the Islanders to [[Jon Ledecky]] and [[Scott D. Malkin]]. Business operations were returned to the Islanders following the 2018–19 season, where the franchise rents the arena and NYCB Live.

According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Barclays Center passed [[Madison Square Garden]] as the highest-grossing venue in the US for concerts and family shows, not counting sports events. That statistic was based on ticket sales between November 1, 2012, and May 31, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Garden wilting at No. 2 as Barclays Center named highest-grossing venue in US|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/garden_wilting_at_no_WroErVTTwgNulGVBhiA4BM|work=NY Post|access-date=July 24, 2013|first=David K.|last=Li}}</ref> On February 24, 2015, an ironworker was killed when four joists fell on him as he was helping to install the arena's green roof.<ref>{{cite news|title=Iron worker at Barclays Center crushed to death by steel beams: police|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/worker-barclays-center-crushed-death-steel-beams-article-1.2128317|publisher=NY Daily News|date=February 25, 2015|first=Kerry|last=Burke}}</ref>

Poor reception of the arena's quality as a hockey venue affected the Islanders' average attendance in comparison to Nassau Coliseum, which fell to an NHL low of 12,059 (the arena itself is also the second-smallest in the league). The team began to seek an exit from Barclays, although NHL officials judged that the Coliseum (even with its recent renovations) would not be suitable as a full-time venue, as it lacked amenities common in new facilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islanders-making-their-move-to-brooklyns-barclays-center-1435625418|title=Barclays Center to Finally Break the Ice With Islanders, Fans|last=Caldwell|first=Dave|date=June 30, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="nyp-barclayssplit">{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/barclays-pressuring-islanders-into-more-coliseum-games/|title=Barclays pressuring Islanders into more Coliseum games|date=January 23, 2018|work=New York Post|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/09/nhl-on-islanders-nassau-coliseum-hopes-keep-dreaming/|title=NHL on Islanders' Nassau Coliseum hopes: Keep dreaming|date=September 9, 2017|work=New York Post|access-date=October 3, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> On June 21, 2018, the Islanders announced that they would begin to play a portion of their home schedule at Nassau Coliseum until the completion of their new [[Belmont Park Arena]] project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/22254786/new-york-islanders-split-home-games-nassau-coliseum-barclays|title=Net return: Isles get 12 home games at Nassau|work=ESPN.com|access-date=November 17, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Barclays Center was designed by the architect firm [[SHoP Architects]]. [[Ellerbe Becket|Ellerbe Becket/AECOM]] served as the project [[Architect of record]].

Initial concepts for the area were designed by [[Frank Gehry]], whose design proposed a rooftop park (open only to residents of the Atlantic Yards complex) ringed by an open-air [[Track and field|running track]] and capable of doubling as an [[Ice rink|ice skating rink]] in winter with [[panoramic]], year-round views of [[Manhattan]].<ref name="constructiondigital" /> The famed architect's tallest tower, called Miss Brooklyn at 620 feet, was also part of this plan.<ref name=NYm/> Gehry's plans carried a projected cost of $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name="constructiondigital" /> Forest City Ratner unveiled a scaled back version of the project in February 2008 reducing Miss Brooklyn's size 40%, and making it {{convert|109|ft}} shorter.<ref name=NYm/> Another redesign unveiled just over two months later scrapped Miss Brooklyn entirely, and in January 2009, the developer started "value engineering" the arena design, cutting its budget even more. In September 2009 the Becket/SHoP proposal with a projected cost (initially) of $800&nbsp;million (ultimately itself revised to $1&nbsp;billion) was unveiled.<ref name=NYm/>

Externally, the arena's shape features three articulated bands with features a glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] covered by a "latticework" composed of 12,000 [[Weathering steel|preweathered steel]] panels engineered and constructed by ASI Limited/SHoP Construction<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/building_types_study/stadiums/2012/barclays-center-shop.asp?specs=true|title=Architectural Record: Barclays Center}}</ref> meant to evoke the image of Brooklyn's [[Brownstone#Brownstone dwellings|brownstones]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop-construction.com/#/projects/featured/barclayscenter|title=Barclays Center|work=SHoP Construction|access-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref> A {{convert|117|by|56|ft|m|adj=on}} [[oculus]] extends over a {{convert|5660|sqft|m2|adj=on}} section of the plaza outside of the main arena entrance with an irregularly shaped display screen looping the interior face of the oculus.<ref name="bc-09-28-10">{{cite press release|title=Plaza at Barclays Center to Include New Transit Entrance with Green Roof, Landscaping and Open Space for Community Programming |url=http://barclayscenter.com/press/articles/plaza_at_barclays.shtml |publisher=Barclays Center |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=October 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016140620/http://barclayscenter.com/press/articles/plaza_at_barclays.shtml |archive-date=October 16, 2011}}</ref> The arena floor's location below grade allows people in the plaza to view the scoreboard.<ref name="bc-09-28-10" />

Unlike most other urban venues in the US, Barclays Center has no dedicated parking lot; however, it is easily accessible by [[New York City Subway|subway]], [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|bus]], and [[Long Island Rail Road|railroad]].<ref name="transit">{{cite web

==Naming rights==
[[File:Barclays-center.jpg|thumb|left|Seen in 2018]]
On January 18, 2007, it was announced that the arena would be called Barclays Center, after London-based banking group [[Barclays]].

===Hockey===
[[File:Barclays Center - New York Islanders 03.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Islanders playing against the [[Washington Capitals]] in 2016]]
The [[New York Islanders]] moved from [[Nassau Coliseum]] to Barclays Center before the [[2015–16 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Honan|first=Edith|title=New York Islanders to move to Brooklyn in 2015|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCABRE89N1B420121024|agency=Reuters Canada|access-date=October 24, 2012|date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> The Islanders played the first NHL hockey game at Barclays Center in a preseason game on September 21, 2013, losing to the [[New Jersey Devils]] 3–0 in front of a crowd of 14,689. The first goal in the arena's history was scored by [[Jacob Josefson]] of the New Jersey Devils. An Islanders game was scheduled for the previous preseason but was canceled due to the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]]. The Islanders and Devils played again on September 26, 2014. This time, the Islanders defeated New Jersey 3–2 in a shootout. The first goal in Islanders Brooklyn history was scored in the first period on a power play (and a delayed penalty call) by defenseman [[Ryan Pulock]].

The first regular season game was played on October 9, 2015 against the [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|2015 Stanley Cup]] champions the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], who won the game 3–2 in overtime. This was the sixth NHL game at Barclays Center, following five total preseason contests (three in 2015), and one Islanders rookie scrimmage. The first NHL regular season goal scored in the Barclays Center was a shorthanded goal by [[Artem Anisimov]] for the Blackhawks in the first period, while [[John Tavares (ice hockey)|John Tavares]] scored in the second period and was the first Islander to do so.

The first [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] game at Barclays Center was held on April 17, 2016, when the Islanders defeated the [[Florida Panthers]] 4–3 in game three of the first-round series between the two teams. Seven nights later, the arena hosted game 6 of the series, which turned out to be the longest home game in Islanders history. In that game, the Islanders were trailing 1–0 when Tavares scored the game-tying goal with 53.2 seconds left in regulation; he would score the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993.

The Islanders are scheduled to move to the newly constructed [[UBS Arena]] in time for the 2021–22 season. New York State governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] announced on February 29, 2020, that the Islanders would play all home games in the 2020–21 season at [[Nassau Coliseum]], their former home.<ref name="nhl-2020-02-29">{{cite web | title=Islanders to host all Stanley Cup Playoff games at Nassau Coliseum|last=Compton|first=Brian|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/new-york-islanders-to-play-playoff-games-this-season-all-next-season-nassau-coliseum/c-315693992|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|date=February 29, 2020|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> It was also announced that the Islanders would play all of their home playoff games during the [[2020 Stanley Cup playoffs]] at Nassau Coliseum, meaning that their final game played at the Barclays Center was scheduled to be on March 22, 2020, against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]. However, all NHL games were postponed on March 12 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in North America]]. At that point in time, the Islanders had six home games left in the regular season, two in Brooklyn and four in Nassau County, as well as six road games, and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]. The last Islanders game at Barclays Center before the season's pause was played on March 3, 2020, when the Islanders lost 6–2 to the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Nassau Coliseum, however, was closed indefinitely in June 2020, and the Islanders will reportedly return to Barclays Center for the 2020–21 season if the Coliseum remains unavailable.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nassau Coliseum shuts down; Islanders' home uncertain |url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/nassau-coliseum-shuts-down-islanders-home-uncertain |work=NationalPost.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=June 16, 2020 |access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref>

===Boxing and mixed martial arts===
Several boxing matches have taken place in the arena, including [[Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah]], and [[Ruslan Provodnikov]] vs. [[Chris Algieri]]. The venue hosted [[UFC 208]] on February 11, 2017 and it hosted [[UFC 223]] on April 7, 2018.

===Gymnastics===
On November 6, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions 2016|url=https://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/kelloggs-tour-of-gymnastics-champions-2016|publisher=barclayscenter.com|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

==Issues==

===Legal actions===
During its construction, the center was the source of a number of controversies involving local residents, the use of [[eminent domain]], potential environmental impact, lack of continued public financing, as well as a major economic downturn delayed the project.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Ratner on May 16, 2009.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} Opponents appealed the court decision, and a hearing for the appeal was scheduled for October 14, 2009, with a decision to be issued no sooner than November 25.<ref name="Thompson"/>

On November 24, 2009, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in favor of the state using eminent domain for the project. [[Empire State Development Corporation]] Vice President Warner Johnston indicated that the agency is committed to seeing the project completed and said "we can now move forward with development."<ref name="nj.com"/>

Barclays Center has also been accused of mistreating [[luxury box]] holders who are African-American. Three employees of Ludwig's Pharmacy in Prospect Heights claimed in a lawsuit, filed in October 2013, that they were singled out for bad treatment at the arena because they are black. They are suing for $4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Luxury Box Holders Accuse Barclays Center Of Racism, File $4 Million Lawsuit|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/box_holders_accuse_barclays_center.php|publisher=Gothamist|access-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102225014/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/box_holders_accuse_barclays_center.php|archive-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>{{needs update|date=September 2020}}

===Labor issues===
A group of 120 part-time construction workers who work to convert the arena from concert hall to sports venue unsuccessfully tried to switch unions in February 2013. The pay for part-time work is structured differently than that of the same work at [[Madison Square Garden]], and workers have complained about not being able to make a living on one-day-a-month work at $14/hour, and being barred from collecting [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130228/BLOGS04/130229858|title=Barclays Workers Fail to Break From Union|last=Bragg|first=Chris|date=February 28, 2013|publisher=Crain's}}</ref>

===Quality as a hockey venue===

As the arena was not originally designed with hockey in mind, the New York Islanders' move to Barclays Center has resulted in complaints over seats with obstructed views, and the arena's ice quality.

Some seats were singled out for having poor and obstructed sightlines during hockey games.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-and-worst-seats-in-hockey-1443832148|title=The Good Views and Bad Views About Barclays Center|last=Raskin|first=Alex|date=October 2, 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> ''[[Business Insider]]'' has called sections 201 to 204 and 228 to 231, "the worst seat in American professional sports".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/barclays-center-new-york-islanders-seats-2015-10|title=Brooklyn's Barclays Center might have the worst seat in American professional sports|last=Garber|first=Jonathan|date=October 12, 2015|work=Business Insider}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark acknowledged the issue, but insisted nothing can be done: "There's really nothing we're going to do from a capital improvement standpoint. You can watch the game on your mobile device. The game is on the scoreboard."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2016/02/03/new-york-islanders-barclays-center-troubles-brett-yormark-interview|title=Islanders tackling many challenges during first season in Brooklyn|last=Fuchs|first=Jeremy|date=February 3, 2016|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> There have also been complaints over the quality of the ice during hockey games. The stadium uses [[PVC piping]] instead of steel piping under the ice surface, making it much harder to maintain NHL standards and temperature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lighthousehockey.com/2016/10/22/13369316/barclays-center-ice-islanders-complaints|title=In Year 2, Barclays Center Ice Still a Problem|date=October 22, 2016|work=lighthousehockey.com}}</ref>
