In 2011, it had a population of 134,122.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-northwestengland.php?cityid=E35000173|title=Town population 2011|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>

Evidence of [[Stone Age]], [[Roman Britain|Roman]], and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] activity has previously been discovered locally. In the [[Middle Ages]], Sale was a rural [[Township (England)|township]], linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring [[Ashton upon Mersey]], whose fields and meadows were used for crop and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses' [[Girth (tack)|saddle girths]] were made.

The [[Bridgewater Canal]] reached the town in 1765, stimulating Sale's urbanisation. The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale's growth as a [[commuter town]] for Manchester, leading to an influx of middle class residents; by the end of the 19th century the town's population had more than tripled. Agriculture gradually declined as [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service industries]] boomed.

Sale's urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the [[Local Government Act 1929]]. The increase in population led to the granting of a [[charter]] in 1935, giving Sale honorific [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]]. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town, supported by its proximity to the [[M60 motorway]] and the [[Manchester Metrolink]] network.

== History ==
A [[flint tool|flint]] arrowhead discovered in Sale suggests a prehistoric human presence at the location,<ref name="Swain9">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;9.</ref> but there is no further evidence of activity in the area until the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. A 4th-century [[hoard]] of 46&nbsp;Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey [[Drainage basin|basin]].<ref name="Nevell9720"/><ref>Nevell (1992), pp.&nbsp;59,&nbsp;75.</ref> Sale lies along the line of the [[Roman road]] which runs between the fortresses at [[Chester]] ([[Deva Victrix]]) and [[York]] ([[Eboracum]]), via the [[castra|fort]] at [[Manchester]] ([[Mamucium]]);<ref name="Nevell9720">Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;20.</ref> the present-day [[A56 road|A56]] follows the route of the road through the town.<ref name="Swain9"/> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the [[Anglo-Saxons]].

Some local field and road names,<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;12.</ref> and the name of Sale itself, are Anglo-Saxon in origin, which indicates the town was founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. The [[Old English]] ''salh'', from which "Sale" is derived, means "at the [[willow|sallow]] tree",<ref>Dodgson (1970b), p.&nbsp;4.</ref> and Ashton upon Mersey means "village or farm near the [[ash trees]]".<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;12–13.</ref> Although the [[Township (England)|townships]] of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey were not mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, that may be because only a partial survey was taken.<ref>Redhead, Norman, in: Hartwell, Hyde and Pevsner (2004), p.&nbsp;18.</ref> The first recorded occurrences of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey are in 1199–1216 and 1260 respectively.<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;32,&nbsp;38–39.</ref> The settlements were referred to as townships rather than [[manorialism|manors]], which suggests further evidence of Anglo-Saxon origins as townships were developed by the Saxons.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;11.</ref>

[[File:Historic Dovecote at Walkden Gardens, Sale, Cheshire - geograph.org.uk - 526310.jpg|thumb|left|The dovecote is all that survives of Sale Old Hall.]]
The manor of Sale was one of 30 held by [[List of Barons of Halton#2 William FitzNigel|William FitzNigel]], a powerful 12th century baron in north Cheshire. He divided it between Thomas de Sale and Adam de Carrington, who acted as [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]] on FitzNigel's behalf.<ref name="Swain20">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;20.</ref> On de Sale's death, his land passed to his son-in-law, John Holt; de Carrington's land passed into the ownership of Richard de Massey, a member of the Masseys who were Barons of [[Dunham Massey|Dunham]]. Sale descended through the Holt and Massey families until the 17th century, when their respective lands were sold.<ref name="Swain20"/> Sale Old Hall was built in about 1603 for James Massey, probably to replace a medieval [[manor house]], and was one of the first buildings in northwest England to be made of brick.<ref name="Swain22">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;22.</ref><ref>Nevell (2008), p.&nbsp;61.</ref> It was rebuilt in 1840 and demolished in 1920, but two buildings in its grounds have survived: its [[dovecote]], now in [[Walkden Gardens]], and its lodge, the latter now occupied by Sale Golf Club.<ref name="Swain22"/>

[[File:1777 Burdett map of Sale.jpg|right|thumb|1777 map of area around Sale showing the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey and the separate village of Cross Street ([[Baguley]] and [[Wythenshawe Hall]] are in the southeast)]]
In 1745, Crossford Bridge&nbsp;– which dated back to at least 1367&nbsp;– was torn down.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;27.</ref> It was one of a series of bridges crossing the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising]]. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] and [[Stockport]] instead.<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;42,&nbsp;44.</ref>

The extension of the Bridgewater Canal to [[Runcorn]] was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce.<ref name="Swain44">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;44.</ref> Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back [[night soil]] to fertilise the fields.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;47.</ref> Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several [[yeoman|yeomen]] claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct.<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;44–45.</ref> A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, on the site of the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey.<ref name="Swain40">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;40.</ref> The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time.<ref>Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;56.</ref> The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road.<ref name="Swain40"/> Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.

About {{convert|300|acre|ha}} of "wasteland" known as Sale Moor was [[Enclosure|enclosed]] in 1807, to be divided between the landowners in Sale. This was part of a nationwide initiative to begin cultivation of [[common land]] to lessen the food shortage caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;51–52.</ref> Records of [[poor relief]] in the town start in 1808, a time when the region was in the grip of an [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]].<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;61–62.</ref> [[Poorhouse]]s, where [[pauper]]s could stay rent-free, were built in the early-19th century, reflecting the poor state of the local economy.<ref name="Swain68">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;68.</ref> In 1829, [[Samuel Brooks (railway pioneer)|Samuel Brooks]] acquired {{convert|515|acre|ha}} of land in Sale&nbsp;– about a quarter of the township&nbsp;– from [[George Grey, 6th Earl of Stamford]].<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The area later became known as Brooklands after the land owner.

[[File:Bridgewater Canal in centre of Sale 2006.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Bridgewater Canal, looking north towards Stretford. The Metrolink tramline runs parallel with the canal.]]
The [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]] opened in 1849,<ref name="Nevell97">Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;97.</ref> and led to the middle classes using Sale as a commuter town, a residence away from their place of work.<ref name="Swain85">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;85.</ref> This resulted in Sale's population more than tripling by the end of the 19th century.<ref name="Nevell87">Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;87.</ref> The land in Sale Moor was the cheapest in the town because the soil was poor and difficult to cultivate, which was part of the reason the area was common land until the early 19th century. However, when the railway opened, Sale Moor was close to the station and became the most expensive area in Sale. Villas were built in Sale Moor, and a few in Ashton upon Mersey as the demand for land increased.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;91.</ref> They were often decorated with stained glass or different coloured bricks in an attempt to make them "mansions in miniature" for the aspiring middle class.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;98.</ref>

Pressure from an increasing population led to the town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880;<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;116.</ref> and Sale was connected to the telephone network in 1888.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;84.</ref> As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914,<ref name="Swain134">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;134.</ref> and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War.<ref>Swain (1987) p.&nbsp;112.</ref> The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing.<ref name="Swain 119-123">Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;119,&nbsp;123.</ref> The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building [[council house|council housing]], and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, Sale had 594&nbsp;council houses.<ref name="Swain 119-123"/> The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war.<ref name="Swain134"/> additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.

Sale was never officially evacuated during the war, and even received families from evacuated areas, although it was not considered far enough from likely targets to be an official destination for evacuees.<ref name="Swain133">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;133.</ref> The town's proximity to Manchester, an industrial centre directed towards the war effort, did result in a number of bombing raids. [[Incendiary bomb|Incendiaries]] dropped on Sale in September 1940 caused no casualties, but did damage two houses on Norman Road. In a bombing incident the following November, four people were injured and a school was damaged; on 22 December 1940, twelve people were injured by bombs.<ref name="Swain133"/> On the night of 23 December, much of Manchester suffered heavy bombing in what became known as the [[Manchester Blitz]]. Six hundred incendiary bombs were dropped on Sale in three hours. There were no injuries, but Sale Town Hall was severely damaged.<ref name="Swain133"/> On 3 August 1943, at 11:50&nbsp;pm, a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington Bomber]] on a training exercise crashed in Walton Park in the south-west of the town. Of the six-man crew, consisting of five members of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and one member of the [[Royal Air Force]], the pilot and the bomb-aimer were killed.<ref name="crash"/>

Sale's shopping centre was redeveloped during the 1960s, as part of the town's post-war regeneration. In 1973, the shopping precinct in the town centre, which had grown up in the mid-19th century, was also redeveloped and pedestrianised in an attempt to increase trade.<ref name="Swain134"/> The construction of the M63 motorway (subsequently renamed the M60) in 1972 led to the creation of Sale Water Park. To minimise the risk of flooding, the new road was built on an embankment, for which the necessary gravel was extracted from what is today an artificial lake and water-sports centre.<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;135–136.</ref> Opportunities for leisure were increased when the old swimming baths, demolished in 1971, were replaced in 1973 by a new complex built on the same site.<ref name="Swain134"/>

Most of the parks, including Worthington and Walton, are in the central and southern areas, leaving Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor with a shortage of accessible green space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=3B6804A6-9924-46FD-AF73-C80A72819945 |title=Brooklands Ward Profile |publisher=Trafford Council |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106010550/http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=3B6804A6-9924-46FD-AF73-C80A72819945 |archive-date=6 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 30 June 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=877523D9-2EEF-41A7-BC4E-E50F346DD3DD |format=PDF |title=Ashton-on-Mersey Ward Profile |publisher=Trafford Council |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191519/http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=877523D9-2EEF-41A7-BC4E-E50F346DD3DD |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 30 June 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=FF97C56E-3D0A-4A0C-B528-A7E3007204B1 |format=PDF |title=Sale Moor Ward Profile |publisher=Trafford Council |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191814/http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=FF97C56E-3D0A-4A0C-B528-A7E3007204B1 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 30 June 2007.</ref>

Originally a [[working class]] town, there was an influx of [[middle class]] people in the mid-19th century when businessmen began using Sale as a commuter town.<ref name="Swain85"/> Since then, Sale has had a greater proportion of middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that of the rest of the nation but was biased towards the middle classes, transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_SOC&data_cube=N_SOC_redist&u_id=10027550&c_id=10001043&add=Y |title=Sale social class |publisher=Vision of Britain}} Retrieved on 1 August 2008.<br />•{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_rate_page.jsp?u_id=10027550&c_id=10001043&data_theme=T_SOC&id=0 |title=Percentage of Working-Age Males in Class 1 and 2 |publisher=Vision of Britain}} Retrieved on 1 August 2008.<br />•{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_rate_page.jsp?u_id=10027550&c_id=10001043&data_theme=T_SOC&id=2 |title=Percentage of Working-Age Males in Class 4 and 5 |publisher=Vision of Britain}} Retrieved on 1 August 2008.</ref>

=== Population change ===
According to the [[hearth tax]] returns of 1664, the township of Sale had a population of about 365.<ref>Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during the latter half of the 19th century (due to the [[Industrial Revolution]]). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] or Stretford.<ref>Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;85.</ref> The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town.<ref name="Nevell86">Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;86.</ref> A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930.<ref name="Swain139">Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;139.</ref> Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population.

During the medieval period, most of the land was used for [[agronomy|growing crops]] and raising livestock such as cattle.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;15.</ref> The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes.<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;14,&nbsp;16.</ref> Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the [[Earl of Stamford|Stamfords]] and the [[De Trafford baronets|de Traffords]], to invest.<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;85–86,&nbsp;88–91.</ref> Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.<ref>Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;89–90.</ref>

Along with the rest of the region, Sale's economy during the early-19th century was weak, a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival of the railway in the middle of the century.<ref name="Swain68"/> Despite the dominance of agriculture, there was a growing service industry; Sale and Ashton upon Mersey experienced a growth in numbers employed in retail and domestic services in the first half of the 19th century.<ref name="Nevell86"/> By 1901, less than 20% of Sale residents were employed in agriculture.<ref name="Nevell86"/> Employment was available in [[workhouse]]s for those who could not find work elsewhere. Sale was part of the Altrincham Union, which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;61.</ref>

[[File:Sale shopping centre 2007 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|The main thoroughfare of Sale shopping centre]]
The main shopping centre in Sale, the Square Shopping Centre, was constructed in the 1960s. Following the Trafford Centre's opening in 1998, it was expected that the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered.<ref>{{cite news |title='Bright future' for town centre |work=Manchester Evening News |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/408906_bright_future_for_town_centre |date=25 September 2002|accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref> In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £7&nbsp;million refurbishment, a major part of the redevelopment of Sale's town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70% in rental income.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sale shops fetch £40m |work=Manchester Evening News |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/184679_sale_shops_fetch_40m_.html |last=Thame|first=David|date=22 November 2005|accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref> The town's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale's available office and commercial space was at an all-time low because of high demand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sale's sales boom |work=Manchester Evening News |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1024971_sales_sales_boom |date=20 November 2007|accessdate=23 August 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Sale Station - geograph.org.uk - 1749841.jpg|thumb|left|Originally built in wood, [[Sale Metrolink station|Sale station]] was rebuilt in brick in the late 1870s.]]
The first [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road in the area was the latter-day A56 Chester Road between Manchester and Crossford Bridge (on the border between Sale and Stretford). Turnpike trusts collected tolls from road users and used the proceeds to maintain the highway. There was a toll booth on the Sale side of Crossford Bridge. Another section of road between Altrincham and Crossford Bridge was turnpiked in 1765.<ref name="Nevell96-97">Nevell (1997), pp.&nbsp;96–97.</ref> The commencement of "swift [[Packet trade|packet]]" services on the newly opened Bridgewater Canal in 1776 made commuting from Sale into Manchester both practical and convenient, with boats travelling at a relatively swift {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;46.</ref> However the arrival in 1849 of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway<ref name="Nevell97"/> sounded a death-knell for both the canal packet services and turnpike trusts. Many trusts went into terminal decline, mirroring a national trend. By 1888 almost all roads and highways were the responsibility of the local authority.<ref name="Nevell96-97"/> Sale's railway station, originally named Sale Moor,<ref name="Nevell97"/> was renamed to Sale in 1856.<ref>Swain (1987), p.&nbsp;89.</ref> Three years later [[Brooklands Metrolink station|Brooklands railway station]] was opened, followed in 1931 by the opening of [[Dane Road Metrolink station|Dane Road railway station]] along with the electrification of the entire line.<ref name="Nevell100">Nevell (1997), p.&nbsp;100.</ref> The line was renovated in the early 1990s and is now part of the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].<ref name="Nevell100"/>

Following the completion of a tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901, the [[British Electric Traction|British Electric Traction Company]] applied to Parliament for an extension to Sale. The proposal was amended to continue the line further south, into Altrincham. The line through Sale was owned by Sale Urban District Council and leased to the [[Manchester Corporation]]. Services to Sale commenced in 1907. A branch along Northenden Road from the line to Sale Moor was created in 1912. Sale Moor's line had only a single track which in 1925 resulted in a head-on collision between two tramcars, injuring eight passengers.<ref name="Swain 119-120">Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;119–120.</ref> Bus services were first introduced to the area in the 1920s, but became more widespread in the 1930s.<ref>Swain (1987), pp.&nbsp;129–130.</ref> The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services, which from the 1930s went into decline. The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934, and throughout Sale in the 1940s.<ref name="Swain 119-120"/>

The [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] system connects Sale with other locations in Greater Manchester. Trams depart the town's three stations at least every 12&nbsp;minutes between 07:00 and 22:30 every day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tram Times |publisher=Metrolink |url=http://www.metrolink.co.uk/tramtimes/Pages/Sale.aspx}} Retrieved on 28 February 2014.</ref> The nearest main line railway station is [[Navigation Road station|Navigation Road]] in Altrincham, from where trains run to [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]], Stockport and [[Chester]].
