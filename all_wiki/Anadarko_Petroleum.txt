Anadarko claimed that BP was guilty of [[gross negligence]] or willful misconduct which led to the explosion.

====Settlement with BP====
[[File:Anadarko Petroleum in Gillette, Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|Anadarko Petroleum in [[Gillette, Wyoming]]]]

In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/exclusive-bp-bills-anadarko-272-million-in-gulf-spill-response | title=Exclusive: BP Bills Anadarko $272 Million In Gulf Spill Response | first=Rachel | last=Slajda | work=[[Talking Points Memo]] | date=June 30, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 ([[Macondo Prospect]]) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anadarko-and-bp-settle-deepwater-horizon-dispute-2011-10-17 | title=Anadarko and BP settle Deepwater Horizon dispute | work=[[MarketWatch]] | first=Daniel | last=Robert | date=October 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sdut-bp-anadarko-settle-gulf-disaster-claims-2011oct16-story.html | title=BP, Anadarko settle Gulf oil spill disaster claims | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[New York Daily News]] | date=October 17, 2011}}</ref>

====Fine under the Clean Water Act====
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Carl Barbier]] ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the [[Clean Water Act]] of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion]].<ref name=stemple>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-spill-anadarko/anadarko-ordered-to-pay-159-5-million-fine-for-2010-gulf-spill-idUSKBN0TK4YF20151201 | title=Anadarko ordered to pay $159.5 million fine for 2010 Gulf spill | first=Jonathan | last=Stemple | work=[[Reuters]] | date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."<ref name=stemple/> The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-bp-idUSKCN0P91PA20150629 | title=U.S. Supreme Court rejects BP, Anadarko over Deepwater Horizon spill penalties | first=Lawrence | last=Hurley | work=[[Reuters]] | date=June 29, 2015}}</ref>

===Tronox litigation and settlements===
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.<ref name=epatronox/>

The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased [[Kerr-McGee]] in 2005. As background, in 2006, Kerr-McGee spun off its [[Tronox]] subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.<ref name=tucker/> According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its oil and gas assets with Anadarko acquiring the remainder of Kerr-McGee.

====Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders====
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://investor.tronox.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-tronox-limited-regarding-tronox-vs-anadarko-settlement | title=Investors: Statement by Tronox Limited Regarding Tronox vs. Anadarko Settlement | publisher=[[Tronox]] | date=April 3, 2014}}</ref>

====Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice====

The [[United States Department of Justice]], on behalf of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], sued Anadarko for $25 billion.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-01/anadarko-fights-ailing-preacher-in-25-billion-epa-toxic-lawsuit | title=Anadarko Fights Ailing Preacher in $25 Billion EPA Toxic Lawsuit | first=Tiffany | last=Kary | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=May 1, 2012 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In April 2014, the parties reached a $5.15 billion settlement in what was at the time the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.<ref name=epatronox>{{cite web | url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-settlement-agreement-anadarko-fraud-case-results-billions-environmental | title=Case Summary: Settlement Agreement in Anadarko Fraud Case Results in Billions for Environmental Cleanups Across the Country | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=tucker/> Since then the total amount for the complete and comprehensive cleanup of the BP DeepWater Horizon incident, of which Anadarko was also connected (see above), has passed $60 billion.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
