'''Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Миха́йлович Брин}}; born August 21, 1973) is an American [[computer scientist]] and Internet entrepreneur. Together with [[Larry Page]], he co-founded [[Google]].

Brin immigrated to the United States with his family from the Soviet Union at the age of six. He earned his bachelor's degree at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in [[Stanford University]] to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a [[web search engine]]. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in [[Susan Wojcicki]]'s garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Larry Page and Sergey Brin paid $1,700 a month to rent the garage where Google was born |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cofounders-paid-1700-garage-rent-2015-9?r=UK&IR=T |work=Business Insider |access-date=October 17, 2018 |archive-date=October 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018043300/https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cofounders-paid-1700-garage-rent-2015-9?r=UK&IR=T |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.<ref name=Moment/> In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in [[Warsaw]], Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate.<ref name="Moment"/> They formally applied for their [[exit visa]] in September 1978, and as a result, his father was "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many [[refuseniks]]. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.<ref name="Moment"/>

The Brin family lived in [[Vienna]] and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the [[University of Maryland]] with help from [[Anatole Katok]]. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the [[HIAS|Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]]. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.<ref name="Moment"/><ref name=hias>{{cite news |last1=Strom |first1=Stephanie |title=Billionaire Aids Charity That Aided Him |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/25donate.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 24, 2009 |access-date=October 31, 2018 |archive-date=October 31, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031133141/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/25donate.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch [[Montessori School]] in [[Adelphi, Maryland]], but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the [[University of Maryland]], encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended [[Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Greenbelt, Maryland)|Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, Maryland]]. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the [[University of Maryland]], where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19.<ref name="resume">{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~sergey/resume.html|title=Resume|access-date=March 9, 2008|last=Brin|first=Sergey|date=January 7, 1997|archive-date=March 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322000250/http://infolab.stanford.edu/~sergey/resume.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Brin began his graduate study in computer science at [[Stanford University]] on a [[NSF-GRF|graduate fellowship]] from the [[National Science Foundation]]. In 1993, he interned at [[Wolfram Research]], the developers of [[Mathematica]].<ref name=resume/> {{As of|2008}}, he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=534604&symbol=GOOG|title=Sergey Brin: Executive Profile & Biography|access-date=March 9, 2008|work=[[Business Week]]|quote=He is currently on leave from the PhD program in computer science at Stanford university...|archive-date=March 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308131028/http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=534604&symbol=GOOG|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Search engine development ==
During an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met [[Larry Page]]. The two men seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends." Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was in extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its [[citations]] in other papers".<ref name="Economist">{{cite news|title=Enlightenment Man|work=[[The Economist]]|date=December 6, 2008|url=https://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12673407|access-date=February 20, 2020|archive-date=February 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054616/http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12673407|url-status=live}}</ref> Together, they authored a paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=S.|authorlink1=Sergey Brin|last2=Page|first2=L.|authorlink2=Larry Page|doi=10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X|title=The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine|journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems|volume=30|issue=1–7|pages=107–17|year=1998|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf|issn=0169-7552|citeseerx=10.1.1.115.5930|access-date=August 28, 2015|archive-date=September 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927004511/http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the [[PageRank|PageRank algorithm]], and realized that it could be used to build a [[search engine]] far superior to those existing at the time.<ref name="wiredbirth">{{cite journal|author1=John Battelle|title=The Birth of Google|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|journal=Wired|access-date=February 12, 2018|date=August 13, 2005|archive-date=November 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107160749/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|url-status=live}}</ref> The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the [[backlink]]s that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page.<ref name="Moschovitis">Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2005.</ref>[[File:Page+brin by origa.jpg|thumb|155x155px|Page and Brin]] Combining their ideas, they began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>

After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite journal|title=Enlightenment man|url=https://www.economist.com/node/12673407|journal=The Economist|access-date=February 2, 2015|date=December 4, 2008|archive-date=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404134801/https://www.economist.com/node/12673407|url-status=live}}</ref>

Page and Brin used the former's basic [[HTML]] programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional [[server (computing)|servers]] to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available on the Stanford Web site.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>

By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:
[[File:Websites interlinking to illustrate PageRank percents.png|thumb|179x179px|The mathematical website interlinking that the [[PageRank]] algorithm facilitates, illustrated by size-percentage correlation of the circles. The [[algorithm]] was named after Page himself.]]

::Total indexable HTML urls: 75.2306&nbsp;Million
::Total content downloaded: 207.022&nbsp;gigabytes

::BackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running [[Linux]]. The primary database is kept on a [[Sun Ultra series]] II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.

BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: "We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."<ref name="archive.wired.com">{{cite magazine|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?pg=2&topic=battelle&topic_set=|title=Wired 13.08: The Birth of Google|magazine=wired.com|date=August 2005|access-date=February 13, 2015|archive-date=July 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709201400/http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?pg=2&topic=battelle&topic_set=|url-status=live}}</ref> Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real."<ref name="economist.com" />

Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern printing:

{{Quote|In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts{{nsmdns}}originally replicated by hand{{nsmdns}}to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance{{nbsp}}...

''Information Technology''. October 1, 2009</ref>}}

The comparison was also noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg{{nbsp}}... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."<ref name=Vise>[[Vise, David]], and [[Malseed, Mark]]. ''[[The Google Story]]'', Delta Publ. (2006)</ref> Also, not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web," such as digitizing books and expanding health information.<ref name="economist.com" />

== Other interests ==

Brin is working on other, more personal projects that reach beyond Google. For example, he and Page are trying to help solve the world's energy and climate problems at Google's philanthropic arm, [[Google.org]], which invests in the [[alternative energy]] industry to find wider sources of [[renewable energy]]. The company acknowledges that its founders want "to solve really big problems using technology".<ref name="windpower">[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/10/google_a_vanguard_of_the.html "Cars and Wind: What's next for Google as it pushes beyond the Web?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219210737/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/10/google_a_vanguard_of_the.html |date=February 19, 2018 }} ''The Washington Post'', October 12, 2010</ref>
