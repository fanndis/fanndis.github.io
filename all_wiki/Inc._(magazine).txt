==Inc. 500 and Inc. 5000==
In its first issue in April 1979, ''Inc.'' published the [https://www.inc.com/magazine/19830501/8468.html Inc. 100], a list of the fastest-growing publicly held small companies. In 1983, the list expanded to 500 companies and shifted its focus to privately held companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/19831201/5891.html|title=Inside The Inc. 500|date=1983-12-01|website=Inc.com|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> Twenty-five years later, ''Inc.'' introduced the [https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html Inc. 5000], which ranks the country's 5,000 fastest-growing private companies. The Inc. 500 is now a special ranking of the top 10% of the Inc. 5000 list.<sup>[12]</sup> 

The Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth over a three-year period. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by the first week of the starting calendar year, and therefore able to show three full calendar years of sales. Additionally, they have to be U.S.-based, privately held, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31 of the last year measured. Revenue in the initial year must have been at least $100,000, and revenue in the prior year (the year before applying to the Inc. 5000) must have been at least $2 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list|title=Inc. 5000 List Application Guide|website=Inc.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref>
