A '''prescription drug''' (also '''prescription medication''' or '''prescription medicine''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] that legally requires a [[medical prescription]] to be dispensed. In contrast, [[over-the-counter drug]]s can be obtained without a prescription. The reason for this difference in [[controlled substance|substance control]] is the potential scope of misuse, from [[drug abuse]] to [[practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]] and without sufficient education. Different jurisdictions have different definitions of what constitutes a prescription drug.

"Rx" (℞) is often used as a short form for prescription drug in North America - a contraction of the Latin word "''recipe''" (an imperative form of "recipere") meaning "take".<ref>{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Gregory R.|title=Perseus 4.0 (Perseus Hopper)|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=recipere&la=la|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Prescription drugs are often dispensed together with a [[monograph]] (in Europe, a Patient Information Leaflet or PIL) that gives detailed information about the drug.

The use of prescription drugs has been increasing since the 1960s.

* Schedule 2 &ndash; Pharmacy Medicine
* Schedule 3 &ndash; Pharmacist-Only Medicine
* Schedule 4 &ndash; Prescription-Only Medicine/Prescription Animal Remedy
* Schedule 5 &ndash; Caution
* Schedule 6 &ndash; Poison
* Schedule 7 &ndash; Dangerous Poison
* Schedule 8 &ndash; Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal)
* Schedule 9 &ndash; Prohibited Substance
* Unscheduled Substances

As in developed countries, the person requiring a prescription drug attends the clinic of a qualified [[health practitioner]], such as a [[physician]], who may write the prescription for the required drug.

Many prescriptions issued by health practitioners in Australia are covered by the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]], a scheme that provides subsidised prescription drugs to residents of Australia to ensure that all Australians have affordable and reliable access to a wide range of necessary medicines. When purchasing a drug under the PBS, the consumer pays no more than the patient co-payment contribution, which, as of January 1, 2020, is [[Australian dollar|A$]]41.00 for general patients. Those covered by government entitlements (low-income earners, welfare recipients, Health Care Card holders, etc.) and or under the [[Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (RPBS) have a reduced co-payment, which is [[Australian dollar|A$]]6.60 in 2020. The co-payments are compulsory and can be discounted by pharmacies up to a maximum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.00 at cost to the pharmacy.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Medicines Act 1968]] and the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/1830/made Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997] contain regulations that cover the supply of sale, use, prescribing and production of medicines. There are three categories of medicine:<ref name="HPC ">{{cite web | url = http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/medicinesandprescribing/ | title = About Registration: Medicines and Prescribing | publisher = [[Health and Care Professions Council]] | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113121019/http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/medicinesandprescribing/ | archive-date = 13 January 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

* Pharmacy medicines ('''P'''), which may be sold by a pharmacist without a prescription
* General sales list ('''GSL''') medicines, which may be sold without a prescription in any shop

The possession of a prescription-only medicine without a prescription is legal unless it is covered by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].<ref name="Home Office Laws">{{cite web | url =http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/other-laws/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100419081707/http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/other-laws/ | title = Other drug laws | publisher = [[Home Office]] | archive-date = 19 April 2010 }}</ref>

A patient visits a [[physician|medical practitioner]] or [[dentist]], who may prescribe drugs and certain other medical items, such as blood glucose-testing equipment for [[diabetic]]s. Also, qualified and experienced nurses and pharmacists may be independent prescribers. Both may prescribe all POMs (including controlled drugs), but may not prescribe Schedule 1 controlled drugs, and 3 listed controlled drugs for the treatment of addiction; which is similar to doctors, who require a special license from the Home Office to prescribe schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 drugs have little or no medical benefit, hence their limitations on prescribing. [[District nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s have had limited prescribing rights since the mid-1990s; until then, prescriptions for dressings and simple medicines had to be signed by a doctor. Once issued, a prescription is taken by the patient to a pharmacy, which dispenses the medicine.

Most prescriptions are [[NHS prescription]]s, subject to a standard charge that is unrelated to what is dispensed. The [[NHS]] prescription fee was increased to £9.15 per item in [[National Health Service (England)|England]] on 1 April 2020;<ref>{{cite web|title=How Much is the NHS Prescription Charge?|url=https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/how-much-nhs-prescription-charge/ |publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=15 June 2020}}</ref> prescriptions are free of charge if prescribed and dispensed in [[NHS Scotland|Scotland]],<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7127997.stm | title = Staged end to prescription charge | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 5 December 2007}}</ref> [[NHS Wales|Wales]] and [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web|title=[NI] Prescription charges |url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/health-and-well-being/health-services/doctors-dentists-and-other-health-services/prescription-charges.htm |publisher=NI Direct |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829090132/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/health-and-well-being/health-services/doctors-dentists-and-other-health-services/prescription-charges.htm |archive-date=29 August 2011 }}</ref> and for some patients in England, such as inpatients, children, those over 60s or with certain medical conditions, and claimants of certain benefits.<ref name="NHS Choices help">{{cite web |title= NHS in England - help with health costs |url= http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx |website= nhs.uk |id= NHS Choices |publisher= NHS |accessdate= 15 February 2017}}</ref> The pharmacy charges the NHS the actual cost of the medicine, which may vary from a few pence to hundreds of pounds.<ref name="BMA">{{cite web

===United States===
{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}
In the United States, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] defines what substances require a prescription for them to be dispensed by a pharmacy. The federal government authorizes physicians (of any specialty), [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s and other [[advanced practice nurse]]s, veterinarians, dentists, and optometrists to prescribe any controlled substance. They are then issued unique [[Drug Enforcement Act]] numbers; many other mental and physical health technicians, including basic-level [[registered nurse]]s, [[medical assistant]]s, emergency medical technicians, most psychologists, and social workers, for example, do not have the authority to prescribe any legend drugs or controlled drugs.  Legend drugs are another name for drugs requiring a prescription.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) was enacted into law by the [[US Congress]] of the United States in 1970. It is the federal drug law that regulates manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of ''controlled'' substances.  The legislation classes these substances into five schedules, with varying qualifications for each schedule.  The schedules are designated [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)| schedule I]], [[List of Schedule II drugs (US)| schedule II]], [[List of Schedule III drugs (US)| schedule III]], [[List of Schedule IV drugs (US)| schedule IV]], and [[List of Schedule V drugs (US)| schedule V]].  Many drugs require a prescription, even though they are not a controlled substance.

The safety and the effectiveness of prescription drugs in the US are regulated by the 1987 [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]] (PDMA). The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is charged with implementing the law.

Misuse or abuse of prescription drugs can lead to adverse drug events, including those due to dangerous drug interactions.

The package insert for a prescription drug contains information about the intended effect of the drug and how it works in the body. It also contains information about side effects, how a patient should take the drug, and cautions for its use, including warnings about allergies.

As a general rule, ''[[over-the-counter drug]]s'' (OTC) are used to treat a condition that does not need care from a healthcare professional if have been proven to meet higher safety standards for self-medication by patients. Often, a lower strength of a drug will be approved for OTC use, but higher strengths require a prescription to be obtained; a notable case is [[ibuprofen]], which has been widely available as an OTC [[analgesic|pain killer]] since the mid-1980s, but it is available by prescription in doses up to four times the OTC dose for severe pain that is not adequately controlled by the OTC strength.

[[Herbal medicine|Herbal preparations]], [[amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]], and other [[food supplement]]s are regulated by the FDA as [[dietary supplements]]. Because specific health claims cannot be made, the consumer must make informed decisions when purchasing such products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=GC |last2=O'Connor |first2=AB |last3=Stafford |first3=RS |title=Enhancing prescription drug innovation and adoption |journal= Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=154 |pages=833–837 |year=2011 |pmid=21690598|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-154-12-201106210-00012|issue=12 |pmc=4049188}}</ref>

By law, American pharmacies operated by "membership clubs" such as [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]  must allow non-members to use their pharmacy services and may not charge more for these services than they charge as their members.<ref name="SavingAdvice">{{cite web|last1=Strain|first1=Jeffrey|title=Can I Use the Costco Pharmacy Without a Membership?|url=https://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2015/02/02/1032625_can-i-use-the-costco-pharmacy-without-a-membership.html|website=SavingAdvice.com|accessdate=28 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403090900/http://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2015/02/02/1032625_can-i-use-the-costco-pharmacy-without-a-membership.html|archive-date=3 April 2016|date=2 February 2015}}</ref>

Physicians may legally prescribe drugs for uses other than those specified in the FDA approval, known as [[off-label use]]. Drug companies, however, are prohibited from marketing their drugs for off-label uses.

Large US retailers that operate pharmacies and pharmacy chains use inexpensive generic drugs as a way to attract customers into stores. Several chains, including Walmart, Kroger (including subsidiaries such as Dillons), Target, and others, offer $4 monthly prescriptions on select generic drugs as a customer draw.<ref>{{cite web

==Expiration date==
The expiration date, required in several countries, specifies the date up to which the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. In the United States, expiration dates are determined by regulations established by the FDA.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124787.htm  | title = Questions and Answers on Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Guidance Practices, Level 2 Guidance - Records and Reports | publisher = [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] }}</ref>  The FDA advises consumers not to use products after their expiration dates.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm251658.htm | title = Expiration Dates Matter | publisher = [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] |date=14 July 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>

A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The results showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective far past their original expiration date. At least one drug worked 15 years after its expiration date.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Proceedings |journal=Baylor Univ. Medical CTR. |volume=13 |page=309}}</ref> Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions—notably [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]], [[insulin]], some liquid antibiotics; outdated [[tetracyclines]] can cause [[Fanconi syndrome]]—most expired drugs are probably effective.<ref>{{Cite news

The expiration date is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a medication. Drug expiration dates exist on most medication labels, including prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) and dietary (herbal) supplements. U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are required by law to place expiration dates on prescription products prior to marketing. For legal and liability reasons, manufacturers will not make recommendations about the stability of drugs past the original expiration date.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/article/drug-expiration-dates.html |title=Drug Expiration Dates - Are They Still Safe to Take? |publisher=drugs.com |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>

University of Minnesota. March 29, 2013.</ref>

Prescription drug prices including generic prices  are rising faster than the average rate of inflation. To subsidize prescription drug costs, some patients have decided to buy medicine online.<ref name="WZZM13">[http://www.wzzm13.com/news/investigations/13-on-your-side/the-canadian-remedy-how-to-save-hundreds-on-prescription-drugs/407942367]</ref>

Generics undergo strict scrutiny to meet the equal efficacy, safety, dosage, strength, stability, and quality of brand name drugs.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/questionsanswers/ucm100100.htm|title=Questions & Answers - Generic Drugs: Questions & Answers|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> Generics are developed after the brand name has already been established, and so generic drug approval in many aspects has a shortened approval process because it replicates the brand name drug.<ref name=":1" />

Brand name drugs cost more due to time, money, and resources that drug companies invest in<!--not a mistake--> in order to repeat research clinical trials that the FDA requires for the drug to remain in the market.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm|title=Generic Drugs - Generic Drug Facts|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> Because drug companies have to invest more in research costs to do this, brand name drug prices are much higher when sold to consumers.<ref name=":2" />

When the patent expires for a brand name drug, generic versions of that drug are produced by other companies and are sold for lower price. By switching to generic prescription drugs, patients can save significant amounts of money: e.g. one study by the [[FDA]] showed an example with more than 50% savings of a patient's overall costs of their prescription drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm134205.htm|title=Resources for You - Savings From Generic Drugs Purchased at Retail Pharmacies|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

== Drug cost containment strategies in the US ==
In the United States there are many resources available to patients to lower the costs of medication. These include copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. The [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]] is another example.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cost Sharing Out of Pocket Costs |url=https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/cost-sharing/out-of-pocket-costs/index.html |website=Medicaid.gov |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> 

Generic drug program lowers amount of money patient has to pay when picking up their prescription at the pharmacy and as their name implies they only cover generic drugs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Generic Drug Facts |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm |website=FDA |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>

Co-pay assistance programs are program to help patient lower costs of specialty medications: i.e. medications that are on restricted formulary, limited distribution, and with no generics available. These medications can include drugs for HIV, hepatitis C, and multiple sclerosis. Patient Assistance Program Center ([http://www.rxassist.org/providers/resources RxAssist]) has a list of foundations that provide co-pay assistance programs. It is important to note that co-pay assistance programs are for the under-insured patients. Patients without insurance are not eligible for this resource, however they may be eligible for patient assistance programs.

Patient assistance programs are funded by the manufacturer of the medication. Patients can often apply to these programs through the manufacturer's website. This type of assistance program is one of the few options for the uninsured patient.

The out of pocket costs for patients enrolled in co-pay assistance or patient assistance programs are $0. It is a major resource to help lower costs of medications – however, many providers and patients are not aware of the resources.
