'''''The Sound of Music''''' is a 1965 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Robert Wise]], and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], with [[Richard Haydn]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] of [[The Sound of Music|the same name]], composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] with lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The film's screenplay was written by [[Ernest Lehman]], adapted from the stage musical's [[Libretto|book]] by [[Lindsay and Crouse]]. Based on the 1949 memoir ''[[The Story of the Trapp Family Singers]]'' by [[Maria von Trapp]], the film is about a young Austrian [[postulant]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|title=Hollywood's Widower Fantasy|last=Yoffe|first=Emily|date=1993-08-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-02-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205185041/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|archive-date=February 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.

The film was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited [[roadshow theatrical release]]. Although critical response to the film was mixed, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks, and [[List of highest-grossing films#High-grossing films by year|the highest-grossing film of 1965]]. By November 1966, ''The Sound of Music'' had become the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all-time—surpassing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''—and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286,000,000.

''The Sound of Music'' received five [[38th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film also received two [[23rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], the Directors Guild of America Award for [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1965|Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) listed ''The Sound of Music'' as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|fifty-fifth]] greatest American movie of all time, and the [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|fourth]] greatest movie musical. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]] in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his first wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her.

While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.

Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming [[Salzburg Festival]] but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he does not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire [[waltz]] in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional ''[[Ländler]]'' folk dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.

While they are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the [[Third Reich]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at [[Bremerhaven]] to accept a commission in the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]]. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the ''Anschluss'', the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts]] waiting outside the villa. When questioned by ''[[Gauleiter]]'' Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.

Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.

''The Sound of Music'' story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers'', [[1949 in literature|published in 1949]] to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband [[Georg von Trapp|Georg]] in 1947.<ref name="hirsch-4">Hirsch 1993, p. 4.</ref> Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told.<ref name="hirsch-4"/> In 1956, German producer [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] purchased the film rights for $9,000 ({{Inflation|US|9000|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), hired [[George Hurdalek]] and [[Herbert Reinecker]] to write the screenplay, and [[Franz Grothe]] to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional [[Folk song|Austrian folk songs]].<ref name="hirsch-6">Hirsch 1993, p. 6.</ref> ''[[The Trapp Family]]'' was released in [[West Germany]] on October 9, 1956 and became a major success.<ref name="hirsch-4"/> Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a [[sequel]], ''[[The Trapp Family in America]]'', and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years.<ref name="hirsch-4"/> Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America.<ref name="hirsch-4"/>

==Production==
For the film, Richard Rodgers added two new songs, "I Have Confidence" and "Something Good", for which he wrote the lyrics as well as the music (Hammerstein having died in August 1960), while three of the original stage songs were omitted,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-salzburg.net/travel/soundofmusic_songlist.htm|title="The Sound of Music" Songlist : All Songs : Visit Salzburg|website=www.visit-salzburg.net|access-date=May 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020225350/http://www.visit-salzburg.net/travel/soundofmusic_songlist.htm|archive-date=October 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "How Can Love Survive", "No Way To Stop It" and "An Ordinary Couple". Arranger and conductor [[Irwin Kostal]] prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage prior to the start of filming, and later adapted instrumental underscore passages based on the songs. Choreographers [[Marc Breaux]] and [[Dee Dee Wood]], who had worked with Andrews on ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', worked out all new choreography sequences that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. ''The Sound of Music'' was filmed from March 26 through September 1, 1964, with external scenes shot on location in Salzburg, Austria, and the surrounding region, and interior scenes filmed at the [[20th Century Fox]] studios in [[California]].

===Screenplay and pre-production===
[[File:Robert wise 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robert Wise smiling|Robert Wise, 1990]]
In December 1962, 20th Century Fox president [[Richard D. Zanuck]] hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical.<ref name="hirsch-11">Hirsch 1993, p. 11.</ref> Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood, and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps.<ref name="hirsch-23-25">Hirsch 1993, pp. 23–25.</ref> The "Do-Re-Mi" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time.<ref name="hirsch-23-25"/> Lehman also eliminated two songs, "How Can Love Survive?" and "[[No Way to Stop It]]", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max.<ref name="hirsch-23-25"/> In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-dubbed version of the two German films. Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material.<ref name="hirsch-28">Hirsch 1993, p. 28.</ref> While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was [[Robert Wise]], with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]''.<ref name="hirsch-13">Hirsch 1993, p. 13.</ref> Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including [[Stanley Donen]], [[Vincent J. Donehue]], [[George Roy Hill]], and [[Gene Kelly]].<ref name="baer-113">Baer 2008, p. 113.</ref>

In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, [[William Wyler]], to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film.<ref name="hirsch-13-14">Hirsch 1993, pp. 13–14.</ref> After hiring musical supervisor [[Roger Edens]], Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations.<ref name="hirsch-15">Hirsch 1993, p. 15.</ref> In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations—an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences.<ref name="hirsch-31">Hirsch 1993, p. 31.</ref> During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project, and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible.<ref name="hirsch-16">Hirsch 1993, p. 16.</ref> Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963 and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes.<ref name="hirsch-16"/> At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director.<ref name="hirsch-16"/> Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]''. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.<ref name="hirsch-16"/>

Meanwhile, Wise, whose film ''The Sand Pebbles'' had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film.<ref name="hirsch-17">Hirsch 1993, p. 17.</ref> Wise joined the picture in October 1963,<ref name="hirsch-34">Hirsch 1993, p. 34.</ref> and flew to Salzburg with associate producer [[Saul Chaplin]] and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified.<ref name="hirsch-75-78">Hirsch 1993, p. 75, 78.</ref> When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach—mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical.<ref name="hirsch-34"/> He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]],'' whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's.<ref name="hirsch-34"/> Other changes included replacing "An Ordinary Couple" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey—Rodgers provided "Something Good" and "I Have Confidence" especially for the film.<ref name="hirsch-34-37">Hirsch 1993, pp. 34–37.</ref> Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963,<ref name="hirsch-38">Hirsch 1993, p. 38.</ref> but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped transform a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge.<ref name="hirsch-38-42">Hirsch 1993, pp. 38–42.</ref> Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964.<ref name="hirsch-42">Hirsch 1993, p. 42.</ref>

===Casting and rehearsals===
[[File:The Sound of Music Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews|Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews on location in Salzburg, 1964]]
Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews.<ref name="hirsch-49">Hirsch 1993, p. 49.</ref> When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, [[Grace Kelly]], and [[Shirley Jones]].<ref name="hirsch-50">Hirsch 1993, p. 50.</ref> Wise and Lehman went to [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney Studios]] to view footage from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, "Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!"<ref name="hirsch-49"/> Andrews had some reservations—mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version—but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in ''The Sound of Music'' and one other film for $225,000 ({{Inflation|US|225000|1964|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).<ref name="hirsch-51">Hirsch 1993, p. 51.</ref> Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Yul Brynner]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Richard Burton]].<ref name="hirsch-51-53">Hirsch 1993, pp. 51–53.</ref> Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character.<ref name="hirsch-53-54">Hirsch 1993, pp. 53–54.</ref>

Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered [[Victor Borge]], [[Noël Coward]], and [[Hal Holbrook]] among others before deciding on Richard Haydn.<ref name="hirsch-53-54"/> For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder, Wise looked for a "name" actress—Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences—and decided on Eleanor Parker.<ref name="hirsch-54-55">Hirsch 1993, pp. 54–55.</ref> The casting of the children characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England.<ref name="hirsch-61">Hirsch 1993, p. 61.</ref> Some of the child-actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included [[Mia Farrow]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Shelley Fabares]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Kurt Russell]], and [[The Osmonds]].<ref name="hirsch-61-63">Hirsch 1993, pp. 61–63.</ref> Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. [[Charmian Carr]], however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress.<ref name="hirsch-66-67">Hirsch 1993, pp. 66–67.</ref> After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, "She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately."<ref name="hirsch-66-67"/> The last person to be cast was [[Daniel Truhitte]] in the role of Rolfe.<ref name="hirsch-66-67"/>

Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964.<ref name="hirsch-92">Hirsch 1993, p. 92.</ref> The husband-and-wife team of [[Marc Breaux]] and [[Dee Dee Wood]], who had worked with Andrews on ''Mary Poppins'', worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano—the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract.<ref name="hirsch-92-93">Hirsch 1993, pp. 92–93.</ref> The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive.<ref name="hirsch-93">Hirsch 1993, p. 93.</ref> Breaux and Wood worked out all new choreography better suited for film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings.<ref name="hirsch-93"/> They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for "The Lonely Goatherd".<ref name="hirsch-95">Hirsch 1993, p. 95.</ref> The choreography for the ''Ländler'' strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance.<ref name="hirsch-93"/> The musical arranger [[Irwin Kostal]] prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage prior to the start of filming.<ref name="hirsch-100-101">Hirsch 1993, pp. 100–101.</ref> In her book, ''The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie'', Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene where the child-actors actually sing is when they sing "The Sound of Music" on their own after Maria leaves.<ref name="hirsch-103">Hirsch 1993, p. 103.</ref> Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound, they did not replace them as singers.<ref>Carr, Charmian, pp.33-34</ref> The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer.<ref name="hirsch-101-104">Hirsch 1993, pp. 101–104.</ref>

===Marketing===
Robert Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film.<ref name="hirsch-188">Hirsch 1993, p. 188.</ref> After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line "The Happiest Sound in All the World", which would appear on promotional material and artwork.<ref name="hirsch-188"/> Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by [[Howard Terpning]] of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background.<ref name="hirsch-189">Hirsch 1993, p. 189.</ref><ref name="latimes-boehm"/>{{refn|Terpning also created the poster artwork for ''Lawrence of Arabia'', ''Doctor Zhivago'', ''The Sand Pebbles'', ''The Guns of Navarone'', and the 1967 theatrical re-release of ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name="latimes-boehm"/> He is also known for his numerous magazine covers and his paintings of the American West and the Plains Indians.<ref name="latimes-boehm"/>|group=Note}} In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers ''Daily Variety'', ''Weekly Variety'', and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' to attract future exhibitor interest in the project.<ref name="hirsch-188"/> The studio intended the film to have an initial [[roadshow theatrical release]] in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.<ref name="hirsch-175"/> The roadshow concept involved two showings a day with reserved seating and an intermission similar to Broadway musicals.<ref name="hirsch-175"/> Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities.<ref name="hirsch-189"/> During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century Fox organized press junkets for America journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members.<ref name="hirsch-189"/>

Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the film as "three hours of visual and vocal brilliance",<ref name="hirsch-175"/> and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast".<ref name="hirsch-175"/> The "wildly mixed film reviews" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical''.<ref>Hischak (2008), p. 697.</ref> After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, ''The Sound of Music'' opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events.<ref name="hirsch-175"/> After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country, and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965.<ref name="hirsch-176">Hirsch 1993, p. 176.</ref> The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.<ref name="hirsch-176"/>

==Television and home media==
The first American television transmission of ''The Sound of Music'' was on February 29, 1976 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which paid $15 million for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films ever shown on television to that point<ref name="hirsch-209">Hirsch 1993, p. 209.</ref> with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref> The movie was not shown again until [[NBC]] acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979.<ref name="time"/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 6, 1978|page=6|title=20th Gets Last 'Sound' Money Before TV Shot}}</ref> NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years.<ref name="hirsch-209"/> During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot—approximately 140 minutes without commercials. The thirty minutes edited out of the original film included portions of the "Morning Hymn and Alleluia" sung by the nuns, part of the dialogue between Mother Abbess and Maria in the abbey, part of Liesl and Rolfe's dialogue preceding "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", Liesl's verse of "Edelweiss" sung with the Captain, the Captain and Baroness waltzing at the party, and minor dialogue cuts within existing scenes.

The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a [[letterbox]] format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC, generally during Christmas week, and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a [[high definition television|high definition]] version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''—a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month.<ref name=deadline-ratings/>

In the [[United Kingdom]], the film rights were acquired by the [[BBC]], who paid a corporation record $4.1 million,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=September 28, 1978|page=4|title=Stanfill Says Fox' 3d-Qtr. Net Will Dip But Still Be Excellent|last=Meyer|first=Frank}}</ref> and it was first aired on [[BBC One]] on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas time]]. As the BBC channels in Britain are [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|not funded by advertising]] there was no need to cut scenes to fit within a timeslot and the film was screened in the full 174-minute version without breaks.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC One – The Sound of Music|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007bgf8|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=2 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105003616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007bgf8|archive-date=January 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The film has been released on [[VHS]], [[LaserDisc]], and [[DVD]] numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000 to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release.<ref name="allmovie-tsom-releases"/> The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations.<ref name="allmovie-tsom-releases"/> A 40th anniversary DVD, with "making of" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005.<ref name="allmovie-tsom-releases"/> The film made its debut issue on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary.<ref name="allmovie-tsom-releases"/><ref name="br-calogne"/><ref name="htt-smotroff"/> For the [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release, the original 70&nbsp;mm negatives were rescanned at [[Ultra-high-definition television|8K resolution]], then restored and remastered at [[4K resolution]] for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, Fox Home Entertainment released ''The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition''—a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, ''The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg''.<ref name="allmovie-tsom-releases"/><ref name="post-movie"/> A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled ''The Untold Story of the Sound of Music'' featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by [[Diane Sawyer]].<ref name="abc-2020-sawyer"/>

In part to the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]], the film was made available on the [[Disney+]] streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913417/disney-plus-launch-lineup-marvel-star-wars-pixar-tv-shows-movies-simpsons-national-geographic Disney+ launch lineup: every movie and TV show available to stream in the US on day one]</ref>

''The Sound of Music'' film, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family that is not completely accurate. The film was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] television production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'', and the stage production of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' (coincidentally all starring [[Julie Andrews]]). Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] was inspired by the opening of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and saw the musical as "a fairy tale that's almost real".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.la-screenwriter.com/2015/04/16/the-sound-of-music-and-the-thrill-of-screenwriting/ |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=The Sound of Music and the Thrill of Screenwriting|website=LA-Screenwriter.com|language=en-US|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> The film incorporated many "fairy tale" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of [[Salzburg]]), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both [[Guinevere]] and Cinderella.<ref name="Flinn">Flinn 2015</ref>{{page number needed|date=December 2018}}

In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used [[artistic license]] to convey the essence and meaning of their story. [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]] was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the [[Anschluss]], and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called [[Aigen (Salzburg city district)|Aigen]]. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstraße 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in [[Zell Am See]] and [[Klosterneuburg]] after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in [[Pula|Pola]] following [[World War I]]. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife in 1922.<ref name="archives"/> In the film, Georg is referred to as "[[Captain]]", but his actual family title was "[[Ritter]]" (German for "knight"), a hereditary knighthood the equivalent of which in the United Kingdom is a baronetcy. Austrian nobility, moreover, was legally abolished in 1919 and the [[nobiliary particle]] ''von'' was proscribed after World War I, so he was legally "Georg Trapp". Both the title and the prepositional nobiliary particle ''von'', however, continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of courtesy.<ref name="archives"/>

Georg was offered a position in the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', but this occurred before the Anschluss. He was heavily courted by the Nazis because he had extensive experience with submarines, and Germany was looking to expand its fleet of [[U-boats]]. With his family in desperate financial straits, and having no marketable skills other than his training as a naval officer, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. Rather than threaten arrest, the Nazis actually continued to woo him.<ref name="archives"/> In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria von Trapp (called "Louisa" in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, "[She] had a terrible temper ... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice."<ref name="tfl-family"/>

[[Maria von Trapp|Maria Augusta Kutschera]] had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young [[Maria Franziska von Trapp|Maria Franziska]] ("Louisa" in the movie), who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children.<ref name="archives"/> Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. "I really and truly was not in love," Maria wrote in her memoir, "I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after." They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria later acknowledged that she grew to love Georg over time and enjoyed a happy marriage.<ref name="archives"/>

The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the [[Great Depression|worldwide depression of the early 1930s]], when the Austrian national bank folded.<ref name="archives"/> In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment.<ref name="hirsch-201-202">Hirsch 1993, pp. 201–202.</ref> In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria–Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of [[Berchtesgaden]], within sight of Adolf Hitler's [[Kehlsteinhaus]] Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. Although Georg was an ethnic German-Austrian, he was also an Italian citizen, having been born in the [[Dalmatia]]n city of [[Zadar]], which at that time was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and later fell into Italian territory after World War I. From Italy, they traveled to London and ultimately the United States.<ref name="archives"/>

The character Max Detweiler, the scheming family music director, is fictional. The von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend [[Franz Wasner]], was their musical director for over twenty years and accompanied them when they left Austria.<ref name="archives"/> The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as "Louisa", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.<ref name="archives"/> The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers.<ref name="archives"/> Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a "documentary or realistic movie" about her family, and that he would make the film with "complete dramatic freedom" in order to produce a "fine and moving film", one they could all be proud of.<ref>Hirsch 1993, p. 40.</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1966, [[American Express]] created the first ''Sound of Music'' guided tour in Salzburg.<ref name="maslon-172">Maslon 2015, p. 172.</ref> Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading ''Sound of Music'' bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region.<ref name="maslon-172"/> The first ''Sing-along Sound of Music'' revival screening was at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999,<ref>[http://www.singalonga.net/sound-of-music/about/ Singalonga.net]</ref> leading to a successful run at the [[Prince Charles Cinema]] which is ongoing as of 2018.<ref name=SingalongLondon/><ref name="nytimes-singalong"/> During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen.<ref name="nytimes-singalong"/> In July 2000, ''Sing-along Sound of Music'' shows opened in Boston and Austin, Texas.<ref name="nytimes-singalong"/> Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen.<ref name="nytimes-singalong"/> The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl).<ref name="playbill"/> ''Sing-along Sound of Music'' screenings have since become an international phenomenon.<ref>Maslon 2015, pp. 157–158.</ref>

In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="santopietro-253"/> The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''The Sound of Music'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|website=Oscars.org|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=the+sound+of+music&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|access-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813152344/http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=the+sound+of+music&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|archive-date=August 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
