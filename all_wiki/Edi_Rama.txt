'''Edi Rama''' (born '''Edvin Rama''', 4 July 1964) is an [[Albanian people|Albanian]] politician, painter, writer, publicist, former pedagogue, former basketball player,<ref>{{cite web|title=Edi Rama PRIME MINISTER|url=http://www.kryeministria.al/en/government/prime-minister-cabinet/rama-edi|website=kryeministria.al|language=en}}</ref> who is currently serving as the 33rd<ref>[[Prime Minister of Albania|prime minister of Albania]]</ref> [[Prime Minister of Albania|prime minister of Albania]] (since 13 September 2013)  and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] (since 21 January 2019). Rama has also been the chairman of the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] since 2005.

Before his election as Prime Minister, Rama held a number of other positions. He was appointed [[Ministry of Culture (Albania)|Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports]] in 1998, a position that he held until 2000.

He was first elected [[Mayor of Tirana]] in 2000, and was reelected in 2003 and 2007. In 2013, the coalition of center-left parties led by Edi Rama won the [[2013 Albanian parliamentary election|2013 parliamentary election]], defeating the center-right coalition of [[Democratic Party of Albania]]'s incumbent Prime Minister, [[Sali Berisha]].  He was elected as prime minister for a second term in the 2017 election. Rama is one of the initiators of [[Mini Schengen Zone]], an economic zone of the Western Balkans countries intended to guarantee “[[European Single Market|four freedoms]]”.

== Early life and career ==
Born as Edvin Rama on 4 July 1964 in [[Tirana]], Albania, he is the first of two children of Kristaq and Aneta Rama. His father was [[Kristaq Rama]] (1932-1998), a well-known sculptor born in [[Durrës]] who was the creator of numerous [[statue]]s of Albania's communist dictator [[Enver Hoxha]]. His great grandfather, also named Kristaq Rama was an intellectual who [[Albanian National Awakening|advocated for Albanian independence and schools]] and he originated from [[Berat]] before later relocating to Durrës.<ref name="Telegrafiedir"/> Other ancestors from his paternal side come from the southeastern village of [[Dardhë]], near [[Korçë]].<ref>Balkan Insight. "Rich Albanians Breathe New Life into Forgotten Village”. 4 September 2014. http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/rich-albanians-breathe-new-life-into-forgotten-village</ref> His mother, Aneta Rama (née Koleka) (1938-2020), was a graduate of medicine from the southwestern village of [[Vuno]],<ref>{{cite web|author=30, 10 April:13 |url=http://www.gazetadita.al/edi-rama-do-jete-deputet-i-vlores/ |title=Edi Rama do jetë deputet i Vlorës &#124; Gazeta Dita |publisher=Gazetadita.al |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}</ref> [[Vlorë County|Vlorë]], sister of [[Spiro Koleka]] a member of the [[Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania|Politburo]] during [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]]. Rama states that the Koleka family, going back some centuries is of northern [[Mirditë District|Mirditor]] origin, and that the surname was derived from ''Kol Leka''.<ref name=Spie>{{cite news|title=Rama: 23 qershori s'është ndeshje futbolli, me votën luani me jetën tuaj|url=http://www.lajmi.info/rama-23-qershori-seshte-ndeshje-futbolli-me-voten-luani-me-jeten-tuaj/|publisher=Lajmi|quote=Po të jetë puna kështu, stërgjyshërit e mamasë time kanë zbritur nga Mirdita.

Rama started painting early in his childhood. During his teenage years, his talent was noticed by two influential Albanian painters of the time, Edi Hila and Danish Jukniu.<ref name="panorama1">{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/edi-rama-rrefen-vitet-ne-paris-dhe-debatet-me-babane-merita-e-tij-qe-u-bera-njeri-i-lire/|title=Edi Rama rrëfen vitet në Paris dhe debatet me babanë: Merita e tij që u bëra njeri i lirë|date=2016-07-09|publisher=Panorama.com.al|accessdate=2017-04-30}}</ref> They encouraged Rama to further develop his painting skills in a professional context.<ref name="panorama1" />  He attended and graduated from the [[Jordan Misja Artistic Lyceum]], an art school in Tirana.<ref name="NOA Lajme">{{cite news |last1=NOA Lajme |title=Follow Inaugurohet Liceu Artistik, Rama: "I dënuar" të jetë ekselent |date=26 October 2016|language=sq}}</ref> As a teenager, Rama was involved in sports as a professional basketball player for [[BC Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]].

After graduating, Rama started working as an instructor at the Academy of Arts. During this time, he organized several open student meetings, during which the communist government was publicly criticized. Essays from those meetings were collected in the book ''Refleksione'', which Rama published together with publicist [[Ardian Klosi]] in 1992.

Shortly before the [[fall of communism in Albania]], Rama attempted several times to get involved with the incipient fight for democracy. He tried to influence student protests and become part of the newly created Democratic Party of Albania, but soon left after a quarrel over ideological matters with [[Sali Berisha]].<ref>http://shekulli.com.al/p.php?id=36632</ref>

In 1994, Rama ran away to [[France]], and tried to begin a career as a painter. He and his former student, [[Anri Sala]], exhibited their works in several art galleries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In 27 November 2002, he changed his first name by shortening it to Edi Rama.<ref>{{Cite web|date=21 April 2016|title=Formulari i vetëdeklarimit i Edi Ramës|trans-title=Edi Rama's self-declaration form|url=http://www.cec.org.al/Portals/0/Documents/CEC%202013/formularet/deputete/61%20-%20edi%20rama.pdf|website=www.cec.org.al|page=1}}</ref>

{{Edi Rama series}}

== Political career ==
During one of his trips back to [[Albania]] in January 1997, Rama suffered a physical assault. While perpetrators were never found, there were concerns over the involvement of the [[SHISH|State Secret Service]] given Rama's outspoken criticism towards the Albanian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sot.com.al/politike/fatos-klosi-e-v%C3%ABrteta-e-rrahjes-s%C3%AB-ram%C3%ABs-nga-shikasit-me-xhupa-t%C3%AB-zinj-t%C3%AB-gazidedes-pse-nuk|title=Fatos Klosi: E vërteta e rrahjes së Ramës nga shikasit me xhupa të zinj të Gazidedes, pse nuk e ndëshkuam Berishën dhe kush i urdhëronte rrahjet|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>

In 1998, while in Albania for the funeral of his father, Rama was offered a cabinet position by the then-[[Prime Minister of Albania]] [[Fatos Nano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shqiptarja.com/news.php?IDNotizia=199423 |title='Rrëfehet' Edi Rama: Telefonata që më bëri Ministër të Kulturës |publisher=Shqiptarja.com |date=2017-04-22 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}</ref> Later that year he was appointed [[Ministry of Culture (Albania)|Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports]].

As a Minister, Rama immediately became known for his extravagance in a variety of ways, including his unique colorful dressing style. His innovative cultural projects, coupled with his strange clothing and rebellious political style, helped him reach a great level of support especially among young people.

=== Mayor of Tirana (2000–11) ===
{{See also|Mayor of Tirana}}

[[File:Tirana - Colourful houses at Lana.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Colorful buildings in Tirana.]]

In October 2000, the Socialist Party of Albania endorsed Edi Rama in the election for Mayor of Tirana. The Democratic Party nominee was [[Besnik Mustafaj]] an Albanian writer and diplomat. Rama won 57% of the vote and was sworn-in as mayor. After taking office, he undertook a radical campaign of bulldozing hundreds of illegal constructions and restoring many areas near [[Tirana]]'s center and [[Lana River]] into their initial form.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2069799.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – The mayor transforming Tirana|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 June 2017|date=27 June 2002}}</ref>

Rama earned international recognition by repainting the facades of many soviet-style, demolishing buildings in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observers.france24.com/en/20100428-artist-mayor-sees-crumbling-capital-turned-painters-canvas-albania-tirana-edi-rama|title=Tirana's artist mayor turns crumbling capital into painters' canvas|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The repainting gave the city a unique style, turning it into a tourist attraction. Rama was awarded the inaugural [[World Mayor]] Prize in 2004.<ref name="worldmayor.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmayor.com/worldmayor_2004/results_2004.html|title=World Mayor: The winners of the 2004 contest|website=www.worldmayor.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The award committee, motivated their decision stating that "''Edi Rama is the man who changed a whole city. Now there is a new Tirana, colored, happy, with a new and improved infrastructure and cultural life''".<ref name="worldmayor.com"/>

As mayor he compiled the ''Tirana City Master Plan''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/project/2008/10291/mvrdv-architects/tirana-rocks-masterplan-in-tirana.html|title=WAN:: Tirana Rocks masterplan by MVRDV Architects in Tirana, Albania|website=www.worldarchitecturenews.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> including the [[Skanderbeg Square]] project. He planted thousands of new trees, making Tirana a much more environment-friendly city. Rama also expanded the existing roads and paved new ones, improving mobility. 
According to a UNDP report<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/263/hdr_2002_en_complete.pdf</ref> Rama played a critical role in the modernization of the local government, empowering municipalities and giving them, for the first time real power to impact the life of their communities.

Rama was reelected as [[Mayor of Tirana]] by defeating [[Democratic Party of Albania]] candidates Spartak Ngjela, a former attorney, in 2003 and [[Sokol Olldashi]] in 2007.

In 2011, Rama decided to run for a fourth term in office. His opponent, [[Lulzim Basha]] was a member of Prime Minister Berisha's cabinet. Rama's reelection bid failed after a court ruling decided hundreds of ballots mistakenly cast in the wrong ballot boxes were valid. The initial count saw Rama ahead by 10 votes. With all ballots counted Lulzim Basha won the race by 81 votes. Edi Rama appealed the court's decision at the Electoral College and demanded the reinstatement of the initial tally. Rama's appeals were rejected and [[Lulzim Basha]] was sworn in as the new Mayor of Tirana. Rama and the Socialist Party criticized the judges involved in the court ruling, severely eroding public's trust in Albanian institutions.

=== Leader of the opposition (2005–13) ===

Having previously run as an independent in 2000, Edi Rama only registered as a [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist]] in 2003. Later that year he announced a bid for the chairmanship of the Party. He and a [[Rexhep Meidani]], a former [[President of Albania|President]] ran against the incumbent, [[Fatos Nano]]. Rama's bid failed to gain sufficient support from the Assembly delegates. He received 41 votes, Rexhep Meidani received 61, while Fatos Nano was reelected with 456 votes.<ref name="illyriapress.com">{{Cite web|url=http://illyriapress.com/si-u-ngjit-edi-rama-ne-krye-te-partise-socialiste/|title=Si u ngjit Edi Rama në krye të Partisë Socialiste {{!}} ILLYRIA|website=illyriapress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>

After the center-left coalition lost in the [[2005 Albanian parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]], Fatos Nano resigned as Chairman of the Socialist Party. In the subsequent election for the chairmanship of the Party, Edi Rama defeated Rexhep Meidani 297 to 151 and became the Chairman of the Socialist Party.<ref name="illyriapress.com"/> Capitalizing on Rama's popularity as a mayor, the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] regained some of its appeal. Rama replaced many of Party's influential leaders with younger loyalists. In his earlier attempts to regain control in the [[Parliament of Albania|Parliament]], he tried to frame himself as a political outsider. Inspired by the progressive policies of [[Tony Blair]]'s "New Labour" and [[Anthony Giddens]] "Third Way", his political platform called for a "third direction beyond the traditional right and left".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arkivi2.peshkupauje.com/2009/04/rruga-e-pare-e-dyte-pastaj-rruga-e-trete.html|title=Rruga e Parë, e Dytë, pastaj Rruga e Tretë – Peshku pa ujë|website=arkivi2.peshkupauje.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>

As the minority leader, Rama threw his support behind a set of constitutional amendments introduced in the Parliament during summer 2008. These amendments changed Albania's election law from a [[majoritarian representation]] with a proportional adjustment into a [[party-list proportional representation]] as well as curtailed Presidential powers. Despite criticism and protests from President [[Bamir Topi]] and MPs from [[Socialist Movement for Integration|the Socialist Movement for Integration]] and other smaller political parties, the amendments were passed in the Parliament with a [[Supermajority|super-majority]].

Rama's reelection as Mayor in 2007 was greatly helped by the Socialist Movement for Integration's endorsement of his candidacy. Seeing the 2008 constitutional amendments voted by Rama's SPA as a serious threat to their existence in Albanian politics, [[Ilir Meta]] and the SMI did not join Rama in a pre-electoral coalition for the [[2009 Albanian parliamentary election|2009 parliamentary election]]. The Socialist Party led by Edi Rama were only able to win 66 seats in the Parliament. Incumbent Prime Minister Berisha's Democratic Party won 70 seats, while the remaining 4 seats went to Ilir Meta's Socialist Movement for Integration. Demands by Edi Rama and the Socialists for a recount in the district of [[Fier]] were rejected by courts amidst criticism about the judges impartiality. Eventually, all four newly elected SMI members of the parliament voted support for Prime Minister Berisha's Democrats.

The 2009 elections narrow defeat prompted Rama to continue his mandate as Chairman of the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party opted for a hardcore dispute of the newly elected government by boycotting parliamentary debates for months and staging a [[hunger strike]] to prompt for domestic and foreign attention to the situation. The heated political debate surrounding the 2009 election has been pointed out as one reason for Albania's failed bid at gaining official [[EU candidate countries|candidate status]] in accession talks with the EU.<ref>Jovanovska, Svetlana. (8 May 2012) [http://euobserver.com/887/31237 / Albania is refused EU candidate status]. Euobserver. Retrieved on 13 May 2012.</ref>

In January 2011, a recorded videotape showed Deputy Prime Minister [[Ilir Meta]] negotiating informal [[Pay to play|pay-to-play]] fees with Dritan Prifti, Minister for the Economy, Commerce and Energy. On 21 January 2011, clashes broke out between police and protesters in an [[2011 Albanian opposition demonstrations|anti-government rally in front of the Government building]] in Tirana. Four people were shot dead from government special forces.<ref>[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/breakingnews/2011/01/21/nb-00 Breaking News: Protesters killed in Tirana rally].

=== Prime Minister of Albania (2013–present) ===
In 2013, the Socialist Party of Edi Rama led the coalition of center-left parties (that included his former opponents, the SMI) into a landslide victory in the [[2013 Albanian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] defeating the center-right coalition led by Prime Minister [[Sali Berisha]]. His platform, nicknamed "Renaissance"<ref>
http://ps.al/new/programi/rimekembje-e- ekonomise/</ref> was based on four pillars: European integration, economic revitalization, restoration of the public order and democratization of the state institutions. Since September 2013, Rama has been serving as the [[Prime Minister of Albania]].

Since 15 September 2013, Rama is serving as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|33rd]] [[Prime Minister of Albania]]. During the electoral campaign, Rama stated that the return of public order was his number one priority. In 2013, the [[Albanian Police]] was able to cover actively only 55% of the territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punetebrendshme.gov.al/al/te-rejat/lajme/rriten-pagat-per-93-te-punonjesve-te-policise-se-shtetit&page=48|title=Rriten pagat për 93 % të punonjësve të Policisë së Shtetit|website=www.punetebrendshme.gov.al|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The Government invested heavily in modernizing, training, and improving financial benefits of the police force. The police earned international acclaim when in 2014 undertook a highly successful operation on [[Lazarat]], a remote village in the south of the country, known for the production of narcotics.<ref>https://www.ata.gov.al/en/interpol-praises-state-police-operation-in-lazarat/</ref>

Rama has been committed to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania|judicial system]] in [[Albania]], which was one of the most corrupted and ineffective judicial systems in Europe at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infocip.org/en/?p=1199|title="The whole judicial system in Albania is corrupt".

Another key reform, was the reform in the energy sector, left in the brink of bankruptcy from a previous failed privatization effort. His government successfully enforced the payment of billions of unpaid bills and heavily invested in the modernization of the obsolete power distribution network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/02/27/NA270217-Albania-successfully-concludes-3-year-support-program|title=Albania Successfully Concludes Three-Year IMF-Supported Program|website=www.imf.org|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> 
Economic policies have also been successful.<ref>https://www.ata.gov.al/en/world-bank-report-albania-records-highest-growth-rate-in-region/</ref> The economic growth, from 0.5% in 2013, accelerated to 3.5% in 2016 and is expected to exceed 4% during 2017.

Furthermore, with 11.5% (2019) [[Albania]] has the 5th lowest [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment rate]] in the [[Balkans]].

Other important reforms include the administrative reform, the social welfare and pension system reform, and the reform in higher education. 
Internationally, Rama is pursuing a historical reconciliation [[Albania - Serbia relations|policy]] between [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]] and his visit in [[Belgrade]], in 2014 was the first visit of an [[Prime Minister of Albania|Albanian Prime Minister]] in Serbia in over 70 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/164212/First+Albanian+PM+Visit+to+Serbia+in+70+Years+Postponed|title=First Albanian PM Visit to Serbia in 70 Years Postponed – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> In a second visit, during the Economic Forum of Nis, Rama compared the Albanian and Serbian reconciliation process with the historical reconciliation between the French and Germans after the [[second World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=336420|title=Forumi shqiptaro-gjerman, Rama: Shqipëri-Serbi, si Gjermania e Franca pas luftës – Lajme – Top Channel|website=top-channel.tv|accessdate=25 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005150509/http://top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=336420|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rama is also a key supporter of the [[Berlin Process]], an intergovernmental platform of cooperation between the [[European Union]] and [[Western Balkans]] countries.

The [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]] led by Rama participated at the 2017 [[2017 Albanian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 25 June 2017. One day after, partial results suggested that the Socialist Party had won a majority.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-election-result-idUSKBN19H18L Albanian Socialists to get parliamentary majority, partial vote count shows] Reuters, 26 June 2017</ref>

The Second Rama government has been accused by the opposition for excessive spending in modernizing the government infrastructure, including ministries buildings and their office equipment. In the first six months of 2018, the investments summed up to 40 million euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exit.al/en/2018/08/17/the-rama-governments-hypocrisy-e40-million-for-offices-but-the-budget-cant-afford-new-national-theater/|title=The Rama Government's Hypocrisy – €40 Million For Offices, But The Budget Can't Afford New National Theater - Exit - Explaining Albania|date=17 August 2018}}</ref> During his premiership, the government followed an open policy regarding concessions and public-private partnerships.

In its 2018 investment climate statement for Albania, the US State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs considered the lack of transparency in public procurement as a major issue in Albania, together with high rates of corruption and poor enforcement of contracts. The opposition has accused the government and especially Rama for favoring concession contracts to his friends and relatives, prompting to a substantial continuation of the political traditions across the parliament spectrum.<ref>http://www.tiranatimes.com/?p=138117</ref>

== Domestic policy ==

Edi Rama adopts a [[neo-liberal]] economic policy, considered more right-wing than that of the governments of the [[Democratic Party of Albania]]. It reduces public spending and promotes [[public-private partnerships]], a source of rapid enrichment for a circle of entrepreneurs close to power, in most sectors (tourism, higher education, health, public works, culture...). The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), traditionally favorable to these policies, however, considered that the Albanian government was proceeding too quickly with privatizations and exposed the country to "significant fiscal risks".<ref>https://mondediplo.com/2020/09/11albania</ref>

While the country is in recession upon arrival, the growth rate approaches 4 percent in 2017 and 2018, the unemployment rate rises from 17.5 percent in 2014 to 11.5 percent in 2020. According to him, the improvement in the economic situation can be explained by the political stability of the country: "We are a country without a Senate, without unions, without a radical left and without comedians who play politics. "Nevertheless, salaries remain low and emigration has accelerated since 2014.<ref>https://mondediplo.com/2020/09/11albania</ref>

[[Drug trafficking]] has grown considerably, accounting for nearly a third of GDP in 2017. According to estimates by Italian customs, 753,000 cannabis plants were destroyed in 2016, compared to 46,000 in 2014. Such destruction would have affected only 10 percent of the cultivated area. The Minister of the Interior, [[Saimir Tahiri]] (in office from 2013 to 2017), has himself been blamed for his involvement in this traffic.<ref>https://mondediplo.com/2020/09/11albania</ref>

In 2018, he adopts a law, welcomed by the [[European Union]], which provides for competition between universities and their openness to the market. The increase in tuition fees is causing discontent among students.<ref>https://mondediplo.com/2020/09/11albania</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
{{Further|List of official trips made by Edi Rama}}

In several occasions, Rama has stated that the [[European Union]] needs to accelerate the integration process of the [[Western Balkans]], considering it the only way to subdue the dangerous fractions in the region, preventing a possible eruption of violence, like the one that hammered the region in the nineties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/07/if-eu-shuns-albania-radical-islam-beckons/|title=If EU shuns Albania radical Islam beckons|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>

Rama has had a diverse agenda of high level meetings.

Edi Rama and Bilal Shehu, a [[New Jersey]] limousine driver, attended one of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s fundraising events in October 2012, weeks before Obama's reelection. A photograph of Rama and Barack Obama from this event was shared by Rama on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] ahead of Albania's 2013 Parliamentary Election, to imply a relationship with [[Barack Obama|Obama]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-election-idUSKCN0ZF2S6|title=New Jersey man admits to helping disguise foreign political...|date=2016-06-29|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-29|language=en}}</ref> Rama's ticket to the event was in the name of Bilal Shehu's wife.

In a plea deal with U.S. Federal Prosecutors, William Argeros, a U.S. citizen from [[Florida]] admitted to teaming up with Bilal Shehu to receive $80,000 "from a foreign source" and route it to the Obama Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee supporting Obama's reelection bid and other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/albanian-prime-minister-edi-rama-date-with-barack-obama-guilty-fundraising/|title=Albanian prime minister's date with Obama|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|date=2016-07-26|website=POLITICO|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>

Shehu admitted that he received the $80,000 wire transfer into his New Jersey-based bank account from a foreign bank account in late September 2012, knowing that he was to provide it to the joint fundraising committee.

=== Makoçi's testimony in divorce hearings ===
In October 2003 [[Gazeta Tema]] published a court document from Edi Rama's divorce from actress Matilda Makoçi in 1991. According to the document, the breakdown in the marriage relationship started when Rama learned Makoçi was pregnant with their son Gregor. According to the document Rama told Makoçi he could not father children due to a medical condition. The document states that Rama was not willing to submit to a DNA parentage testing, and as such, Grigor's paternity remained undisputed. According to the document, Makoçi testified in the final divorce hearings that Rama claimed she got pregnant during a period when she was on vacation in Vlora, together with his father Kristaq and his mother Aneta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rd.al/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gazeta.jpg|website=www.rd.al|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rd.al/2018/03/deshmia-monstruoze-e-rames-ne-gjykate-ti-ke-qene-ne-plazh-prinderit-e-mi-kur-ke-mbetur-shtatzane/|title=Dëshmia monstruoze e Ramës në Gjykatë: "Ti ke qenë në plazh me prindërit e mi kur ke mbetur shtatzanë!"|last=RD|first=Gazeta|date=2018-03-14|website=Rilindja Demokratike|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cna.al/2016/09/09/dokumenti-ja-si-e-mohoi-edi-rama-djalin-e-tij-grigorin/|title=Dokumenti / Ja si e mohoi Edi Rama djalin e tij Grigorin|last=cna|date=2016-09-09|website=CNA|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref> While Rama has repeatedly disputed the veracity of this story, [[Gazeta Tema]] and Mero Baze, Gazeta Tema's chief editor since 1999 and a former reporter for [[Voice of America|VoA]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], have never retracted the story.

=== Involvement in Electoral Fraud ===
In a series of 16 audio tapes published online by the [[Germany|German]] tabloid [[Bild]], Rama and his cabinet members were recorded in conversations with police and members of organized crime ahead of the 2017 Parliamentary Elections. In one of the tapes Rama himself is recorded in a conversation with Arben Keshi, a local police official, asking if "the objective had been met". In another recording, cabinet member Damian Gjiknuri was heard offering Keshi to send "a van of problematic guys" who "should not be too exposed" but may be needed "just in case" for the election. In other tapes, current and former Socialist MPs were recorded giving instructions to Keshi and other local officials on bribing constituents with cash and intimidating them with threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://balkanweb.com/e-plote-16-pergjimet-e-reja-te-bild-si-u-blene-votat-ne-diber/|title=E plotë/ 16 përgjimet e reja të BILD: Si u blenë votat në Dibër|date=2019-06-17|website=Balkanweb.com - News24|language=sq-AL|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> In other tapes published by Bild, former Mayor of [[Durrës]] Vangjush Dako, appointed by Rama was heard in conversations with members of drug trafficking and organized crime in connection to the 2017 Elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kohajone.com/2019/06/05/bild-nxjerr-pergjimet-e-reja-mes-vangjush-dakos-dhe-astrit-avdylajt/|title="Bild" nxjerr përgjimet e reja mes Vangjush Dakos dhe Astrit Avdylajt|last=Lindita|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

=== Attacks on the media ===
Rama has been criticized for trying to intimidate the journalists and political commentators critical of him. Since rising to power in 2013, Prime Minister Edi Rama has launched a series of attacks towards them. These attacks often involve a mix of [[name calling]], [[bullying]] and [[elitism]]. Among other names, he uses the Turkish loanword ''llum kazani'' (dregs in a cauldron) to describe journalists, television hosts, political commentators, as well as their coverage of the news.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetatema.net/2017/06/09/edi-rama-blendi-fevziu-eshte-kazan-mediatik-ndersa-zheji-thjesht-nje-kosh/|title=DEBATI/ Çfarë mendon Edi Rama për gazetarët: Blendi Fevziu është kazan mediatik, ndërsa Zheji thjesht një kosh…|date=2017-06-09|work=Gazeta Tema|access-date=2018-05-02|language=sq-AL}}</ref> Rama commented during his appearance in "Të Paekspozuarit",  a weekly political show by Ylli Rakipi, that the host and his regular guests, [[Andi Bushati]] and [[Fatos Lubonja]], "pluck and roast chicken", "drink [[Rakia|raki]]", and they give their viewers "dog food".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balkanweb.com/site/o-zot-me-ler-te-mbaroj-rama-sherr-me-gazetarin-ti-ha-pula-me-lubonjen-e-bushatin-ylli-rakipi-te-kane-rene-qerpiket/|title="O Zot, më ler"/ Rama, gazetarit: Ti ha pula me Lubonjën e Bushatin.

Të ranë qerpikët…|website=www.panorama.com.al|language=sq|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> Bushati, Lubonja and Rakipi are among his biggest critics in the media. On July 7, 2019 Lubonja's personal car was vandalized. According to media reports the perpetrator, who the police allege was mentally impaired, was shouting "You haven't seen it all yet". The same expression has been repeated by Edi Rama several times in his TV appearances, when describing his relationship with the press.

===Controversial Media law===
In December 2019, the government led by Rama proposed changes in two laws regarding communications and information services in Albania, with focus on regulating the online media market, forcing them to register and giving authority to institutions controlled by the Parliament to fine online medias and journalists and block their contents.

Called by him as the 'anti-defamation' law, it gives to the Authority of Audiovisual Media in Albania the competences of fining journalists, and they can have their cases heard in court only after paying the AMA-imposed fine. Critics say this clause aims to decimate the finances of independent news outlets, whose limited funding would be likely to expire long before a court even hears the case.<ref>https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/albania-approves-controversial-anti-defamation-laws</ref>

Civic society and media organizations in Albania protested the changes in the law, considering them as censoring free-speech and expressing their concerns, because the drafted law didn't take in consideration several recommendations made by international actors like the EU Commissioner for Human Rights and OSCE.<ref>https://balkaninsight.com/2019/12/18/albania-approves-controversial-media-laws-amidst-protests/</ref>
The draft received criticism from conservative politicians outside Albania.<ref>https://exit.al/en/2019/12/19/european-peoples-party-calls-on-rama-to-repeal-anti-defamation-laws/</ref><ref>https://www.ocnal.com/2019/12/david-lega-if-anti-defamation-packages.html</ref>
The Albanian Ombudsman also called the government on not approving the two anti-defamation draft laws, as they do not meet international standards.<ref>https://exit.al/en/2019/12/18/albanian-ombudsman-media-laws-do-not-meet-international-standards/</ref>

=== Other controversies ===
In 2003, Rama appeared before the [[Albanian Parliament]] in an inquiry commission on abuse of funds in the [[Municipality of Tirana]]. During the session, he was seen speaking using a loudspeaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/albania/gazeta-shqiptare/20130911/282089159450437|title=PressReader.com – Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The commission was eventually closed and Rama acquitted.

During his time as a mayor, in several attempts to widen roads and improve infrastructure, Rama authorized the bulldozing of private properties. In one occasion, Rama himself cut an electric wooden pole with an ax before the cameras, because a conflict with the central government was blocking a road extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://balkanweb.com/site/rrefimi-i-artur-zhejit-si-e-binda-edi-ramen-te-dilte-me-sepate-ne-dore-mes-tiranes/|title=Rrëfimi i Artur Zhejit: Si e binda Edi Ramën të dilte me sëpatë në dorë mes Tiranës (Foto)|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> 
He has been accused of corruption and mismanagement of funds by the opposition, including corruption in the granting of building permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citynews.al/2015/08/bllokimi-i-lejeve-te-ndertimit-berisha-rama-rilindi-20-shin-rryshfet/1|title=Bllokimi i lejeve të ndërtimit, Berisha: Rama rilindi 20%-shin rryshfet|date=11 August 2015|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>

Due to his flamboyance and rebellious ways Rama has often been accused of arrogance and elitism, especially at the start of his political career. In more than one occasion political opponents attacked him about his personal and family life, and even raised doubts about his sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albeu.com/kryetitull/rama-kam-degjuar-te-thone-se-jam-homoseksual/232550/|title=Rama: Kam dëgjuar të thonë se jam homoseksual...|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>

In a 2002 town-hall meeting with actors from the [[National Theatre (Albania)|National Theater]], discussing whether the existing building needed to be demolished or not, Mayor Rama responded to the actors' requests to keep the existing building intact using [[sarcasm]] and suggesting that the actors might as well designate [[Violeta Manushi]]'s underwear as a "cultural monument".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lapsi.al/2018/03/21/video-kur-rama-tallej-me-breket-e-te-ndieres-violeta-manushi/|title=Video/ Kur Rama tallej me brekët e të ndierës Violeta Manushi|date=2018-03-21|work=Lapsi.al|access-date=2018-04-17|language=sq-AL}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpz.al/2018/03/21/video-kur-rama-tallej-me-breket-e-te-ndieres-violeta-manushi/|title=Video/ Kur Rama tallej me brekët e të ndjerës Violeta Manushi|website=Te Paekspozuarit|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=TPZ.

On 23 April 2013, after a guest speech at the [[Diplomatic Academy of Vienna]],  Rama was involved in a physical altercation with Egin Ceka, a junior Albanian diplomat working for the Permanent Mission of [[Albania]] to [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]. Mr. Ceka claimed Edi Rama physically assaulted him. The incident was later confirmed by the [[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Albanian Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-eyes-parliamentary-probe-against-opposition-leader|title=Albania Socialist Leader Faces Assault Probe|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://top-channel.tv/english/foreign-ministry-ramas-incident-in-vienna/|title=Foreign Ministry: Rama's incident in Vienna|website=top-channel.tv|language=sq-AL|access-date=2018-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://top-channel.tv/english/investigative-commission-for-incident-in-vienna/|title=Investigative Commission for incident in Vienna|website=top-channel.tv|language=sq-AL|access-date=2018-04-08}}</ref>

On 21 March 2014, while former Prime Minister Sali Berisha was delivering a speech in the parliament, Rama was caught on a [[Microphone gaffe|hot mic]] launching a series of insults towards him. Rama called the former Prime Minister a miscreant, a bastard, delirious, stupid and a dickhead.<ref>{{Citation|last=Euralb Albania|title=Edi Rama shan Sali Berishen / O rrot k***|date=2014-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LePkdg4-LjI|accessdate=2018-04-10}}</ref>

On 9 September 2017 Rama nominated [[Gramoz Ruçi|Gramoz Ruci]] as Speaker of the [[Parliament of Albania|Parliament]]. Ruci had served during [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist Albania]] first as the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Workers' Party]] First Secretary for [[Tepelenë District|Tepelene]] district and then later as [[Ministry of Interior (Albania)|Minister of Interior]] .
