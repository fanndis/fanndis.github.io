==History==
{{Main|Old Tagalog}}

[[File:Baybayin alpha.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The Tagalog [[Baybayin]] script]]

The word ''Tagalog'' is derived from the [[endonym]] ''taga-ilog'' ("river dweller"), composed of ''tagá-'' ("native of" or "from") and ''ilog'' ("river"). Linguists such as Dr. David Zorc and Dr. [[Robert Blust]] speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups originated in Northeastern [[Mindanao]] or the Eastern [[Visayas]].<ref>Zorc, David. 1977. "The Bisayan Dialects of the Philippines: Subgrouping and Reconstruction". ''Pacific Linguistics'' C.44. Canberra: The Australian National University</ref><ref>Blust, Robert. 1991. "The Greater Central Philippines hypothesis". ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 30:73–129</ref>

Possible words of Old Tagalog origin are attested in the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] from the tenth century, which is largely written in [[History of the Malay language#Old Malay (7th to 14th century)|Old Malay]].<ref>Postma, Anton. The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary. ''Philippine Studies''. Vol. 40, No. 2 (Second Quarter 1992), pp. 183-203.</ref> The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593. The ''Doctrina'' was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current [[Baybayin]] script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography for the language.

[[File:Vocabulario de la lengua tagala 1794.jpg|thumb|200px|''Vocabulario de la lengua tagala'', 1794.]]

Throughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the "Arte y reglas de la lengua tagala" (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his "[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]" in [[Pila, Laguna]].

The first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and José Hernandez.<ref>Juan José de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino</ref> Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P. Juan de Noceda and P. Pedro de Sanlucar and published as ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]'' in Manila in 1754 and then repeatedly<ref>{{Google books |plainurl= |id=PTIOAAAAIAAJ |title=Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, Manila 1860 }}</ref> reedited, with the last edition being in 2013 in Manila.<ref>Juan José de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, Manila 2013, Komision sa Wikang Filipino.</ref>

Among others, ''Arte de la lengua tagala y manual tagalog para la administración de los Santos Sacramentos'' (1850) in addition to early studies<ref>{{cite journal|title=A contribution to Asian Historiography : European studies of Philippines languages from the 17th to the 20th century|journal=Archipel|first=Marlies|last=Spieker-Salazar|volume=44|issue=1|pages=183–202|doi=10.3406/arch.1992.2861|year=1992}}</ref> of the language.

The indigenous poet [[Francisco Balagtas]] (1788–1862) is regarded as the foremost Tagalog writer, his most notable work being the early 19th-century [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Florante at Laura]]''.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Kun sino ang kumathâ ng̃ "Florante": kasaysayan ng̃ búhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunung̃a't kadakilaan|author=Cruz, H.|date=1906|publisher=Libr.

Tagalog was declared the official language by the first revolutionary constitution in the Philippines, the [[wikisource:Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1897)#ARTICLE VIII: OFFICIAL LANGUAGE|Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]] in 1897.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&page=1&epage=1 |title=1897 Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Article VIII |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228152829/http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&page=1&epage=1 |archive-date=2009-02-28 }}</ref>

In 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1935constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1935 Philippine Constitution, Article XIV, Section 3 |accessdate = 2007-12-20 |publisher = Chanrobles Law Library}}</ref> After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines.<ref name=MLQspeech>{{Citation|url=http://www.quezon.ph/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/mlq-speech-national-language-1.pdf |title=Quezon's speech proclaiming Tagalog the basis of the National Language |author=Manuel L.

In 1959, the language was further renamed as "Pilipino".<ref name=Gonzalez/> Along with English, the national language has had official status under the 1973 constitution (as "Pilipino")<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1973constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1973 Philippine Constitution, Article XV, Sections 2–3 |accessdate = 2007-12-20 |publisher = Chanrobles Law Library}}</ref> and the present 1987 constitution (as Filipino).

===Controversy===
The adoption of Tagalog in 1937 as basis for a national language is not without its own controversies. Instead of specifying Tagalog, the national language was designated as ''Wikang Pambansâ'' ("National Language") in 1939.<ref name=MLQspeech /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan |title=Mga Probisyong Pangwika sa Saligang-Batas |publisher=Wika.pbworks.com |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref> Twenty years later, in 1959, it was renamed by then Secretary of Education, José Romero, as ''[[Filipino language|Pilipino]]'' to give it a [[nation]]al rather than [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] label and connotation. The changing of the name did not, however, result in acceptance among non-[[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]], especially [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]s who had not accepted the selection.<ref name="Gonzalez"/>

The national language issue was revived once more during the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|1971 Constitutional Convention]]. The majority of the delegates were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a "national language" altogether.<ref>{{cite web|title=What the PH constitutions say about the national language|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/65477-national-language-philippine-constitutions|website=Rappler|language=en}}</ref> A compromise solution was worked out—a "universalist" approach to the national language, to be called ''Filipino'' rather than ''Pilipino''. The 1973 constitution makes no mention of Tagalog. When a new constitution was drawn up in 1987, it named Filipino as the national language.<ref name="Gonzalez"/> The constitution specified that as the Filipino language evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. However, more than two decades after the institution of the "universalist" approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.

Many of the older generation in the Philippines feel that the replacement of English by Tagalog in the popular visual media has had dire economic effects regarding the competitiveness of the Philippines in trade and overseas remittances.<ref>{{cite news |title=The cost of being tongue-tied in the colonisers' tongue |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2009/06/04/e-for-english |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=4 June 2009 |quote=ONCE it claimed to have more English speakers than all but two other countries, and it has exported millions of them. But these days Filipinos are less boastful. Three decades of decline in the share of Filipinos who speak the language, and the deteriorating proficiency of those who can manage some English, have eroded one of the country's advantages in the global economy. Call-centres complain that they reject nine-tenths of otherwise qualified job applicants, mostly college graduates, because of their poor command of English. This is lowering the chances that the outsourcing industry will succeed in its effort to employ close to 1m people, account for 8.5% of GDP and have 10% of the world market}}</ref>

===Use in education===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

Upon the issuance of ''Executive Order No. 134'', Tagalog was declared as basis of the National Language. On 12 April 1940, ''Executive No. 263'' was issued ordering the teaching of the national language in all public and private schools in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-disseminationscd/language-and-translation/filipino-language-in-the-curriculum/|title=Filipino Language in the Curriculum - National Commission for Culture and the Arts|work=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

Article XIV, Section 6 of the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] specifies, in part:

{{quote|Subject to provisions of law and as the Congress may deem appropriate, the Government shall take steps to initiate and sustain the use of Filipino as a medium of official communication and as language of instruction in the educational system.<ref name=1987constitutionXIV>

Under Section 7, however:

{{quote|The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein.<ref name=1987constitutionXIV />}}

In 2009, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] promulgated an order institutionalizing a system of mother-tongue based multilingual education ("MLE"), wherein instruction is conducted primarily in a student's mother tongue (one of the various regional Philippine languages) until at least grade three, with additional languages such as Filipino and English being introduced as separate subjects no earlier than grade two. In secondary school, Filipino and English become the primary languages of instruction, with the learner's first language taking on an auxiliary role.<ref>[http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf Order No. 74 (2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225924/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, as of 2014 there were 100 million people living in the Philippines, where the vast majority have some basic level of understanding of the language. The Tagalog homeland, [[Katagalugan]], covers roughly much of the central to southern parts of the island of [[Luzon]]—particularly in [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Bataan]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Quezon]], [[Rizal]], and [[Zambales]]. Tagalog is also spoken natively by inhabitants living on the islands of [[Marinduque]] and [[Mindoro]], as well as [[Palawan]] to a lesser extent. Significant minorities are found in the other Central Luzon provinces of [[Pampanga]] and [[Tarlac]], [[Ambos Camarines]] in Bicol Region, and the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera]] city of [[Baguio]]. Tagalog is also the predominant language of [[Cotabato City]] in [[Mindanao]], making it the only place outside of Luzon with a native Tagalog speaking majority.<ref>{{Citation

* [[Bangsamoro]]
** [[Maguindanao]] (While [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]] has traditionally been the majority language of the province, Tagalog is now the main language of "mother tongue" primary education in the province and is the majority language in the regional center of [[Cotabato City]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/625918/filipino-or-tagalog-now-dominant-language-of-teaching-for-maguindanaons|title=Filipino or Tagalog now dominant language of teaching for Maguindanaons|first=Nash|last=Maulana|website=Inquirer}}</ref>

Tagalog speakers are also found in other parts of the Philippines and through its standardized form of [[Filipino language|Filipino]], the language serves the national ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the country.

Tagalog also serves as the common language among [[Overseas Filipinos]], though its use overseas is usually limited to communication between [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Filipino ethnic groups]]. The largest concentration of Tagalog speakers outside the Philippines is found in the [[United States]], where in 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau reported (based on data collected in 2011) that it was the fourth most-spoken non-English language at home with almost 1.6 million speakers, behind [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] (including Patois, Cajun, Creole), and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (with figures for [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] combined). In urban areas, Tagalog ranked as the third most spoken non-English language, behind Spanish and Chinese varieties but ahead of French.<ref name="USA">{{cite news|title=Language Use in the United States: 2011|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acs-22.html|agency=United States Census Bureau|date=August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229214944/https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acs-22.html | archive-date=2018-12-29 | id=Report number ACS-22}}</ref> Other countries with significant concentrations of overseas Filipinos and Tagalog speakers include [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Malaysia]].

==Classification==
Tagalog is a [[Central Philippine languages|Central Philippine]] language within the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Being [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], it is related to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Tetum language|Tetum]] (of Timor), and [[Yami language|Yami]] (of Taiwan).<ref name="ethnologue.com">Lewis, M.P., Simons, G.F., & Fennig, C.D. (2014). Tagalog. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the
World.'' Retrieved from http://www.ethnologue.com/language/tgl</ref> It is closely related to the languages spoken in the [[Bicol Region]] and the [[Visayas]] islands, such as the [[Bikol languages|Bikol group]] and the [[Visayan languages|Visayan group]], including [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].<ref name="ethnologue.com"/>

Tagalog differs from its [[Central Philippine languages|Central Philippine]] counterparts with its treatment of the [[Proto-Philippine language|Proto-Philippine]] [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|*ə}}. In most [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] and [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] languages, this sound merged with {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|[o]}}. In Tagalog, it has merged with {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*dəkət}} (adhere, stick) is Tagalog ''dikít'' and Visayan & Bikol ''dukot''.

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*r}}, {{IPA|*j}}, and {{IPA|*z}} merged with {{IPA|/d/}} but is {{IPA|/l/}} between vowels. Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*ŋajan}} (name) and {{IPA|*hajək}} (kiss) became Tagalog ''ngalan'' and ''halík''.

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*R}} merged with {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. {{IPA|*tubiR}} (water) and {{IPA|*zuRuʔ}} (blood) became Tagalog ''tubig'' and ''dugô''.

===Dialects===
[[File:Katagalugan.png|thumb|Distribution of Tagalog dialects in the Philippines. The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]

At present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon and Aurora) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.

Some example of dialectal differences are:
* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngayón'' (now, today), ''sinigáng'' (broth stew), ''gabí'' (night), ''matamís'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.
* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[ɾ]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bundók'', ''dagat'', ''dingdíng'', and ''isdâ'' become ''bunrók'', ''ragat'', ''ringríng'', and ''isrâ'', e.g. "sandók sa dingdíng" becoming "sanrók sa ringríng".
* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''nákáin'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''nákáin ka ba ng patíng?'' ("Do you eat shark?"), he would be understood as saying "Has a shark eaten you?" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.
* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.

Perhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=1980 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.

One example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.

===Code-switching with English===
{{main|Taglish}}

''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.

Code-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are "Filipinized" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.

{{Verse translation
| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?
| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?
}}

City-dwellers are more likely to do this.

The practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}
{{Contains special characters|IPA}}
Tagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally CrVC, where Cr only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' "truck" or ''sombréro'' "hat".<ref name=ELL>{{ELL2|Tagalog}}</ref>

===Vowels===
Tagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.<ref name=ELL/> Before appearing in the area north of the Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from central and northern Philippines, such as the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages, as well as Spanish words.

Nevertheless, simplification of pairs {{IPA|[o ~ u]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ ~ i]}} is likely to take place, especially in some Tagalog as second language, remote location and working class registers.

The four [[diphthong]]s are {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/uj/}}, {{IPA|/aw/}}, and {{IPA|/iw/}}. Long vowels are not written apart from pedagogical texts, where an acute accent is used: ''á é í ó ú.''<ref name=ELL/>

*the word starts with a prefix followed by a verb that starts with a vowel, like ''mag-aayos'' ([will] fix)

===Stress and final glottal stop===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is a [[distinctive feature]] in Tagalog. Primary stress occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs at the end of a word.

Tagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and/or the presence of a final glottal stop. In formal or academic settings, stress placement and the glottal stop are indicated by a [[diacritic]] (''tuldík'') above the final vowel.<ref>Himmelmann, Nikolaus (2005). "Tagalog" in K. Alexander Adelaar & Nikolaus Himmelmann (eds.) ''The Austronesian languages of Asia and Madagascar'', pp. 350-376, London, Routledge.</ref> The penultimate primary stress position (''malumay'') is the default stress type and so is left unwritten except in dictionaries.

==Grammar==

==Writing system==
{{see also|Filipino orthography}}
{{Contains special characters|Baybayin}}

Tagalog, like other Philippines languages today, is written using the Latin alphabet. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]—or [[alphasyllabary]]—called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.

In the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name="Is k foreign 19"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter ⟨k⟩ rather than ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.

In 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La España Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would "use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La España'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Católica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters "k" and "w" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as "unpatriotic". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name="k is for">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938–967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name="Is k foreign 19">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Católica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In April 1890, Jose Rizal authored an article ''Sobre la Nueva Ortografia de la Lengua Tagalog'' in the Madrid-based periodical [[La Solidaridad]]. In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as "more perfect" than what he himself had developed.<ref name="k is for"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name="k is for"/> The revolutionary society Kataás-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name="k is for"/>

In 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name="ebolusyon">{{cite web | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.

===Baybayin===
{{Main|Baybayin}}

Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].

Although it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.

There has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.

A "kudlit" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an "E" or "I" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an "O" or "U" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.

===Latin alphabet===
====Abecedario====
Until the first half of the 20th century, Tagalog was widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography consisting of 32 letters called ''''ABECEDARIO'''' ([[wikt:abecedario#English-alphabet|Spanish for "alphabet"]]):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emanila.com/news/opinion/ggrivera_2001_04_10_opinion_tagalog.html |title=The evolution of the native Tagalog alphabet |first=Guillermo |last=Gómez Rivera |author-link=Guillermo Gómez Rivera |date=April 10, 2001 |publisher=Emanila Community (emanila.com) |at=Views & Reviews |location=Philippines |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919003751/http://emanila.com/news/opinion/ggrivera_2001_04_10_opinion_tagalog.html |archive-date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last =Signey | first =Richard |title= Philippine Journal of Linguistics|at= The Evolution and Disappearance of the "Ğ" in Tagalog orthography since the 1593 Doctrina Christiana | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18813686 |publisher=Linguistic Society of the Philippines|location=Manila, Philippines|issn=0048-3796|oclc=1791000 |accessdate = August 3, 2010 | postscript =.}}</ref>

When the national language was based on Tagalog, grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced a new alphabet consisting of 20 letters called ''ABAKADA'' in school grammar books called ''balarilà'':<ref>{{Citation

====''ng'' and ''mga''====
{{See also|ng (digraph)}}
The [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker ''ng'' and the plural marker ''mga'' (e.g. ''Iyan ang '''mga''' damit ko.'' (Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[naŋ]}} and ''mangá'' {{IPA|[mɐˈŋa]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to "of" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means "when" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. 
* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadulás.''—When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.
* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''—He woke up <u>early</u>.
* ''Gumalíng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''—Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.

In the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is "greatly" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').

The longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:
*''Naghintáy sila '''nang''' naghintáy.''—They kept on waiting" (a closer calque: "They were waiting and waiting.")

===''pô/hô'' and ''opò/ohò''===
The words ''pô/hô'' and ''opò/ohò'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative "''oo''" ("yes"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.

"Pô" and "opò" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. "Hô" and "ohò" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, "pô" and "opò" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.
*Example: "''Pakitapon naman '''pô/ho''' yung basura.''" ("Please throw away the trash.")

Used in the affirmative:
*Ex: "''Gutóm ka na ba?" "'''Opò/Ohò'''''". ("Are you hungry yet?" "Yes.")

''Pô/Hô'' may also be used in negation.
*Ex: "''Hindi ko '''pô/hô''' alam 'yan.''" ("I don't know that.")

==Vocabulary and borrowed words==
{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}

Tagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.

In pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

Tagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

Due to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.

English has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Tagalog has contributed several words to [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Philippine Spanish]], like ''barangay'' (from ''balan͠gay,'' meaning ''barrio''), the ''abacá'', ''cogon'', ''palay'', ''dalaga'' etc.

==Religious literature==
[[File:CalauanChurchjf4373 11.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Ten Commandments]] in Tagalog.]]

Religious literature remains one of the most dynamic contributors to [[Tagalog literature]]. The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> ("the Bible") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> ("the Old Bible"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible
* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version
* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]
* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version
* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')

When the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.

Jehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].

Tagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].

==Examples==
===Lord's Prayer===
In Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is known by its [[incipit]], ''Amá Namin'' (literally, "Our Father").

{{Poemquote
| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;
| text=
Amá namin, sumasalangit Ka,
Sambahín ang ngalan Mo.
Mapasaamin ang kaharián Mo.
Sundín ang loób Mo,
Dito sa lupà, gaya nang sa langit.
Bigyán Mo kamí ngayón ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,
At patawarin Mo kamí sa aming mga salâ,
Para nang pagpápatawad namin,
Sa nagkakasalà sa amin;
At huwág Mo kamíng ipahintulot sa tuksó,
At iadyâ Mo kamí sa lahát ng masamâ.
[Sapagkát sa Inyó ang kaharián, at ang kapangyarihan,
At ang kaluwálhatian, ngayón, at magpakailanman.]
Amen.
}}

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
This is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''Pángkalahatáng Pagpapahayag ng Karapatáng Pantao'')

{{Verse translation
| lang=tl
| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may layà at magkakapantáy ang tagláy na dangál at karapatán. Silá'y pinagkalooban ng pangangatwiran at budhî na kailangang gamitin nilá sa pagtuturingan nilá sa diwà ng pagkakapatiran.
| All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml The Universal Declaration of Human Rights], The United Nations.</ref></blockquote>
}}

===Numbers===
The numbers (''mga bilang'') in Tagalog language are of two sets. The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number "seven", it can be translated into Tagalog as "''pito''" or "''siyete''" (Spanish: ''siete'').

===Months and days===
Months and days in Tagalog are also localised forms of Spanish months and days. "Month" in Tagalog is ''buwán'' (also the word for [[moon]]) and "day" is ''araw'' (the word also means [[sun]]). Unlike Spanish, however, months and days in Tagalog are always capitalised.

===Proverbs===
''Ang hindî marunong lumingón sa pinánggalingan ay hindî makaráratíng sa paroroonan''. (José Rizal)<br />One who knows not how to look back from whence he came, will never get to where he is going.

''Unang kagat, tinapay pa rin.'' It means :"First bite, still bread." or "All fluff no substance."

''Tao ka nang humarap, bilang tao kitang haharapin.''<br />(A proverb in Southern Tagalog that made people aware the significance of sincerity in Tagalog communities. It says, "As a human you reach me, I treat you as a human and never act as a traitor.")

''Hulí man daw (raw) at magalíng, nakáhahábol pa rin.''<br />If one is behind but capable, one will still be able to catch up.

''Magbirô ka na sa lasíng, huwág lang sa bagong gising.''<br />Make fun of someone drunk, if you must, but never one who has just awakened.

''Aanhín pa ang damó kung patáy na ang kabayo?''<br />What use is the grass if the horse is already dead?

''Ang sakít ng kalingkingan, ramdám ng buóng katawán.''<br />The pain in the pinkie is felt by the whole body.<br />
(In a group, if one goes down, the rest follow.)

''Nasa hulí ang pagsisisi.''<br />Regret is always in the end.

''Pagkáhabà-habà man ng prusisyón, sa simbahan pa rin ang tulóy.''<br />The [[procession]] may stretch on and on, but it still ends up at the church.<br />
(In romance: refers to how certain people are destined to be married. In general: refers to how some things are inevitable, no matter how long you try to postpone it.)

''Kung 'dî mádaán sa santóng dasalan, daanin sa santóng paspasan.''<br />If it cannot be got through holy prayer, get it through blessed force.<br />
(In romance and courting: ''santóng paspasan'' literally means 'holy speeding' and is a euphemism for [[sexual intercourse]]. It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favored by older generations, which often featured [[Harana (serenade)|serenades]] and manual labor for the girl's family; the other is upfront seduction, which may lead to a slap on the face or a pregnancy out of wedlock. The second conclusion is known as ''pikot'' or what Western cultures would call a '[[shotgun marriage]]'. This proverb is also applied in terms of diplomacy and negotiation.)
