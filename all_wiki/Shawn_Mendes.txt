'''Shawn Peter Raul Mendes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|d|ɛ|z}}; born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He gained a following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application [[Vine (software)|Vine]]. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager [[Andrew Gertler]] and [[Island Records]] [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label. He has since released [[Shawn Mendes discography|three studio albums]], headlined [[Shawn Mendes#Tours|three world tours]], and received [[List of awards and nominations received by Shawn Mendes|several awards]].

Mendes released his [[The Shawn Mendes EP|self-titled debut EP]] (2014) and his debut studio album ''[[Handwritten (Shawn Mendes album)|Handwritten]]'' (2015), whose single "[[Stitches (Shawn Mendes song)|Stitches]]" reached number one in the United Kingdom and the top 10 in the United States and Canada. He then released his second studio album ''[[Illuminate (Shawn Mendes album)|Illuminate]]'' (2016), whose singles "[[Treat You Better (Shawn Mendes song)|Treat You Better]]" and "[[There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back]]" reached the top 10 in several countries. His [[Shawn Mendes (album)|self-titled third studio album]] (2018) was supported by the lead single "[[In My Blood (Shawn Mendes song)|In My Blood]]". All three albums debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with the first one making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the age of 18 and the third one making him the third-youngest artist to achieve three number one albums. In 2017, Mendes became the first artist to land three number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart before turning 20 years old. In 2018, he became the first artist to achieve four number-one singles on the [[Adult Top 40|Adult Pop Songs]] chart before the age of 20 as well. In 2019, he released the hit singles "[[If I Can't Have You (Shawn Mendes song)|If I Can't Have You]]" and "[[Señorita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Señorita]]", with the latter peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Among his accolades, Mendes has won 13 [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada|SOCAN]] awards, 10 [[MTV Europe Music Award]]s, eight [[Juno Award]]s, eight [[iHeartRadio MMVAs]], two [[American Music Awards]], and received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

== Personal life ==

{{quote|I spoke to a therapist a couple of times [...] Therapy is what works for you. Therapy is listening to music and running on the treadmill, therapy is going to dinner with your friends—it's something that distracts you, that helps you heal and so it just depends on what you think therapy is. I made a conscious effort to be more connected to the people in my life. I found I was closing myself off from everybody, thinking that would help me battle it then realizing the only way I was going to battle it was completely opening up and letting people in.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/shawn-mendes-undergoes-therapy-to-cure-anxiety-118042100102_1.html |title=Shawn Mendes undergoes therapy to cure anxiety |date=April 21, 2018 |work=[[Business Standard]] |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}</ref>}}
