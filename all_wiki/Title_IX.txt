{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Title&nbsp;IX''' is a federal civil rights law in the United States of America that was passed as part (Title IX) of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]]. This is Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688. The early legislative draft was authored by Representative [[Patsy Mink]] with the assistance of Representative [[Edith Green]]. It was then co-authored and introduced  to Congress by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] in the U.S. Senate, and Congresswoman [[Patsy Mink]] in the House. It was later renamed the '''Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act''' following Mink's death in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/113|title=H.J.Res.113 – 107th Congress (2001–2002): Recognizing the contributions of Patsy Takemoto Mink.|last=Miller|first=George|date=October 29, 2002|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>

==Historical background==

===Foundations and hearings===
Title IX was enacted as a follow-up to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The 1964 Act was passed to end discrimination in various fields based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of employment and public accommodation.<ref>Section 703(a)(1), Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (July 2, 1964).</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|title=The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|date=August 15, 2016|work=National Archives|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020043707/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|archive-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref> The 1964 Act did not prohibit sex discrimination against persons employed at educational institutions. A parallel law, Title VI, had also been enacted in 1964 to prohibit discrimination in federally funded private and public entities. It covered race, color, and national origin but excluded sex. Feminists during the early 1970s lobbied Congress to add sex as a protected class category. Title IX was enacted to fill this gap and prohibit discrimination in all federally funded education programs. Congressman John Tower then proposed an amendment to Title IX that would have exempted athletics departments from the scope of Title IX's coverage.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The Tower amendment was rejected, but it led to widespread misunderstanding of Title IX as a sports-equity law, rather than an anti-discrimination, civil rights law.<ref name="Suggs">Suggs, Welch. ''A Place on the Team.'' Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 2005.</ref> While Title&nbsp;IX is best known for its impact on high school and [[college athletics|collegiate athletics]], the original statute made no explicit mention of sports. The United States Supreme Court also issued decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, making clear that sexual harassment and assault is a form of sex discrimination. In 2011, President Barack Obama issued guidance reminding schools of their obligation to redress sexual assaults as civil rights matters under Title IX. Obama also issued guidance clarifying Title IX protections for LGBT students through [[Dear colleague letter (United States)|Dear Colleague]] letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Harassment and Bullying|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=October 26, 2010|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=May 13, 2016|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 20, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017204448/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|archive-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|title=Sessions memo reversing gender identity civil rights policy|last=Times)|first=Charles Savage (The New York|website=www.documentcloud.org|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020033440/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|archive-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/transgender-civil-rights-act-justice-department-sessions.html|title=In Shift, Justice Dept.

The precursor to Title IX was an executive order, issued in 1967 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], forbidding discrimination in federal contracts. Before these orders were issued, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) had persuaded him through successful lobbying, or influencing, his aides or Members of Congress to include the addition of women.<ref name="Suggs" /> [[Executive Order 11375]] required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=60553|title=Lyndon B.

August 1997.</ref> She utilized university statistics to show how female employment at the university had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men.<ref name="Suggs" /> Sandler then brought her complaints to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]'s [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance]], where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint; later citing inequalities in pay, rank, and admissions, among others.

Sandler soon began to file complaints against the University of Maryland and other colleges while working with NOW and the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL). Sandler later filed 269 complaints against colleges and universities, which led to the events of 1970.<ref name="Suggs" /> In 1970, Sandler joined U.S. House Representative [[Edith Green]]'s [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education]] of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor Committee]], and observed corresponding congressional hearings relating to women's issues on employment and equal opportunity. In these hearings, Green and Sandler initially proposed the idea of Title&nbsp;IX. An early legislative draft was then authored by Representative [[Patsy Mink]] with the assistance of Representative [[Edith Green]].<ref name="aauw">[http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm "Title&nbsp;IX: A Brief History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415133530/http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm |date=April 15, 2010 }} AAUW. 2009.</ref>  At the hearing, there were mentions of athletics. The idea behind the draft was a progressive one in somewhat instituting an affirmative action for women in all aspects of American education.<ref name="Suggs" />

===Steps from a draft to legislative act to public law===
[[File:Birch bayh.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana]]
Mink's initial draft of Title IX was formally introduced in Congress by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana in 1971 who then was its chief Senate sponsor for congressional debate. At the time, Bayh was working on numerous constitutional issues related to women's employment and sex discrimination—including but not limited to the revised draft of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The ERA attempted to build "a powerful constitutional base from which to move forward in abolishing discriminatory differential treatment based on sex".<ref name="Bayh">Cruikshank, Kate. ''[http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 The Art of Leadership; A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228194809/http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 |date=December 28, 2012 }}''. (Indiana University Libraries, 2007), p. 43.</ref> As he was having partisan difficulty in later getting the ERA Amendment out of committee, the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] was on the Senate Floor for re-authorization; and on February 28, 1972, Bayh re-introduced a provision found in the original/revised ERA bill as an amendment which would become Title IX.<ref name="SenateIntro">118 Cong. Record 5802-3 (1972).</ref> In his remarks on the Senate Floor, Bayh stated, "we are all familiar with the stereotype [that] women [are] pretty things who go to college to find a husband, [and who] go on to [[graduate school]] because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again.

The desire of many schools not to waste a 'man's place' on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts contradict these myths about the 'weaker sex' and it is time to change our operating assumptions."<ref name="SenateSpeech">118 Cong. Record 5804 (1972).</ref> He continued: "While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work".<ref name="SenateSpeech2">118 Cong. Record 5808 (1972).</ref> Title&nbsp;IX became public law on June 23, 1972.<ref name="now">[http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html "Legislative History of Title&nbsp;IX"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624070911/http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html |date=June 24, 2010 }} National Organization for Women.

===Implementation===
Each institution or organization that receives federal funding must designate at least one employee as Title IX coordinator. Their duty is to oversee that Title IX is not being violated and to answer all questions pertaining to Title IX. Everyone must have access to the Title IX coordinator's name, address, and telephone number. In order to ensure compliance with Title IX, programs of both male and females must display no discrimination. This applies to athletics participation numbers, scholarships, program budgets, expenditures, and coaching salaries by gender.

Title IX's statutory language is brief. U.S. President Nixon therefore directed the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) to carry publish regulations clarifying the law's application.<ref name="Suggs"/> In 1974, U.S. Senator [[John Tower]] introduced the Tower Amendment which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title&nbsp;IX compliance.<ref name="cases">[http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html "Landmark Title&nbsp;IX Cases in History"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110914080142/http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html |date=September 14, 2011 }} Gender Equity in Sport. February 23, 2006.</ref> Later that year, Congress rejected the Tower Amendment and passed an amendment proposed by U.S. Senator [[Jacob Javits]] directing HEW to include "reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports" adopted in its place.<ref name="Suggs" /> In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations detailing how Title&nbsp;IX would be enforced.<ref name="Suggs" />  These regulations were codified in the [[Federal Register]] in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] [[Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Volume 34]], Part 106 ({{USCFR|34|106}}). Since 1975, the federal government has issued guidance clarifying how it interprets and enforces those regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/sex.html|title=Reading Room: Sex Discrimination Policy|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref>

===Further legislation===
[[File:Patsymink.jpg|thumb|Representative [[Patsy Mink]] of Hawaii, Title IX co-author, for whom the law was renamed in 2002]]
The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 is tied to Title IX which was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 ruling ''[[Grove City College v. Bell]].''<ref name="oyez">[http://oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1983/1983_82_792 "The Oyez Project, Grove City College v.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. November 19, 2009</ref> This case was initially reached by the Supreme Court when [[Grove City College]] disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title&nbsp; IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.<ref name="oyez"/> The Department of Education's stance was that because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was thus receiving federal assistance and Title&nbsp; IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program that only this program had to comply. This ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&nbsp; IX as it then made many athletic programs outside the purview of Title&nbsp; IX, and thus reduced its scope.<ref name="Suggs"/>

Grove City's court victory, however, was short-lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed in 1988, which extended Title&nbsp;IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives ''any'' federal assistance, both direct and indirect.<ref name="now" /> In 1994, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, sponsored by Congresswoman [[Cardiss Collins]] required that federally-assisted educational institutions disclose information on roster sizes for men's and women's athletic teams; as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches' salaries, and other expenses, annually.<ref name="cases" /> In 1992, the Supreme Court decided monetary relief was available under Title IX in the case [[Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/90-918|title=Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools|website=Oyez|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2019}}</ref> In October 2002, less than a month after the death of U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution to rename Title IX the "Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act," which President George W. Bush signed into law.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush signs resolution honoring Patsy Mink|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|access-date=May 20, 2013|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=October 31, 2002|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018064617/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013}}</ref> On November 24, 2006, Title&nbsp;IX regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level; this was largely to introduce federal abstinence-only programs, which may have been a partial basis for the support of President Bush.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |title=Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |number=206 |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620084108/http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |archive-date=June 20, 2012 }}</ref>

On May 15, 2020, the department of education issued a letter stating that the policy of the state of [[Connecticut]] which allows transgender girls to compete in high school sports as girls was a violation of the civil rights of those who had always identified as girls and a violation of Title IX. It stated that Connecticut's policy "denied female student-athletes athletic benefits and opportunities, including advancing to the finals in events, higher-level competitions, awards, medals, recognition, and the possibility of greater visibility to colleges and other benefits."<ref>{{cite news |title=Policy allowing transgender athletes to compete as girls found to violate US law |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/connecticut-transgender-federal-civil-rights-lawsuit |access-date=June 8, 2020 |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Guardian |date=May 28, 2020}}</ref>

== Impact on American schools ==

=== Equity in athletics ===
Though views differ as respects the impact of Title&nbsp;IX, the discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title&nbsp;IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females, and whether and to what extent Title&nbsp;IX has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males.{{By whom|date=July 2017}} Title IX has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, their goal has been to see an increase in females’ participation in athletics, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Rebecca|date=Fall 2008|title=Cheerleading in the Context of Title IX and Gendering in Sport|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=2a970548-ca6b-4b4a-8f5f-49b96d90d7b0%40sessionmgr4007&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=57121870&db=s3h|journal=EBSCOhost|volume=11}}</ref> Athletic equality requirements that schools must meet were made, the requirements were set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, schools must pass at least one of three tests measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf|title=A Report of the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education|date=2008|work=Title IX at 35|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> These tests consist of proportional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making an effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific sex dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an effort to expand the program to the other sex.<ref name=":1" /> Although Title IX has increased the participation of female students, there is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females’ role in coaching has majorly decreased while males have gained a larger role in directing athletics, which is still a struggle for women today.<ref name=":0" /> Also, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of [[Women's sports|female sports]] led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW.<ref name="Hult 240">{{harvnb|Hult |p=240}}</ref>.

===Sexual harassment and sexual violence===
Title IX applies to all educational programs and all aspects of a school's educational system. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued [[Yale University]] for its failure to curtail sexual harassment on campus by especially male faculty. This case, [[Alexander v. Yale]], was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination.<ref>Alexander v. Yale, [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/631/178/86618/ 631 F.2d 178] (2d Cir. 1980).</ref> The plaintiffs in the case alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty. Some of the cases were based on a 1977 report authored by plaintiff [[Ann Olivarius]], now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, "[https://wff.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/1977_Report_to_the_Yale_Corporation.pdf A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus]."

These changes shift the standard of evidence used in Title IX investigations from "preponderance of the evidence" to a "clear and convincing" evidence standard, which is typically used for civil cases in which serious allegations are made (as opposed to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/06/20/how-have-obamas-k-12-policies-fared-under.html|title=How Have Obama's K-12 Policies Fared Under Trump?|last=Ujifusa|first=Andrew|work=Education Week|access-date=June 20, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.robertkinglawfirm.com/criminal-defense/sex-crimes/title-ix-defense/|title=Title IX Defense|last=King|first=Robert|work=King Law|access-date=September 15, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> On September 22, 2017, US Department of Education Secretary Betsy Devos rescinded the Obama-era guidelines which had prodded colleges and universities to more aggressively investigate campus sexual assaults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos-1506092354-htmlstory.html|title=Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinds Obama-era guidelines on campus sexual assault|first=Lauren|last=Rosenblatt|website=latimes.com}}</ref> On May 7, 2020, the U.S. Department of Education released final regulations governing campus sexual assault under Title IX, the first Title IX guidance published by the Office of Civil Rights to go through a formal notice-and-comment process since 1997.<ref name="insidehighered.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/07/education-department-releases-final-title-ix-regulations#:~:text=The%202020%20regulations%20will%20instead,a%20higher%20burden%20of%20proof.}}</ref> Unlike guidance issued by the Obama administration in 2011 and 2014, they will have the force of law behind them.

===Transgender students===
{{main|Gender identity under Title IX}}
Between 2010 and 2016, under the [[Obama administration]] the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance explaining that [[transgender]] students are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. In particular, Title IX of its Education Amendments of 1972 bars schools that receive financial aid assistance from sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities. It instructed public schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in academic life. A student who identifies as a transgender boy, for instance, is allowed entry to a boys-only class, and a student who identifies as a transgender girl is allowed entry to a girls-only class. This also applies to academic records if that student is over the age of eighteen at a university.<ref name="Dominic Holden">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|title=Department Of Education Issues Guidelines To Protect Transgender Students In Single-Sex Classrooms|author=Dominic Holden|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=December 2, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121033755/https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|archive-date=November 21, 2017}}</ref> The memo states in part that "[a]ll students, including transgender students, or students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender, or gender non-conforming, consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes."<ref name="Dominic Holden"/>

However, starting in 2017 with the [[Trump administration]], several of these policies have been rolled back. In February 2017, the Departments of Justice and Education (headed by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] and Education Secretary [[Betsy DeVos]], respectively) withdrew the guidance on gender identity.<ref name="guardian-23feb2017">{{cite news|author1=David Smith|author2=Molly Redden|title=Trump administration rescinds Obama-era protections for transgender students|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|access-date=February 23, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 23, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222220432/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|archive-date=February 22, 2017}}</ref> The Education Department announced on February 12, 2018 that Title IX did not allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|title=Education Department no longer investigating transgender bathroom complaints|first=Moriah|last=Balingit|date=February 12, 2018|access-date=April 27, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322084639/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|archive-date=March 22, 2018}}</ref>

Dwayne Bensing, who worked in the Education department and was in its LGBTQ affinity group, had unsuccessfully asked DeVos not to withdraw the Obama administration guidance on [date, year]. Two years later, in the summer of 2019, Bensing discovered that the Education Department was fast-tracking the [[Alliance Defending Freedom|Alliance Defending Freedom's]] complaint against transgender student-athletes, even though the Department's attorneys did not understand the legal basis for doing so and the Department had to pressure other employees. Bensing leaked this information to the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' and was forced to resign in December 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/education-department-whistleblower-forced-out-transgender-students_n_5e336a7cc5b611ac94d1fb1d|title=Education Department Whistleblower Forced Out After Exposing Push Against Trans Athletes|last=Klein|first=Rebecca|date=January 31, 2020|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref> Although Mr. Bensing was educated as a lawyer, he failed to read and understand the full scope of the Whistleblower Protection Act, as amended, as the act only protects federal employees if they disclose suspected crimes and abuses to their supervisor during normal business hours, among other requirements. Disclosing any information outside established channels in the form of “leaks” to journalists at the Washington Blade, et al. do not meet the legal definition of a whistleblower since any information leaked gives the appearance of ulterior motives rather than correcting said abuses using established oversight channels.<ref>{{Cite web|title=US Department of Education OIG Hotline Whistleblower Protection|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/hotlinewbedemployees.html|website=US Department of Education|access-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person's sex as determined at birth and could not be changed, effectively limiting recognition of transgender students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender "on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?module=inline | title ='Transgender' Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration | first1 = Erica | last1= Green | first2=  Katie | last2=  Benner | first3 =  Robert | last3 = Pear | date = October 21, 2018 | access-date = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the "#WontBeErased" hashtag.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html | title = #WontBeErased: Transgender People and Allies Mobilize Against Trump Administration Proposal | first = Sarah | last = Mervosh | date = October 22, 2018 | access-date = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

In May 2020, the Trump administration's Department of Education contended that the rights of [[cisgender]] women are infringed upon by transgender women.

In August 2020, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed a 2018 lower court ruling in [[Adams v. The School Board of St. Johns County, Florida]] that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is discrimination "on the basis of sex" and is prohibited under Title IX (federal civil rights law) and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]]. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/fl_adams-v-school-board-st-johns-county | title = Adams v.

==OCR's test for Title IX compliance==
{{main|Office for Civil Rights}}
Title&nbsp;IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR's current interpretation of Title&nbsp;IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title&nbsp;IX's text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.<ref name="Shelton 2001"/><ref name="Irving 2003">{{cite news |title=Wrestling With Title&nbsp;IX |work=New York Times |first=John |last=Irving |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |date=January 28, 2003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311175231/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |archive-date=March 11, 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Gavora 2003">{{cite news |title=Tilting the Playing Field: Schools, Sports, Sex and Title&nbsp;IX |first=Jessica |last=Gavora |year=2003}}</ref>

Critics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a "quota" in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the "proportionality" prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participating in athletics (despite the third prong, which focuses on any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participation). Instead, it requires that the genders' athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest.  Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to the past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary. Critics say that prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest despite its gender-neutral language, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the "underrepresented sex", even though ED regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution "effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes". As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to consider male athletic interest, critics maintain that the OCR's three-prong test operates to discriminate against men.<ref name="Shelton 2001"/><ref name="Gavora 2003"/>

Defenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders' differing athletic interest levels are merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title&nbsp;IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics regardless of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that "opportunity drives interest",<ref>{{cite news |title=Smith professor speaks on Title&nbsp;IX |work=The Smith College Sophian |year=2008 |url=http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207111650/http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |archive-date=December 7, 2008 }}</ref> critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title&nbsp;IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in which athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students. Author and self-described women's rights advocate [[John Irving]] opined in a ''[[New York Times]]'' column that on this topic, women's advocates were being "purely vindictive" in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title&nbsp;IX be maintained.<ref name="Irving 2003"/>

On March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title&nbsp;IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the underrepresented sex.<ref>{{cite web |title=Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy: Three-Part Test – Part Three |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]] |access-date=October 13, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018094908/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |archive-date=October 18, 2009 }}</ref> Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses.<ref>{{cite web |title=OCR rescinds 2005 Title&nbsp;IX clarification |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/ocr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |access-date=April 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416001218/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2Fncaa%2Fncaa+news%2Fncaa+news+online%2F2010%2Fassociation-wide%2Focr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |archive-date=April 16, 2011 }}</ref> On April 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights abandoned the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e‑mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title&nbsp;IX compliance.

In February 2010, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] weighed in on the OCR's three-prong test, offering several recommendations on Title&nbsp;IX policy to address what it termed "unnecessary reduction of men's athletic opportunities".<ref name="USCCR 2010 report">{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletics: Accommodating Interests and Abilities |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] |access-date=February 1, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214210606/http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |archive-date=December 14, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Brady 2010">{{cite news |title=Commission: Title&nbsp;IX interpretation unnecessarily hurts men's sports |work=USA Today |first=Erik |last=Brady |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |date=April 2, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305151642/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref>  The Commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education's regulations on interest and abilities be revised "to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex", almost always females.<ref name="Brady 2010"/>

==Legacy and recognition==
On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Title IX the [[National Women's Law Center]] lodged twenty-five complaints with the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/04/01/title-ixs-pyrrhic-victory/|title=Title IX's Pyrrhic Victory|author=Michael W.

After Title IX was implemented, there was controversy about the amount of athletic integration. Especially among female education leaders who worried about girls being injuried or bullied by rough boys in coeducational activities. These gym teachers who worried about losing their job as programs were combined, a valid fear, as it turned out. While there were always some parents and administrators who did not like the idea of coed gym classes, that has in fact become the norm as a result of Title IX. <ref>(Game, Set, Match| author=Susan Ware| Date= April 2011)</ref>

There were several events praising the 40th anniversary of Title&nbsp;IX in June 2012. For example, the [[White House Council on Women and Girls]] hosted a panel to discuss the life-altering nature of sports. Panelists included [[Billie Jean King]], All‑American NCAA point guard [[Shoni Schimmel]] of the [[Louisville Cardinals women's basketball|University of Louisville]], and [[Aimee Mullins]], the first double-amputee sprinter to compete in NCAA track and field for [[Georgetown Hoyas track and field|Georgetown University]].<ref name="washingtonpostix">{{cite news |last=Groer |first=Annie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/as-title-ix-turns-40-women-pay-homage/2012/06/23/gJQArEBjxV_blog.html |title=As Title&nbsp;IX turns 40, women pay homage |work=The Washington Post |date=June 23, 2012 |access-date=June 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624193728/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/as-title-ix-turns-40-women-pay-homage/2012/06/23/gJQArEBjxV_blog.html |archive-date=June 24, 2012 }}</ref>

==Criticism==
Concern has been expressed that colleges have been overly aggressive in enforcing Title IX regulations, particularly about sexual matters. The author Laura Kipnis and other conservatives have argued that Title IX regulations have empowered investigators who routinely endanger academic freedom and fair process, [[Presumption of innocence|presume the guilt]] of suspects, assign the man full responsibility for the outcome of any social interaction, and minutely regulate personal relationships.<ref>{{cite web| url =https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septoct-2015/what-went-wrong-with-title-ix/| title =What Went Wrong With Title IX?| last =Bagenstos| first =Samuel| date =October 2015| website =Washington Monthly| access-date =April 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Kipnis| first =Laura| title =Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus| publisher =Harper| date =2017| pages =256| url=http://laurakipnis.com/books/unwanted-advances/| isbn =978-0062657862 }}</ref>
