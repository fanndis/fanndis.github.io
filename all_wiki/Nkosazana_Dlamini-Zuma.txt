She ran for the position of President of the [[African National Congress]] in 2017, but was defeated by [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] at the [[54th National Conference of the African National Congress]].

==Early years==
Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini, a [[Zulu people|Zulu]], was born in [[Natal Province|Natal]], the eldest of eight children. She completed high school at the [[Adams College|Amanzimtoti Training College]] in 1967.<ref name=historic>[http://www.historicschools.org.za/view.asp?ItemID=11&tname=tblComponent2&oname=Schools&pg=front&subm=Pilot%20Schools Adams College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927021946/http://www.historicschools.org.za/view.asp?ItemID=11&tname=tblComponent2&oname=Schools&pg=front&subm=Pilot%20Schools |date=27 September 2013 }}, Historic Schools Restoration Project; retrieved 3 August 2013</ref>

In 1971, she started her studies in [[Zoology]] and [[Botany]] at the [[University of Zululand]], where she obtained a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's degree in Science]] (BSc). She subsequently began her medical studies at the [[University of Natal]], where she became an active underground member of South African Students Organisation, and was elected as its deputy president in 1976. She was exiled in the same year and finished her studies abroad at the [[University of Bristol]] in the UK in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.int/en/cpauc/profile|title=Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - Profile - African Union|website=www.au.int|access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

Subsequently, she worked as a medical doctor at the [[Mbabane Government Hospital]] in Swaziland, where she met her future husband, previous ANC party president Jacob Zuma.

==ANC==
In 1985, Dlamini-Zuma returned to the [[United Kingdom]] to complete a diploma in tropical child health from [[Liverpool University]]'s [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine|School of Tropical Medicine]]. After receiving her diploma, she worked for the ANC Regional Health Committee before accepting the position of director of the Health and Refugee Trust, a British non-governmental organisation. During the [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (CODESA) negotiations in 1992, she was part of the Gender Advisory Committee.

She was suggested as a possible ANC candidate for the Presidency in the 2009 election and for the leadership of the party.<ref>Boyd Webb, [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20071116034129531C548887 "Is SA ready for a female president?"], ''Cape Times'' (''IOL''), 16 November 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=325082 "Dlamini-Zuma available for ANC leadership"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819175810/http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=325082 |date=19 August 2012 }}, ''Mail & Guardian Online'', 16 November 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=325170 "Dlamini-Zuma not in ANC succession debate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819175816/http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=325170 |date=19 August 2012 }}, ''Mail & Guardian Online'', 16 November 2007.</ref>

Dlamini-Zuma was nominated for the ANC political party's deputy presidency by four provinces aligned to President Thabo Mbeki,<ref name="IOL"/> while the five provinces backing her ex-husband ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma preferred her as the national chairperson.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/dlamini-zuma-can-just-pick-n-choose-380366|title=Dlamini-Zuma can just 'pick 'n choose'|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref> She was elected to the ANC's 80-member National Executive Committee in December 2007.<ref>Brendan Boyle, [http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=666599 "Winnie Mandela tops ANC election list"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002120731/http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=666599|date=2 October 2008}}, ''The Times'' (South Africa), 21 December 2007.</ref>

==South African government==
===Health Department===
After the first all-inclusive South African elections of 1994, Dlamini-Zuma was appointed as Minister of Health in the cabinet of [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]], where she continued the work of previous Minister of Health [[Rina Venter]] to racially desegregate the health system and broaden state anti-tobacco measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hst.org.za/news/health-department-gets-tobacco-award|title=Health department gets tobacco award|date=31 July 2000|website=Hst.org.za|access-date=13 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414082004/http://www.hst.org.za/news/health-department-gets-tobacco-award|archive-date=14 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dlamini-Zuma introduced the [[Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993#The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act-1999|Tobacco Products Amendment Bill]] in 1999, which made it [[smoking ban|illegal to smoke]] in public buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2001/01jan-feb/corp8.html|title=The Great South African Smokeout|last=White|first=Anna|year=2001|website=Multinational Monitor|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

====HIV/AIDS and ''Sarafina II''====
In August 1995, against South African Communications Services recommendations for "cheaper and better" [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness programmes,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/1996-09-13-mixed-plaudits-for-public-protectors-baptism|title=Mixed plaudits for public protector's baptism|date=13 September 1996|work=The M&G Online|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> the [[Department of Health (South Africa)|Department of Health]] awarded a R14.27m contract to [[Mbongeni Ngema]], a "good friend" of Dlamini-Zuma's, to produce a sequel to the musical, ''[[Sarafina! (musical)|Sarafina!]]''.<ref name="SA Monitor"/>

Investigations into ''[[AIDS in South Africa#1995|Sarafina II]]'' revealed that Dlamini-Zuma had lied to [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] about funding for the project coming from the EU, and had ignored proper bidding procedures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/world/south-africa-scandal-over-sarafina-spotlights-corruption-in-the-anc.html|title=South Africa Scandal Over 'Sarafina' Spotlights Corruption in the A.N.C.|last=Daley|first=Suzanne|date=8 October 1996|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=21 April 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name="SA Monitor">{{Cite web|url=http://sa-monitor.com/dlamini-zuma-sarafina-ii-original-nkandla-bdlive-8-april-2016|title=Dlamini-Zuma and Sarafina II: The original Nkandla|last=van Onselen|first=Gareth|date=8 April 2016|website=South African Monitor|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

==Controversy==
==="Rubbish" tweet===
On 7 April 2017, Dlamini-Zuma received scorn for labeling protest marches against Jacob Zuma as "rubbish"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2017/04/08/dlamini-zuma-says-this-rubbish-anti-zuma-march-tweet-was-fake|title=Dlamini-Zuma says 'this rubbish' anti-Zuma march tweet was fake|date=8 April 2017|website=Sowetan Live|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2017/04/07/Dlamini-Zuma-says-her-not-part-of-this-rubbish-anti-Zuma-march-tweet-was-fake1|title=Dlamini-Zuma says her 'not part of this rubbish' anti-Zuma march tweet was fake|date=7 April 2017|website=Times LIVE|access-date=9 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2017/04/07/Did-Dlamini-Zuma-dismiss-countrywide-anti-Zuma-marches-as-this-rubbish|title=Did Dlamini-Zuma dismiss countrywide anti-Zuma marches as 'this rubbish'?|date=8 April 2017|website=Times LIVE|access-date=9 April 2017}}</ref> and for characterising them as examples of [[white privilege]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article/id/11965/Zuma's_edifice_starts_to_wobble|title=Zuma's edifice starts to wobble|date=14 April 2017|website=Africa Confidential|access-date=20 April 2017}}</ref>

Her verified Twitter account posted "This is what they are protecting ... hence some of us are not part of this rubbish. They must join us for the march for our land they stole..." and deleted the tweet shortly thereafter. Dlamini-Zuma referred to the missive as a "fake tweet" afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/04/07/dlamini-zuma-labels-save-sa-protests-rubbish|title=Dlamini-Zuma labels Save SA protests 'rubbish'|date=8 April 2017|website=Eyewitness News|access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dlamini-zuma-rejects-rubbish-march-tweet-as-fake-20170407|title=Dlamini-Zuma rejects 'rubbish' march tweet as fake|last=Evans|first=Jenni|date=7 April 2017|work=News24|access-date=9 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecr.co.za/news/news/10-things-about-nation-wide-peoplesmarch|title=10 things about the #SAunites marches|date=8 April 2017|website=East Coast Radio|access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

===Allegations of connections to cigarette smuggling organisations===
On 5 November 2017, the ''[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' newspaper published photographs linking Dlamini-Zuma to senior figures in cigarette smuggling organisations operating in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/amp/sunday-times/news/2017-11-04-smoked-out-ndz-hanging-out-with-cigarette-smuggler-and-gambling-tycoon/|title=Smoked out!

===COVID-19 Lockdown===
During the 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown, Dlamini-Zuma made a u-turn announcement regarding the lifting of the controversial ban on the sale of tobacco products within the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-29-level-four-lockdown-dlamini-zuma-stubs-out-south-africas-hopes-for-a-puff/|title=Level four lockdown: Dlamini-Zuma stubs out South Africa’s hopes for a puff|website=Mail&Guardian|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> This was met with intense criticism considering a family member Edward Zuma has shares in Amalgamated Tobacco Manufacturers, a major producer of cheap cigarettes in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/opinion/2020-05-22-burning-questions-over-nkosazana-dlamini-zumas-cigarette-ban-motives/|title=Burning questions over Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's cigarette ban motives|website=DispatchLive|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://za.linkedin.com/in/edward-zuma-770604b8|title=Linked In - Edward Zuma|website=LinkedIn|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

Shortly after Ramaphosa defended her: "After careful consideration and discussion, the NCCC reconsidered its position on tobacco. As a result, the regulations ratified by Cabinet and announced by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on 29 April extended the prohibition," wrote the president. "This was a collective decision and the public statements by both myself and the minister were done on behalf of, and mandated by, the collective I lead."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/covid-19-tobacco-sale-u-turn-was-collective-decision-ramaphosa-defends-dlamini-zuma-20200504|title=Tobacco sale U-turn was collective decision - Ramaphosa defends Dlamini-Zuma|website=News24|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

South African DJ, Max Hurrell, created a short dance song featuring a recording of Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma saying: "When people zol, they put saliva on the paper, and then they share that zol..." The short dance song was released on his Facebook page, and soon after it emerged on other media platforms, rising to the #1 played song in South Africa on the Apple iTunes music platform. Max Hurrell said: “I honestly made the song just to make people laugh during a tough time, I’ve gotten loads of thank yous from people saying they needed the ‘mood-lifter’ and so I am grateful that I was able to help people feel better." After the song went viral Minister  Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma reached out to the DJ and commended him for entertaining the nation during the lockdown and offered him words of encouragement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/lifestyle/zol-max-hurrell-number-1-itunes/|title="But also, when people Zol" – Max Hurrell’s song hits number 1 on iTunes chart!|website=Good Things Guy|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>
