'''The Mall''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l}}<ref>[http://londonist.com/2011/10/pronunciation.php "How Do You Pronounce Theydon Bois?"]. Londonist.</ref>) is a road in the [[City of Westminster]], [[central London]], between [[Buckingham Palace]] at its western end and [[Trafalgar Square]] via [[Admiralty Arch]] to the east. Near the east end at Trafalgar Square and [[Whitehall]] it is met by Horse Guards Road and [[Spring Gardens]] where the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] and [[London County Council]] were once based. It is closed to traffic on Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays and on ceremonial occasions.

==History==
[[File:The_mall_london.jpg|thumb|The Mall, looking towards Buckingham Palace]]
The Mall began as a field for playing [[pall-mall]]. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was a fashionable promenade, bordered by trees.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Walford|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433075901656&view=1up&seq=94|title=Chapter VII: The Mall and Spring Gardens|work=Old and New London: A Narrative of Its History, its People, and its Places|volume=4: Westminster and the Western Suburbs|pages=74–85|date=1887–1893|edition=New|location=[[London]], England|publisher=Cassell & Company, Limited|accessdate=2019-07-02|oclc=35291703|via=[[HathiTrust]] Digital Library}}</ref> It was envisioned as a ceremonial route in the early 20th century, matching the creation of similar ceremonial routes in other cities such as [[Berlin]], [[Mexico City]], [[Oslo]], [[Paris]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Vienna]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] These routes were intended to be used for major national ceremonies. As part of the development&nbsp;– designed by [[Aston Webb]]&nbsp;– a new façade was constructed for Buckingham Palace, and the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]] was erected.

The Victoria Memorial is immediately before the gates of the Palace, whilst Admiralty Arch at the far end leads into Trafalgar Square. The length of The Mall from where it joins Constitution Hill at the Victoria Memorial end to Admiralty Arch is exactly {{convert|0.5|nmi}}. [[St. James's Park]] is on the south side of The Mall, opposite [[Green Park]] and [[St James's Palace]], on the north side. Running off The Mall at its eastern end is [[Horse Guards Parade]], where the [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony is held.

The surface of The Mall is coloured red to give the effect of a giant red carpet leading up to Buckingham Palace. This colour was obtained using synthetic [[iron oxide]] pigment from [[Deanshanger]] Oxide Works (Deanox),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk/schools/deanshanger99/home.html|title=deanshanger CLUTCH Club|work=open.ac.uk|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=July 2016}} which was created using the Deanox Process devised by chemist Ernest Lovell. It was [[David Eccles, 1st Viscount Eccles|David Eccles]]' decision, as Minister of Works from 1951 to 1954, to make The Mall red.

On [[Victory in Europe Day]] (8 May 1945), the Palace was the centre of British celebrations, with the [[George VI|King]], [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]] and [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] (the future queen) and [[Princess Margaret]] appearing on the balcony, with the Palace's [[Blackout (wartime)|blacked-out windows]] behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd on The Mall.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

During [[state visit]]s, the monarch and the visiting head of state are escorted in a state carriage up The Mall and the street is decorated with [[Union Flag]]s and the flags of the visiting head of state's country. During the Golden Jubilee celebrations of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2002, over one million people packed The Mall to watch the public displays and the appearance of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] on the palace balcony.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Scheduled [[bus]]es are not allowed to use the Mall and go past Buckingham Palace except by permission of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]]. This has only happened twice in history; in 1927 and in 1950.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Prince|date=1972|page=49|title=Wheels of London|publisher=The Sunday Times Magazine|isbn=0-7230-0068-9}}</ref>
