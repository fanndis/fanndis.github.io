==History==
<!-- Company's formation -->
ABC-Clio was founded in 1953 as a privately held corporation by Eric Boehm with its first publication, ''[[Historical Abstracts]]''.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010423/40175-e-books-a-natural-for-abc-clio.html|title = E-books a natural for ABC-CLIO|last = Costello|first = Megan|date = 2 April 2001|journal = Publishers Weekly|access-date = 26 November 2016|volume = 248|issue = 14|pages = 28–29|issn = 0000-0019}}</ref> The name represents the company's two original divisions when it incorporated in 1969: ABC stands for American Bibliographical Center and Clio Press is named after [[Clio]], the muse of history from ancient Greek mythology. According to Boehm, he had always been interested in history so when he noticed that there were not many good historical abstracting services available, he started publishing the ''Historical Abstracts''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68875009.html|title = ABC-CLIO Stresses Customer-Based Products|last = Hane|first = Paula J.|date = January 2001|journal = Information Today|access-date = 8 May 2015|url-access=subscription |volume = 18|issue = 1|issn = 8755-6286|page = 12}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

<!-- Product timeline -->
During the 1960s, a sister bibliographic and abstract publication on American history was added, ''America: History and Life'', which was considered an award-winning title. The company entered into digital publishing with electronic data in the 1960s and in 1975, it published its first online database<ref name=":3" /> called ''DIALOG''. During the 1980s, ABC-Clio expanded into providing primary reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries and stopped publishing bibliographic books.<ref name=":4" /> In the 1990s, ABC-Clio began to provide access to its humanities database on CD-ROM. The ''Exegy Current Events'' CD-ROM was named "Best Disc of the Year" by Library Journal.<ref name=abc-clio>{{Cite web|url = http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/About.aspx|title = History and Mission|access-date = 26 November 2016|publisher = ABC-CLIO}}</ref> In 1998, ABC-Clio provided electronic access to ''America: History and Life''. By the 2000s, one of the company's most popular products had become online databases for researching many topics in the field of the humanities. In 2001, ABC-Clio began to publish eBooks, initially providing 150 different titles to schools and libraries.<ref name=":3" /> The company's reference books had won numerous awards, and the company started a series of subject-related online databases for secondary school use. In 2004, the company acquired the quarterly historical journal, ''[[Journal of the West]]'', which has been published since 1962.<ref name=abc-clio/>

<!-- Mergers/acquisitions -->
In 1996, ABC-Clio merged with an electronic publishing company, Intellimation, which also produced educational software. The merger brought Becky Snyder, ABC-Clio's current president, from Intellimation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9605107609/abc-clio-merges-intellimation|title = ABC-CLIO merges with Intellimation|last = Rogers|first = Michael|date = May 1996|journal = Library Journal|access-date = 8 May 2015|url-access=subscription |volume = 121|issue = 8|issn = 0363-0277}}{{dead link|date=November 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It sold ''Historical Abstracts'' and ''America: History and Life'' to [[EBSCO Publishing]] in 2007.<ref>"[http://www.abc-clio.com/academic/pressroom/pressview.aspx?contentid=100241&task=home EBSCO Acquires Two Renowned Databases from ABC-CLIO: ''Historical Abstracts'' and ''America: History and Life''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415014106/http://www.abc-clio.com/academic/pressroom/pressview.aspx?contentid=100241&task=home |date=April 15, 2008 }}".
