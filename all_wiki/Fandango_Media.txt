'''Fandango Media, LLC''' is an American [[Box office|ticketing company]] that sells [[Ticket (admission)|movie tickets]] via their website as well as through their [[mobile app]], as well as a provider of television and streaming media information, e.g., through its subsidiaries [[Flixster]], [[Movies.com]], and [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

==History==
Fandango was founded April 27, 2000,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} after which [[revenue]] increased rapidly for several years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, as the Internet grew in popularity, small and medium-sized [[Chain store|movie-theater chains]] began to offer [[independent business|independent]] ticket sale capabilities through their own websites. In addition, a new [[paradigm]] of moviegoers' [[Computer printer|printing]] their own tickets at home (with [[barcode]]s to be [[barcode reader|scanned]] at the theater) emerged, in services offered by '''PrintTixUSA''' and by point-of-sale software vendor operated websites like '''ticketmakers.com''' (and eventually Fandango itself). Finally, an overall [[recession|slump]] in moviegoing continued into the 2000s, as [[home cinema|home theaters]], [[DVD]]s, and [[high definition television]]s proliferated in average households, turning their homes into a preferred place to screen films.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

On April 11, 2007, [[Comcast]] acquired Fandango, with plans to integrate it into a new entertainment website called "'''Fancast.com'''," set to launch the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/comcast-adds-fandango-88613|title=Comcast Adds Fandango|author=Wallenstein, Andrew|date=April 12, 2007|work=AdWeek|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref> In June 2008, the domain [[Movies.com]] was acquired from Disney.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/business/fi-movies24|title=Fandango acquires Movies.com|author=Chmielewski, Dawn C.|date=June 24, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref> With Comcast's purchase of a majority stake in [[NBCUniversal]] in January 2011 (full ownership in 2013), Fandango and all other Comcast media assets were merged into the company.

In March 2012, Fandango announced a partnership with Yahoo! Movies, making Fandango the official online and mobile ticketer for registered users of the Yahoo! service.<ref>{{cite news|author=Perez, Sarah|date=March 19, 2012|title=Fandango Wins Yahoo Movies Deal Over Rival MovieTickets.com|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/fandango-wins-yahoo-movies-deal-over-rival-movietickets-com/|work=[[TechCrunch]]}}</ref> That October, [[Paul Yanover]] was named President of Fandango.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-0410-ct-how-i-made-it-20160410-story.html|title=He's led Fandango's ambitious expansion beyond movie ticket sales|last=Faughnder|first=Ryan|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>

Fandango made its first international acquisition in September 2015 when it bought the Brazilian ticketing company Ingresso, which provides ticketing to a variety of Brazilian entertainment events, including the biannual [[Rock in Rio]] festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/global/fandango-acquires-brazil-ingresso-1201602564/|title=NBCU's Fandango Acquires Brazilian Ticketing Site Ingresso|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2015-09-25|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>

In February 2016, Fandango announced its acquisition of [[Flixster]] and [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from [[Time Warner]]'s [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]]. As part of the deal, Warner Bros. would become a 30% shareholder of the combined Fandango company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/fandango-buys-flixster-rotten-tomatoes/|title=Fandango Buys Flixster And Rotten Tomatoes|author=Ha, Anthony |date=February 17, 2016|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/rotten-tomatoes-fandango-flixster/|title=Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster Acquired By Fandango|website=Slashfilm|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-19}}</ref>

In December 2016, Fandango Media purchased [[Cinepapaya]], a Peru-based website for purchasing movie tickets, for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/01/comcast-fandango-cinepapaya/|title=Comcast's Fandango Buys Online Ticket-Seller Cinepapaya|date=2016-12-01|work=Fortune|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref> Later that same month, Fandango moved to [[Fox Sports Digital Media|Fox Interactive Media's]] former headquarters in Beverly Hills.<ref name="Solomon">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Daina Beth |title=Fandango Moving to Larger Headquarters in Beverly Hills |url=https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/dec/21/fandango-moving-larger-headquarters-beverly-hills/ |accessdate=15 November 2019 |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=21 December 2016}}</ref>

==Services==
Fandango charges a [[premium (marketing)|premium]] to reserve a ticket to be printed out upon arrival at a movie theater, thereby avoiding [[queue area|line]]s. Initially, seating was promised for [[sold out|sold-out]] shows, but this feature was discontinued for most theaters, as not all were equipped to handle [[reserved seating]] and [[will call]] lines. With ticket prices in many areas exceeding US$10.00, purchasing tickets through Fandango and other ticketing websites can make movie-going an expensive proposition; however, procuring tickets to movies on their [[opening day]]s by [[convention (norm)|conventional]] means may be inconvenient and difficult (especially in large [[metropolis|metropolitan]] areas) without utilizing services like Fandango.

Fandango's advertisements play before previews at participating movie-theater chains and feature [[paper bag|lunch bag]] [[puppet]]s telling various one- or two-line [[joke]]s and [[riddle]]s centering on the company's name. The company also produced an advertising segment that is based on the song, "[[We are the World]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Fandango's website also offers exclusive film clips, trailers, celebrity interviews, reviews by users, movie descriptions, and some web-based games to Fandango members.<ref>{{cite web|website=Fandango.com|title=Site INdex|url=https://www.fandango.com/site-index/|accessdate=October 12, 2019}}</ref>

As of March 5, 2015, Fandango provides members the ability to refund or exchange their orders up to 2 hours before the showtime of their film.<ref>{{cite web|website=Fandango.com|date=October 2019| url=https://www.fandango.com/cancel-my-reservation-192910/movie-times| title=Cancel My Reservation Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Fandango.com|date=October 2019| url=https://www.fandango.com/policies/movie-ticket-policy| title=Ticket Policy}}</ref>

Fandango's Android app was listed among Techland's 50 Best Android Applications for 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/07/01/50-best-android-apps-for-2013/slide/pulse-news/|title=50 Best Android Apps for 2013|last=Newman|first=Jared|work=Techland|date=July 1, 2013|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704153053/http://techland.time.com/2013/07/01/50-best-android-apps-for-2013/slide/pulse-news/|archive-date=July 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Competition==
Until its acquisition of its rival [[MovieTickets.com]] in 2017, Fandango was one of three major [[online]] advance movie ticket sale sites, along with MovieTickets.com and [[Atom Tickets]]. Before being acquired by Comcast in April 2007, Fandango was privately owned; its major [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], [[Regal Entertainment Group]], which owned the [[Regal Entertainment Group#United Artists Theatres|United Artists]] and [[Hoyts]] theater chains, was the second largest movie-theater chain in the U.S. Regal and its partners founded Fandango partly to prevent the older MovieTickets.com from establishing a monopoly on phone and online ticketing services. (MovieTickets.com was publicly owned and [[trade (financial instrument)|traded]] under the [[stock symbol]] HOLL.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fandango-to-acquire-popular-online-ticketer-movieticketscom-creating-global-suite-of-movie-ticketing-properties-with-mission-of-getting-more-moviegoers-into-theaters-worldwide-300536440.html|work=PRNewswire|title=FANDANGO TO ACQUIRE POPULAR ONLINE TICKETER MOVIETICKETS.COM, CREATING GLOBAL SUITE OF MOVIE TICKETING PROPERTIES WITH MISSION OF GETTING MORE MOVIEGOERS INTO THEATERS WORLDWIDE|publisher=Fandango|date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>) The company's advertising agency reportedly chose the name "Fandango" because it sounded "fun, kinetic and smart", and "easily pronounce[d] and remember[ed]--even though it really has nothing to do with movies."<ref>{{cite web| author=Lang, Adam | url=http://www.rewindandcapture.com/why-is-it-called-fandango/ | title=Why is it called Fandango?| website= RewindandCapture.com| date= October 29, 2014}}</ref>

Mergers of movie chains have complicated matters regarding which company provides online ticketing for a particular chain. Upon Regal's acquisition of [[Consolidated Theatres (North Carolina)|Consolidated Theatres]], that chain was under contract to MovieTickets.com; as such Fandango does not ticket those Regal theaters. On the other hand, Regal's acquisition of the Hoyts chain resulted in Fandango's taking over the latter's online ticketing.

Prior to 2012, Fandango did not provide online ticketing for many [[AMC Theatres]]. However, it provided online ticketing for AMC Theatres that were originally part of the [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, due to contractual obligations in place prior to the 2005 merger of the two movie chains.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/334-amc-loews-merger-could-shake-up-online-movie-ticketers-fandango-and-movietickets-com-holl-goog-msft-twx-yhoo | title=AMC-Loews merger could shake up online movie ticketers Fandango and MovieTickets.com | work=Seeking Alpha | date=June 23, 2005 | accessdate=April 29, 2011 | author=Jackson, David}}</ref> Loews had previously attempted to break the contract in 2002 under pressure of bankruptcy and from (then) [[AOL]] [[Moviefone]] and its partner, Loews' [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation|Cineplex]] subsidiary; Fandango successfully sued both Loews and Moviefone and retained Loews' business.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/1438501 |title=Fandango Heads Off An End Run |work=InternetNews.com |date=August 2, 2002 |access-date=April 29, 2011 |author=Cox, Beth |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525193036/http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/1438501 |archive-date=May 25, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> As of February 8, 2012, Fandango began providing ticketing for all AMC Theatres in the US,<ref>{{cite web|website=Fandango| title=Fandango, AMC Theatres announce newly expanded partnership | url=http://www.fandango.com/movieblog/fandangoamctheatresannouncenewlyexpandedpartnership-698047.html}}</ref> after which MovieTickets.com's fellow shareholders sued AMC for breach of contract.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rich, Katey | url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/MovieTickets-com-Suing-AMC-Setting-Up-Fandango-Deal-29316.html| title= MovieTickets.com suing AMC setting up Fandango deal| website= CinemaBlend.com| date= February 8, 2012}}</ref> AMC and MovieTickets.com settled in 2013, with an agreement that the theater chain's online ticketing would be available on both Fandango and MovieTickets.com.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/amc-comes-on-board-movietickets-com-following-suit-settlement-1201066425/|title=AMC Comes on Board MovieTickets.com Following Suit Settlement|last= McNary |first= Dave|newspaper= Variety |date= January 21, 2014|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}</ref>

In May 2012, Fandango announced a partnership with [[Moviefone]], MovieTickets.com's former partner.<ref>{{cite news| author=Verrier, Richard | url= https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fandango-20120523,0,812900.story | title=Fandango and Moviefone dial up new partnership| work=Los Angeles Times| date= May 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author=Shaw, Lucas | title= Fandango and Moviefone partner for ticket sales| url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/13767140/fandango-and-moviefone-partner-for-ticket-sales/ | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716080905/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/13767140/fandango-and-moviefone-partner-for-ticket-sales/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |work=Reuters| date= May 23, 2012}}</ref>

[[Atom Tickets]], a movie ticketing app and website launched in 2014, has been called a "serious competitor" of Fandango's.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/business/media/movie-ticketing-start-up-atom-tickets-hopes-to-fill-theaters.html|title=A Movie Ticketing Start-Up Hopes to Fill Empty Seats|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2016-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-16|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2016/04/27/atom-tickets-lobs-bomb-at-fandango-movietickets.html|title=Atom Tickets Lobs Bomb at Fandango, MovieTickets.com|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In July 2009, it was revealed that Fandango and other websites, including [[buy.com]] and [[Orbitz]], were linked with controversial Web loyalty programs, also known as [[Post-transaction marketing|post-transaction marketers]]. Fandango reportedly gave the third party access to Fandango customers' credit cards.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10293633-93.html | title=Buy.com, Orbitz linked to controversial marketers | work=CNET | date=July 24, 2009 | accessdate=April 29, 2011 | author=Sandoval, Greg}}</ref>

In December 2013, Fandango launched a trademark dispute when [[WWE]] tried to trademark the name for use by the [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango (ne Johnny Curtis)]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/another-tribute-to-the-troops-photo-fandango-wwe-issues|work=eWrestlingNews|title=Another Tribute to the Tropps: Fandango WWE Issues}}</ref>

In August 2014, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] ("FTC") approved final orders settling charges against Fandango for misrepresenting to the public the security of their mobile app and for failing to protect the transmission of Fandango customers' sensitive personal information.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Meena|title=FTC Settlement Requires Fandango and Credit Karma to Establish Comprehensive Security Programs to Protect Consumers' Sensitive Personal Information|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/ftc-settlement-requires-fandango-and-credit-karma-to-establish-comprehensive-securit|accessdate=August 24, 2014|work=The National Law Review|publisher=[[Covington & Burling]] LLP|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> The Fandango mobile app assured consumers, during checkout, that their credit card information was stored and transmitted securely.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fandango, Credit Karma Settle FTC Charges that They Deceived Consumers By Failing to Securely Transmit Sensitive Personal Information|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/03/fandango-credit-karma-settle-ftc-charges-they-deceived-consumers|website=ftc.gov/|publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> However, the FTC claims against Fandango focused on failures relating to both the implementation and testing of the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] "SSL" certificates for 4 years following the mobile app's launch in March 2009. According to the FTC, Fandango commissioned security audits in 2011, but the audits were limited in scope and did not review the security of the app's transmission of information. The FTC also alleged that Fandango did not implement effective channels for security complaints and instead relied on its general customer service system to handle security vulnerability reporting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=LaRose|first1=Cynthia J.|author2=Romero, Jake|title=Stop Phoning It in on Mobile Security: What Your Business Needs to Know About the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma|journal=The National Law Review|date=March 4, 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/stop-phoning-it-mobile-security-what-your-business-needs-to-know-about-federal-trade|accessdate=August 24, 2014|issn=2161-3362}}</ref>

In October 2015, [[FiveThirtyEight]] published a story and podcast calling Fandango's metrics on user ratings into question.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/|title=Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango's|last=Hickey|first=Walt|date=2015-10-15|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rating-subjective-experiences-is-hard-but-fandango-is-really-bad-at-it/|title=Rating Subjective Experiences Is Hard, But Fandango Is Really Bad At It|last=Avirgan|first=Jody|date=2015-10-22|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The investigation noted that the site's method for calculating ratings made it rare for a movie to ever receive an overall rating below three stars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Machkovech|first1=Sam|title=FiveThirtyEight analysis finds inflated, rounded-up reviews at Fandango|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/10/fivethirtyeight-analysis-finds-inflated-rounded-up-reviews-at-fandango/|website=Arstechnica|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> The problem seemingly extended from Fandango's habit of rounding ratings up to the nearest half.<ref name="Verge">{{cite web|last1=Plaugic|first1=Lizzie|title=You probably should ignore Fandango movie ratings|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9545427/fandango-movie-reviews-inflated-stars|website=The Verge|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> Fandango, in response, noted that this was a glitch it was working to repair.<ref name="Verge"/> Nevertheless, [[Gizmodo]] cited the study after Fandango announced the purchase of [[Rotten Tomatoes]] amid fears that the purchase would "ruin" the site.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=Fandango Buys Rotten Tomatoes But Will Probably Ruin It|url=https://gizmodo.com/fandango-will-probably-ruin-rotten-tomatoes-1759743925|website=Gizmondo|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref>

In December 2017, Fandango received hundreds of complaints regarding its delivery of ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' tickets. ''Forbes'' reported that issues began within hours of advanced sales' becoming available for the new ''Star Wars'' film, with customers complaining of long wait times and website glitches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/10/star-wars-the-last-jedi-pre-sale-tickets-fandango/|work=Forbes|title=Stars Wars the Last Jedi Tickets Fandango}}</ref> Troubles for the company continued as many complained that they had paid for tickets which they never received, and the [[YouTube]] channel [[Red Letter Media]] referenced the complaint in their ''The Last Jedi'' review multiple times.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Customers found little to no support from Fandango's customer relations team, which ignored complaints whilst continuing to take payments.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==FandangoNow and Vudu==

Fandango manages two [[Video on demand|Video On Demand]] (VOD) movie streaming services.
