'''Aleksander Kwaśniewski''' ({{IPA-pl|alɛˈksandɛr kfaɕˈɲɛfskʲi|-|Pl-Aleksander Kwaśniewski.ogg}}; born 15 November 1954) is a Polish politician and journalist. He served as the [[President of Poland]] from 1995 to 2005. He was born in [[Białogard]], and during the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist rule]], he was active in the Socialist Union of Polish Students and was the Minister for Sport in the Communist government during the 1980s. After the fall of Communism, he became a leader of the left-wing [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], a successor to the former ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]], and a co-founder of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]].

Kwaśniewski was elected to the presidency in 1995, defeating the incumbent, [[Lech Wałęsa]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aleksander-Kwasniewski Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Polish politician at Encyclopaedia Britannica.]</ref> He was re-elected to a second and final term as president in 2000 in a decisive first-round victory. Although he was praised for attempting to further integrate [[Poland]] into the [[European Union]], he faced criticism for involving the country in the [[Iraq War]]. His term ended on 23 December 2005, when he handed over power to his elected successor, conservative [[Lech Kaczyński]].

==Early political career (1973–1995)==
From 1973–77, Kwaśniewski studied Transport Economics and Foreign Trade at the [[University of Gdańsk]], although he never graduated. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} He became politically active at this time, and joined the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in 1977, remaining a member until it was dissolved in 1990. An activist in the communist student movement until 1982, he held, among other positions, the chairmanship of the University Council of the Socialist Union of Polish Students (SZSP) from 1976–77 and the vice-chairmanship of the [[Gdańsk Voivodship]] Union from 1977–79. Kwaśniewski was a member of the SZSP supreme authorities from 1977–82. 

[[File:A.T.Kijowski&A.Kwasniewski.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kwaśniewski (left) on [[Andrzej Tadeusz Kijowski]]'s talk show in December 1994]]
From November 1981 to February 1984 he was the editor-in-chief of the communist-controlled student weekly ''ITD'', then editor-in-chief of the daily communist youth ''Sztandar Młodych'' from 1984–85. He was a co-founder of the first computer-science periodical in Poland, ''Bajtek'', in 1985. From 1985–87, Kwaśniewski was Minister for Youth Affairs in the [[Zbigniew Messner]] government, and then Chairman of the Committee for Youth and Physical Culture till June 1990. 

He joined the government of [[Mieczysław Rakowski]], first as a Cabinet Minister and then as chairman of the government Social-Political Committee from October 1988 to September 1989. A participant in the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round-Table negotiations]], he co-chaired the task group for trade-union pluralism with [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] and Romuald Sosnowski. As the PZPR was wound up, he became a founding member of the post-communist [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland|Social Democratic Party]] of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) from January to February 1990, and its first chairman until he assumed the presidency in December 1995. He was also one of the founding members of the coalition [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) in 1991. 

Kwaśniewski was an activist in the Student Sports Union from 1975–79 and the [[Polish Olympic Committee]] (PKOL); he later served as PKOL president from 1988–91. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Running for the [[Sejm]] from the [[Warsaw]] constituency in 1991, he won the largest number of votes (148,533), although did not win an absolute majority. Kwaśniewski headed the parliamentary caucus of the Democratic Left Alliance in his first and second terms (1991–1995). He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly from November 1993 to November 1995.

==Presidency (1995-2005)==
[[File:Z Aleksandrem Kwaśniewskim- gratulacje 1995 po wyborach prezydenckich.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Kwaśniewski]] receiving praises by supporters after his presidential victory in 1995]]
In an often bitter campaign, Kwaśniewski won the [[1995 Polish presidential election|presidential election in 1995]], collecting 51.7 percent of votes in the [[Two-round system|run-off]], against 48.3 percent for the incumbent, [[Lech Wałęsa]], the former [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader. Kwaśniewski's campaign slogans were "Let's choose the future" (''Wybierzmy przyszłość'') and "A Poland for all" (''Wspólna Polska''). Political opponents disputed his victory and produced evidence to show that he had lied about his education in registration documents and public presentations. There was also some mystery over his graduation from university. A law court confirmed that Kwaśniewski had lied about his record—and this did not come to light until after the election—but did not penalise him for it. Kwaśniewski took the presidential [[oath of office]] on 23 December 1995. Later the same day, he was sworn in as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces at the Warszawa First Fighter Wing, in [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

His political course resembled that of Wałęsa's in several key respects, such as the pursuit of closer ties to the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. Kwaśniewski also continued the transition to a [[market economy]] and the [[privatization]] of state-owned enterprises, although with less energy than his predecessor. 

Hoping to be seen as "the president of all Poles", including his political opponents, he quit the Social Democratic Party after the election. Later, he formed a coalition with the rightist government of [[Jerzy Buzek]] with few major conflicts and on several occasions, he stood against movements of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] government of [[Leszek Miller]]. At one moment, support for Kwaśniewski reached as high as 80% in popularity polls; most of the time it was over 50%.

In 1997, the Polish newspaper ''Zycie'' reported that Kwaśniewski had met former KGB officer [[Vladimir Alganov]] at the Baltic sea resort [[Cetniewo]] in 1994. First Kwaśniewski denied ever meeting Alganov and filed a libel suit against the newspaper. Eventually, Kwaśniewski admitted that he had met Alganov on official occasions, but denied meeting him in Cetniewo.<ref>[http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol6num4/constitutionwatch/poland.html East European Constitutional Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902091957/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol6num4/constitutionwatch/poland.html |date=2 September 2006}}. Volume 6 Number 4. Fall 1997.</ref>

Kwaśniewski's greatest achievement was his ability to bring about a new [[Constitution of Poland]] to replace the modified [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist document then still in use. The failure to create a new document had been a criticism often levelled at Wałęsa. Kwaśniewski actively campaigned for its approval in the subsequent referendum, and he signed it into law on 16 July 1997. He took an active part in the efforts to secure Polish membership of [[NATO]]. He headed Poland's delegation at the 1997 [[Madrid summit]], where Poland, the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Hungary]] were promised membership; and the [[Washington summit]], where on 26 February 1999, during the [[Kosovo conflict]], which he supported, he signed the instruments ratifying Poland's membership of NATO. He also took an active part in promoting further enlargement of the alliance, speaking out in favor of membership for a further seven states (see [[Prague summit]]) and the open-door policy that leaves open the option of further members. He was an author of the 2002 [[Riga Initiative]], a forum for cooperation between Central European states, aimed towards further enlargement of NATO and the European Union.

An advocate of regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe, Kwaśniewski hosted a summit of the region's leaders at [[Łańcut]] in 1996. Speaking out against the danger [[organized crime]] posed to the region, he submitted a draft of a convention on fighting organised crime to the UN in 1996. He was an active participant at meetings of regional leaders in [[Portorož]] in 1997, [[Levoča]] in 1998, and [[Lviv]] and [[Yalta]] in 1999. After a history of sometimes acrimonious relations with [[Lithuania]], Kwaśniewski was a driving force behind the presidential summit in [[Vilnius]] in 1997, at which the two countries' presidents signed a treaty of friendship. Poland subsequently became one of the strongest advocates of Lithuanian membership in [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] and the strongest advocate of [[Ukraine]] in Europe. In 2000 he was re-elected in the first round of voting, collecting 53.9 percent of the vote. His election campaign slogan was: "A home for all—Poland" (''Dom wszystkich—Polska''). On 23 December 2000, he took office for the second term.

Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], Kwaśniewski organized an international conference in Warsaw, with the participation of leaders from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe to strengthen regional activities in fighting international terrorism. Under Kwaśniewski's leadership, Poland became a strong ally of the United States in the [[War on Terror]] and contributed troops in the [[Iraq War]], a move that was highly controversial in Poland and Europe. Poland was in charge of a sector of Iraq after the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Polish membership of the [[European Union]] became a reality on 1 May 2004, during Kwaśniewski's second term. Both he and his wife [[Jolanta Kwaśniewska|Jolanta]] had campaigned for approval of the EU accession treaty in June 2003. He strongly supported including mention of Europe's Christian roots into the [[European Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/06/04/wkwas04.xml]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051029122834/http://www.prezydent.pl/x.node?id=3666]</ref> Thanks to his close relations with [[Leonid Kuchma]], in late 2004 he became a mediator in a political conflict in Ukraine – the [[Orange Revolution]], and according to some commentators, he played the major role in its peaceful solution.

After the release of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] in December 2014, Kwaśniewski admitted that he had agreed in 2003 to host a secret [[CIA]] [[black site]] in Poland, but that activities were to be carried out in accordance to Polish law. He said that a U.S. draft memorandum had stated that "people held in Poland are to be treated as prisoners of war and will be afforded all the rights they are entitled to", but due to time constraints, the U.S. had not signed the memorandum. The U.S. had conducted activities in great secrecy at [[Stare Kiejkuty (base)|the site]].<ref name=telegraph-20141210>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/11286267/Polish-president-admits-Poland-agreed-to-host-secret-CIA-black-site.html |title=Polish president admits Poland agreed to host secret CIA 'black site' |author=Matthew Day |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>

===Controversial pardons===
In December 2005, when his presidency was coming to an end, he granted [[clemency]] for a post-Communist deputy minister of Justice Zbigniew Sobotka, who had been sentenced for 3.5 years of prison for revealing a state secret (effectively, he warned gangsters about an operation against them). Kwaśniewski changed the prison sentence to [[probation]].<ref>{{in lang|pl}} ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' article [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,47243,3072146.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231074520/http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,47243,3072146.html |date=31 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>

Sobotka was convicted and sentenced to jail but the presidential pardon freed him.}}</ref>

Another case of Kwaśniewski's controversial granting of [[pardon]]s was the [[Peter Vogel (banker)|Peter Vogel]] case. The story goes back to 1971 when Piotr Filipczyński, a.k.a. Peter Vogel was sentenced to 25 years in jail for a brutal murder (shortened to 15 years in 1979). Surprisingly enough, in 1983 (during [[martial law in Poland]]) he was granted a passport and allowed to leave the country. He returned in 1990 soon earning the nickname "the accountant of the Left" as a former Swiss banker who took care of more than thirty accounts of Polish [[Democratic Left Alliance|social democrats]]. Despite an arrest warrant issued in 1987, Vogel moved freely in Poland and was eventually arrested in 1998 in Switzerland. After Vogel's extradition to Poland, in 1999 Kwaśniewski initiated the procedure of granting him amnesty. In December 2005 (a few days before leaving his office) Kwaśniewski pardoned Vogel despite the negative opinion of the procurer.<ref>[http://www.iwp.edu/news/newsID.315/news_detail.asp The institute of world politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317171437/http://www.iwp.edu/news/newsID.315/news_detail.asp |date=17 March 2007 }}, retrieved on 1 January 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=85649] {{in lang|pl}} [[Wprost]] article</ref>

===Rywingate===
Kwaśniewski refused in 2003 to face a special parliamentary commission,<ref>[http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1098.cfm Poland: Paper Chase], [http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/2877/ Endgame Sans President]</ref> which was set up to reveal all circumstances linked with [[Rywingate]]. Kwaśniewski argued, that the constitution did not allow parliamentary commissions to investigate the president, and there were no clear law opinions. The commission decided eventually not to summon Kwaśniewski.<ref>{{in lang|pl}}  http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/polityka/article,Prezydent,id,49332.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065429/http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/polityka/article,Prezydent,id,49332.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> For a second time Kwaśniewski refused as a witness to face the commission investigating the privatization of [[Orlen]] petrol concern, in March 2005. He argued that the actions of commission members, being in opposition to the leftist government supported by him, were directed against him.<ref>{{in lang|pl}}. He sought to undermine the commission by releasing considerable amounts of information to journalists while only belatedly making it available to the commission members.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/polish/domestic/story/2005/03/050307_kwasniewski_commission.shtml BBCPolska.com]</ref>

===Member of secret police allegations===
In 2007, [[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]] revealed that Kwaśniewski was registered during communist times as an agent "Alek" of the secret police, the Security Service (''[[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]]'' – SB), from 1983 to 1989. Kwaśniewski himself denied having been an agent in a special statement, demanded from politicians by Polish law, and a court confirmed his statement.<ref>{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.dziennik.pl/polityka/article54626/Kwasniewski_oszukiwal_nawet_esbekow.html Dziennik – Kwaśniewski oszukiwał nawet esbeków] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305005125/http://www.dziennik.pl/polityka/article54626/Kwasniewski_oszukiwal_nawet_esbekow.html |date=5 March 2009 }}</ref>

==Post-presidency==
On 7 March 2006, Kwaśniewski was appointed Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership at [[Georgetown University]], where he teaches students in the [[School of Foreign Service|Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] about contemporary European politics, the trans-Atlantic relationship, and democratization in Central and Eastern Europe. He also teaches a course on political leadership, convened by Professor Carol Lancaster, with former Spanish Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=13238 |title=Former Polish President Joins SFS Faculty |access-date=8 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317011436/http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=13238 |archive-date=17 March 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He is also Chairman of the supervisory board of the [[International Centre for Policy Studies]] in Kiev, Ukraine and a member of the International Honorary Council<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diplomats.pl/en/component/content/article/473.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202143035/http://diplomats.pl/en/component/content/article/473.html |archivedate=2 February 2014  }}</ref> of the European Academy of Diplomacy.

In 2008 Aleksander Kwaśniewski became Chairman of the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]], a not-for-profit organization established to monitor [[Toleration|tolerance]] in Europe, prepare practical recommendations to governments and [[international organisation]]s on improving interreligious and interethnic relations on the continent. The organization is co-chaired by [[European Jewish Fund]] President [[Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor]].

Since June 2012 Kwaśniewski and [[Pat Cox]] lead a [[European Parliament]] monitoring mission in [[Ukraine]] to monitor the [[Criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010|criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko]], [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] and [[Valeriy Ivaschenko]].<ref>[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/ukraine-welcomes-prolongation-of-cox-kwasniewski-mission-until-fall-says-kozhara/ Ukraine welcomes prolongation of Cox-Kwasniewski mission until fall, says Kozhara], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (18 April 2013)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/145261.html Cox-Kwasniewski mission to visit Ukraine in late March, planning to visit Tymoshenko], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (19 March 2013)</ref>

Since 2011, Kwaśniewski has served on the [[Concordia Summit|Leadership Council for Concordia]], a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future.

Kwaśniewski was also involved with the EU talks with the Ukrainian government about the association agreement with the EU that the Ukrainian parliament failed to ratify in November 2013.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-tymoshenko-bill-rejected/25175222.html]</ref> After the [[Euromaidan|Maidan unrest]] had installed the transitional government under [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk|Yatsenyuk]], who signed the EU association agreement for Ukraine in 2014, Kwaśniewski took up in a director's post in the gas company ″[[Burisma Holdings]] Limited″ which owns licenses for the major Ukrainian gas fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://burisma.com/board-of-directors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514022640/http://burisma.com/board-of-directors/ |archivedate=14 May 2014  }}</ref>

===Possible illegal lobbying on behalf of Paul Manafort===
In a plea agreement [[Trials of Paul Manafort|filed in United States Federal court]] on 14 September 2018, former Donald Trump campaign chair [[Paul Manafort]] admitted to organizing a group of former European heads of state to illegally lobby, starting in 2011, on behalf of then-Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. The plea agreement describes one of the heads of state involved in this secret lobbying as a "former Polish President" who "was also a representative of the European Parliament with oversight responsibility for Ukraine."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/302-paul-manafort-court-documents/c44625ae1d687a0163b2/optimized/full.pdf#page=36 |title=Re: United States vs. Paul J.
