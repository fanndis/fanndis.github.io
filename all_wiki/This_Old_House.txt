'''''This Old House''''' is an American [[home improvement]] media brand with television shows, a magazine and a website, ThisOldHouse.com. The brand is headquartered in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. The television series airs on the American television network [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) and follows remodeling projects of houses over a number of weeks. Boston PBS station [[WGBH-TV]] originally created the program and produced it from its inception in 1979 until 2001 when Time Inc. acquired the television assets and formed This Old House Ventures. WGBH also distributed episodes to PBS until 2019 when [[WETA-TV]] became the distributor starting with the first episode of season 41.<ref>https://current.org/2019/06/this-old-house-moves-from-presenter-wgbh-to-weta/</ref> [[Warner Bros. Domestic Television]] distributes the series to commercial television stations in syndication. Time Inc. launched ''This Old House'' magazine in 1995, focusing on home how-to, know-how and inspiration.
 
In 2016, Time Inc. sold This Old House Ventures to executive Eric Thorkilsen and private equity firm TZP Growth Partners (although it will continue to have a special partnership deal with its former parent company).<ref>{{Cite web| last1 = Lieberman| first1 = David| title = Time Inc.

==Overview==
''This Old House'' and its sister series ''Ask This Old House'' are often broadcast together as ''The This Old House Hour'', which was originally known as ''The New This Old House Hour''. Both shows are owned by This Old House Ventures, Inc. and are underwritten by [[GMC Truck|GMC]] and [[The Home Depot]]. [[Weyerhauser]] lumber distributor, a previous underwriter, by 1989 had donated more than $1,000,000 a year to the show.<ref name="Beck">{{Cite news

</ref>  ''This Old House'' is also underwritten by [[State Farm Insurance]], [[HomeServe]], and [[Marvin Windows and Doors]]. Other underwriters throughout the show's tenure included Parks Corporation, [[Glidden (paints)|Glidden]], [[Montgomery Ward]], [[Ace Hardware]], [[Kohler Company|Kohler]], [[Schlage]], [[Century 21 Real Estate]], [[Toro (company)|Toro]], [[ERA Real Estate]], [[Angie's List]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], and [[Lumber Liquidators]], Inc. Two of the original underwriters were [[Weyerhauser]] and [[Owens-Corning]].

The third series to share the name is ''Inside This Old House'', a retrospective featuring highlights from previous episodes. Old episodes are also shown under the program name ''This Old House Classics'' and were formerly shown on [[The Learning Channel]] under the name ''The Renovation Guide''. Only the episodes with original host [[Bob Vila]] aired under that name. {{As of|2006}}, ''Classics'' are also carried on the commercial [[non-broadcast network|non-broadcast]] [[DIY Network]] as well as syndicated to local TV stations.

''This Old House''  was one of the earliest home improvement shows on national television. As such, it was initially controversial among building contractors, and the cast was afraid that they were giving away secrets of the building trades.<ref>{{cite news|last=Storrs|first=Francis|title=This Old House: An Oral History|newspaper=Boston Magazine|date=February 2009|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/2009/01/this-old-house/}}</ref> As time passed, however, the show grew into a cultural icon. Producer-director Russell Morash became known as the "Father of How-To."<ref>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Geneva|title=Russell Morash: This old Yankee leads a guerrilla crew|url=http://www.current.org/wp-content/themes/current/archive-site/people/peop711m.html|newspaper=Current|date=June 23, 1997}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Kevin oconnor 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]], current host since 2003]]

Begun in 1979 as a one-time, 13-part series airing on WGBH, ''This Old House'' has grown into one of the most popular programs on the network. It has produced spin-offs (notably ''[[The New Yankee Workshop]]'' hosted by [[Norm Abram]]), a magazine, and for-profit web sites. The show has won 17 [[Emmy Awards]] and received 82 nominations.

Although WGBH acquired the first two project houses (6 Percival Street in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] and the [[Dr. Henry Jacob Bigelow House|Bigelow House]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]) for renovation,<ref>Bob Vila's This Old House (1981), {{ISBN|0-525-47670-9}}, pages 22 to 39.</ref> the series then focused on renovating older houses, including those of modest size and value, with the homeowners doing some of the work, as a form of [[sweat equity]]. The series covering the renovation of the Westwood house (Weatherbee Farm) became something of a cult classic because of an escalating dispute between the hosts, Vila and Abram, and the homeowners over the direction the project was taking. Vila remarked at the end of the Westwood series that the owners could have contributed more "sweat equity." As the show evolved, it began to focus on higher-end, luxury homes with more of the work done by expert contractors and tradespeople.

Vila left ''This Old House'' in 1989 following a dispute over his doing commercials, and created a similar show called ''Bob Vila's Home Again''. According to news reporter Barbara Beck, Vila was fired by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] over making TV commercials for [[Rickel|Rickel Home Centers]], [[The Home Depot]]'s competitor. Home Depot, the show's underwriter, dropped its local sponsorship for ''This Old House'' after Vila made the commercials. Vila was fired in an effort to have Home Depot return as a sponsor to the show. During Vila's tenure, the show drew 11&nbsp;million viewers and had won five [[Emmys]]. [[Weyerhauser]], at this time a supplier for The Home Depot, stopped underwriting the show.<ref name="Beck" />  [[Steve Thomas (television)|Steve Thomas]] took over hosting duties after Vila's departure, remaining with the program until 2003. Cast members later complained that Vila took up too much screen time, and noted that the show became more of an ensemble production after he left.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sharpsteen|first=Bill|title=If I Were a Carpenter|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-22/magazine/tm-5671_1_stucco-house|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 22, 1997}}</ref>

[[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]] is the current host of ''This Old House''. Before O'Connor joined the cast, he was a homeowner who appeared on ''Ask This Old House'', having problems with wallpaper removal. While O'Connor has been the host, Abram's role has increased to that of a near co-host. In at least a couple of season opening episodes (Cambridge, Carlisle, and Austin), Abram has appeared with O'Connor to introduce the new project. Abram also filled in for O'Connor when his son was born during the Carlisle project.

Beginning with the 2007–08 season, ''This Old House'' and ''Ask This Old House'', were presented in a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] format.

To celebrate its 30th anniversary season, ''This Old House'' worked with Nuestra Comunidad to renovate a foreclosed home in Boston's [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood. Nuestra Comunidad is a non-profit development corporation that acquired this 1870s-era Second Empire home from a bank.

In 2016, Time Inc. sold This Old House to a joint venture operating as This Old House Ventures, LLC.<ref>https://adage.com/article/media/time-sells-house-magazine-brand/303363</ref>

To celebrate the 40th season in 2019, a retrospective and revisit of some of the more notable projects was incorporated into a handful of episodes with some of the original homeowners providing tours. The first house highlighted was the original project house in Dorchester.

==Theme music==
For the first 23 seasons (1979–2002), ''This Old House'' used the first theme song, which is the clarinet sound of "[[Louisiana Fairy Tale]]", composed by [[Haven Gillespie]], [[Mitchell Parish]] and [[J. Fred Coots]] and performed by 20th-century jazz artist [[Fats Waller]]. The theme song changed after This Old House Ventures bought the series from WGBH. In Season 24 (2002–2003), "Louisiana Fairy Tale" was removed entirely due to copyright issues, and was replaced by "This Old House '97", which was composed by Peter Bell. A new theme song followed in Season 30 (2009–2010). [[Bill Janovitz]] composed the show's current theme song, which was first used in Season 33 (2012–2013).

==''Ask This Old House''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}
[[File:Ask This Old House logo.png|thumb|upright=0.5|''Ask This Old House'' logo]]

In 2002, Time Inc. created a spinoff of ''This Old House'' entitled '''''Ask This Old House'''''. The show was inspired by a similar feature in ''This Old House Magazine''.  It takes place in "the [[loft]]" of a rural [[barn]] somewhere in the Boston area. The regulars on the show are [[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]], [[Tom Silva]], [[Richard Trethewey]], and [[Roger Cook (landscaper)|Roger Cook]].  [[Norm Abram]] does not appear on ''Ask This Old House''. Magazine readers or show viewers submit home repair or improvement questions to the four regulars. Guest experts answer more specialized questions. Most of the questions are answered in the loft, but one or two homeowners in each episode receive a visit from one of the show's tradesmen. The visits come from a guest tradesman if the project is related to electrical or painting needs. The tradesman assists in starting or completing the task with the homeowners' help. O'Connor sometimes assists in these projects. ''Ask This Old House'' had a segment called "What Is It?". In this segment, three of the four regulars offer humorous guesses as to the function of an unusual tool. The fourth regular reveals its actual use. Beginning with the 2007-2008 season, ''Ask This Old House'' added a "useful tip" segment provided by a viewer of the show. The useful tip segment is a revival of a short-lived feature of ''This Old House'' when Vila hosted the show. The opening sequence of ''Ask This Old House'' consisted of a [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] van towing the blue ''Ask This Old House'' trailer from around [[Massachusetts]], before reaching the barn at the end. The twenty-five-second version of the opening sequence shows Silva, the passenger, picking up four coffees from a [[drive-through]]. The original version had Steve Thomas as the driver. The forty-second version of the opening sequence shows [[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]] as the driver. In both versions, after the van pulls into the barn driveway, the footage cuts to Trethewey handing out the coffees to the other three regulars. Prior to [[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]]'s installation as host, the van driver was Steve Thomas, the host for the show's first season. ''Ask This Old House'' has been nominated for five [[Emmy Award]]s.

==''Inside This Old House''==

|}

A short-lived spin-off of the ''This Old House'' franchise, '''''Inside This Old House''''' was shown primarily on the [[A&E Network]], and originally aired from 2003 to 2004. The show was very much like ''Ask This Old House'': it was shot mainly in the "loft", hosted by O'Connor and features the regular experts listed above and also Abram (master carpenter). However, unlike ''Ask This Old House'', usually one or two experts were used throughout the episode and a specific theme was discussed. The theme was usually a particular topic (e.g. landscaping, installing doors, etc.). Along with the in-house expert, and sometimes a guest expert, clips were shown of past episodes of ''This Old House'' (mainly the original episodes with Bob Vila) to further illustrate the point, as well as revisiting past projects undertaken over the previous twenty-five years to see what the homeowners have done since airing. Each episode ended with a segment called "Inside Out", which featured one of two guest commentators Jimmy Dunn and Doreen Vigue, and one of the experts, with a brief and comedic overview of what was discussed on the show.

==''This Old House: Trade School''==
In 2017, [[The CW]] network began airing a new spin-off, ''This Old House: Trade School''.  It is also hosted by [[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]], and features the stars of ''This Old House'': Norm Abram, Tom Silva, Richard Trethewey and Roger Cook, showing what it is like to work alongside these seasoned pros.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.onemagnificentmorning.com/programs/this-old-house-trade-school/ | title=This Old House: Trade School}}</ref>  Some of the content may be repackaged from ''This Old House''.

The first host of ''This Old House'' was designer builder, and remodeling expert Bob Vila. He hosted the program from 1979 to 1989. In 1989, Vila left ''This Old House'' to become a spokesman for [[Sears Roebuck & Company]]. From 1990 to 2005, he hosted ''Bob Vila's Home Again'', and from 2005 to 2007, he hosted ''Bob Vila''. He was followed by Steve Thomas, who hosted from 1989 to 2003. In 2003, Thomas left the show, and was replaced by current host [[Kevin O'Connor (television)|Kevin O'Connor]].

==Television production team==
{{As of|2013}}, the television production team is as follows:
* [[Russell Morash]] (Creator)
* Chris Wolfe (General Manager, This Old House Productions)
* John Tomlin (Senior Series Producer, ''This Old House'')
* Heath Racela (Senior Series Producer, ''Ask This Old House'')

==In popular culture==
Like many successful programs, ''This Old House'' has found its way into the humorist's eye on occasion. The most famous example is ''Tool Time'', the "show-within-a-show" on the American television situation comedy ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''. [[Tim Allen]] played Tim Taylor, a character inspired by Bob Vila, while [[Richard Karn]] portrayed [[Al Borland]], a character based on [[Norm Abram]]. Bob Vila also guest-starred from time to time as Tim's rival and archenemy; in one episode in 1994, Vila challenged Tim to a hot rod race, and Tim tells Vila that he will kick Vila back to "That Old House", and Vila tells Tim that he's no longer on "This Old House", and that, he started a new show called "Home Again" and Tim said he'll kick Vila "Home Again."

[[HBO]]'s ''Hardcore TV'' parodied ''This Old House'' as "This Old Whore House", "This Old House of Style", and "This Old House Party". ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' parodied the show as "This Old Brain", as well as "This Old Climate", both featured [[Pat Cashman]] as Bob Liam. [[Nick at Nite]]'s ''[[On the Television]]'' parodied the show as "This Old Backyard". In 1985, PBS produced a parody of ''This Old House'', which is titled as "This Old Shack". The parody featured Bob Villa, and master carpenter Paul Thumbs, in a 3-part rehab in Arlington. ''[[Almost Live!]]'' parodied ''This Old House'' as "This Here Place", which featured [[Pat Cashman]] as Bob Bobbin. Fox's ''[[In Living Color]]'' parodied ''This Old House'' as "This Ol' Box". [[Damon Wayans]] portrayed a homeless person named Anton Jackson, who talks about renovating a large cardboard box where he lived. [[The Disney Channel]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse Club|The All New Mickey Mouse Club]]'' parodied the show as "This Old Home", which featured renovations on the candy house from [[Hansel and Gretel]]. [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] portrayed Bob Vilalala (a parody of Bob Vila). In 1986, ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' parodied ''This Old House'' as "This House Needs Work with David Letterman", where [[Chris Elliott]] portrayed a head carpenter. In 2000, Blame Society Productions released a parody of ''This Old House'', which is titled as "My Old House with Bob Voila", adding the words "ass", "snack", and "ham".

In 1988, [[John Larroquette]] portrayed [[Bob Vila]] on the [[NBC]] late night sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', parodying ''This Old House'', where he rehabilitates an 1865 Victorian farmhouse, as low bearing walls that sweat blood, with homeowners Tom ([[Kevin Nealon]]) and Peggy McGuinness ([[Victoria Jackson]]). In 1989, [[Phil Hartman]] portrayed a robot named XG-7000, who hosted a PBS show called "Robot Repair." He instructed viewers on how to repair a grandfather clock. XG-7000 told the producer by changing the title. The following week, the show was presented with a new title, such as "Robot Repair and You", "Explaining Robots", and "Let's Fix, Robots", due to XG-7000's frustration. The following week, the show was presented as "This Old Robot", XG-7000 stormed off the set to kill the producer, telling that the producer must be destroyed. On a Fox show called "Fugitive Robots", which is a parody of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', [[Jon Lovitz]] portrayed an FBI agent, who remarked that XG-7000 was wanted for brutal murder. He explains that the show was called "Robot Restoration", and was supposedly about how to fix robots. The skit ends with the text reading onscreen: "Fugitive Robots, previously known as Robot Apprehension". [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s long running sketch comedy show ''[[Mad TV]]'' did a parody called "This Cold House". In the seventh season of the second series of ''[[ZOOM (1999 TV series)|ZOOM]]'', there was a parody of ''This Old House'' which was known as "This Old Place". There, "Abe Norman" (a parody of [[Norm Abram]]) played by [[Kyle Morrow]], would fix something (example: [[washing machine]]) that would never end up as it should. On one occasion, he put a gown in a washing machine and it came out as the shirt he was wearing currently.
