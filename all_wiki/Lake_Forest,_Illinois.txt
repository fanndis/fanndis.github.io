'''Lake Forest''' is a city located in [[Lake County, Illinois]], [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] it had a population of 19,375.<ref name="Census 2010">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1741105| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212175818/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1741105| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Lake Forest city, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| access-date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> The city is along the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and is a part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]].

Lake Forest was founded together with [[Lake Forest College]]; it was laid out as a town in 1857, and was a stop for travelers making their way south to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. The Lake Forest City Hall, designed by [[Charles Sumner Frost]], was completed in 1898. It originally housed the fire department, the [[Lake Forest Library]], and city offices.<ref>''A Preservation Foundation Guide to National Register Properties, Lake Forest, Illinois. Second ed.''

==History==
The [[Potawatomi]] inhabited Lake County before the United States Federal Government forced them out in 1836 as part of [[Indian Removal]] of tribes to areas west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-04-22-8701310119-story.html|title = Lake Forest and Lake Bluff have Grown from Same Roots|last = Solomon|first = Jeremy|date = April 22, 1987|work = Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

As Lake Forest was first developed in 1857, the planners laid roads that would provide limited access to the city in an effort to prevent outside traffic and isolate the tranquil settlement from neighboring areas. Though the town is considerably more accessible today, due in part to the extensive new construction taking place further west, the much smaller neighborhood of eastern Lake Forest, near the coast of [[Lake Michigan]], remains relatively secluded. It is one of the most scenic, historical, and architecturally significant suburbs of Chicago.  These neighborhoods include estates and homes designed by distinguished architects such as [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]], [[David Adler (architect)|David Adler]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Arthur Heun, Jerome Cerny, [[Henry Ives Cobb]], and modernist [[George Fred Keck]], among others. Landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] also designed projects in Lake Forest. [[Market Square (Lake Forest, Illinois)|Market Square]], designed by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]], was completed in 1916 as a commercial center for Lake Forest.

Lake Forest had an African-American community from very early on in its history. Members of this community established the African Methodist Episcopal Church as of 1866, and it stood at what is now the corner of Maplewood and Washington Road.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Arpee|first=Edward|title=Lake Forest, Illinois; history and reminiscences, 1861-1961.|publisher=Rotary Club of Lake Forest|year=1963|pages=76}}</ref> 

The secluded style of Lake Forest was intended as a form of protection. According to the president of the Lake Forest-Lake Bluff Historical Society, the captains of industry and upper-class elite who first settled in Lake Forest sought a refuge from late 19th and early 20th-century Chicago. In their view, the city was overrun with immigrants from southern and eastern Europe who had dangerous socialist ideas and indulged in excessive alcoholic consumption.<ref name=":1" />

Country clubs became important centers of social activity in Lake Forest's early decades. The Onwentsia Club was, in the words of one writer, "the premiere social and sporting club in the Midwest".<ref name=":1" /> In 1898, members held a plantation-themed party, dining on fried chicken, corn on the cob, and watermelon served by—in keeping with the party's theme—"little colored girls".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|title = Dinner in Dixie Style: Novel Entertainment Given by the Onwentsia Club.|date = September 3, 1898|work = Chicago Daily Tribune}}</ref> After-dinner entertainment included a [[minstrel show]].<ref name=":2" /> This was a period in United States history in which there was considerable interest in Southern culture and the mythical plantation society. Both the North and South were active in memorializing their contributions to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], as well as achieving a kind of reconciliation that, according to historian [[David W. Blight]], pushed issues of race to the side.<ref>David W. Blight, ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', Belknap Press, 2002</ref>

One of Lake Forest's most notable features is its virgin [[prairie]]s and other [[nature preserve]]s. In 1967, a group of 12 long-time residents of Lake Forest formed a [[conservation movement|land conservation]] organization, Lake Forest Open Lands Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfola.org|title=Lake Forest Open Lands Association}}</ref>  Its express purpose was to purchase or otherwise set aside the rapidly disappearing [[Urban open space|open spaces]] in the city, in the interests of preserving [[animal]] [[habitat]], restoring [[ecosystem]]s, and providing [[environmental education]] for the city's children. In the next 38 years, the group managed to acquire more than {{convert|700|acre|km2}} within the city limits, which now form six nature preserves with {{convert|12|mi|km}} of [[trail#Walking trails|walking trail]]s open to the public.

Preserved in perpetuity are [[wetland]]s, original pre-1830 prairie, [[woodland]], and [[savanna]], all within the community. The restoration of these lands is celebrated by an annual "Bagpipes and Bonfire" event in September, which started as a community event in which controlled fires were burned to clear underbrush and preserve the savannah. From an early time, the playing of bagpipes has accompanied the community gathering, as the town had numerous Scots-Irish residents in its early years. This has also been an annual fundraising event for Lake Forest Open Lands Association.<ref>[http://www.lfola.org/bagpipes-bonfire-0 "Bagpipes & Bonfire"], Lake Forest Open Lands Association</ref>

[[Ragdale|The Ragdale Foundation]], an artists' community and residence, is located in Lake Forest. Formerly [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]]'s summer retreat and built in 1897, the estate has accommodated notable artist [[Sylvia Shaw Judson]].

Lake Forest was a [[sundown town]] not only to African Americans, but [[American Jews|Jews]] too. It excluded both from living within the city-limits and kept anti-Jewish and anti-[[African-American]] housing covenants until 1990.<ref>{{cite book |authors=Higley, Stephen R. |title=Privilege, Power, and Place: The Geography of the American Upper Class |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=1995 |pages=61–63}}</ref>

In 1992, Lake Forest gained national attention when it attempted to ban the sale of offensive music to anyone under the age of 18.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title = Lake Forest calls cops on racy CD lyrics|last = Parons|first = Christi and Cindy Schreuder|date = September 10, 1992|work = Chicago Tribune|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-09-10-9203220521-story.html}}</ref> City council members used existing ordinances against obscenity—defined in the codes as "morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion"—to buttress their campaign.<ref name=":0" /> Mayor Charles Clarke stated, "If they sell an obscene tape to somebody underage, we will prosecute."<ref name=":0" /> The person who came up most frequently in discussions of obscene content was [[Ice-T]], a rapper who has since also performed as an actor.

Lake Forest has been named a [[Tree City USA]] by the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] in recognition of its commitment to community forest.  As of 2006, Lake Forest had received this national honor for 26 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The actor [[Mr. T]] notably angered the town by cutting down more than 100 oak trees on his estate, in what is now referred to as the "Lake Forest Chain Saw Massacre."<ref>{{cite news| last=Johnson| first=Dirk| title=Genteel Chicago Suburb Rages Over Mr. T's Tree Massacre| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/30/us/genteel-chicago-suburb-rages-over-mr-t-s-tree-massacre.html| newspaper=New York Times| access-date=May 1, 2011| date=May 30, 1987}}</ref>

==Commercial development==

Commercial development in Lake Forest is focused in three areas, two of which have public railway stations. The central business district includes a [[Metra]] commuter railroad station on the [[Union Pacific/North Line]]. It extends beyond Market Square, providing a mixture of retail, banking, and professional services, as well as restaurants.  Market Square is composed of a wide variety of shops and restaurants, including [[Talbots]], [[Williams Sonoma (brand)|Williams Sonoma]], [[J.Crew]], and [[Einstein Bros. Bagels]]. The business district to the west includes a Metra commuter railroad station on the [[Milwaukee District/North Line]]. It extends beyond Settlers' Square to provide a mixture of retail, banking and professional services, as well as restaurants. A third area of business development, consisting mostly of corporate and office space, has been developed along the city's northwestern border with the [[Tri-State Tollway]].

The headquarters of [[Fortune 500]] companies [[Tenneco]], [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick]], and [[Hospira]] are located in Lake Forest; [[Akorn]], Covered Logistics, [[Horizon Therapeutics]], [[IDEX Corporation|IDEX]], [[Packaging Corporation of America]], [[Pactiv]], [[Prestone]], and [[Trustmark Companies|Trustmark]] also have their headquarters in Lake Forest, while [[W. W. Grainger]] and [[BFG Technologies]] are located in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] Lake County, near Lake Forest. The [[Chicago Bears]] training facility and headquarters, [[Halas Hall]], opened in 1997 in west Lake Forest, and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] now train at the Bears' previous facility located on the campus of Lake Forest.

Lake Forest is the base for Linking Efforts Against Drugs (LEAD),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leadingefforts.org|title=LEAD - Substance Abuse Prevention for Communities|website=www.leadingefforts.org|access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> a national organization aimed at discouraging youth from getting involved in drugs.

==Polo==
Lake Forest is noted in the [[Chicago]] area for its history of [[polo]], once being the westernmost establishment of the sport in the United States. It was home to the "East-West clash of 1933", in which a team of "Westerners" (who would today be considered [[Midwesterners]]), challenged the best of the Eastern US polo teams, winning two of three matches. Box seats sold for $5.50, and the general public was admitted for $1.10. The Chicago press covered the match extensively, including the arrival of every horse and player, the color of the horseflesh, and the color of the goalposts. The match was described as a "gleaming moment in American polo, if not the very zenith of the game in this country." In the early 21st century, Lake Forest continues the tradition, and polo is played yearly throughout August.
