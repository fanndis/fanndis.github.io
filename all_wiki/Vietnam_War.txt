These included a total of 45,707 single-barrel shotguns, 611 armoured cars and smaller numbers of carbines and pistols. Writing in 1975, he revealed that "we had clandestinely been giving 'aid' to Vietnam since early 1958. Published American archival sources now reveal that the actual Malaysian contributions to the war effort in Vietnam included the following: "over 5,000 Vietnamese officers trained in Malaysia; training of 150 U.S. soldiers in handling Tracker Dogs; a rather impressive list of military equipment and weapons given to Viet-Nam after the end of the Malaysian insurgency (for example, 641 armored personnel carriers, 56,000 shotguns); and a creditable amount of civil assistance (transportation equipment, cholera vaccine, and flood relief)". It is undeniable that the Government's policy of supporting the South Vietnamese regime with arms, equipment and training was regarded by some quarters, especially the Opposition parties, as a form of interfering in the internal affairs of that country and the Tunku's valiant efforts to defend it were not convincing enough, from a purely foreign policy standpoint. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191310/http://www.idfr.gov.my/images/stories/publication/2008/tunku.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

By 1964, 23,000 US advisors were stationed in South Vietnam. In the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] in August, a U.S. [[destroyer]] was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] and gave President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] broad authority to increase American military presence in Vietnam. Johnson ordered the deployment of [[Military organization|combat units]] for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000.<ref name=AWL/> Past this point, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) (also known as the North Vietnamese Army or NVA) engaged in more [[conventional warfare]] with U.S and South Vietnamese forces. Despite little progress, the United States continued a significant build-up of forces. U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|287}} U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on [[air supremacy|air superiority]] and overwhelming firepower to conduct [[search and destroy]] operations, involving [[army|ground forces]], [[artillery]], and [[airstrike]]s. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.

The [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|481}} The CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north.{{sfn|Military History Institute of Vietnam|2002|pp=247–249}} In 1969, North Vietnam declared a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces began more conventional [[combined arms]] warfare. By 1970, over 70% of communist troops in the south were northerners, and southern-dominated VC units no longer existed.<ref>Kiernan, Ben.

Oxford University Press, Feb. 2017, page 447.</ref> Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch [[Norodom Sihanouk]] by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the [[Khmer Rouge]], escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-ARVN [[Cambodian campaign|counter-invasion]].

In 1969, following the election of U.S President [[Richard Nixon]], a policy of "[[Vietnamization]]" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and [[materiel]] shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the first and largest mechanized PAVN offensive during the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972. The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the [[Case–Church Amendment]], passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.<ref name="Kolko">{{cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofwarviet00kolk|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0394747613}}</ref>{{rp|457}} The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. [[Fall of Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh fell]] to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 while the [[1975 Spring Offensive]] saw the capture of Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.

The scale of fighting was enormous. By 1970, the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, and the PAVN was not far behind with approximately one million regular soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pilger|first=John|title=Heroes|publisher=South End Press|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcL6w-VmjWwC&pg=PA238|isbn=9780896086661|page=238}}</ref><ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|770}} The war exacted an [[Vietnam War casualties|enormous human cost]]: estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed range from 966,000<ref name=Hirschman/> to 3.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=Obermeyer/> Some 275,000–310,000 [[Khmer people|Cambodians]],<ref name=Heuveline/><ref name=Banister/><ref name=Sliwinski/> 20,000–62,000 [[Lao people|Laotians]],<ref name=Obermeyer/> and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain [[missing in action]].<ref group="A" name="USd&w" />

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War. Conflict between North Vietnam and its Cambodian allies in the [[GRUNK|Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea]], and the newly formed [[Democratic Kampuchea]] began almost immediately in a series of border raids by the Khmer Rouge, eventually escalating into the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]]. Chinese forces directly invaded Vietnam in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], with subsequent [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts, 1979–1991|border conflicts]] lasting until 1991. Insurgencies were fought by the unified Vietnam in all three countries. The end of the war and resumption of the [[Third Indochina War]] would precipitate the [[Vietnamese boat people]] and the larger [[Indochina refugee crisis]], which saw millions of refugees leave Indochina (mainly southern Vietnam), with an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea. Within the U.S, the war gave rise to what was referred to as [[Vietnam Syndrome]], a public aversion to American overseas military involvements,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalb|first=Marvin|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/01/22-obama-foreign-policy-kalb|title=It's Called the Vietnam Syndrome, and It's Back|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=22 January 2013|access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref> which together with the [[Watergate scandal]] contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected America throughout the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Horne|first=Alistair|title=Kissinger's Year: 1973|publisher=Phoenix Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0753827000|pages=370–1}}</ref>

Given that there have been several conflicts in Indochina, this particular conflict is known by the names of its primary protagonists to distinguish it from others.

The primary military organizations involved in the war were the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) and the [[United States armed forces]], fighting against the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) (commonly called the North Vietnamese Army, or NVA, in English-language sources) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, more commonly known as the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) in English language sources), a South Vietnamese communist guerrilla force.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|xli}}

[[Daniel Ellsberg]] contends that U.S. participation in Vietnam had begun in 1945 when it gave support to a French effort to reconquer its colony in Vietnam, a nation which had just declared independence in August 1945.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|title=The doomsday machine – Talks at Google (February 2018)|url=https://singjupost.com/daniel-ellsberg-the-doomsday-machine-talks-at-google-transcript/ |website=Talks at google|publisher=Google / Daniel Ellsberg|access-date=1 June 2018|date=2 February 2018}}</ref>

Indochina was a [[French Indochina|French colony]] during the 19th century. When the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded]] during [[World War II]], the [[Viet Minh]] opposed them with support from the US, the Soviet Union and China. They received some Japanese arms when Japan surrendered. The Viet Minh, a Communist-led common front under the leadership of [[Ho Chi Minh]], then initiated an insurgency against French rule. Hostilities escalated into the [[First Indochina War]] (beginning in December 1946). By the 1950s, the conflict had become entwined with the Cold War.

Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including "rent reduction" and "land reform", which resulted in significant political oppression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated resulted in an initial estimation of nearly 100,000 executions nationwide.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954–1956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954–1955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper "Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953–1956" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7–9) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html|archive-date=20 April 2011}}<br/>cf. {{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955–56 |journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|issue=4|date=November 2005|pages=395–426 |doi= 10.1080/14682740500284630 |s2cid=153956945}}<br/>cf. {{cite book|last=Vu|first=Tuong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000 |title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010 |isbn=978-1139489010 |page=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&nbsp;...

From April to June 1955, Diệm eliminated any political opposition in the south by launching military operations against two religious groups: the [[Cao Đài]] and [[Hòa Hảo]] of [[Ba Cụt]]. The campaign also focused on the [[Bình Xuyên]] [[organized crime]] group, which was allied with members of the communist party secret police and had some military elements.

In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955, Diệm [[electoral fraud|rigged]] the poll supervised by his brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]] and was credited with 98.2 percent of the vote, including 133% in Saigon.

In December 1960, the Viet Cong was formally created with the intent of uniting all anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. It was formed in [[Memot District|Memot, Cambodia]], and directed through a central office known as [[Central Office for South Vietnam|COSVN]]. According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the Viet Cong "placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [[coalition government]] and the neutralization of Vietnam." The identities of the leaders of the organization often were kept secret.<ref name="WarBegan" />

Support for the VC was driven by peasant resentment of Diem's reversal of land reforms in the countryside. Most of the population lived in countryside villages and strongly supported the reforms. In areas they controlled, the Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal lands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the villages. People who were farming land they had held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was enforced by the South Vietnamese army. The divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the French: ''"75 percent support for the NLF, 20 percent trying to remain neutral and 5 percent firmly pro-government"''.<ref name="Young">{{cite book|last=Young|first=Marilyn|title=The Vietnam Wars: 1945–1990|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamwars194510000youn|url-access=registration|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1991|isbn=978-0060921071}}</ref>{{rp|73}}

[[File:The President's News Conference, 23 March 1961.jpg|thumb|President Kennedy's news conference of 23 March 1961]]

In the [[1960 U.S. presidential election]], Senator John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America "loomed larger than Asia on his sights."<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|264}} In April 1961, Kennedy approved the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and that invasion failed. In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.–Soviet issues. Only 16 months later, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16–28 October 1962) played out on television worldwide. It was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale [[nuclear war]], and the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) forces to [[DEFCON]] 2.

The Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] that he had approved on 4 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161188|title=It's Time to Stop Saying that JFK Inherited the Bay of Pigs Operation from Ike|publisher=History News Network|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement in May ("Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers."<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|265}}), the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage U.S. credibility. He was determined to "draw a line in the sand" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, "Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place."<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

Kennedy's policy toward South Vietnam assumed that Diệm and his forces had to ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own.

One major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a "brush fire" war in Vietnam.

The [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was initiated in late 1961. This joint U.S.–South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from the Viet Cong. It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. However, by November 1963 the program had waned, and it officially ended in 1964.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|1070}}

On 23 July 1962, fourteen nations, including China, South Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|agreement]] promising to respect the neutrality of Laos.

The inept performance of the ARVN was exemplified by failed actions such as the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] on 2 January 1963, in which a small band of Viet Cong won a battle against a much larger and better-equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat.<ref name="Sheehan">{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|title=A Bright Shining Lie – John Paul Vann and the American War in Vietnam|publisher=Vintage|year=1989|isbn=978-0679724148}}</ref>{{rp|201–6}} During the battle the South Vietnamese had lost 83 soldiers, 5 US war helicopters that had been shot down by Vietcong forces, while the Vietcong forces had lost only 18 soldiers. The ARVN forces were led by Diệm's most trusted general, [[Huỳnh Văn Cao]], commander of the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]]. Cao was a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coup attempts; he had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Diệm was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F. Kennedy]] noted, "Diệm wouldn't make even the slightest concessions. He was difficult to reason with&nbsp;..."<ref>Live interview by [[John Bartlow Martin]].

{{quote|Strategic hamlets had failed&nbsp;... The South Vietnamese regime was incapable of winning the peasantry because of its class base among landlords.

[[File:Arvncapture.jpg|thumb|upright|ARVN forces capture a Viet Cong]]
Discontent with Diệm's policies exploded in May 1963 following the [[Huế Phật Đản shootings]] of nine unarmed Buddhists protesting against the ban on displaying the [[Buddhist flag]] on [[Vesak]], the Buddha's birthday. This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents over the Buddhist majority. Diệm's elder brother [[Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục|Ngô Đình Thục]] was the Archbishop of Huế and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Catholic paramilitaries demolishing Buddhist pagodas throughout Diệm's rule. Diệm refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the ARVN [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] of Colonel [[Lê Quang Tung]], loyal to Diệm's younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, [[Xá Lợi Pagoda raids|raided pagodas]] across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.

U.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [[regime change]] during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] wanted to encourage a coup, while the Defense Department favored Diệm. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Diệm's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ngô family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].

[[File:Corpse of Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1963 coup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ngô Đình Diệm]] after being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963]]

The CIA contacted generals planning to remove Diệm and told them that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid. President Diệm was overthrown and executed, along with his brother, on 2 November 1963. When Kennedy was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that he "rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face."<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|326}} Kennedy had not anticipated Diệm's murder. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them.

Following the coup, chaos ensued. Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession. Increasingly, each new regime was viewed by the communists as a puppet of the Americans; whatever the failings of Diệm, his credentials as a nationalist (as Robert McNamara later reflected) had been impeccable.<ref name=McNamara/>{{rp|328}}

Bombing was not restricted to North Vietnam. Other aerial campaigns, such as [[Operation Barrel Roll]], targeted different parts of the Viet Cong and PAVN infrastructure.

The ostensibly neutral Laos had become [[Laotian Civil War|the scene of a civil war]], pitting the [[Kingdom of Laos|Laotian government]] backed by the US against the Pathet Lao and its North Vietnamese allies.

Massive aerial bombardment against the Pathet Lao and PAVN forces were carried out by the US to prevent the collapse of the Royal central government, and to deny the use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos, nearly equal to the 2.1&nbsp;million tons of bombs the U.S. dropped on Europe and Asia during all of World War II, making Laos the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population.<ref name="KiernanTaylor">{{cite journal|author-link1=Ben Kiernan|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|last2=Owen|first2=Taylor|url=http://apjjf.org/2015/13/16/Ben-Kiernan/4313.html |title=Making More Enemies than We Kill?

The American buildup transformed the South Vietnamese economy and had a profound effect on society. South Vietnam was inundated with manufactured goods.

Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|556}} all agreed to send troops.

The U.S. and its allies mounted complex [[search and destroy]] operations, designed to find enemy forces, destroy them, and then withdraw, typically using helicopters. In November 1965, the U.S. engaged in its first major battle with the PAVN, the [[Battle of Ia Drang]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph Galloway |url=http://www.historynet.com/ia-drang-where-battlefield-losses-convinced-ho-giap-and-mcnamara-the-u-s-could-never-win.htm|title=Ia Drang – The Battle That Convinced Ho Chi Minh He Could Win|access-date=2 May 2016 |publisher=Historynet|date=18 October 2010}}</ref> The operation was the first large scale helicopter air assault by the U.S., and first to employ [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] strategic bombers in a tactical support role.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|284–5}} These tactics continued in 1966–1967 with operations such as [[Operation Masher|Masher]], [[Operation Thayer|Thayer]], [[Operation Attleboro|Attleboro]], [[Operation Cedar Falls|Cedar Falls]] and [[Operation Junction City|Junction City]]. However, the PAVN/VC insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated great tactical flexibility. By 1967, these operations had generated large-scale internal refugees, numbering nearly 2.1&nbsp;million in South Vietnam, with 125,000 people evacuated and rendered homeless during Operation Masher alone, which was the largest search and destroy operation in the war up to that point.<ref name="Elliott">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/opinion/violence-pacification-vietnam-war.html |title=The Terrible Violence of 'Pacification'|last=Elliott|first=Mai|date=2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=8 June 2018 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Operation Masher would have negligible impact, however, as the PAVN/VC returned to the province just four months after the operation ended.<ref name="Ward">{{Cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Geoffrey C.|last2=Burns|first2=Ken|title=The Vietnam War: An Intimate History |publisher=Alfred A.

Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilise with the coming to power of prime minister Air Marshal [[Nguyễn Cao Kỳ]] and figurehead chief of state, General [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]], in mid-1965 at the head of a military junta. This ended a series of coups that had happened more than once a year. In 1967, Thieu became president with Ky as his deputy, after rigged elections. Although they were nominally a civilian government, Ky was supposed to maintain real power through a behind-the-scenes military body. However, Thieu outmanoeuvred and sidelined Ky by filling the ranks with generals from his faction. Thieu was also accused of murdering Ky loyalists through contrived military accidents. Thieu, mistrustful and indecisive, remained president until 1975, having won a [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|one-candidate election in 1971]].<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|706}}

The Johnson administration employed a "policy of minimum candor"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|18}} in its dealings with the media. Military information officers sought to manage media coverage by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress in the war. Over time, this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements.

[[File:Vietconginterrogation.jpg|thumb|upright|An alleged Viet Cong captured during an attack on an American outpost near the Cambodian border is interrogated.]]

The invasion of Cambodia sparked [[Protests against the Vietnam War|nationwide U.S. protests]] as Nixon had promised to deescalate the American involvement. [[Kent State shootings|Four students were killed by National Guardsmen]] in May 1970 during a protest at [[Kent State University]] in [[Ohio]], which provoked further public outrage in the United States. The reaction to the incident by the Nixon administration was seen as callous and indifferent, reinvigorating the declining anti-war movement.<ref name=Daddis/>{{rp|128–9}} The U.S. Air Force continued to heavily bomb Cambodia in support of the Cambodian government as part of [[Operation Freedom Deal]].

Building up on the success of ARVN units in Cambodia, and further testing the Vietnamization program, the ARVN were tasked to launch [[Operation Lam Son 719]] in February 1971, the first major ground operation aimed directly at attacking the Ho Chi Minh trail by attacking the major crossroad of [[Tchepone]].

===Easter Offensive and Paris Peace Accords, 1972===
Vietnamization was again tested by the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972, a massive conventional PAVN invasion of South Vietnam. The PAVN quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half. U.S. troop withdrawals continued, but American airpower responded, beginning [[Operation Linebacker]], and the offensive was halted.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|606–37}}

The war was central to the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 U.S. presidential election]] as Nixon's opponent, [[George McGovern]], campaigned on immediate withdrawal. Nixon's National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, had continued secret negotiations with North Vietnam's [[Lê Đức Thọ]] and in October 1972 reached an agreement. President Thieu demanded changes to the peace accord upon its discovery, and when North Vietnam went public with the agreement's details, the Nixon administration claimed they were attempting to embarrass the president. The negotiations became deadlocked when Hanoi demanded new changes. To show his support for South Vietnam and force Hanoi back to the negotiating table, Nixon ordered [[Operation Linebacker II]], a massive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong 18–29 December 1972.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|649–63}} Nixon pressured Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement, threatening to conclude a bilateral peace deal and cut off American aid while promising an air-response in case of invasion.

On 15 January 1973, all U.S. combat activities were suspended. Lê Đức Thọ and Henry Kissinger, along with the PRG Foreign Minister [[Nguyễn Thị Bình]] and a reluctant President Thiệu, signed the Paris Peace Accords on 27 January 1973.<ref name=Ward/>{{rp|508–13}} This officially ended direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, created a ceasefire between North Vietnam/PRG and South Vietnam, guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam under the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for elections or a political settlement between the PRG and South Vietnam, allowed 200,000 communist troops to remain in the south, and agreed to a POW exchange. There was a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces. "This article", noted Peter Church, "proved… to be the only one of the Paris Agreements which was fully carried out."<ref>{{cite book|last=Church|first=Peter|title=A Short History of South-East Asia|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2006|isbn=978-0470821817|pages=193–4}}</ref> All US forces personnel were completely withdrawn by March 1973.<ref name=Herring/>{{rp|260}}

In the lead-up to the ceasefire on 28 January, both sides attempted to maximize the land and population under their control in a campaign known as the [[War of the flags]]. Fighting continued after the ceasefire, this time without US participation, and continued throughout the year.<ref name=Ward/>{{rp|508–13}} North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying troops in the South but only to the extent of replacing expended material. Later that year the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to Kissinger and Thọ, but the North Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying that a true peace did not yet exist.

On 15 March 1973, Nixon implied the US would intervene again militarily if the North launched a full offensive and Secretary of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger|James Schlesinger]] re-affirmed this position during his June 1973 confirmation hearings. Public and congressional reaction to Nixon's statement was unfavorable, prompting the U.S. Senate to pass the [[Case–Church Amendment]] to prohibit any intervention.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|670–2}}

PAVN/VC leaders expected the ceasefire terms would favor their side, but Saigon, bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the Viet Cong. The PAVN/VC responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Trần Văn Trà]].<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|672–4}} With U.S. bombings suspended, work on the Ho Chi Minh trail and other logistical structures could proceed unimpeded. Logistics would be upgraded until the North was in a position to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for the 1975–1976 dry season. Tra calculated that this date would be Hanoi's last opportunity to strike before Saigon's army could be fully trained.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|672–4}} The PAVN/VC resumed offensive operations when the dry season began in 1973, and by January 1974 had recaptured territory it lost during the previous dry season.

Within South Vietnam, the departure of the US military and the global recession that followed the [[1973 oil crisis]] hurt an economy that was partly dependent on U.S. financial support and troop presence. After two clashes that left 55 ARVN soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January 1974, that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accords were no longer in effect. This was despite there being over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thieu-announces-war-has-resumed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120114757/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thieu-announces-war-has-resumed|url-status=dead|title=This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed|publisher=History.com|access-date=17 October 2009|archive-date=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|683}}

The success of the 1973–1974 dry season offensive inspired Trà to return to Hanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive the next dry season. This time, Trà could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops, a vast change from the days when the Ho Chi Minh trail was a dangerous mountain trek.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|676}} Giáp, the North Vietnamese defence minister, was reluctant to approve of Trà's plan since a larger offensive might provoke U.S. reaction and interfere with the big push planned for 1976. Trà appealed over Giáp's head to first secretary Lê Duẩn, who approved of the operation. Trà's plan called for a limited offensive from Cambodia into [[Phước Long Province]]. The strike was designed to solve local logistical problems, gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces, and determine whether the U.S. would return.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|685–90}}

On 13 December 1974, North Vietnamese forces [[Battle of Phuoc Long|attacked Phước Long]]. Phuoc Binh, the provincial capital, fell on 6 January 1975.

The speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy. It was decided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to General Văn Tiến Dũng and that [[Pleiku]] should be seized, if possible. Before he left for the South, Dũng was addressed by Lê Duẩn: "Never have we had military and political conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have now."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dougan|first1=Clark|last2=Fulgham|first2=David|title=The Vietnam Experience The Fall of the South|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1985|isbn=978-0939526161|page=22}}</ref>

[[File:PAVN Captures Hue, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|The capture of Hue, March 1975]]

On 10 March 1975, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery. The target was [[Battle of Buon Me Thuot|Buôn Ma Thuột]], in [[Đắk Lắk Province]]. If the town could be taken, the provincial capital of Pleiku and the road to the coast would be exposed for a planned campaign in 1976. The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed on 11 March. Once again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success. Dung now urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to [[Kon Tum]]. He argued that with two months of good weather remaining until the onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}

President Thiệu, a former general, was fearful that his forces would be cut off in the north by the attacking communists; Thieu ordered a retreat, which soon turned into a bloody rout. While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted to flee, isolated units fought desperately. ARVN general Phu abandoned Pleiku and Kon Tum and retreated toward the coast, in what became known as the "column of tears".<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|693–4}}

On 20 March, Thieu reversed himself and ordered Huế, Vietnam's third-largest city, be held at all costs, and then changed his policy several times. As the PAVN launched their attack, panic set in, and ARVN resistance withered. On 22 March, the PAVN opened the siege of Huế. Civilians flooded the airport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape. As resistance in Huế collapsed, PAVN rockets rained down on Da Nang and its airport. By 28 March 35,000 PAVN troops were poised to attack the suburbs. By 30 March 100,000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the PAVN marched victoriously through Da Nang. With the fall of the city, the defense of the Central Highlands and Northern provinces came to an end.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|699–700}}

With the northern half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered General Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon. The operational plan for the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]] called for the capture of Saigon before 1 May. Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital. Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh and Da Lat.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|702–4}}

On 7 April, three PAVN divisions attacked [[Battle of Xuân Lộc|Xuân Lộc]], {{convert|40|mi}}  east of Saigon. For two bloody weeks, severe fighting raged as the ARVN defenders made a [[last stand]] to try to block the PAVN advance. On 21 April, however, the exhausted garrison was ordered to withdraw towards Saigon.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|704–7}} An embittered and tearful president Thieu resigned on the same day, declaring that the United States had betrayed South Vietnam. In a scathing attack, he suggested that Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement two years earlier, promising military aid that failed to materialize. Having transferred power to [[Trần Văn Hương]] on 21 April, he left for [[Taiwan]] on 25 April.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|714}} After having appealed unsuccessfully to Congress for $700&nbsp;million in emergency aid for South Vietnam, President Ford had given a televised speech on 23 April, declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U.S. aid.

By the end of April, the ARVN had collapsed on all fronts except in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Thousands of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. On 27 April 100,000 PAVN troops encircled Saigon. The city was defended by about 30,000 ARVN troops. To hasten a collapse and foment panic, the PAVN shelled [[Tan Son Nhut Airport]] and forced its closure.

{{Main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}
[[File:NVA pose for picture in Presidential Palace at end of Vietnam war.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Victorious PAVN troops at the Presidential Palace, Saigon]]

Chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Saigon. [[Martial law]] was declared. American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, U.S. and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the U.S. embassy compound. [[Operation Frequent Wind]] had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of U.S. Ambassador [[Graham Martin]]'s belief that Saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached. Frequent Wind was the largest helicopter evacuation in history. It began on 29 April, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space. Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as PAVN tanks breached defenses near Saigon. In the early morning hours of 30 April, the last U.S. Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|718–20}}

On 30 April 1975, PAVN troops entered the city of Saigon and quickly overcame all resistance, capturing key buildings and installations. A tank from the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th Division]] crashed through the gates of the [[Independence Palace]] at 11:30&nbsp;am local time and the Viet Cong flag was raised above it. President [[Dương Văn Minh]], who had succeeded Huong two days earlier, surrendered to Colonel [[Bùi Tín]].<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|720–1}}

[[File:Vietnam War protesters. 1967. Wichita, Kans - NARA - 283627.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Anti-war protests]]

During the course of the Vietnam War a large segment of the American population came to be opposed to U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967 and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam.<ref>Lunch, W. & Sperlich, P.

[[File:vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|right|Anti-Vietnam War demonstration, 1967]]

Early opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam drew its inspiration from the Geneva Conference of 1954. American support of Diệm in refusing elections was seen as thwarting the democracy America claimed to support. John F. Kennedy, while senator, opposed involvement in Vietnam.<ref name=Kahin/> Nonetheless, it is possible to specify certain groups who led the anti-war movement at its peak in the late 1960s and the reasons why. Many young people protested because they were the ones being [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]], while others were against the war because the anti-war movement grew increasingly popular among the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a [[unilateral]] withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism and [[American imperialism|imperialism]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Zimmer|first=Louis B.|title=The Vietnam War Debate|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0739137697|pages=54–5}}</ref> and for those involved with the [[New Left]], such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]], opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]]. Some wanted to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam, such as [[Norman Morrison]] emulating the [[self-immolation]] of [[Thích Quảng Đức]].

[[File:Vietnam War protests in Vienna, Austria (Greyscale).jpg|thumb|Vietnam War protesters in [[Vienna]] in 1968]]

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam War increasingly turned to mass protests in an effort to shift U.S. public opinion. Riots broke out at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] during protests against the war.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|514}} After news reports of American military abuses, such as the 1968 My Lai Massacre, brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement, some veterans joined [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]].

In 1950, China extended [[diplomatic recognition]] to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and sent heavy weapons, as well as military advisers led by [[Politics of Shanxi#List of Governors of Shanxi|Luo Guibo]] to assist the Viet Minh in its war with the French. The first draft of the 1954 Geneva Accords was negotiated by French prime minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] who, seeing U.S. intervention coming, urged the Viet Minh to accept a partition at the 17th parallel.<ref name="Qiang">{{cite book|last=Qiang|first=Zhai|title=China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950–1975|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0807848425}}</ref>{{rp|54–5}}

China's support for North Vietnam when the U.S. started to intervene included both financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles. In the summer of 1962, [[Mao Zedong]] agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. Starting in 1965, China sent [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, man anti-aircraft batteries, rebuild roads and railroads, transport supplies, and perform other engineering works. This freed North Vietnamese army units for combat in the South. China sent 320,000 troops and annual arms shipments worth $180&nbsp;million.<ref name=Qiang/>{{rp|135}} The Chinese military claims to have caused 38% of American air losses in the war.<ref name=Womack/>{{rp|}} China claimed that its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20&nbsp;billion (approx. $143&nbsp;billion adjusted for inflation in 2015) during the Vietnam War.<ref name=Womack/>{{rp|}} Included in that aid were donations of 5&nbsp;million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to North Vietnamee food production in a single year), accounting for 10–15% of the North Vietnamese food supply by the 1970s.<ref name=Womack/>{{rp|}}

[[Sino-Soviet relations]] soured after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968. In October, the Chinese demanded North Vietnam cut relations with Moscow, but Hanoi refused.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ang|first=Cheng Guan|title=Ending the Vietnam War: The Vietnamese Communists' Perspective|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2005|isbn=978-0415406192|page=27}}</ref> The Chinese began to withdraw in November 1968 in preparation for a clash with the Soviets, [[Sino-Soviet border conflict#Battle of Zhenbao Island|which occurred at Zhenbao Island]] in March 1969.

In 1967, the Chinese government launched a secret military program named "[[Project 523]]". which intended to find a treatment for [[malaria]] to provide the assistance to the PAVN who suffered malaria. As a result, Chinese scientist Youyou Tu and her collaborators discovered [[artemisinin]]. Tu was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for her contribution on the anti-malaria treatment.

The Chinese also began financing the Khmer Rouge as a counterweight to North Vietnam at this time. China "armed and trained" the Khmer Rouge during the civil war and continued to aid them for years afterward.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bezlova, Antoaneta|title=China haunted by Khmer Rouge links|publisher=Asia Times|url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KB21Ad01.html|date=21 February 2009}}</ref> The Khmer Rouge launched ferocious raids into Vietnam in 1975–1978. When Vietnam responded with an [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge]], China launched a brief, punitive [[Sino-Vietnamese War|invasion of Vietnam in 1979]].

Soviet ships in the South China Sea gave vital early warnings to PAVN/VC forces in South Vietnam. The Soviet intelligence ships would pick up American B-52 bombers flying from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and Guam. Their airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to COSVN, North Vietnam's southern headquarters. Using airspeed and direction, COSVN analysts would calculate the bombing target and tell any assets to move "perpendicularly to the attack trajectory." These advance warnings gave them time to move out of the way of the bombers, and, while the bombing runs caused extensive damage, because of the early warnings from 1968 to 1970 they did not kill a single military or civilian leader in the headquarters complexes.<ref name="Truong p. 168">{{harvnb|Truong|1985|p=168}}</ref>

The Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment. Soviet crews fired Soviet-made [[surface-to-air missile]]s at U.S. [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]], which were shot down over Thanh Hóa in 1965. Over a dozen Soviet soldiers lost their lives in this conflict. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian officials acknowledged that the Soviet Union had stationed up to 3,000 troops in Vietnam during the war.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Soviet Involvement in the Vietnam War|agency=Associated Press|publisher=historicaltextarchive.com|url=http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=180}}</ref>

Some Russian sources give more specific numbers: Between 1953 and 1991, the hardware donated by the Soviet Union included 2,000 tanks, 1,700 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]], 7,000 artillery guns, over 5,000 anti-aircraft guns, 158 surface-to-air missile launchers, 120 helicopters.

The North Koreans stayed through 1968, and 200 pilots were reported to have served.

Thai Army formations, including the [[Royal Thai Volunteer Regiment]] (Queen's Cobras) and later the [[Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division]] (Black Panthers), saw action in South Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. Thai forces saw much more action in the covert war in Laos between 1964 and 1972, though Thai regular formations there were heavily outnumbered by the irregular "volunteers" of the CIA-sponsored Police Aerial Reconnaissance Units or PARU, who carried out reconnaissance activities on the western side of the Ho Chi Minh trail.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}

[[File:RAR Vietnam.jpg|thumb|upright|An Australian soldier in Vietnam]]

Australia and New Zealand, close allies of the United States and members of the SEATO and the [[ANZUS]] military cooperation treaty, sent ground troops to Vietnam. Both nations had gained experience in counterinsurgency and jungle warfare during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and World War II, and their governments subscribed to the domino theory. New Zealand was, however, a reluctant participant. Officials expected a foreign intervention to fail, were concerned that they would be supporting a corrupt regime, and did not want to further stretch their country's small military (which was already deployed to Malaysia).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Independence and Foreign Policy: New Zealand in the World Since 1935|last=McKinnon|first=Malcolm|publisher=Auckland University Press|year=1993|location=Auckland, NZ|pages=152–77}}</ref> In the end, though, a desire to prove their commitment to the ANZUS alliance and discourage an American withdrawal from Southeast Asia necessitated a military commitment.

Australia, with decades of experience from both the Malayan Emergency and its [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam|AATTV]] role in 1962, recognised the necessity of a true counter-insurgency, which relied on providing village-level security, establishing civilian trust and economic incentives and improving ARVN capabilities.<ref name="Ross">{{cite web|url=http://www.vvaa.org.au/bross-1.pdf|title=Australia's Military Involvement in the Vietnam War|last=Ross|first=Brian|date=1995|website=Vietnam Veterans of Australia Association}}</ref> This brought Australian commanders into conflict with Westmoreland's conventional attrition warfare approach, since Australian ground forces were required to follow US doctrine.<ref name=Ross/> Nevertheless, Australian forces were generally the most capable at counter-insurgency, and they helped to train Regional Forces despite being under significant doctrinal constraints.<ref name=Ross/>

==United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO)==

The ethnic minority peoples of South Vietnam, like the [[Degar|Montagnards]] (Degar) in the Central Highlands, the Hindu and Muslim [[Cham people|Cham]], and the Buddhist [[Khmer Krom]], were actively recruited in the war. There was an active strategy of recruitment and favorable treatment of Montagnard tribes for the Viet Cong, as they were pivotal for control of infiltration routes.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Kaminsky|first1=Arnold P.|last2=Long|first2=Roger D.|title=Nationalism and Imperialism in South and Southeast Asia: Essays Presented to Damodar R.SarDesai|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGIPDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT300|isbn=978-1351997423}}</ref> Some groups had split off and formed the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]] (French: ''Front Uni de Lutte des Races Opprimées'', acronym: FULRO) to fight for autonomy or independence. FULRO fought against both the South Vietnamese and the Viet Cong, later proceeding to fight against the unified [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] after the fall of South Vietnam.

During the war, the South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem began a program to settle ethnic Vietnamese Kinh on Montagnard lands in the Central Highlands region. This provoked a backlash from the Montagnards, some joining the Viet Cong as a result. The Cambodians under both the pro-China King Sihanouk and the pro-American Lon Nol supported their fellow co-ethnic Khmer Krom in South Vietnam, following an anti-ethnic Vietnamese policy. Following Vietnamization many Montagnard groups and fighters were incorporated into the [[Vietnamese Rangers]] as border sentries.

Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones, they were never allowed directly in the field of battle. Unlike the men, the women who served in the military were solely volunteers. They faced a plethora of challenges, one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers. Living in a male-dominated environment created tensions between the sexes. By 1973, approximately 7,500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holm|1992|p=206}}.</ref> American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes. To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as "proper, professional and well protected." This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the feminism of the 1960s–1970s in the United States. Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.<ref name=Norman/>{{rp|71}}

In South Vietnam, many women voluntarily served in the ARVN's Women's Armed Force Corps (WAFC) and various other Women's corps in the military. Some, like in the WAFC, served in combat with other soldiers.

The experience of American military personnel of African ancestry during the Vietnam War had received significant attention. For example, the website "African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War" compiles examples of such coverage,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aavw.org/served/homepage_wetoo_integrated.html |title=Fully Integrated |work=African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War (aavw.org) |access-date=11 May 2017}}</ref> as does the print and broadcast work of journalist [[Wallace Terry]] whose book ''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans'' (1984), includes observations about the impact of the war on the black community in general and on black servicemen specifically. Points he makes on the latter topic include: the higher proportion of combat casualties in Vietnam among African American servicemen than among American soldiers of other races, the shift toward and different attitudes of black military careerists versus black draftees, the discrimination encountered by black servicemen "on the battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty assignments" as well as their having to endure "the racial insults, cross-burnings and Confederate flags of their white comrades"—and the experiences faced by black soldiers stateside, during the war and after America's withdrawal.{{sfn|Terry|1984|loc=Epigraph, pp. xv–xvii}}

Civil rights leaders protested the disproportionate casualties and the overrepresentation in hazardous duty and combat roles experienced by African American servicemen, prompting reforms that were implemented beginning in 1967–68. As a result, by the war's completion in 1975, black casualties had declined to 12.5% of US combat deaths, approximately equal to percentage of draft-eligible black men, though still slightly higher than the 10% who served in the military.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Appy|first=Christian|title=Working-class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEygbABXmFUC&q=Working-Class+War:+American+Combat+Soldiers+and+Vietnam|isbn=9780807860113}}</ref>

During the early stages of the war, the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms; these were often of American manufacture or were crude, makeshift weapons used alongside [[shotgun]]s made of galvanized pipes. Most arms were captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.

The US service rifle was initially the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. The M14 was a powerful, accurate rifle, but it was heavy, hard-recoiling, and especially unwieldy in jungle fighting, as it was unsuited for the combat conditions, often suffering from feed failure. It was gradually replaced by the [[M16 rifle]], designed by [[Eugene Stoner]], between 1964 and 1970. When first deployed, the M16 also suffered from a propensity to jam in combat, leaving the soldier defenseless and potentially killing him.<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.H.

In the post-war era, Americans struggled to absorb the lessons of the military intervention. As General Maxwell Taylor, one of the principal architects of the war, noted, "First, we didn't know ourselves. We thought that we were going into another Korean War, but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies… And we knew less about North Vietnam. Who was Ho Chi Minh? Nobody really knew. So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business. It's very dangerous."<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|23}} President [[Ronald Reagan]] coined the term "[[Vietnam Syndrome]]" to describe the reluctance of the American public and politicians to support further military interventions abroad after Vietnam. According to a 2004 Gallup poll, 62 percent of Americans believed it was an unjust war.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wyatt-Brown |first=Bertram |title=A Warring Nation: Honor, Race, and Humiliation in America and Abroad|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dywAAAAQBAJ&q=HUMILIATION|isbn=978-0813934754 |chapter=Chapter 8}}</ref> US public polling in 1978 revealed that nearly 72% of Americans believed the war was "fundamentally wrong and immoral."

In the past three decades, surveys have consistently shown that only around 35% of Americans believe that the war was fundamentally wrong and immoral.<ref name=Hagopian/>{{rp|10}} When surveyed in 2000, one third of Americans believed that the war was a noble cause.<ref name=Hagopian/>{{rp|10}}

Failure of the war is often placed at different institutions and levels. Some have suggested that the failure of the war was due to political failures of U.S. leadership.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/09/mcnamara-writes-vietnam-mea-culpa/a85cc058-54fe-4074-bda3-b374885ede8f/ |title=McNamara Writes Vietnam Mea Culpa |last=Lippman |first=Thomas W. |date=9 April 1995 |website=The Washington Post |access-date=28 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228230351/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/09/mcnamara-writes-vietnam-mea-culpa/a85cc058-54fe-4074-bda3-b374885ede8f/ |archive-date=28 December 2019 |quote=As recounted by McNamara ... the war could and should have been avoided and should have been halted at several key junctures, one as early as 1963.

Yet in Vietnam the Army experienced tactical success and strategic failure... success rests not only on military progress but on correctly analysing the nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies. A new humility and a new sophistication may form the best parts of a complex heritage left to the Army by the long, bitter war in Vietnam."{{sfn|Demma|1989}}

As the Vietnam War continued inconclusively and became more unpopular with the American public, morale declined and disciplinary problems grew among American enlisted men and junior, non-career officers. Drug use, racial tensions, and the growing incidence of fragging—attempting to kill unpopular officers and non-commissioned officers with grenades or other weapons—created severe problems for the U.S. military and impacted its capability of undertaking combat operations. By 1971, a U.S. Army colonel writing in the [[Armed Forces Journal]] declared: "By every conceivable indicator, our army that now remains in Vietnam is in a state approaching collapse, with individual units avoiding or having refused combat, murdering their officers and non commissioned officers, drug-ridden, and dispirited where not near mutinous....The morale, discipline, and battle-worthiness of the U.S. Armed Forces are, with a few salient exceptions, lower and worse than at any time in this century and possibly in the history of the United States."<ref name=Heinl/> Between 1969 and 1971 the U.S. Army recorded more than 900 attacks by troops on their own officers and NCOs with 99 killed.<ref name="Lepre">{{cite book|last=Lepre|first=George|title=Fragging: Why U.S. Soldiers Assaulted their Officers in Vietnam|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0896727151}}</ref>{{rp|44–7}}

===Effects of U.S. chemical defoliation===
[[File:Defoliation agent spraying.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. helicopter spraying chemical [[defoliant]]s in the [[Mekong Delta]], South Vietnam, 1969]]
One of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort in Southeast Asia was the widespread use of chemical [[defoliant]]s between 1961 and 1971. They were used to [[Wikt:defoliate|defoliate]] large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide their weapons and encampments under the foliage. These chemicals continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Palmer|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|2007}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Lynne Peeples |date=10 July 2013 |title=Veterans Sick From Agent Orange-Poisoned Planes Still Seek Justice |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/agent-orange-vietnam-veterans_n_3572598.html |access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref>

[[Agent Orange]] and similar chemical substances used by the U.S. have also caused a considerable number of deaths and injuries in the intervening years, including among the US Air Force crews that handled them. Scientific reports have concluded that refugees exposed to chemical sprays while in South Vietnam continued to experience pain in the eyes and skin as well as gastrointestinal upsets.

The Vietnam War has been featured extensively in television, film, video games, music and literature in the participant countries. In Vietnam, one notable film set during Operation Linebacker II was the film ''[[Girl from Hanoi]]'' (1975) depicting war-time life in Hanoi. Another notable work was the diary of Đặng Thùy Trâm, a Vietnamese doctor who enlisted in the Southern battlefield, and was killed at the age of 27 by US forces near [[Quảng Ngãi]]. Her diaries were later published in Vietnam as ''Đặng Thùy Trâm's Diary'' (''Last Night I Dreamed Of Peace''), where it became a best-seller and was later made into a film ''[[Don't Burn]]'' (''Đừng Đốt''). In Vietnam the diary has often been compared to ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and both are used in literary education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://english.vov.vn/society/amsterdam-mayor-visits-hanoiamsterdam-high-school-284797.vov|title=Amsterdam Mayor visits Hanoi-Amsterdam High School|last=http://vov.vn/|date=10 December 2014|work=VOV Online Newspaper|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref> Another Vietnamese film produced was ''[[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone]]'' (''Cánh đồng hoang)'' in 1979 which weaves the narrative of living on the ground in a US "free-fire zone" as well as perspectives from US helicopters.

In American popular culture, the "Crazy Vietnam Veteran", who was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, became a common [[stock character]] after the war.

One of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was [[John Wayne]]'s pro-war ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968). Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, some of the most noteworthy examples being [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;– based on his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987). Other Vietnam War films include ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), [[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July (1989)]] ''[[The Siege of Firebase Gloria]]'' (1989), ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' (2007).<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}

The war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded ''[[The "Fish" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]'' in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}} Many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Peggy Seeger]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Barbara Dane]], [[The Critics Group]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[John Lennon]], [[John Fogerty]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Neil Young]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Jimmy Cliff]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]. The modern classical composer [[George Crumb]] composed a string quartet, a [[threnody]], regarding the war in 1970 titled [[Black Angels (Crumb)|''Black Angels'']].

The war is also depicted in popular [[video game]]s, especially in the [[first-person shooter]] [[Wargame (video games)|war]] [[genre]], such as ''[[Line of Sight: Vietnam]]'' (2003)'', [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]]'' (2003), ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' (2004), ''[[Vietcong: Fist Alpha]]'' (2004), [[Vietcong 2|Vietcong 2 (2005)]], ''[[Elite Warriors: Vietnam]]'' (2005), ''[[The Hell in Vietnam]]'' (2008), ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified]]'' (2012), ''[[Rising Storm 2: Vietnam]]'' (2017), and in ''[[Far Cry 5#Downloadable content|Far Cry 5]]'' (2018) as an [[Downloadable content|additional content]]. The war also saw [[depiction]] in [[Video game genre|another genre]], in the form of [[third-person shooter]]s, [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], [[real-time strategy]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], such as ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II#Other media|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Caliber .50]]'' (1989), ''[[Made Man (video game)|Made Man]]'' (2006), ''[[Gunboat (video game)|Gunboat]]'' (1990) and ''[[Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam]]'' (2009).

====Myths==== <!-- Redirect target of [[Mythology of the Vietnam War]] and [[Vietnam War myths]] -->
Myths play a central role in the [[historiography]] of the Vietnam War, and have become a part of the [[culture of the United States]]. Much like the general historiography of the war, discussion of myth has focused on U.S. experiences, but changing myths of war have also played a role in [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Australia]]n historiography.

Recent scholarship has focused on "myth-busting",<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|373}} attacking the previous orthodox and revisionist schools of American historiography of the Vietnam War. This scholarship challenges myths about American society and soldiery in the Vietnam War.<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|373}}

Kuzmarov in ''The Myth of the Addicted Army: Vietnam and the Modern War on Drugs'' challenges the popular and Hollywood narrative that US soldiers were heavy drug users,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuzmarov|first=Jeremy|title=The Myth of the Addicted Army: Vietnam and the Modern War on Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDbtvEIxWigC|year=2009|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-55849-705-4|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qDbtvEIxWigC&pg=PA3&dq=nixon+%22tide+of+drug+abuse%22 3–4]}}</ref> in particular the notion that the My Lai massacre was caused by drug use.<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|373}} According to Kuzmarov, Richard Nixon is primarily responsible for creating the drug myth.<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|374}}

Michael Allen in ''Until The Last Man Comes Home'' also accuses Nixon of myth making, by exploiting the plight of the [[League of Wives of American Prisoners in Vietnam]] and the [[National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia]] to allow the government to appear caring as the war was increasingly considered lost.<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|376}} Allen's analysis ties the position of potential missing or prisoner Americans into post-war politics and recent presidential elections, including the [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift boat]] controversy in US electoral politics.<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|376–7}}

Kolbert writes: "[On taking office as President, Lyndon] Johnson wasn't informed that... President [Kennedy] had traded away American [nuclear] warheads [in Turkey in order to resolve the Cuban Missile Crisis]. The lesson L.B.J. seems to have drawn... was that Kennedy had succeeded by refusing to compromise [with the Soviets]. This would have deeply unfortunate consequences when it came time for Johnson to deal with North Vietnam." (p.&nbsp;72.)
