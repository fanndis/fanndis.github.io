'''Raymond Huo''' ({{zh|s=霍建强|t=霍建強|p=Hùo Jiànqiáng}}; born 1964<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.parliament.nz/media/6305/roll-of-members-of-the-new-zealand-house-of-representatives-1854-onwards.pdf |title=Roll of members of the New Zealand House of Representatives, 1854 onwards |date=24 May 2019 |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=3 September 2020}}</ref>) is a New Zealand politician who was a Member of Parliament from 2008 to 2014 and from 2017 to 2020. He was first elected in {{NZ election link year|2008}} as the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]'s first MP of Chinese descent. He was the third [[Chinese New Zealander]] to enter Parliament, after the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s [[Pansy Wong]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]]'s [[Kenneth Wang]]. Huo announced in July 2020 that he would not be standing in the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 election]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-21|title=Labour MP Raymond Huo retiring from politics at election|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300062284/labour-mp-raymond-huo-retiring-from-politics-at-election|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Huo was born in [[Qianshan County|Qianshan]], an eastern part of [[China]], where his mother still lives.<ref name="talk about China">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10875711 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406041345/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10875711 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 April 2013 |title=We need to talk about China |date=6 April 2013 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=18 March 2017 }}</ref> Huo's father was a doctor, and his mother was a head nurse. They were in their early thirties when they volunteered to move from the capital city to Qianshan to help the local population fight [[schistosoma]], a parasitic disease. It was here that Huo first picked up some of the ideals and beliefs, such as social justice and equity, which would lead him into politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/4/8/#06|title=Raymond Huo|publisher=Huo.co.nz|accessdate=3 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103180722/http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/4/8/#06|archive-date=3 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Being a medical professional did not spare Huo's father from persecution during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. His father—an "intellectual"—was ordered to stand at the gates of the hospital for an hour, three times a day with a white board stating "counter-revolutionary medical expert".<ref name="talk about China"/> Huo, only 5 years old at the time, joined him with a smaller whiteboard saying "little counter-revolutionary medical expert".

Huo credits his time in the small rural town as a major influence on his desire for free-will that he has carried into his politics and world view.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10553565">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10553565 |title=New voices: Nikki Kaye, Todd McClay, Raymond Huo |author=Trevett, Claire |date=26 January 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025081514/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10553565 |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to his [[maiden speech]] to Parliament, Huo taught himself to speak English as a teenager in China by listening to the radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raymond Huo|url=http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/308/32/|publisher=Huo.co.nz|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208192529/http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/308/32/|archive-date=8 February 2013|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> Huo states that he studied at [[Anhui University]] in [[Hefei]] and at [[China University of Political Science and Law]] in [[Beijing]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Raymond Huo|url=https://nz.linkedin.com/in/raymond-huo-50339721|last=Huo|first=Raymond|website=LinkedIn|access-date=12 May 2020}}</ref> and that the latter appointed an Honorary Professor of Law.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Raymond Huo (霍建强)|url=https://www.labour.org.nz/raymondhuo|website=New Zealand Labour Party|language=en|access-date=2020-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117002358/https://www.labour.org.nz/raymondhuo|archive-date=17 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Huo emigrated to New Zealand in 1994. He worked as a journalist for ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' where he was the Asian Affairs reporter. He subsequently obtained a MLitt (First Class Honours) majoring in political communication, and an LLB from the [[University of Auckland]]. Prior to becoming a Member of Parliament, Huo practiced law in Auckland at Brookfields and Hesketh Henry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/4/12/#04|title=Raymond Huo|publisher=Huo.co.nz|accessdate=3 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103181252/http://www.huo.co.nz/home/content/view/4/12/#04|archive-date=3 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Member's Bills===
[[File:Dyson and Huo 44.JPG|thumb|Huo and [[Ruth Dyson]] at a Labour function in 2013]]
Huo was a strong advocate for Ethnic Representation on the new board of the [[Auckland Council]] Super City and submitted the Local Government (Auckland Council) (Asian Advisory Board) Amendment Bill to the House. Although Huo's Bill was voted down in Parliament by 64 votes to 58 on 4 November 2009, the Government soon after announced that an Ethnic Advisory Board Panel would be established on the new council.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10607153">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/indians-in-nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=233&objectid=10607153 |title=Asian input critical to city's future, says Huo |author=Tan, Lincoln |date=4 November 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025084022/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/indians-in-nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=233&objectid=10607153 |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Huo has also been vocal about the need for New Zealand to overhaul the Export Education sector which is worth over $2.3 billion to the country's economy. Huo believes that New Zealand has a reputation for "ghetto education" in Asian countries and must change this or risk losing hundreds of International students from the Asian region.<ref>{{cite news |title='Ghetto education' creates suspicion in major market |url=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-new-zealand-herald/20110216/283257389357729 |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=PressReader.com |date=16 February 2011}}</ref>

In February 2011 Huo said because of its economic importance, he will write to the Prime Minister to adopt the Education (export education by private training establishments) Amendment Bill to be included in the current Education Amendment Bill (No 4).<ref name="NZ_Herald_10706463">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10706463 |title='Ghetto education' creates suspicion in major market |author=Tan, Lincoln |date=16 February 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025084042/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10706463 |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Controversies==

Following [[Russel Norman]]'s controversial protest to [[PRC]] Vice President [[Xi Jinping]] during Xi's 2010 visit to New Zealand, Huo wrote a blog entry defending Chinese rule over Tibet.<ref name="nzherald.co.nz">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/human-rights/news/article.cfm?c_id=500838&objectid=10656194 |title=MP's pro-China blog appals Tibet's friends |author=Tan, Lincoln |date=3 July 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215091442/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/human-rights/news/article.cfm?c_id=500838&objectid=10656194 |archive-date=15 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Thuten Kesang]], spokesperson for the New Zealand Tibetan community, accused Huo of "promoting communist China progaganda" and said he would lay a formal complaint with the Labour Party.<ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/>

===Allegations of links to the Chinese Communist Party===
In September 2017, New Zealand China expert and [[University of Canterbury]] political scientist Dr [[Anne-Marie Brady]] alleged in a conference paper that Huo was a pro-China influencer who helped to advance China's [[United Front Work Department|united front]] strategy of co-opting political and business elites in New Zealand. According to Brady, Huo worked very closely with the Chinese Government and had close contacts with the [[Zhi Gong Party]], one of the [[List of political parties in China|eight legal parties in China]] subordinate to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] that focuses on promoting relations between Beijing and Chinese diaspora communities abroad.

In early March 2019, Huo as Chair of the parliamentary Justice Select Committee declined Dr Anne-Marie Brady's request to testify at a Parliamentary justice committee to examine potential foreign interference as part of its review of the 2017 general election. Huo, who had been named as a key pro-China influencer in Brady's conference paper, had declined her request on the procedural grounds that she had submitted her application five months after the final deadline on 23 September 2018. Huo and the other Labour members of the Justice Select Committee voted against Brady's application, triggering criticism from the opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] electoral reform spokesperson [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garrick |first1=Gia |title=National Party targets justice committee refusal to hear Anne-Marie Brady |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/384223/national-party-targets-justice-committee-refusal-to-hear-anne-marie-brady |accessdate=8 March 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=8 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308005621/https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/384223/national-party-targets-justice-committee-refusal-to-hear-anne-marie-brady |archive-date=8 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In response to media coverage, Huo reversed his earlier decision and extended an invitation for Dr Brady to speak to select committee members.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Labour MPs backtrack on Anne-Marie Brady committee decision |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/384252/labour-mps-backtrack-on-anne-marie-brady-committee-decision |accessdate=8 March 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=8 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308095357/https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/384252/labour-mps-backtrack-on-anne-marie-brady-committee-decision |archive-date=8 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=Justice select committee chairman Raymond Huo opens invitation to Anne-Marie Brady to speak to MPs. |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12210853 |accessdate=8 March 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=8 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308142531/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12210853 |archive-date=8 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Huo later criticised Smith for leaking the internal voting of the Justice select committee and playing on his identity as a Chinese&ndash;born MP.<ref name="NZH 21 July 2020" />
