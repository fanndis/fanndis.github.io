'''Thelma Catherine''' "'''Pat'''" '''Nixon''' (née '''Ryan'''; March 16, 1912 – June 22, 1993), also commonly known as '''Patricia Nixon''', was an American educator and the wife of [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th [[President of the United States]]. During her more than 30 years in public life, she served as both the [[Second Lady of the United States|Second]] (1953–1961) and [[First Lady of the United States]] (1969–1974).

Born in [[Ely, Nevada]], she grew up with her two brothers in what is now [[Cerritos, California]], graduating from high school in 1929. She attended [[Fullerton Junior College]] and later the [[University of Southern California]]. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters, [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia]] and [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]]. Dubbed the "Nixon team," Richard and Pat Nixon campaigned together in his successful [[United States Congress|congressional]] campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in 1952 alongside General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], whereupon Pat became Second Lady. Pat Nixon did much to add substance to the role of the Vice President's wife, insisting on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals, and village markets as she undertook many missions of goodwill across the world.

As First Lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including volunteerism. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the [[White House]], an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. She was the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history, a record unsurpassed until twenty-five years later. She accompanied the President as the [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|first First Lady to visit China]] and the Soviet Union, and was the first President's wife to be officially designated a representative of the United States on her solo trips to [[Africa]] and [[South America]], which gained her recognition as "Madame Ambassador"; she was also the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. Her tenure as First Lady ended when, after being re-elected in a [[1972 United States presidential election|landslide victory in 1972]], President Nixon resigned two years later amid the [[Watergate scandal]].

Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life. She and her husband settled in [[San Clemente]], California, and later moved to [[New Jersey]]. She suffered two strokes, one in 1976 and another in 1983, and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992. She died in 1993, aged 81.

==Early life==
Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in 1912 in the small mining town of [[Ely, Nevada]].<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=38|title=First Lady Biography: Pat Nixon|accessdate= August 15, 2007|year= 2005|publisher= The National First Ladies Library}}</ref> Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and [[market gardening|truck farmer]] of Irish ancestry; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> The nickname "Pat" was given to her by her father, because of her birth on the day before [[Saint Patrick's Day]] and her Irish ancestry.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> Upon enrolling in college in 1931, she stopped using the name Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally using the name Patricia. The name change was not a legal action, however, merely one of preference.<ref>{{cite news|author=Halloran, Richard|title=First Lady of the Land at 60: Thelma Catherine Ryan Nixon, Woman in the News|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kinnard, Judith M.|title=Thelma Ryan's Rise: From White Frame to White House|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1971}}</ref>

After her birth, the Ryan family moved to California, and in 1914 settled on a small [[truck farm]] in [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] (present-day [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=First Lady Hailed on Return 'Home'|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1969|page=18}}</ref> Thelma Ryan's high school yearbook page gives her nickname as "Buddy" and her ambition to run a boarding house.<ref>Illustration in a ''New York Times'' article by Judith M.

== Education and career ==
It has been said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as consistently before marrying as did Pat Nixon.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> As she told the writer [[Gloria Steinem]] during the 1968 presidential campaign, "I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work."<ref name="steinem">{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/45934/index11.html|title=In Your Heart You Know He's Nixon|author=Steinem, Gloria|magazine=New York|date=October 28, 1968|accessdate=May 16, 2009 }}</ref>

After graduating from [[Excelsior High School (Norwalk, California)|Excelsior High School]] in 1929, she attended [[Fullerton College]]. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank,<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> and from 1930 until 1931, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and also as a [[radiographer]].<ref name="nyt-obit" />

== Marriage and family, early campaigns ==
While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met [[Richard Nixon]], a young lawyer who had recently graduated from the [[Duke University School of Law]]. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in ''[[The Dark Tower (play)|The Dark Tower]]''.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> Known as Dick, he asked Pat to marry him the first night they went out. "I thought he was nuts or something!" she recalled.<ref>{{cite news|title=Diplomat in High Heels: Thelma Ryan Nixon|work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 1959|page=11}}</ref> He courted the redhead he called his "wild Irish Gypsy" for two years,{{sfnp|Marton|2001|p=173}} even driving her to and from her dates with other men.

They eventually married on June 21, 1940, at the [[The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa|Mission Inn]] in [[Riverside, California]].<ref name="sferrazza-ch-353"/> She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he "was going places, he was vital and ambitious&nbsp;... he was always doing things".<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, "Oh but you just don't realize how much fun he is! He's just so much fun!"<ref name="os234"/>  Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier.<ref name="sferrazza-ch-353"/>  As U.S. involvement in [[World War II]] began, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the [[Office of Price Administration]] (OPA); Pat worked as a secretary for the [[American Red Cross]], but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA.<ref name="sferrazza-ch-353"/>  He then joined the [[United States Navy]], and while he was stationed in San Francisco, she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst.<ref name="sferrazza-ch-353">Sferrazza, "Thelma Catherine (Patricia) Ryan Nixon", p. 353.</ref>

Veteran [[United Press International|UPI]] reporter [[Helen Thomas]] suggested that in public, the Nixons "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were "very close".<ref name="csa172"/> In private, Richard Nixon was described as being "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts.<ref name="csa172"/> During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first.<ref name="csa173">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=173}}</ref> Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him.<ref name="csa173"/> Of his critics, she said that "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is."<ref name="csa173"/>

Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when he entered politics and successfully ran for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, [[Patricia Nixon Cox|Patricia]], known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]]. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, "The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942982,00.html|title=Pat Nixon: Steel and Sorrow|accessdate=August 18, 2008|work=Time|date=August 19, 2008}}</ref> Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent [[Jerry Voorhis]].<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> She also wrote and distributed campaign literature.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia| title =The American Presidency| encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica| year= 2007}}</ref> Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent [[California's 12th congressional district]]. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the [[United States Senate]], and then be nominated as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] candidate.

Although Pat Nixon was a [[Methodist]], she and her husband attended whichever [[Protestant church]] was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional [[Baptist]] services with the Reverend Dr. [[Billy Graham]], and [[Norman Vincent Peale]]'s [[Marble Collegiate Church]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844670-2,00.html|title=A Worshiper in the White House|accessdate= October 8, 2007|date= December 6, 1968 |publisher=Time|pages=1–2}}</ref>

[[Image:Nixons in Ghana 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President and Pat Nixon during a visit to [[Ghana]], 1957]]
At the time of her husband coming under consideration for the vice presidential nomination, Pat Nixon was against her husband accepting the selection, as she despised campaigns and had been relieved that as a newly elected senator he would not have another one for six years.<ref name=Ambrose13/>  She thought she had prevailed in convincing him, until she heard the announcement of the pick from a news bulletin while at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=Ambrose13>{{cite book|title=Nixon Volume I: The Education of a Politician 1913-1962|first=Stephen E.|last=Ambrose|page=264.|year=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0671657222}}</ref> During the [[1952 United States presidential election|Presidential campaign of 1952]], Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed "[[Checkers speech]]", so-called for the family's dog, a [[cocker spaniel]] given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer,<ref name="steinem"/> then said, "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she would look good in anything."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/34_eisenhower/psources/ps_checkers.html|title=Richard Nixon's Checkers Speech|accessdate=November 5, 2007|year=2002–2003|publisher=PBS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109115002/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/34_eisenhower/psources/ps_checkers.html|archivedate=November 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>In 1968, however, a fashion writer of ''The New York Times'' noted that Pat Nixon had purchased a coat made of blonde mink and one of brown-and-black [[Persian lamb]] by the furrier Sidney Fink of Blum & Fink. {{cite news|author=Curtis, Charlotte|title=Fashion Spotlight Turns to New First Family|work=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1968}}</ref>

Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad during his vice presidential years. She traveled to 53 nations, often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals, orphanages, and even a [[leper colony]] in [[Panama]].<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> On a trip to [[Venezuela]], the Nixons' limousine was pelted with rocks and the couple was spat upon as representatives of the U.S. government.<ref name="silentpartner"/>

A November 1, 1958, article in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' was typical of the media's favorable coverage of the future First Lady, stating that "Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct&nbsp;... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been." A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her "a paragon of wifely virtues" whose "efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bender, Marylin|title=Pat Nixon: A Diplomat in High Heels|work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 1960|page=31}}</ref>

Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation's Ideal Housewife (1957), and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband's suits one evening.<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> "Of course, I didn't have to," she told ''The New York Times'', "But when I don't have work to do, I just think up some new project."

== Her husband's campaigns—1960, 1962 and 1968 ==
In [[1960 United States presidential election|the 1960 election]], Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States against Democratic opponent Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]. Pat was featured prominently in the effort; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan "Pat for First Lady".<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined.<ref name="os234">{{harvp|O'Brien|Suteski|2005|p=234}}</ref> Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost—"millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes", as one reporter put it.<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/>

In 1962, the Nixons [[1962 California gubernatorial election|embarked on another campaign]], this time for [[Governor of California]]. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, "Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him."<ref name="Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 205-206">{{harvp|Eisenhower|1986|pp=205–206}}</ref> She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband,<ref name="Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 205-206" /> but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to [[Pat Brown]].

Six years later, Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency. Pat was reluctant to face another campaign, her eighth since 1946.<ref name="jne235237">{{harvp|Eisenhower|1986|pp=235, 237}}</ref> Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics,<ref>{{cite book | last=Mason |first=Robert |title=Richard Nixon and the Quest for a New Majority | url=https://archive.org/details/richardnixonques00maso | url-access=limited |publisher=UNC Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8078-2905-6| page=[https://archive.org/details/richardnixonques00maso/page/n37 25]}}</ref> and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself.<ref name="steinem"/>  Although she supported him in his career, she feared another "1960", when Nixon lost to Kennedy.<ref name="jne235237"/> She consented, however, and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband.{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|p=236}} Richard Nixon made a political comeback with his [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential victory of 1968]] over Vice-President [[Hubert Humphrey]]—and the country had a new First Lady.

=== Major initiatives ===
Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position.<ref name="csa165">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=165}}</ref> When considering ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, [[Lady Bird Johnson]].{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=168}} She decided to continue what she called "personal diplomacy", which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations.{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|p=254}}

[[Image:Pat Nixon greets White House visitors 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Pat Nixon greets young White House visitors, 1969]]

One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers.<ref name="PN Biography: Richard Nixon Library">{{cite web |url=http://www.nixonfoundation.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=PNbio|title=Biography of First Lady Pat Nixon|accessdate= October 8, 2007|year= 2005|publisher= Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace Foundation}}</ref> She stated, "Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others."<ref name="csa177">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=177}}</ref> She undertook a "Vest Pockets for Volunteerism" trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs.<ref name="csa177"/> Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat "saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be".<ref name="csa177"/> Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled {{convert|4130|mi|km|0}} within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=181}} She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League,<ref name="csa177"/> and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973,<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3984|title=Richard Nixon: Statement on Signing the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973|date=October 1, 1973|accessdate=August 19, 2008|publisher=The American Presidency Project}}</ref> Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]].<ref name="burns-125">{{harvp|Burns|2008|p=125}}</ref>

Pat Nixon developed and led a coordinated effort to improve the authenticity of the White House as an historic residence and museum. She added more than 600 paintings, antiques and furnishings to the Executive Mansion and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration;<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/> this greatly, and dramatically, expanded upon [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s more publicized efforts. She created the [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine other rooms, including the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] and [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]].<ref name="csa188"/> She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white.<ref name="csa188"/> She ordered the American flag atop the White House flown day and night, even when the president was not in residence.<ref name="csa188"/>

She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything, and had them translated into Spanish, French, Italian and Russian for foreigners.<ref name="csa188"/> She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled.

[[File:Pat Nixon Red Room C5596-16.jpg|thumb|Pat Nixon with White House curator [[Clement Conger]], whom she hired, in the Red Room after her redecorations, 1971]]

She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented. The tours that were conducted in December displayed the White House's Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]; among the guests were [[The Carpenters]] in 1972. These events were described as ranging from "creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing".<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the [[East Room]] of the White House.<ref name="csa188"/> She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter, Tricia, to [[Edward F.

}}

After hearing about the [[1970 Ancash earthquake|Great Peruvian earthquake of 1970]], which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a "volunteer American relief drive" and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims.{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=185}} She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams.{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=186}} Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort,<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: "Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done,"<ref name="csa187"/> and an editorial in Peru's ''Lima Prensa'' said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon.<ref name="csa187">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=187}}</ref> [[Fran Lewine]] of the [[Associated Press]] wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a "mercy mission" resulting in such "diplomatic side effects".<ref name="csa187"/> On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the [[Order of the Sun (Peru)|Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun]], the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas.<ref name="First Lady Pat Nixon"/>

She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a {{convert|10000|mi|km|0|adj=on}}, eight-day journey to [[Ghana]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name="csa196">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=196}}</ref> Upon arrival in Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute reserved only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops.<ref name="csa196"/> She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals.

[[File:President Richard and Pat Nixon on Great Wall.png|thumb|The Nixons walked on the [[Great Wall of China]] during their historic trip in February 1972]]
Another notable journey was the [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Nixons' historic visit]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972. While President Nixon was in meetings, Pat toured through [[Peking]] in her red coat. According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, China was Pat Nixon's "moment", her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States.<ref name="csa199200">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|pp=199–200}}</ref> She accompanied her husband to the Nixon–[[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] summit meetings in the [[Soviet Union]] later in the year. Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China, Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm-in-arm with [[Soviet First Lady]] [[Viktoria Brezhneva]].<ref name="csa199200"/> Later, she visited [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]] in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president.

=== Fashion and style ===
[[Image:Pat Nixon poses 1970.jpg|thumb|left|Pat Nixon posing in the White House, 1970]]
The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' stated that Pat had a "good figure and good posture", as well as "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900581,00.html|title=Redoing Pat|accessdate=July 25, 2008|work=Time|date=January 24, 1969}}</ref> Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said,<ref>{{cite news|author=Weinman, Martha|title=First Ladies—In Fashion, Too?|work=The New York Times|date=September 11, 1960}}</ref> and favored them because, "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable".{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=192}} She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. "I'm a size 10," she told ''[[The New York Times]]''. "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers."<ref name="cc-nyt"/> She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably [[Geoffrey Beene]], at the suggestion of Clara Treyz, her personal shopper.<ref name="cc-nyt"/> Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike."<ref>{{cite news|title=Pat's Wardrobe Mistress|work=Time|date=January 12, 1970|accessdate=November 9, 2007|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942153-2,00.html}}</ref><ref>Nixon also frequently wore wigs that replicated her short blonde hairstyle, especially on political trips when access to a hairdresser was difficult. {{cite news|author=Curtis, Charlotte|title=Pat Nixon: 'Creature Comforts Don't Matter'|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1968}}</ref>

Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. "Always before, it was sort of fun to get some&nbsp;... thing that was completely different, high-style", she told a reporter. "But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular."{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|p=187}}

=== Watergate ===
{{further|Watergate scandal}}
At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon "barely noticed" the reports of a break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters.<ref name="csa201">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=201}}</ref> Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, "I know only what I read in the newspapers."<ref name="csa203">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=203}}</ref> In 1974, when a reporter asked "Is the press the cause of the president's problems?", she shot back, "What problems?"<ref>Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 210</ref> Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.<ref name="csa203"/>''

[[Image:NIXONSandFORDS.jpg|thumb|left|The Fords escort the Nixons as they depart the White House on Nixon's final day as president, August 9, 1974.]]
Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made. [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower]] stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence.{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|pp=409–410}} Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to "private love letters—for one person alone".{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=214}} Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, "Dick has done so much for the country. Why is this happening?"<ref name="csa215"/>

After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, she replied "But why?"{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=216}} She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new [[White House china|official china pattern]] from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings.{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|pp=417–419}} On August 7, 1974, the family met in the [[Sunroom|solarium]] of the White House for their last dinner. Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband.<ref name="csa217">{{harvp|Anthony|1991|p=217}}</ref> When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, "We're all very proud of you, Daddy."<ref name="csa217"/> Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling."{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|p=424}}

On the morning of August 9 in the East Room, Nixon gave a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s biography and praised his own parents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/nixon-farewell.htm|title= Richard M. Nixon: White House Farewell|accessdate= September 23, 2007|publisher=The History Place}}</ref> The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] and Betty Ford. The outgoing president departed from the White House on [[Marine One]]. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty "You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em."{{sfnp|Anthony|1991|p=218}} The helicopter transported them to [[Andrews Air Force Base]]; from there they flew to California.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/06/nixon.resigns/|title=Nixon's resignation changed American politics forever|date=August 9, 1999|accessdate=August 18, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829175425/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/06/nixon.resigns/ |archivedate = August 29, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie, "Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down&nbsp;... And I know I will never live to see the vindication."{{sfnp|Eisenhower|1986|p=453}}

== Public perception ==
[[File:Pat Nixon reaches out to young girl.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Nixon reaches out from her limousine to a young girl during an October 1972 campaign stop in [[Atlanta]].]]
Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to, and identified with, Pat Nixon.<ref name="csa187"/> When a group of people from a rural community visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated.<ref name="csa187"/> When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see her washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room.<ref name="csa187"/> She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis.<ref name="csa197"/> During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister [[Zhou En-lai]] was sufficiently smitten with her so as to give two rare [[giant panda]]s to the United States as a gift from China.<ref name="csa199200"/>

As for the criticisms, she said, "I am who I am and I will continue to be."<ref name="PN is the Ultimate Good Sport"/> She unguardedly revealed some of her opinions of her own life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with [[Gloria Steinem]]: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world.

Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker, she was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed.

After she had spoken to some of them in one instance in 1970, however, one of the students told the press that "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing.

[[Image:Pat nixon.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Nixon's official White House portrait, painted in 1978 by [[Henriette Wyeth|Henriette Wyeth Hurd]]]]
After returning to [[San Clemente, California]], in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, ''[[La Casa Pacifica]]'', Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood hometown of Artesia to dedicate the [[Patricia Nixon Elementary School]].<ref name="Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 441">{{harvp|Eisenhower|1986|p=441}}</ref> In her remarks, she said, "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them.

Pat has been portrayed by [[Joan Allen]] in the 1995 film ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', [[Patty McCormack]] in the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' and [[Nicole Sullivan]] in the 2009 film ''[[Black Dynamite]]''. She was sung by soprano [[Carolann Page]] in [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]' opera ''[[Nixon in China]]'' 1987 world premiere in Houston, Texas; a ''[[New York Times]]'' critic noted that the performance captured "the First Lady's shy mannerisms" while one from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the subject as the "chronically demure First Lady".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/arts/opera-nixon-in-china.html|title=Opera: ''Nixon in China''|first=Donal|last=Henahan|authorlink=Donal Henahan|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-24/entertainment/ca-3984_1_opera-premiere/2|title=Gala Opera Premiere: John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' in Houston|first=Martin|last=Bernheimer|authorlink=Martin Bernheimer|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 24, 1987}}</ref> The part was later sung by Scottish soprano [[Janis Kelly (soprano)|Janis Kelly]] in the 2011 [[Metropolitan Opera]] premiere in New York.

She speaks of coming from a poor family and tells the obliging children that for a while she was a schoolteacher. In Mr. Adams's tender music, as sung by Ms. Kelly, you sense Mrs. Nixon wistfully pondering the much different life she might have had."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/arts/music/04nixon.html|title=President and Opera, on Unexpected Stages|first=Anthony|last=Tommasini|authorlink=Anthony Tommasini|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2011|page=C1}}</ref>
