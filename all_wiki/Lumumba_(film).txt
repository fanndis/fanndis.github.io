'''''Lumumba''''' is a 2000 film directed by [[Raoul Peck]] centred on [[Patrice Lumumba]] in the months before and after [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]] achieved independence from [[Belgium]] in June 1960. [[Raoul Peck]]'s film is a coproduction of France, Belgium, Germany, and Haiti. [[Second Congo War|Political unrest]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] at the time of filming caused the film to be shot in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Beira, Mozambique]].

==Plot==
The plot is based on the final months of Lumumba (played by [[Eriq Ebouaney]]), the first Prime Minister of the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]], whose tenure in office lasted two months, until he was driven from office. [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] ([[Maka Kotto]]) is sworn in as the first President of the country, alongside Lumumba as Prime Minister. Together, they attempt to prevent the Congo succumbing to secession and anarchy. The film concludes with [[Joseph Mobutu]] ([[Alex Descas]]) seizing power.

The film grossed $684,000 in the US.<ref name=boxoffice/> It also aired on [[HBO]].<ref name=hbo/>

Reviewing the film in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alex Tunzelmann noted Peck's "commendable effort to get as close to the truth as possible, incorporating many details from historical investigator Ludo de Witte's ''The Assassination of Lumumba''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tunzelmann|first1=Alex von|title=Lumumba fights its corner as a corrective to imperialism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/14/lumumba-corrective-imperialism|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2012}}</ref> Tunzelmann suggested the film might move too quickly through the Congo and Lumumba's history for viewers not already familiar with it to keep up, but said the "last part of the film, from Lumumba's falling out with Mobutu to his death, is gripping to watch, building to a superb last scene intercutting Lumumba's fate with Mobutu's attempt to rewrite history." Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] read the film's pace as "refus[ing] to lay out Lumumba's life in traditional, corny terms by presenting a lengthy and unwieldy history lesson and then groveling for audience sympathy. Instead ''Lumumba'' vaults through his radicalization and the track that led this former civil servant and beer salesman to leave his angry stamp on the world."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elvis|title=FILM REVIEW; An African Leader's Brief Blaze of Glory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D61130F934A15755C0A9679C8B63|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=27 June 2001|language=en}}</ref>

===Disputed scene===
The film generated some controversy in 2002, when [[Frank Carlucci]], a former American government official and protege of [[Donald Rumsfeld]], persuaded [[HBO]] to delete a reference to him during the airing of the film. The scene in question involves a group of Belgian and Congolese officials deciding whether to kill Lumumba. Carlucci is asked for input, and he mumbles that the US government does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries. At the time, Carlucci was the second secretary of the US Embassy in Congo. He denies playing any role in the death of Lumumba: "The scene is tendentious, false, libelous; it never happened and it is a cheap shot."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

According to one source, the scene was deleted from the version of the film that aired on HBO.<ref name=thenation/> Another source says that the scene was not deleted, but the word "Carlucci" was bleeped in the dialogue, with the name masked in the credits.<ref name=laurier/> The scene remains on the DVD version of the film.
