The '''Bachelor of Business Administration''' ('''BBA''') is a [[bachelor's degree]] in  [[business administration]].

In the United States, the degree is conferred after four years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. In Europe, the degree is conferred after three years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific [[Academic major|concentration]]s.

==Structure==
The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular area. BBA programs thus expose students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see aside. 

The degree also develops the student's practical, managerial and communication skills, and business decision-making capability. Many programs incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry. 

General educational requirements emphasize [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to "Quantitative Applications for Business" or, alternatively, courses in [[Business_mathematics#University_level|Calculus for business]] or [[Calculus 101]], and [[business statistics|business-]] or general-statistics.

===BSBA===
The BSBA '''Bachelor of Science in Business Administration''', is a quantitative variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively mathematics intensive; furthermore, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing additional quantitative optional coursework.

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, [[undergraduate]] business administration programs may be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]], thus indicating that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=AACSB accredited schools|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|publisher=AACSB|access-date=2010-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910083931/http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|archive-date=2012-09-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>
