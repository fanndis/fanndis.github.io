{{History of the Cold War}}

The '''Cold War''' was a period of [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] tension between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] and their respective allies, the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Western Bloc]], after [[World War II]]. Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but the period is generally considered to span the 1947 [[Truman Doctrine]] to the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The term "[[Cold war (general term)|cold]]" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two [[superpowers]], but they each supported major regional conflicts known as [[Proxy war|proxy wars]]. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|victory]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sempa|first=Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4uDwAAQBAJ|title=Geopolitics: From the Cold War to the 21st Century|date=2017-07-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-51768-3|language=en}}</ref> The doctrine of [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) discouraged [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|a pre-emptive attack]] by either side. Aside from the [[Nuclear arms race|nuclear arsenal development]] and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as [[psychological warfare]], propaganda campaigns, [[Cold War espionage|espionage]], far-reaching [[Economic sanctions|embargoes]], rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the [[Space Race]].

The West was led by the United States as well as the other [[First World]] nations of the Western Bloc that were generally [[liberal democratic]] but tied to a network of authoritarian states, most of which were [[Analysis of Western European colonialism and colonization|their former colonies]].{{sfn|G. Jones|2014|pp=176–79}}{{efn-ua|[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-16 "Where did banana republics get their name?" ''The Economist'', 21 November 2013]}} The East was led by the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] and its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], which had an influence across the [[Second World]]. The US government [[United States involvement in regime change#Cold War|supported right-wing governments and uprisings]] across the world, while the Soviet government [[Russia involvement in regime change#1941%E2%80%931953|funded communist parties and revolutions]] around the world. As nearly all the colonial states [[Decolonization#The emergence of the Third World (1945%E2%80%93present)|achieved independence in the period 1945–1960]], they became [[Third World]] battlefields in the Cold War.

[[Cold War (1947–1953)|The first phase]] of the Cold War began immediately after the end of the [[WWII|Second World War]] in 1945. The United States [[North Atlantic Treaty|created]] the [[NATO]] military alliance in 1949 in the apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed [[Foreign policy of the United States|their global policy]] against Soviet influence ''[[containment]]''. The Soviet Union formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1955 in response to NATO. Major crises of this phase included the 1948–49 [[Berlin Blockade]], the 1927–50 [[Chinese Civil War]], the 1950–53 [[Korean War]], the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] and the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The USSR and the US competed for influence in [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Decolonisation of Africa#Timeline|decolonizing states of Africa]] and [[Asia]].

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, [[Cold War (1962–1979)|a new phase began]] that saw the [[Sino-Soviet split]] between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater autonomy of action. The USSR [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded Czechoslovakia]] to suppress the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], while the US experienced internal turmoil from the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 1960s–70s, an international [[peace movement]] took root among citizens around the world. [[Anti-nuclear movement|Movements]] against [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear arms testing]] and for [[nuclear disarmament]] took place, with large [[anti-war protests]]. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of [[détente]] that saw the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] and the US [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|opening relations]] with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a strategic counterweight to the USSR.

Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in 1979. The [[Cold War (1979–1985)|early 1980s]] were another period of elevated tension. The United States increased [[Reagan Doctrine|diplomatic, military, and economic pressures]] on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. [[Cold War (1985–1991)|In the mid-1980s]], the new Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness", c. 1985) and ''[[perestroika]]'' ("reorganization", 1987) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer. The result in 1989 was a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of revolutions]] that (with the exception of [[Romanian Revolution|Romania]]) peacefully overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|abortive coup attempt]] in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|its constituent republics]] and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's only superpower.

The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to [[Culture during the Cold War|in popular culture]], especially with themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, a renewed state of tension between one of the Soviet Union's successor states, the [[Russian Federation]], and the United States in the 21st century (including its [[Western world|Western]] allies) as well as growing tension between an increasingly powerful China and the U.S. and its Western allies have each been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].{{sfn|Syria crisis|2018}}

==Origins of the term==
{{Main|Cold war (general term)}}
At the end of World War II, English writer [[George Orwell]] used ''[[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]'', as a general term, in his essay "You and the Atomic Bomb", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of [[nuclear warfare]], Orwell looked at [[James Burnham]]'s predictions of a polarized world, writing:

{{quote|Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery... James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications—that is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of "cold war" with its neighbours.{{sfn|Orwell|1945}}}}

In ''[[The Observer]]'' of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, "after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire."{{sfn|Orwell|1946}}

The first use of the term to describe the specific [[post-war]] geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by [[Bernard Baruch]], an influential advisor to Democratic presidents,{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=54}} on 16 April 1947. The speech, written by a journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]],{{sfn|Safire|2006}} proclaimed, "Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war."{{sfn|History.com|2009}} Newspaper columnist [[Walter Lippmann]] gave the term wide currency with his book ''The Cold War''. When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, ''la guerre froide''.{{efn-ua|[[Strobe Talbott]], ''The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation'' (2009) p. 441 n. 3; Lippmann's own book is {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydc3AAAAIAAJ|author=Lippmann, Walter|title=The Cold War|publisher=Harper|year=1947}}}}

===Russian Revolution===
[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|Allied troops in [[Vladivostok]], August 1918, during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]]]

{{Main|Russian Revolution|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}

While most historians trace the origins of the Cold War to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began with the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]] in 1917 when the [[Bolsheviks]] took power. In [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]], the British, French and [[Russian Empire]]s had comprised the Allied Powers from the start, and the U.S. joined them in April 1917. The [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November 1917 and fulfilled their promise to withdraw from WWI, and German armies advanced rapidly across the borderlands. The Allies responded with an economic [[blockade]] against all of Russia.{{sfn|Tucker|2016|p=608}} In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of [[Opposition to World War I|popular disgust against the war]] and accepted harsh German peace terms with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany to win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front{{sfn|Combs|2015|p=97–101}} and by <blockquote>"relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe."{{sfn|Chretien|2017|p=129}}{{sfn|Senior|2016|p=176}} </blockquote>According to historian [[Spencer Tucker]], the Allies felt, "The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention," and proceeded to step up their "[[economic warfare]]" against the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Tucker|2016|p=608}} [[Left communism|Some Bolsheviks]] saw Russia as only the first step, planning to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need for peace with Germany led Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] away from this position.{{efn-ua|{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Left-Communist |title= Left Communist {{!}} Russian political faction |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=30 September 2018 |language= en}}}}

In 1918 Britain provided money and troops to support the [[White movement|anti-Bolshevik "White" counter-revolutionaries]]. This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War [[Winston Churchill]], a committed [[British Empire|British imperialist]] and [[anti-communist]].<ref>Clifford Kinvig, ''Churchill's crusade: the British invasion of Russia, 1918–1920'' (2007) pp=91–95.</ref> France, Japan and the United States [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invaded]] Russia in an attempt to topple the new Soviet government. Despite the economic and military warfare launched against it by Western powers, the Bolshevik government succeeded in defeating all opposition and took full control of Russia, as well as breakaway provinces such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.<ref>Richard Luckett, ''The White Generals: An Account of the White Movement and the Russian Civil War'' (Routledge, 2017).</ref>

Western powers also diplomatically isolated the Soviet government. [[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement" and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert English|title=Russia and the Idea of the West: Gorbachev, Intellectuals, and the End of the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qA_uT6GrcxEC&pg=PA26|year=2000|page=26|isbn=9780231504744|access-date=30 November 2019|archive-date=29 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729150207/https://books.google.com/books?id=qA_uT6GrcxEC&pg=PA26|url-status=live}}</ref> He set up an organization to promote sister revolutions worldwide, the [[Comintern]]. It failed everywhere; it was crushed when it tried to start revolutions in Germany, Bavaria, and Hungary.<ref>Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (1996)</ref> The failures led to an inward turn by Moscow.

Britain and other Western powers—except the United States—did business and sometimes recognized the new Soviet Union. By 1933, old fears of Communist threats had faded, and the American business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used presidential authority to normalize relations in November 1933.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=341–343}} However, there was no progress on the Tsarist debts Washington wanted Moscow to repay. Expectations of expanded trade proved unrealistic. Historians Justus D. Doenecke and Mark A. Stoler note that, "Both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord."{{sfn|Doenecke|Stoler|2005|pp=18. 121}}  Roosevelt named [[William Christian Bullitt Jr.|William Bullitt]] as ambassador from 1933 to 1936. Bullitt arrived in Moscow with high hopes for Soviet–American relations, but his view of the Soviet leadership soured on closer inspection. By the end of his tenure, Bullitt was openly hostile to the Soviet government, and he remained an outspoken anti-communist for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Brownell|Billings|1987}}

===Beginnings of World War II===
In the late 1930s, Stalin had worked with Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] to promote [[popular fronts]] with capitalist parties and governments to oppose [[fascism]]. The Soviets were embittered when Western governments chose to practice [[appeasement]] with Nazi Germany instead. In March 1939 Britain and France—without consulting the USSR—granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the [[Munich Agreement]]. Facing an aggressive Japan at Soviet borders as well, Stalin changed directions and replaced Litvinov with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], who negotiated closer relations with Germany.{{sfn|Leffler|2008|pp=18–19}}

After signing the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[German–Soviet Frontier Treaty]], the Soviet Union forced the [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]]—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—to allow it [[Background of the occupation of the Baltic states#Soviet ultimatums and occupation|to station Soviet troops in their countries]].{{sfn|Kalnins|2015|pp=126–27}} Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939. The resulting [[Winter War]] ended in March 1940 with [[Moscow Peace Treaty|Finnish concessions]].{{sfn|Tucker|2016|pp=612–13}} Britain and France, treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's expulsion from the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|De Gruyter|2010|pp=171–72}}

In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]].{{sfn|Otfinoski|2014|p=14}} It also seized the disputed Romanian regions of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Hertza]]. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941 and declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers worked together to fight Germany. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its [[Lend-Lease]] Program.{{sfn|Herring|1973}} However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|pp=151–53}}

==End of World War II (1945–1947)==

===Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe===
{{Further|Tehran Conference|Yalta Conference|List of Allied World War II conferences}}
The Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13–23}} Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13–23}} Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through [[international organization]]s.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|p=156}} Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals—military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the [[British Empire]], and the creation of a world peace organization—were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Plokhy|2010}}

[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|The "[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]" at the Yalta Conference: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], 1945]]

The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries in its border regions.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13–23}}{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|p=176}} During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties.{{efn-ua|[[Max Frankel]], "Stalin's Shadow", [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/iron-curtain-by-anne-applebaum.html ''New York Times'' 21 Nov 2012] reviewing Anne Applebaum, ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944–1956'' (2012), See Introduction, text after note 26, and ch. 3, 7–9}} Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.{{sfn|Heller|2006| p= 27 |quote=From the Soviet perspective, a postwar period of peace and reconstruction was indispensable. Therefore, the continuation of cooperation and peaceful relations with its wartime allies, the United States and Great Britain, was greatly to be desired.}}

In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors.

The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the "[[percentages agreement]]" to divide Europe into respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]], including giving Stalin predominance [[Romania in World War II|over Romania]], Hungary, and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche [[White Terror (Greece)|over Greece.]] This proposal was accepted by Stalin. At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin regarding Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations.{{sfn|Plokhy|2010}} Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement,{{sfn|Carlton|2000}}{{sfn|Todd|2016|pp=105–111}} but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=21}}

[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|Post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation zones in Germany]]]]

At the [[Second Quebec Conference]], a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12–16 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]'s original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for "eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar ... looking forward to [[Morgenthau Plan|converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural]] and pastoral in its character." However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states.{{efn-ua|[[United States Government Printing Office]], Report on the Morgenthau Diaries prepared by the Subcommittee of the [[United States]] Committee of the Judiciary appointed to investigate the Administration of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] and other Internal Security Laws, (Washington, 1967) volume 1, pp. 620–21}}
On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the US occupation directive [[Morgenthau Plan|JCS 1067]], which was in effect for over two years, and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin. It directed the US forces of occupation to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany".{{sfn|Jonas|1985|p=270}}

Some historians have argued that the Cold War began when [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|the US negotiated a separate peace]] with [[Schutzstaffel|Nazi SS]] General [[Karl Wolff]] in northern Italy. The Soviet Union was not allowed to participate and the dispute led to heated correspondence between Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin. Wolff, a war criminal, appears to have been guaranteed immunity at the [[Nuremberg trials]] by Office of Strategic Services ([[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]) commander and future [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[Allen Dulles]] when they met in March 1945. Wolff and his forces were being considered to help implement [[Operation Unthinkable]], a secret plan to invade the Soviet Union which Winston Churchill advocated during this period.{{sfn|von Lingen|2013|pp=6, 81–90}}{{sfn|Rev|2010}}{{sfn|Peck|2017|p=2}}

In April 1945, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by [[Harry S. Truman]], who distrusted Stalin and turned for advice to an [[The Wise Men (book)#The "Wise Men"|elite group]] of foreign policy intellectuals. Both Churchill and Truman opposed, among other things, the Soviets' decision to prop up the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Lublin government]], the Soviet-controlled rival to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London, whose relations with the Soviets had been severed.{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=94}}

Following the [[End of World War II in Europe|Allies' May 1945 victory]], the Soviets effectively occupied Central and Eastern Europe,{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=21}} while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe. In [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]], France, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States established zones of occupation and a loose framework for parceled four-power control.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=22}}

The [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 Allied conference in San Francisco]] established the multi-national [[United Nations]] (UN) for the maintenance of [[world peace]], but the enforcement capacity of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] was effectively paralyzed by the ability of individual members to exercise [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]].{{sfn|Glennon|2003}} Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=401}}

At the [[Potsdam Conference]], which started in late July after Germany's surrender, serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. {{sfn|Byrd|2003}} The Soviets pressed their demand made at Yalta, for $20&nbsp;billion of reparations to be taken from Germany occupation zones. The Americans and British refused to fix a dollar amount for reparations, but they permitted the Soviets to remove some industry from their zones.{{sfn|Moss|1993|p=256}} Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions, and to entrench their positions.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=62}} At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=24–26}}

The US had invited Britain into its atomic bomb project but kept it secret from the Soviet Union. Stalin was aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb, and he reacted to the news calmly.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=24–26}} One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference, the US [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in [[occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]].{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=28}} Stalin was also outraged by the actual dropping of the bombs, calling them a "superbarbarity" and claiming that "the balance has been destroyed...That cannot be." The Truman administration intended to use its ongoing nuclear weapons program to pressure the Soviet Union in international relations.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=24–26}}

Following the war, the United States and the United Kingdom used military forces in Greece and Korea to remove indigenous governments and forces seen as communist. Under the leadership of [[Lyuh Woon-Hyung]], working secretly during Japanese occupation, committees throughout [[Korea]] formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence.

===Beginnings of the Eastern Bloc===
{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}
{{Further|Post–World War II economic expansion}}
[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the so-called 'Iron Curtain']]

During the opening stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the [[Eastern Bloc]] by [[Military occupations by the Soviet Union|invading and then annexing]] several countries as [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Socialist Republics]], by agreement with Germany in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included eastern [[Poland]] ([[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|incorporated]] into the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]),{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=43}} [[Latvia]] (which became the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]]),{{sfn|Wettig|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Senn|2007}} [[Estonia]] (which became the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]]),{{sfn|Wettig|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Senn|2007}} [[Lithuania]] (which became the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]]),{{sfn|Wettig|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Senn|2007}} part of eastern [[Finland]] (which became the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]]) and eastern [[Romania]] (which became the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]]).{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=55}}

Central and Eastern European territories that the Soviet army liberated from Germany were added to the [[Eastern Bloc]], pursuant to the [[Percentages Agreement]] between Churchill and Stalin. The Soviet Union converted the territories it occupied into [[satellite state]]s,{{sfn|Schmitz|1999}} such as:
* [[People's Republic of Albania]] (11 January 1946){{sfn|Cook|2001|p=17}}
* [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] (15 September 1946)
* [[Polish People's Republic]] (19 January 1947)
* [[People's Republic of Romania]] (13 April 1948)
* [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (9 May 1948){{sfn|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}
* [[Hungarian People's Republic]] (20 August 1949){{sfn|van Dijk|2008|p=200}}
* [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (7 October 1949){{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}

The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[Planned economy|command economy]], but also adopted the brutal methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Soviet secret police in order to suppress both real and potential opposition.{{sfn|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}} In Asia, the Red Army had overrun [[Manchuria]] in the last month of the war, and it went on to occupy the large swathe of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=40}}

As part of consolidating Stalin's control over the Eastern Bloc, the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs]] (NKVD), led by [[Lavrentiy Beria]], supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed to crush anti-communist resistance.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=34}} When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=100}}

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.{{sfn|Fenton|1998}} After World War II, US officials guided Western European leaders in establishing their own secret security force to prevent subversion in the Western bloc, which evolved into [[Operation Gladio]].{{sfn|Editors}}

In late February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]]'s "[[Long Telegram]]" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. The Truman Administration was receptive to the telegram due to broken promises by Stalin concerning Europe and Iran.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}<!-- |Schecter|2003|pp=152–54 citation not found --> Following the WWII [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]], the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south.{{sfn|Sebestyen|2014}} Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities.{{sfn|Sebestyen|2014}} However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the [[People's Republic of Azerbaijan]] and [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish]] [[Republic of Mahabad]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2003|pp=65–6}} Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous "[[Iron Curtain]]" speech in [[Fulton, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=94}} The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an "iron curtain" dividing Europe from "[[Szczecin|Stettin]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]".{{sfn|Schmitz|1999}}{{sfn|Harriman|1987–1988}}

A week later, on 13 March, Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying that Churchill could be compared to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English-speaking nations]] so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was "a call for war on the U.S.S.R." The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere. He argued that there was nothing surprising in "the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries".{{sfn|Marxists Internet Archive}}{{sfn|McCauley|2008|p=143}}

In September, the Soviet side produced the [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov|Novikov]] telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and "co-authored" by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability "to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war".{{sfn|Kydd|2018|p=107}} On 6 September 1946, [[James F. Byrnes]] delivered a [[Restatement of Policy on Germany|speech]] in Germany repudiating the [[Morgenthau Plan]] (a proposal to partition and de-industrialize post-war Germany) and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=30}} As Byrnes admitted a month later, "The nub of our program was to win the German people&nbsp;... it was a battle between us and Russia over minds&nbsp;..."{{sfn|Morgan}} In December, the Soviets agreed to withdraw from Iran after persistent US pressure, an early success of containment policy.

By 1947, US president [[Harry S. Truman]] was outraged by perceived resistance of the Soviet Union to American demands in Iran, Turkey, and Greece, as well as Soviet rejection of the [[Baruch Plan]] on nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Milestones: 1945–1952}} In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] in [[Greek Civil War|its civil war]] against Communist-led insurgents.{{sfn|Iatrides|1996|pp=373–76}} The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] responded to this announcement by adopting a policy of [[containment]],{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=28–29}} with the goal of stopping the spread of [[Communism]]. Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of $400&nbsp;million to intervene in the war and unveiled the [[Truman Doctrine]], which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=28–29}} American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to [[Domino theory|expand Soviet influence]] even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the British-backed government.{{sfn|Gerolymatos|2017|pp=195–204}} (The insurgents were helped by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] against Stalin's wishes.){{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}}{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=38}}

Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] focused on containment and [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] that weakened during and after the [[Vietnam War]], but ultimately persisted thereafter.{{sfn|Paterson|1989|pp=35, 142 & 212}} Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance,{{sfn|Moschonas|2002|p=21}} while [[Eurocommunism|European]] and [[Communist Party USA|American Communists]], financed by the [[KGB]] and involved in its intelligence operations,{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|p=276}} adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War activists]], the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and the [[anti-nuclear movement]].{{sfn|Crocker|Hampson|Aall|2007|p=55}}

In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=16}} In June 1947, in accordance with the [[Truman Doctrine]], the United States enacted the [[Marshall Plan]], a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=16}} Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13&nbsp;billion (equivalent to $189.39&nbsp;billion in 2016) to rebuild the [[economy of Europe]]. Later, the program led to the creation of the [[OECD#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].

The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to [[European balance of power|Europe's balance of power]], such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|p=186}} The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.{{sfn|Dinan|2017|p=40}} One month later, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]], creating a unified [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}}

Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=32}} Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=32}} The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]] (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]]).{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}} Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=105–06}}

In early 1948, following reports of strengthening "reactionary elements", Soviet operatives executed a [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures.{{sfn|Wettig|2008|p=86}} The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point, set in motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=19}}

The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military [[Greek Civil War|won its civil war]].{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} Under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]] the Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] defeated the powerful [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]]–[[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist]] alliance in the [[Italian general election, 1948|elections of 1948]].{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=162}}

===Espionage===
{{Main|Cold War espionage|American espionage in the Soviet Union and Russian Federation|Soviet espionage in the United States}}
All major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables.{{sfn|Garthoff|2004}} The most famous and active organizations were the American [[CIA]],{{sfn|Immerman|2014}} the Soviet [[KGB]],{{sfn|Andrew|Gordievsky|1991}} and the British [[MI6]]. The East German [[Stasi]], unlike the others, was primarily concerned with internal security, but its [[Main Directorate for Reconnaissance]] operated espionage activities around the world.{{sfn|Trahair|Miller|2012}} The CIA secretly subsidized and promoted anti-communist cultural activities and organizations.{{sfn|Saunders|2013}} The CIA was also involved in European politics, especially in Italy.{{sfn|Barnes|1981}} Espionage took place all over the world, but Berlin was the most important battleground for spying activity.{{sfn|Murphy|Kondrashev|Bailey|1997}}

So much top secret archival information has been released so that historian [[Raymond L. Garthoff]] concludes there probably was parity in the quantity and quality of secret information obtained by each side. However, the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT (espionage) and "sometimes in its reach into high policy circles." In terms of decisive impact, however, he concludes:{{sfn|Garthoff|2004|pp=29–30}}
:We also can now have high confidence in the judgment that there were no successful "moles" at the political decision-making level on either side. Similarly, there is no evidence, on either side, of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side. There also is no evidence of any major political or military decision that was crucially influenced (much less generated) by an agent of the other side.

In addition to usual espionage, the Western agencies paid special attention to debriefing [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc defectors]].<ref>Cowley 1996 p.157</ref>{{citation not found}}

===Cominform and the Tito–Stalin Split===
{{Main|Cominform|Tito–Stalin Split}}
In September 1947, the Soviets created [[Cominform]], the purpose of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet [[Satellite state|satellites]] through coordination of communist parties in the [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=32}} Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the [[Tito–Stalin Split]] obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] position.{{sfn|Papathanasiou|2017|p=66}}

===Berlin Blockade and Airlift===
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
[[File:C-47s at Tempelhof Airport Berlin 1948.jpg|thumb|left|C-47s unloading at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in Berlin during the Berlin Blockade]]

The United States and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into [[Bizone|"Bizonia"]] (1 January 1947, later "Trizonia" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949).{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=13}} As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=18}} In addition, in accordance with the [[Marshall Plan]], they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the west German economy, including the introduction of a new [[Deutsche Mark]] currency to replace the old [[Reichsmark]] currency that the Soviets had debased.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=31}} The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with [[Walter Bedell Smith]] telling General Eisenhower "in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements."{{sfn|Layne|2007|p=67}}

Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in [[West Berlin]].{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=33}} The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=65–70}}

The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change. Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the [[Berlin Blockade#December elections|Berlin municipal elections]] (as they had done in the 1946 elections),{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=13}} which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86.3% and an overwhelming victory for the non-communist parties.{{sfn|Turner|1987|p=29}} The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self. 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue,{{sfn|Fritsch-Bournazel|1990|p=143}} and US Air Force pilot [[Gail Halvorsen]] created "[[Operation Vittles]]", which supplied candy to German children.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=26}} In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=34}}{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=180–81}}

In 1952, Stalin repeatedly [[Stalin Note|proposed a plan]] to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations, if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.{{sfn|van Dijk|1996}}

===Beginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe===
{{Main|NATO|Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Eastern Bloc media and propaganda}}
[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|President Truman signs the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] with guests in the Oval Office.]]

Britain, France, the United States, Canada and other eight western European countries signed the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] of April 1949, establishing the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=34}} That August, the [[RDS-1|first Soviet atomic device]] was detonated in [[Semipalatinsk]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]].{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}} Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948,{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|Turner|1987|p=23}} the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the [[Bizone|three Western zones of occupation]] in April 1949.{{sfn|Bungert|1994}} The Soviet Union proclaimed [[Soviet occupation zone|its zone of occupation]] in Germany the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] that October.{{sfn|Byrd|2003}}

Media in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was an [[Eastern Bloc media and propaganda|organ of the state]], completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party. Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party.{{sfn|O'Neil|1997|pp=15–25}} Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism, emphasizing themes of labor exploitation, imperialism and war-mongering.{{sfn|Wood|1992|p=105}}

Along with the broadcasts of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and the [[Voice of America]] to Central and Eastern Europe,{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=131}} a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the communist system in the Eastern Bloc.{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=9}} Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press.{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=9}} Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=7}}

American policymakers, including Kennan and [[John Foster Dulles]], acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas.{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=7}} The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world.{{sfn|Puddington|2003|p=10}} The CIA also [[Secrecy|covertly]] sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called [[Crusade for Freedom]].{{sfn|Cummings|2010}}

In the early 1950s, the US worked for the rearmament of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership of NATO.{{sfn|Byrd|2003}} In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=105}}

===Chinese Civil War, SEATO, and NSC-68===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War|Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|NSC 68}}
[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|250px|Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in Moscow, December 1949]]

In 1949, [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s United States-backed [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=39}} According to Norwegian historian [[Odd Arne Westad]], the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japan]]. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of [[Chinese nationalism]].{{sfn|Westad|2012|p=291}} Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]].

Confronted with the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|communist revolution in China]] and [[Soviet atomic bomb project|the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949]], the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its [[containment]] doctrine.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}} In [[NSC 68]], a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council instituted a Machiavellian policy {{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp= 164–67]}} while proposing to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}} Truman, under the influence of advisor [[Paul Nitze]], saw containment as implying complete [[rollback]] of Soviet influence in all its forms.{{sfn|Layne|2007|pp=63–66}}

United States officials moved to expand this version of containment into [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]], in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere. {{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=212}} In this way, this US would exercise "[[power projection|preponderant power]]," oppose neutrality, and [[grand strategy|establish global]] [[hegemony]].{{sfn|Layne|2007|pp=63–66}} In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "[[Pactomania]]"), the US formalized a series of alliances with [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]] (notably [[ANZUS]] in 1951 and [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.{{sfn|Byrd|2003}}

===Korean War===
{{Main|Division of Korea|Korean War|Rollback}}
[[File:IncheonLandingMcArthur.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Douglas MacArthur]], UN Command CiC (seated), observes the naval shelling of [[Incheon]] from [[USS Mount McKinley (AGC-7)|USS ''Mt. McKinley'']], 15 September 1950]]

One of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was US intervention in the [[Korean War]]. In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities,{{efn-ua|"South Korea's President Rhee was obsessed with accomplishing early reunification through military means. The Truman administration's fear that Rhee would launch an invasion prompted it to limit South Korea's military capabilities, refusing to provide tanks, heavy artillery, and combat planes. This did not stop the South Koreans from initiating most of the border clashes with North Korean forces at the thirty-eighth parallel beginning in the summer of 1948 and reaching a high level of intensity and violence a year later.

The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war. This directed the US's action to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty while allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the US/UN forces to pursue a [[rollback]] strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thereby allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.{{sfn|Matray|1979}} General [[Douglas MacArthur]] then advanced across the [[Division of Korea|38th Parallel]] into North Korea. The Chinese, fearful of a possible US invasion, sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them back below the 38th parallel.

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Georgy Malenkov]] initially succeeded him as leader of the Soviet Union only to be quickly removed and replaced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a "[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]" for the [[containment]] strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of "[[massive retaliation]]", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression.

While [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce.{{sfn|Khanna|2013|p=372}} The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the [[Eastern Bloc]] by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the [[Warsaw Pact]], in 1955.

From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. According to [[John Lewis Gaddis]], Khrushchev rejected Stalin's "belief in the inevitability of war," however. The new leader declared his ultimate goal was "[[peaceful coexistence]]".{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=70}} In Khrushchev's formulation, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own,{{sfn|Perlmutter|1997|p=145}} as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities,{{sfn|Njølstad|2004|p=136}} which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later "new thinking" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.{{sfn| Breslauer|2002|p=72}}

The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world, particularly in Western Europe, with great decline in membership as many in both western and socialist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response.{{sfn|Lendvai|2008|p=196}} The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician [[Milovan Djilas|Milovan Đilas]] who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that "The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed".{{sfn|Lendvai|2008|p=196}}

===Berlin ultimatum===
{{Main|Berlin Crisis of 1961#Berlin ultimatum|European integration}}
During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city". He gave the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to [[Mao Zedong]] that "Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=71}} NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.{{sfn|Taubman|2004|pp=488–502}}

===American military buildup===
{{Main|Flexible response}}

Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests. Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism. President Eisenhower's [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks all of the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money. Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as [[flexible response]]. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the [[United States special operations forces]], elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704–05}}

To support his new strategy Kennedy ordered a massive increase in defense spending. He sought, and Congress provided, a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union—he claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits. In his inaugural address Kennedy promised "to bear any burden" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war. In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the [[military-industrial complex]], Kennedy focused on rearmament.<ref>Rabe 2013</ref>{{citation not found}}

Nationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably [[Guatemala]], Indonesia and [[Indochina]], were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests .{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as [[decolonization]] gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=121–24}} Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.{{sfn|Towle|2000|p= 160}} The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology.{{sfn| Tucker|2010|p=1566}}

The United States used the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to undermine neutral or hostile Third World governments and to support allied ones.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|pp=64, 916}} In 1953, President Eisenhower implemented [[1953 Iranian coup d'état#Execution of Operation Ajax|Operation Ajax]], a covert coup operation to overthrow the Iranian prime minister, [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]]. The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] in 1951.

The non-aligned Indonesian government of [[Sukarno]] was faced with a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956, when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from [[Jakarta]]. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the [[Masyumi Party]], such as [[Sjafruddin Prawiranegara]], who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Partai Komunis Indonesia]] party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until [[Allen Lawrence Pope]], an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds [[Padang]] and [[Manado]]. By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961.{{sfn|Roadnight|2002}}

Worn down by the [[First Indochina War|communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence]] and handed a watershed defeat by communist [[Viet Minh]] rebels at the 1954 [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in [[Vietnam]]. In the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in [[North Vietnam]] and a pro-Western administration in [[South Vietnam]] at the [[17th parallel north]].

Many emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East–West competition. In 1955, at the [[Bandung Conference]] in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=126}} The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the [[Belgrade]]-headquartered [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1961.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with [[India]] and other key neutral states.

After 1956, the Sino-Soviet alliance began to break down. Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=142}} For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a "lunatic on a throne".{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=42}}

After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=142}} The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war.{{sfn|Lüthi|2010|pp=273–76}} Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=140–42}} Historian Lorenz M.

:The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and [[China–United States relations#Rapprochement|Sino-American rapprochement]].

The [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and [[History of Germany (1945–90)|post–World War II Germany]]. By the early 1950s, the [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement]] was emulated by most of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Dowty|1989|p=114}} However, hundreds of thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] annually emigrated to [[West Germany]] through a "loophole" in the system that existed between [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]], where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement.{{sfn|Harrison|2003|p=99}}

The emigration resulted in a massive "[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]" from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany's population had migrated to West Germany by 1961.{{sfn|Dowty|1989|p=122}} That June, the [[Soviet Union]] issued a new [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] from West Berlin.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=114}} The request was rebuffed, and on 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the [[Berlin Wall]], effectively closing the loophole.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=75}}

===Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev's ousting===
{{Main|Cuban Project|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photograph of a Soviet missile site in [[Cuba]], taken by a US [[Surveillance aircraft|spy aircraft]], 1 November 1962]]

The Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilisation operations known as [[Operation Mongoose]], devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961. Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962,{{sfn|Zubok|1994}} and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response.{{sfn|Zubok|1994}}

Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions. He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade, and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey.{{sfn|H. Jones|2009|p=122}} Castro later admitted that "I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons. ... we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and that we were going to disappear."{{sfn|Blight|Allyn|Welch|2002|p=252}}

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] than ever before.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=82}} The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the [[nuclear arms race]] at nuclear disarmament and improving relations,{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], had come into force in 1961.{{efn-ua|National Research Council Committee on Antarctic Policy and Science, p. 33}}

In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues managed to [[Nikita Khrushchev#Removal|oust]] him, but allowed him a peaceful retirement.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=119–20}} Accused of rudeness and incompetence, John Lewis Gaddis argues that Krhuschev was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=119}} and that Khrushchev had become an 'international embarrassment' when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=119}}

{{Main|Cold War (1962–1979)}}
[[File:1973 NATO and WP troop strengths in Europe.svg|thumb|NATO and Warsaw Pact troop strengths in Europe in 1973]]

In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while [[Eastern Bloc economies|Eastern Bloc economies stagnated]].{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}}{{sfn|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=16}}

The [[Vietnam War]] descended into a quagmire for the United States, leading to a decline in international prestige and economic stability, derailing arms agreements, and provoking domestic unrest. America's withdrawal from the war led it to embrace a policy of [[detente]] with both China and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Milestones: 1969–1976}}

In the [[1973 oil crisis]], Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]) cut their petroleum output. This raised oil prices and hurt Western economies, but helped the Soviet Union by generating a huge flow of money from its oil sales.{{sfn|Painter|2014}}

As a result of the oil crisis, combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as OPEC and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=212}} Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}} During this period, Soviet leaders such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Alexei Kosygin]] embraced the notion of [[détente]].{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}}

===Vietnam War===

[[File:Bruce Crandall's UH-1D.jpg|thumb|left|US combat operations during the [[Battle of Ia Drang]], [[South Vietnam]], November 1965]]
Under President [[John F.

The [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] gave President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground [[Military organization|combat units]] for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000.{{sfn|Koven|2015|p=93}} Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position. The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=131}} From this point, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) engaged in more [[conventional warfare]] with US and South Vietnamese forces.{{sfn|Glass|2017}}

The [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968 proved to be the turning point of the war. Despite years of American tutelage and aid the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead. Tet showed that the end of US involvement was not in sight, increasing domestic skepticism of the war and giving rise to what was referred to as the [[Vietnam Syndrome]], a public aversion to American overseas military involvements. Nonetheless operations continued to cross international boundaries: bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were used by North Vietnam as [[Ho Chi Minh trail|supply routes]], and were heavily [[Operation Barrel Roll|bombed by U.S. forces]].{{sfn|Kalb|2013}}

At the same time, 1963–65, American domestic politics saw the triumph of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. According to historian Joseph Crespino:
:It has become a staple of twentieth-century historiography that Cold War concerns were at the root of a number of progressive political accomplishments in the postwar period: a high progressive marginal tax rate that helped fund the arms race and contributed to broad income equality; bipartisan support for far-reaching civil rights legislation that transformed politics and society in the American South, which had long given the lie to America’s egalitarian ethos; bipartisan support for overturning an explicitly racist immigration system that had been in place since the 1920s; and free health care for the elderly and the poor, a partial fulfillment of one of the unaccomplished goals of the New Deal era. The list could go on.<ref>Joseph Crespino, "A Nation Ruled by Its Fears" ''Reviews in American History,'' 48#1 (March 2020), pp. 119-123, quoting p. 123. https://doi.org/10.1353/rah.2020.0016 </ref>

===French withdrawal from NATO military structures===
{{Main|Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle#Partial withdrawal from NATO in 1966}}
The unity of NATO was breached early in its history, with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France. De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in the organization and what he perceived as a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably [[French Algeria]], where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.{{sfn|Menon|2000|p=11}} De Gaulle considered the response he received to be unsatisfactory, and began the development of an [[Force de dissuasion|independent French nuclear deterrent]]. In 1966 he withdrew France from NATO's military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil.{{sfn| Nuenlist|Locher| Martin|2010|pp=99–102}}

In 1968, a period of political liberalization took place in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] called the [[Prague Spring]]. An "[[Action Programme (1968)|Action Program]]" of reforms included increasing [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of movement]], along with an economic emphasis on [[Final good|consumer goods]], the possibility of a multiparty government, limitations on the power of the secret police,{{efn-ua|Ello (ed.), Paul (April 1968).

{{Main|Brezhnev Doctrine}}

In September 1968, during a speech at the Fifth Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] one month after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Brezhnev outlined the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], in which he claimed the right to violate the sovereignty of any country attempting to replace Marxism–Leninism with capitalism. During the speech, Brezhnev stated:{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=150}}

{{quote|When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.}}

The doctrine found its origins in the failures of Marxism–Leninism in states like Poland, Hungary and East Germany, which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany and the rest of Western Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=153}}

The Middle East remained a source of contention. Egypt, which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR, was a troublesome client, with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] (with advisers and technicians) and the [[War of Attrition]] (with pilots and aircraft) against pro-Western Israel.{{sfn|Stone|2010|p=230}} Despite the beginning of an Egyptian shift from a pro-Soviet to a pro-American orientation in 1972 (under Egypt's new leader [[Anwar Sadat]]),{{sfn|Grenville|Wasserstein|1987}} rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians' behalf during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] brought about a massive American mobilization that threatened to wreck détente.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} <!-- Kumaraswamy, p. 127  Citation not found --> Although pre-Sadat Egypt had been the largest recipient of Soviet aid in the Middle East, the Soviets were also successful in establishing close relations with communist [[South Yemen]], as well as the nationalist governments of [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfn|Grenville|Wasserstein|1987}} Iraq signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1972.

Following [[Cambodian coup of 1970|Sihanouk's March 1970 deposition]] by pro-American general [[Lon Nol]], who ordered the North Vietnamese to leave Cambodia, North Vietnam attempted to overrun all of Cambodia following negotiations with [[Nuon Chea]], the second-in-command of the Cambodian communists (dubbed the [[Khmer Rouge]]) fighting to overthrow the Cambodian government.{{sfn|Mosyakov|2004|p=54}} Sihanouk fled to China with the establishment of the [[GRUNK]] in Beijing.<ref>Norodom Sihanouk, My War with the CIA, Random House, 1973, p.62</ref> American and South Vietnamese forces responded to these actions with a [[Operation Menu|bombing campaign]] and a brief [[Cambodian campaign|ground incursion]], which contributed to the violence of the [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]] that soon enveloped all of Cambodia.{{sfn|BBC|2018}} US carpet bombing [[Operation Freedom Deal|lasted until 1973]], and while it prevented the Khmer Rouge from seizing the capital, it also accelerated the collapse of rural society, increased social polarization,{{sfn|Chandler|2000|pp=96–98}} and killed tens of thousands of civilians.{{sfn|Power|2013}}

After taking power and distancing himself from the Vietnamese,{{sfn|Mosyakov|2004|p=66}} pro-China Khmer Rouge leader [[Pol Pot]] killed 1.5 to 2&nbsp;million Cambodians in the [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|killing fields]], roughly a quarter of the Cambodian population (an event commonly labelled the [[Cambodian genocide]]).{{sfn|Locard|2005}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2003}}{{sfn|Heuveline|2001|pp=102–105}}{{sfn|World Peace Foundation|2015}} [[Martin Shaw (sociologist)|Martin Shaw]] described these atrocities as "the purest genocide of the Cold War era."{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=141}} Backed by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]], an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by [[Heng Samrin]], Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978.

As a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|reached their peak]] in 1969, and United States President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War.{{sfn|Dallek|2007|p=144}} The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.

In February 1972, Nixon achieved a stunning rapprochement with China,{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=149–52}} traveling to Beijing and meeting with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]]. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the [[Vietnam War]] both weakened America's influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}<!-- Buchanan, pp. 168–69 Citation not found -->

Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] sign the SALT II treaty, 18 June 1979, in [[Vienna]]]]

Following his visit to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, including Brezhnev in Moscow.{{sfn|BBC|1972}} These [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: [[SALT I]], the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.{{sfn|Karabell|1999|p=916}}

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established the groundbreaking new policy of ''[[détente]]'' (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures. Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties,{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}} including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, ''détente'' would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually.{{sfn|Litwak|1986}}

These developments coincided with [[Bonn]]'s "[[Ostpolitik]]" policy formulated by the West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]],{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=154}} an effort to normalize relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe. Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the [[Helsinki Accords]] signed at the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=188}}

Kissinger and Nixon were "realists" who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide, because those goals were too expensive in terms of America's economic capabilities.<ref>Caldwell 2009</ref>{{citation not found}} Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace, trade and cultural exchanges. They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals, especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results. Instead Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize America's global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic, moral and political power. They rejected "idealism" as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism. Kissinger's realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter's moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan's rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism.<ref>Schwartz 2011</ref>{{citation not found}}

===Late 1970s deterioration of relations===
In the 1970s, the KGB, led by [[Yuri Andropov]], continued to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]], who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=186}} Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=178}}

Although President [[Jimmy Carter]] tried to place another limit on the arms race with a [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] agreement in 1979,{{sfn|BBC|1979}} his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=194–97}}

The term ''new Cold War'' refers to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant.{{sfn|Halliday|2001|p=2e}} [[John Patrick Diggins|Diggins]] says, "Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world."{{sfn| Diggins|2007|p=267}} [[Michael Cox (academic)|Cox]] says, "The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short."{{sfn|Cox|1990|p=18}}

[[File:Reagan sitting with people from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region in February 1983.jpg|thumb|left|President Reagan publicizes his support by meeting with [[Afghan Mujahideen]] leaders in the White House, 1983.]]

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in [[Afghanistan]] in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide.{{sfn|Hussain|2005|pp=108–09}} The [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen]] insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[China]],{{sfn|Starr|2004|pp=157–58}}{{sfn|Kinsella|1992}} while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.{{sfn|Hussain|2005|pp=108–09}} Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.{{sfn|Meher|2004|pp=68–69, 94}}

In September 1979, Khalqist President [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|pp=25–28}}

Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] treaty from ratification, imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. He described the Soviet incursion as "the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War".{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=211}}

[[File:Cold War Map 1980.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|The world map of military alliances in 1980]]

In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, [[Ronald Reagan]] bluntly stated, in a conversation with [[Richard V. Allen]], his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," he said. "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?"{{sfn|Allen}} In 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated Jimmy Carter in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]], vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=189}} Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]" and predicted that Communism would be left on the "[[ash heap of history]]," while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as "bent on world dominance."{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=197}}{{sfn|Ogorodnev|2013}} In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue. Reagan retreated on this issue.{{sfn|Esno|2018|pp=281–304}}{{sfn| Graebner|Burns|Siracusa|2008|pp=29–31}}

By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist position had developed into a stance known as the new [[Reagan Doctrine]]{{mdash}}which, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments.{{sfn|Graebner|Burns|Siracusa|2008|p=76}} Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]] government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting [[Islamism]] in the majority-Muslim [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asian Soviet Union]].<ref name="Singh">Singh 1995 p.130</ref>{{citation not found}} Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the [[jihad]] against the Soviet Union.<ref name="Singh" />{{citation not found}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] provided a moral focus for [[anti-communism]]; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] that galvanized opposition and may have led to his [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|attempted assassination]] two years later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}<!-- Henze, p. 171 citation not found -->

===Soviet and US military and economic issues===
{{Further|Era of Stagnation|Strategic Defense Initiative|SS-20 Saber|MGM-31 Pershing}}
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|US and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2006]]

The Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25&nbsp;percent of its gross national product at the expense of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and investment in civilian sectors.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=332}} Soviet spending on the [[arms race]] and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system,{{sfn|Towle|p=159}} which experienced at least [[Era of Stagnation|a decade of economic stagnation]] during the late Brezhnev years.

Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of [[nomenklatura|massive party and state bureaucracies]] dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=335}} The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their [[military–industrial complex|military–industrial base]].{{sfn|Odom|2000|p=1}} However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=340}} For example, the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] demonstrated how the [[Vehicle armour|armor]], [[Fire-control system|fire control systems]] and firing range of the Soviet Union's most common main battle tank, the [[T-72]], were drastically inferior to the American [[M1 Abrams]], yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72s as the US deployed M1s.{{sfn|Evans|1992}}

[[File:SDIO Delta Star.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Delta 183 launch vehicle lifts off, carrying the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] sensor experiment "Delta Star".]]

By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986,{{sfn|Carliner|Alesina|1991|p=6}} the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.{{sfn|Feeney|2006}}

Tensions continued to intensify as Reagan revived the [[B-1 Lancer]] program, which had been canceled by the Carter administration, produced [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles,{{sfn|Federation of American Scientists|2000}} installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced the experimental [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], dubbed "Star Wars" by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}<!-- Lakoff, p. 263 citation not found --> The Soviets deployed [[RSD-10 Pioneer]] [[ballistic missile]]s targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy [[MGM-31 Pershing]] and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=202}} This deployment placed missiles just 10&nbsp;minutes' striking distance from Moscow.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|pp=881–82}}

After Reagan's military buildup, the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military,{{sfn| Lebow|Stein|1994}} because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient [[Planned economy|planned manufacturing]] and [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized agriculture]], were already a heavy burden for the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Robert C.|date=November 2001|title=The rise and decline of the Soviet economy|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=859–881|doi=10.1111/0008-4085.00103|issn=0008-4085}}</ref><!-- Gaidar 2007 pp. 190–205 citation not found}} --> At the same time, [[Saudi Arabia]] increased oil production,{{sfn|Gaidar}} even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production.{{efn-ua|"[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/contents.html Official Energy Statistics of the US Government]", EIA&nbsp;– International Energy Data and Analysis.

On 1 September 1983, the Soviet Union shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], a [[Boeing 747]] with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], an action which Reagan characterized as a "massacre". The airliner had violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] near [[Moneron Island]], and the Soviets treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding US spy plane. The incident increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.{{sfn|Talbott|Hannifin|Magnuson|Doerner|1983}} The [[Able Archer 83]] exercise in November 1983, a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release, was perhaps the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis, as the Soviet leadership feared that a nuclear attack might be imminent.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=228}}

American domestic public concerns about intervening in foreign conflicts persisted from the end of the Vietnam War.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=323}} The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost [[counter-insurgency]] tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=323}} In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided [[Lebanese Civil War]], [[Invasion of Grenada|invaded]] [[Grenada]], [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombed]] [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya]] and backed the Central American [[Contras]], anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government in Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=212}} While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was [[Iran–Contra affair|mired in controversy]].{{sfn|Reagan|1991}} The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of [[Guatemala]] during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], in particular the regime of [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], was also controversial.{{sfn|New York Times|2013}}

Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions. Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet war in Afghanistan]] would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,{{sfn|Kinsella|1992}} waged a fierce resistance against the invasion.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=314}} The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war "the Soviets' Vietnam".{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|p=314}} However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system.

A senior [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a "domestic crisis within the Soviet {{nowrap|system. ... It}} may be that the thermodynamic law of [[entropy]] {{nowrap|has ... caught}} up with the Soviet system, which now seems to expend more energy on simply maintaining its equilibrium than on improving itself. We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay".{{sfn|Dobrynin|2001|pp=438–39}}

By the time the comparatively youthful [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] in 1985,{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=197}} the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|pp=331–33}} These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|pp=331–33}}

An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary, and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called ''[[perestroika]]'', or restructuring.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=231–33}} Perestroika relaxed the [[production quota]] system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=231–33}}

Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West.{{sfn|LaFeber|2002|pp=300–40}} Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced ''[[glasnost]]'', or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1999|p=7}} ''Glasnost'' was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and moderate the [[abuse of power]] in the [[Central Committee]].{{sfn|Gibbs|1999|p=33}} Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating [[détente]] between the two nations.{{sfn|Gibbs|1999|p=61}}

East–West tensions rapidly subsided through the mid-to-late 1980s, culminating with the final summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the [[START I]] arms control treaty.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=255}} During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain.{{sfn|Shearman|1995|p=76}} In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets [[Sinatra Doctrine|officially declared]] that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=248}}

In 1989, [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan]],{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=235–36}} and by 1990 Gorbachev [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|consented]] to [[German reunification]],{{sfn|Shearman|1995|p=76}} as the only alternative was a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]] scenario.{{sfn|Shearman|1995|p=74}} When the Berlin Wall came down, Gorbachev's "[[Common European Home]]" concept began to take shape.{{sfn|European NAvigator|1989}}

On 3 December 1989, Gorbachev and [[George H.W. Bush]] declared the Cold War over at the [[Malta Summit]].{{sfn|BBC|1989}} A year later, the two former rivals were partners in the [[Gulf War]] against [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] (August 1990 – February 1991).{{sfn|Newman|1993|p=41}}

===Eastern Europe breaks away===
{{Main|Revolutions of 1989}}
By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=235–236}} Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases. In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organization of competitive elections. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a [[Romanian Revolution|violent uprising]]. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State [[James Baker]] suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994}} The tidal wave of change culminated with the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe. The [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 revolutionary wave]] swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style [[Marxist–Leninist state]]s: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria;{{sfn|Lefeber |Fitzmaurice |Vierdag |1991|p=221}} Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=247}}

In the USSR itself, ''glasnost'' weakened the ideological bonds that held the Soviet Union together, and by February 1990, with the dissolution of the USSR looming, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.{{sfn|Sakwa|1999|p=460}} At the same time the union's component republics declared their autonomy from Moscow, with the [[Baltic states]] withdrawing from the union entirely.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=248. 253}}

Gorbachev used force to keep the Baltics from breaking away. The USSR was fatally weakened by a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] in August 1991. A growing number of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], particularly [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], threatened to secede from the USSR. The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], created on 21 December 1991, was a successor entity to the Soviet Union.{{efn-ua|[http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/14b6b499-9eb2-4dee-b96c-784ec918969a.html Soviet Leaders Recall 'Inevitable' Breakup Of Soviet Union], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 8 December 2006.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russia drastically cut [[List of countries by military expenditures|military spending]], and restructuring the economy left millions unemployed.{{sfn|PBS|2014}} The capitalist reforms culminated in a [[recession]] in the early 1990s more severe than the [[Great Depression]] as experienced by the United States and Germany.{{sfn|Nolan|1995|pp=17–18}} In the 25 years following the end of the Cold War, only five or six of the post-socialist states are on a path to joining the rich and capitalist world while most are falling behind, some to such an extent that it will take several decades to catch up to where they were before the collapse of communism.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2017|p=63}}{{sfn|Milanović|2015|pp=135–38}}

Communist parties outside the Baltic states were not outlawed and their members were not prosecuted. Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries, the communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.<ref>[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115092356/http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf |date=15 January 2016 }}. Svetozar Pejovich.</ref>

[[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] of the [[University of Chicago]] argued in 1996 that decommunization, after a brief active period, quickly ended in near-universal failure. After the introduction of [[lustration]], demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former [[East Germany]], where thousands of former [[Stasi]] informers have been fired from public positions.<ref name=mandelbaum>Michael Mandelbaum (Ed., 1996) "Post-Communism: Four Perspectives", ''Council on Foreign Relations'' {{ISBN|0876091869}}</ref>

Holmes suggests the following reasons for the failure of decommunization:<ref name=mandelbaum/>
*After 45–70 years of communist rule, nearly every family has members associated with the state. After the initial desire "to root out the reds" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice.
*The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past "old news" for many citizens.
*Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
*The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a [[totalitarian state]] to disenfranchise the "[[enemies of the people]]" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice.
*Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise.

The Cold War continues to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world is considered to be [[Unipolarity|unipolar]], with the United States the sole remaining [[superpower]].{{efn-ua|[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1217752.stm "Country profile: United States of America"].

Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8&nbsp;trillion.

However, the aftermath of the Cold War is not considered to be concluded. Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of [[economic growth]] and an increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].{{sfn|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}

==In popular culture==
{{See also|Culture during the Cold War}}
During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world, especially using motion pictures.{{sfn|Shaw|Youngblood|2010|loc=ch. 1}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}} The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, ''[[The Americans]]'', set in the early 1980s, was ranked No. 6 on the [[Metacritic]] annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.{{sfn|Dietz|2013}}{{sfn|Lowry|2018}}

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography of the Cold War}}
As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.{{sfn|Nashel|1999}} In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.{{sfn|Ambrose|Brinkley|2011|pp=789–99}} Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.{{sfn|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}

Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism", and "post-revisionism".{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}}

"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.{{sfn|Byrd|2003}}
