A '''truck''' or '''lorry''' is a [[motor vehicle]] designed  to transport [[cargo]]. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration. Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some [[automobile]]s. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of [[refuse truck]]s, [[fire truck]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s, and [[suction excavator]]s. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a "straight truck" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a "[[tractor]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/What%20We%20Do/Image%20and%20Outreach%20Programs/STR/Trucking%20Glossary.pdf |title=Glossary |website=www.trucking.org |format=PDF |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129105447/https://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/What%20We%20Do/Image%20and%20Outreach%20Programs/STR/Trucking%20Glossary.pdf |archive-date=29 November 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Modern trucks are largely powered by [[diesel engine]]s, although small- to medium-size trucks with [[gasoline engine]]s exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico. In the European Union, vehicles with a [[gross combination mass]] of up to {{convert|3.5|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}} are known as [[light commercial vehicle]]s, and those over as [[large goods vehicle]]s.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}

===Steam wagons===
[[Image:1924-Super-Sentinel.jpg|thumb|A [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] steam truck]]
{{Main|Steam wagon}}
Trucks and cars have a common ancestor: the steam-powered ''fardier'' [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] built in 1769.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, [[steam wagon]]s were not common until the mid-19th century. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these vehicles to very short hauls, usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] appeared in 1881,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} towed by a [[steam tractor]] manufactured by [[De Dion-Bouton]]. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of [[World War I]], and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.

===Internal combustion===
[[File:DMG-Lastwagen von 1896.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Daimler Motor-Lastwagen from 1898]]
In 1895 [[Karl Benz]] designed and built the first truck in history using the [[internal combustion]] engine. Later that year some of Benz's trucks were modified to become the first bus by the ''Netphener'', the first motorbus company in history. A year later, in 1896, another internal combustion engine truck was built by [[Gottlieb Daimler]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Truck History|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bltruck.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> Other companies, such as [[Peugeot]], [[Renault]] and [[Büssing]], also built their own versions. The first truck in the United States was built by [[Autocar Company|Autocar]] in 1899 and was available with optional {{convert|5|or|8|hp|0}} motors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Autocar, Always up, Our History|url=http://www.autocartruck.com/history|publisher=Autocar, LLC|accessdate=21 October 2018}}</ref>

Trucks of the era mostly used [[Straight engine|two-cylinder]] engines and had a carrying capacity of {{cvt|1.5|to|2|t|lbs|-2}}. In 1904, 700 heavy trucks were built in the United States, 1000 in 1907, 6000 in 1910, and 25000 in 1914.

After World War I, several advances were made: pneumatic [[tire]]s replaced the previously common full rubber versions. [[Starter motor|electric starters]], power [[brake]]s, 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines, closed [[#Cabs|cabs]], and electric lighting followed. The first modern semi-trailer trucks also appeared. Touring car builders such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and Renault entered the heavy truck market.

===Diesel engines===
Although it had been invented in 1897, the [[diesel engine]] did not appear in production trucks until Benz introduced it in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |title=Debut of diesel engines in tractors and trucks |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Debut-of-diesel-engines-in-tractors-and-trucks.xhtml?oid=9361501 |publisher=Daimler AG |accessdate=27 September 2018}}</ref> The diesel engine was not common in trucks in Europe until the 1930s. In the United States, Autocar introduced diesel engines for heavy applications in the mid-1930s. Demand was high enough that Autocar launched the "DC" model (diesel conventional) in 1939. However, it took much longer for diesel engines to be broadly accepted in the US: gasoline engines were still in use on heavy trucks in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Peter J.|title=The World Encyclopedia of Trucks|year=2000|publisher=Lorenz Books|isbn=0-7548-0518-2|pp=20–21, 114, 118, 160, 204|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Motor's Truck and Diesel Repair Manual|edition=26|year=1973|publisher=Motor|isbn=0-910992-16-9|pages=530, 1035}}</ref>

===Etymology===
[[File:ROMAN-deŝutulo; Braŝovo 2013.jpeg|thumb|right|A [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|ROMAN]] [[dump truck]] in [[Brașov]], Romania, 2013]]
{{original research section|date=February 2020}}
''Truck'' is used in [[American English]], and is common in [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[Pakistani English|Pakistan]] and [[South African English|South Africa]], while ''lorry'' is the equivalent in [[British English]], and is the usual term in countries like [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]], [[Singaporean English|Singapore]] and [[Indian English|India]].{{Original research inline|date=February 2020}}

The first known usage of "truck" was in 1611 when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships' cannon carriages. In its extended usage, it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads, a meaning known since 1771. Its expanded application to "motor-powered load carrier" has been in usage since 1930, shortened from "motor truck", which dates back to 1901.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truck?show=2&t=1284721768 "Truck"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=truck&searchmode=none "Truck"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref>

"Lorry" has a more uncertain origin, but probably has its roots in the [[rail transport]] industry, where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a [[Railroad car|goods wagon]] as in British usage, not a [[bogie]] as in the American), specifically a large flat wagon. It might derive from the verb ''lurry'' (to carry or drag along, or to lug) which was in use as early as 1664, but that association is not definitive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oed.com//view/Entry/111334|title=lurry, v.|last=|first=|date=September 2019|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> The expanded meaning of ''lorry'', "self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods", has been in usage since 1911.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lorry&searchmode=none "Lorry"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lorry "Lorry"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref>

{{Details|List of truck types}}
In the United States, Canada, and the Philippines "truck" is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than normal cars and includes pickups and other vehicles having an open load bed. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the word "truck" is mostly reserved for larger vehicles; in Australia and New Zealand, a pickup truck is usually called a [[ute (vehicle)|''ute'']] (short for "utility"),<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The First Ute|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/the-first-ute|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329182657/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/the-first-ute|archive-date=March 29, 2012|accessdate=15 June 2012|website=|publisher=ABC – Radio Australia}}</ref> while in South Africa it is called a ''bakkie'' ([[Afrikaans]]: "small open container"). In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland, and [[Hong Kong]] ''lorry'' is used instead of ''truck'', but only for the medium and heavy types, while ''truck'' is used almost exclusively to refer to [[pickup truck|pickup]]s.

==Types by size==
{{see also|Truck classification|List of truck types}}

===Ultra light===
[[File:Might-E Truck.jpg|thumb|[[Might-E Truck]] from [[Canadian Electric Vehicles]]]]
Often produced as variations of [[golf car]]s, with internal combustion or [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric drive]], these are used typically for off-highway use on estates, golf courses, and parks. While not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets, generally as a body variation of a [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]. A few manufactures produce specialized chassis for this type of vehicle, while [[Zap Motors]] markets a version of their Xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the U.S. as a motorcycle).

===Very light===
[[Image:PiaggioTruckMikinos06473.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Piaggio Porter]]]]
[[Image:Tata Super Ace DLS (front), Denpasar.jpg|thumb|[[Tata Super Ace]] in Indonesia]]
Popular in Europe and Asia, many mini-trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with [[monocoque]] bodies. Specialized designs with substantial frames such as the Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by [[Daihatsu]]) and are popular for use in "old town" sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.

Regardless of name, these small trucks serve a wide range of uses. In Japan, they are regulated under the [[Kei car]] laws, which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently, the engine is limited to 660 cc displacement). These vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in Japan. These Japanese-made mini trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road ATVs in the United States, and import regulations require that these mini trucks have a {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}} speed governor as they are classified as low-speed vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=777&section=571.3&section_toc=2060|title=49CFR571|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922163045/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=777&section=571.3&section_toc=2060|archive-date=22 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> These vehicles have found uses in construction, large campuses (government, university, and industrial), agriculture, cattle ranches, amusement parks, and replacements for golf carts.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=お問い合わせ|url=https://www.best-used-tractors.com/contact/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=|language=Japanese}}</ref>

===Light===
[[File:2018 Ford Ranger (PX) XLT 4WD 4-door utility (2018-10-22) 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Ford Ranger]] [[pickup truck]]]]
Light trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than {{convert|6.3|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}) and are used by individuals and businesses alike. In the EU they may not weigh more than {{convert|3.5|t|lbs|abbr=on}} and are allowed to be driven with a [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licence]] for cars. [[Pickup truck]]s, called utes in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.

===Medium===
[[File:DEPTC ATM-1273 20190113.jpg|thumb|left|Fuso Canter, 8th Generation in Taiwan.]]
Medium trucks are larger than light but smaller than heavy trucks. In the US, they are defined as weighing between {{cvt|13000|and|33000|lb|t}}.
For the UK and the EU the weight is between {{cvt|3.5|to|7.5|t|lb}}. Local delivery and public service ([[dump truck]]s, [[garbage truck]]s and [[fire apparatus|fire-fighting trucks]]) are normally around this size.

===Heavy===
[[File:Cement mixer.jpg|thumb|A [[cement mixer]] is an example of a Class 8 heavy truck]]
[[File:Borough of Hackney Seddon Atkinson Strato 325 8x4 Rubbish compactor, Apr 2009 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seddon Atkinson]] Stratos refuse compactor]]
[[File:Truck Pakistan.jpg|thumb|221x221px|left|In Pakistan the majority of trucks are colorful and decorated]]
[[File:SNVI_Truck_B260frigo.jpg|thumb|[[SNVI]] refrigerator truck]]
Heavy trucks are the largest on-road trucks, [[Class 8 truck|Class 8]]. These include vocational applications such as heavy dump trucks, concrete pump trucks, and refuse hauling, as well as ubiquitous long-haul 4x2 and [[6x4 (drivetrain)|6×4]] [[tractor unit]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141218231107/https://cta.ornl.gov/vtmarketreport/pdf/chapter3_heavy_trucks.pdf "Chapter 3. HEAVY TRUCKS – Center for Transportation" (PDF)] ''cta.ornl.gov'' 20 August 2015</ref>

Road damage and wear increase very rapidly with the axle weight. The number of steering axles and the suspension type also influence the amount of the road wear. In many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight of {{convert|44|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}} or more.

===Off-road===
[[File:An ALMA Antenna on the Move.jpg|thumb|right|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] antenna transporters are {{cvt|20|m|ft|frac=9}} long, {{cvt|10|m|ft|frac=9}} wide, weigh {{convert|130|t|1|abbr=on}} and drive on 28 tires.<ref>{{cite news|title=An ALMA Antenna on the Move|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1229a/|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref>]]
Off-road trucks include standard, extra heavy-duty highway-legal trucks, typically outfitted with off-road features such as a front driving axle and special tires for applications such as logging and construction, and purpose-built off-road vehicles unconstrained by weight limits, such as the [[Liebherr T 282B]] mining truck.

===Maximum sizes by country===
{{See|Road train}}
Australia has complex regulations over weight and length, including axle spacing, type of axle/axle group, rear overhang, kingpin to rear of trailer, drawbar length, ground clearance, as well as height and width laws. These limits are some of the highest in the world, a B-double can weigh {{convert|62.5|t|abbr=on}} and be {{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and [[road train]]s used in the [[outback]] can weigh {{convert|172|t|1|abbr=on}} and be {{convert|53.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=aus1>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2013/247a/sch1|title=Heavy Vehicle (Mass, Dimension and loading) National Regulation Schedule 1 (NSW)|publisher=New South Wales Government|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=aus6>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2013/247a/id54|title=Heavy Vehicle (Mass, Dimension and loading) National Regulation Schedule 6 (NSW)|publisher=New South Wales Government|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref>

The European Union also has complex regulations. The number and spacing of axles, steering, single or dual tires, and suspension type all affect maximum weights. Length of a truck, of a trailer, from axle to hitch point, kingpin to rear of trailer, and turning radius are all regulated. In additions, there are special rules for carrying containers, and countries can set their own rules for local traffic.<ref name=eurlex>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01996L0053-20150526|title=Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorized dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorized weights in international traffic|publisher=EUR-Lex|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref>

The United States Federal Bridge Law deals with the relation between the gross weight of the truck, the number of axles, the weight on and the spacing between the axles that the truck can have on the Interstate highway system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/Freight/publications/brdg_frm_wghts/index.htm|title=Freight Management and Operations: Bridge Formula Weights|publisher=US Department of Transportation|date=21 May 2015|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> Each State determines the maximum permissible [[Gross vehicle weight rating|vehicle]], [[Gross combined weight rating|combination]], and [[Gross axle weight rating|axle]] weight on state and local roads.

Almost all trucks share a common construction: they are made of a [[chassis]], a [[#Cab|cab]], an area for placing [[cargo]] or equipment, [[axle]]s, [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and [[wheel|roadwheels]], an [[engine]] and a [[powertrain|drivetrain]]. [[Pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], [[Engine cooling|water]], and [[electrical]] systems may also be present. Many also tow one or more [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] or semi-trailers.

[[File:Scania R470 topline.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Scania R-series|Scania R&nbsp;470]] flat nose truck]][[File:Kenworth_T2000,_Kenworth_Dealer_Hall_of_Fame,_2015.JPG|thumb|Streamlined conventional cab]]
[[File:Kuwaiti BM-30 Smerch.jpg|thumb|upright|Cab beside engine]]

The "cab" is an enclosed space where the driver is seated. A "[[truck sleeper|sleeper]]" is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks.

There are several possible cab configurations:
* "[[Cab over]] engine" (COE) or "flat nose"; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, and are widely used in the rest of the world. They were common in North American heavy-duty trucks but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium- and light-duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of "tilt-cab". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=58–61}} The COE design was invented by [[Viktor Schreckengost]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802613.html | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Viktor Schreckengost; Designed Bicycles, Dinnerware and More | first=Adam | last=Bernstein | date=29 January 2008 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>
* "Conventional" cabs are the most common in North America, Australia, and China, and are known in the UK as "American cabs" and in the Netherlands as "torpedo cabs". The driver is seated behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very [[m:wikt:streamline|streamlined]], with a sloped hood (bonnet) and other features to lower drag.
* "Cab beside engine" designs are used for [[terminal tractor]]s at [[shipyard|shipping yard]]s and for other specialist vehicles carrying long loads such as pipes. This type is often made by replacing the passenger side of a cab-over truck with an extended section of the load bed.
A further step from this is the side loading [[forklift]] that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.

===Engines and motors===
[[File:Cummins Engine (LKW).jpg|thumb|[[Cummins B Series engine#B6.7|Cummins ISB]] 6.7L medium-duty truck diesel engine]]
Most small trucks such as [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs), [[van]]s or [[pickup truck|pickups]], and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use [[gasoline engine]]s (petrol engines), but many [[diesel engine]]d models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use [[four stroke cycle|four-stroke]] diesel engines with a [[turbocharger]] and [[intercooler]]. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Detroit Diesel]] [[two stroke cycle|two stroke]] engine. Diesel engines are becoming the engine of choice for trucks ranging from class&nbsp;3 to 8 GVWs.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ [[CNG]] (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions.

A significant proportion of North American manufactured trucks use an engine built by the last remaining major independent engine manufacturer ([[Cummins]]) but most global OEMs such as [[Volvo Trucks]] and [[Daimler AG]] promote their own "captive" engines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Operators Handbook-DM, DMM, U Series|year=1988|publisher=[[Mack Trucks]]|pages=62–64}}</ref>

In the European Union, all new truck engines must comply with [[European emission standards|Euro&nbsp;VI]] emission regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/hd.php|title=EU: Heavy-Duty Truck and Bus Engines|date=November 2016|website=DieselNet|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>

{{As of|2019}} several alternative technologies are competing to displace the use of diesel engines in heavy trucks. CNG engines are widely used in the US refuse industry and in concrete mixers, among other short-range vocations, but range limitations have prevented their broader uptake in freight hauling applications. Heavy [[electric truck]]s and [[Hydrogen vehicle#Heavy trucks|hydrogen-powered trucks]] are still in the prototype and field-testing stages, although media reports indicate that there is substantial interest in them from major freight haulers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want a Nikola hydrogen-electric truck?

===Drivetrain===
[[File:Rear axles tandem.jpg|thumb|A truck rear suspension and drive axles overview]]
[[File:Eaton Autoshift.jpg|thumb|Eaton Roadranger 18 speed "crash box" with automated gearshift]]
Small trucks use the same type of [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with [[synchromesh]] (synchronizers). Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as "crash boxes", require [[double-clutching]] for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as "floating", a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double-clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.

Double-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain the required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while the transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while the transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. "Skip changing" is also widely used; in principle, the operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.

Common North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18&nbsp;speeds. [[automatic transmission|Automatic]] and [[automated manual transmission]]s for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12, and 16&nbsp;gears are common on larger trucks with a manual transmission, while conventional automatic or automated manual transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the "range and split" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so‑called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.

===Frame===
[[File:A truck chassis section.jpg|thumb|A truck rear frame (chassis) section view]]
[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|thumb|Pickup truck frame (right rear view)]]
A truck [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C‑shaped rails, or beams, held together by [[crossmember]]s. These frames are referred to as [[ladder frame]]s due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy-duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.

The frame is usually made of [[steel]], but can be made (whole or in part) of [[aluminum]] for a lighter weight. A [[Drawbar (haulage)|tow bar]] may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy tractors almost always make use of a [[fifth wheel]] hitch.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}<!-- One out of five heavy trucks (16 tonnes and above) in Sweden are tractors. http://www.vbg.se/sv/support/lfg_statistik/30.-Lastbilar_over_16_ton_1988-.pdf Virtually all other heavy trucks, the majority of the heavy trucks, have a bolt couplings (such as a [[Ringfeder]]). -->

===Body types===
'''[[Refrigerator truck]]s''' have insulated panels as walls and a roof and floor, used for transporting fresh and frozen cargo such as ice cream, food, vegetables, and prescription drugs. They are mostly equipped with double-wing rear doors, but a side door is sometimes fitted.

'''[[Box truck]]s''' ("tilts" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making an enclosed load space. The rear has doors for unloading; a side door is sometimes fitted.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=30–31}}

'''[[Concrete mixer]]s''' have a rotating drum on an inclined axis, rotating in one direction to mix, and in the other to discharge the concrete down chutes. Because of the weight and power requirements of the drum body and rough construction sites, mixers have to be very heavy duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcneiluscompanies.com/Concrete-Mixers/concrete-mixers.html|title=Concrete Mixers (company site)|date=2016|publisher=McNeilus|access-date=24 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schwing-stetter.co.uk/Downloads/TruckMixers.pdf|title=Truck Mixers Summary (Sales Brocure)|date=2016|publisher=Stetter|format=PDF|access-date=24 September 2016}}</ref>

'''[[Dump truck]]s''' ("tippers" in the UK) transport loose material such as sand, gravel, or dirt for construction. A typical dump truck has an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and lifts at the front, allowing the material in the bed to be unloaded ("dumped") on the ground behind the truck.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=34–35}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galiongodwin.com/docs/DumpTruckOperatorManual.pdf|title=Dump Truck Operator Manual|publisher=Galion-Godwin Truck Body Co.|format=PDF|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

'''[[Flatbed truck]]s''' have an entirely flat, level platform body. This allows for quick and easy loading but has no protection for the load. Hanging or removable sides are sometimes fitted.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=28–29}}

'''[[Tractor unit|Semi-tractors]]''' ("artics" in the UK) have a fifth wheel for towing a semi-trailer instead of a body.

'''[[Tank truck]]s''' ("tankers" in the UK) are designed to carry [[liquids]] or [[gas]]es. They usually have a cylindrical tank lying horizontally on the chassis. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids and gases that can be transported.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=32–33}}

'''[[Tow truck|Wreckers]]''' ("recovery lorries" in the UK) are used to recover and/or tow disabled vehicles. They are normally equipped with a boom with a cable; wheel/chassis lifts are becoming common on newer trucks.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=46–47}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jerrdan.com/wp-content/uploads/manuals/maintenance/HDR%207085%20Wrecker%20Operations%20and%20Maintenance%20Manual.pdf|title=HDR 70/85 Wrecker Operations and Maintenance Manual|date=2010|publisher=Jerr-Dan|format=PDF|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.millerind.com/images/uploads/parts/century_820_iiit-parts-0500724-021997.pdf|title=Owner's Manual 820 Wrecker/FIIIT|date=1997|publisher=Miller Industries|format=PDF|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

==Driving==
In many countries, driving a truck requires a special driving license. The requirements and limitations vary with each different jurisdiction.

===Australia===
[[File:Inside Mack Granite.JPG|thumb|Inside a Mack truck]]
In Australia, a [[truck driver]]'s license is required for any motor vehicle with a [[Gross Vehicle Mass]] (GVM) exceeding {{convert|4.5|t|abbr=on}}. The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as:
;Combination
* '''HC''': Heavy Combination, a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination.
* '''MC''': Multi Combination, e.g.,&nbsp;B&nbsp;Doubles/road trains

; Rigid
* '''LR''': Light rigid: a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than {{convert|4.5|t|abbr=on}} but not more than {{convert|8|t|1|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|1|abbr=on}} GVM.
* '''MR''': Medium rigid: a rigid vehicle with 2&nbsp;axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|1|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|1|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes vehicles in class ''LR''.
* '''HR''': Heavy Rigid: a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|1|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|1|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class&nbsp;''MR''.

;Heavy vehicle transmission
There is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class ''HC'', ''HR'', or ''MC'' test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box).<ref>{{cite web|title=South Australia License class information|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/topics/transport-travel-and-motoring|publisher=Gov't of South Australia|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>

===Europe===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz LKW Lenkrad.jpg|thumb|Inside a Mercedes-Benz truck]]
Driving licensing has been harmonized throughout the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] (and practically all European non-member states), so that common rules apply within Europe (see [[European driving licence]]). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than {{cvt|7.5|t}} for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats). For licenses first acquired after 1997, that weight was reduced to {{cvt|3.5|t}}, not including trailers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Since 2013, the C1 license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 and up to 7.5 tonnes. The C license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 tonnes with a trailer up to 750kg, and the CE category allows driving category C vehicles with a trailer over 750kg.

===South Africa===
To drive any vehicle with a GVM exceeding {{cvt|3.5|t}}, a code C1 drivers license is required. Furthermore, if the vehicle exceeds {{cvt|16|t|1}} a code C license becomes necessary.

To drive any vehicle in South Africa towing a trailer with a GVM more than {{convert|7.5|t|abbr=on}}, further restrictions apply and the driver must possess a license suitable for the GVM of the total combination as well as an articulated endorsement. This is indicated with the letter "E" prefixing the license code.

In addition, any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing a Public Driver's Permit, (or PrDP) of the applicable type. This is an additional license that is added to the DL card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license.

The requirements for obtaining the different classes are below.

* "G": Required for the transport of general goods, requires a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal.
* "P": Required for the transport of paying passengers, requires a more stringent criminal record check, additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue. A G class PrDP will be issued at the same time.
* "D": Required for the transport of dangerous materials, requires all of the same checks as class P., and in addition the driver must be over 25 at time of issue.

Trucks contribute to air, noise, and [[water pollution]] similarly to [[automobile]]s. Trucks may{{vague|date=April 2019}} emit lower [[air pollution]] emissions than cars per equivalent vehicle mass, although the absolute level per vehicle distance traveled is higher, and [[diesel exhaust]] is especially dangerous for health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heavy-Duty Truck and Bus Engines|url=http://www.dieselnet.com/standards/us/hd.html|publisher=dieselnet.com|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> EPA measures pollution from trucks.<ref>[https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/420f08027.pdf Average In-Use Emissions from Heavy-Duty Trucks] (PDF), pages 4–5.

Continuous sounds are those from [[tire]]s rolling on the roadway and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds. Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a [[turbocharger]] on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an [[exhaust brake]] [[retarder (mechanical engineering)|retarder]] when traversing a downgrade. There has been [[noise regulation]] put in place to help control where and when the use of [[engine braking]] retarders are allowed.

Concerns have been raised about the effect of trucking on the environment, particularly as part of the debate on [[global warming]], so many countries are lowering limits on truck CO2 emissions.<ref>{{cite news |title=EU countries agree to 30 percent cut in truck CO2 emissions |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-autos-emissions/eu-countries-agree-to-30-percent-cut-in-truck-co2-emissions-idUSKCN1OJ1ZC |agency=Reuters |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>

According to a 1995 U.S.&nbsp;government estimate, the energy cost of carrying one [[ton]] of freight a distance of one kilometer averages 337&nbsp;kJ for water, 221&nbsp;kJ for rail, 2,000&nbsp;kJ for trucks, and nearly 13,000&nbsp;kJ for air transport.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Domestic Freight Transportation|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/efficiency/ee_ch5.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=6 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922145824/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/efficiency/ee_ch5.htm|archivedate=22 September 2008}}</ref> Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail, especially in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Government policy can realize rail freight's role in reducing carbon emissions|url=http://www.freightonrail.org.uk/ConsultationsEnvironmentalAuditCommittee.htm|publisher=FreightOnRail.org.uk|accessdate=6 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820002032/http://www.freightonrail.org.uk/ConsultationsEnvironmentalAuditCommittee.htm|archive-date=20 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Operator health and safety ==
[[File:Truck cab filters.png|alt=An orange metal housing with an open panel containing three horizontal stacked filters|thumb|Truck cab filter housing using a contiguous series of pre-, HEPA, and charcoal panel filters]]
A truck cab is a [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard control]] that protects the truck operator from hazardous airborne pollutants. As an enclosure, it is an example of an [[Engineering controls|engineering control]]. Enclosed operator cabs have been used on agriculture, mining, and construction vehicles for several decades. Most modern-day enclosed cabs have [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) systems for primarily maintaining a comfortable temperature and providing breathable air for their occupants. Various levels of filtration can be incorporated into the HVAC system to remove airborne pollutants such as [[dust]]s, diesel particulate matter (DPM), and other [[aerosol]]s.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet2046.html|title=Design, Testing, and Modeling of Environmental Enclosures for Controlling Worker Exposure to Airborne Contaminants|last=Organiscak|first=J.|last2=Cecala|first2=A.|date=June 2018|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=9 November 2018|last3=Hall|first3=R.}}</ref>

Two key elements of an effective environmental enclosure are a good filtration system and an enclosure with good integrity (sealed isolation from the outside environment). It is recommended that a filtration system filter out at least 95% or greater of airborne respirable aerosols from the intake airflow, with an additional recirculation filtering component for the inside air. Good enclosure integrity is also needed to achieve [[positive pressure]] to prevent wind-driven aerosol penetration into the enclosure'','' as well as to minimize air leakage around the filtration system. Test methods and mathematical modeling of environmental enclosures are also beneficial for quantifying and optimizing filtration system designs, as well as maintaining optimum protection factor performance for enclosure occupants.<ref name=":0" />

==Operations issues==
===Taxes===
Commercial trucks in the US pay higher road use taxes on a state level than other road vehicles and are subject to extensive regulation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmta.org/GA_Trucking_Facts.html |title=Trucking Industry Operating Taxes State of Georgia |accessdate=18 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901201807/http://www.gmta.org/GA_Trucking_Facts.html |archive-date=1 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A few reasons commercial trucks pay higher road use taxes: they are bigger and heavier than most other vehicles, and cause more wear and tear per hour on roadways; and trucks and their drivers are on the road for more hours per day. Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.

===Damage to pavement===
The life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvfnorden.org/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=261|title=Road wear from heavy vehicles – an overview|publisher=NVF committee Vehicles and Transports|date=August 2008|accessdate=27 September 2016|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818141323/http://www.nvfnorden.org/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=261|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.<ref name="Chatti"/><ref name="FHA"/>

===Commercial insurance===
Primary liability insurance coverage protects the truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident. This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U.S.&nbsp;state and federal agencies, and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them. Interstate trucks in the U.S. are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance. This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} (which transport non-hazardous materials). All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous, and which have a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance. All motor carriers operating vehicles such as hopper-type cargo vehicles or tankers with a capacity in excess of {{convert|3500|usgal|l|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance. Pricing is dependent on region, driving records, and history of the trucking operation.

Motor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle. Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled.

=== Trucking accidents ===
[[File:Elst (Overbetuwe) 2012-03-23 Trucking accident (1).JPG|thumb|Trucking accident at [[Elst, Overbetuwe|Elst (Netherlands)]] 2012-03-23]]
In 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008, the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths, but trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:
* 14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill
* 6.5% cause open flames

Following increased pressure from ''The Times'' "Cities Fit For Cycling" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many [[Large goods vehicle|HGVs]]. These signs are directed against a common type of accident that occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV's wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the [[cyclist]]. The signs, such as the winning design of the [http://www.intandemcompetition.com InTANDEM road safety competition] launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside.

=== HGV safety in the EU ===

In-vehicle speed limitation is required applying a 90 km/h limit to commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.<ref name="EU Safety">https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/vehicle/safety_design_needs/heavy_goods_vehicles_en</ref>

Front, side, and rear underrun protection is required on commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.<ref name="EU Safety"></ref>

Trucks must be fitted with blind-spot mirrors that give drivers a wider field of vision than conventional mirrors.<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/topics/vehicles/blind_spot_mirrors_mt</ref>
