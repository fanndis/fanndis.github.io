The tour was announced through MTV News in December 2009. In the interview, Rihanna  stated, "It's going to be a worldwide tour, so it's going to be a very long tour.

In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', Rihanna explained the tour's title. She stated, "I like to think about myself as 'The Last Girl on Earth' because sometimes people make decisions based on the outlook of others and, you know, to me, my life is my life. It's my world, and I'm going to live it the way I want to. That's how I think about everything, that way I'm focused on me, and my work. It's a really narrow space, a focus."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2010/04/85712/ |title=Rihanna Talks 'Idol' and Her New Tour |work=Entertainment Tonight|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]] |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409214055/http://www.etonline.com/news/2010/04/85712/ |archive-date=April 9, 2010 }}</ref>

The tour, choreographed by Tina Landon, was officially announced on December 9, 2009, while on the set of the music video for "[[Hard (Rihanna song)|Hard]]".<ref name="mtv1209"/> She also announced some dates for the European leg of the tour on her official website. It went on to gross over $9.1 million in North America from 26 shows according to Pollstar and the 2011 Australian leg of the tour added another $10 million to the total. English singer-songwriter [[Pixie Lott]] was selected as the opening act for the UK shows, along with last minute additions of [[Tinchy Stryder]] and [[Tinie Tempah]].<ref name="4music">{{cite web|url=http://www.4music.com/artist/pixie-lott/to-support-rihanna-on-tour.html|title=Pixie Lott to support Rihanna on tour|date=February 19, 2010|work=4music website|accessdate=February 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223052117/http://www.4music.com/artist/pixie-lott/to-support-rihanna-on-tour.html|archive-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name="gw">{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/56015/Tinchy-Stryder-Tinie-Tempah-Pixie-Lott-To-Support-Rihanna-On-UK-Tour|title=Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah and Pixie Lott to support Rihanna on UK tour|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2010|last=Gregory|first=Jason|work=Gigwise|publisher=Giant Digital}}</ref> In an interview with MTV, she stated, "We've been ... coming out with different ideas and cool things that we can do.

In an interview with AOL, Rihanna revealed that fans should expect a big upgrade in comparison to her previous tours. She commented, "[w]e've never done a tour to this capacity. The production is unbelievable and the costumes, we just took it to a whole new level. Visually and sonically it's going to be a big step up from the last time. We just keep growing, and this time it is a massive production that I cannot wait for."<ref name="north"/>

The tour is directed by [[Jamie King]], who has previously worked with [[Sticky & Sweet Tour|Madonna]], [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|Britney Spears]] and [[The Best Damn World Tour|Avril Lavigne]]. [[Tina Landon]], who has worked with [[janet. Tour|Janet Jackson]], will serve as choreographer.

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Rihanna in Last Girl on Earth Tour 16-04-5.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Rihanna performing during the tour]]
''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' said, "On the opening night of the UK leg of her world tour, US R&B superstar Rihanna was taking no prisoners. She kicked off with the homicidal pop-rock ballad Russian Roulette to screen imagery of burning naked mannequins and had shed most of her clothes by her second song, which saw her straddling the gun barrel of a life-size pink tank while a semi-naked, military dance troupe twirled their rifles. Sex, violence and pyrotechnics (including big-screen mushroom clouds to accompany the incendiary Fire Bomb) were the themes of the evening. [...] Rihanna has a set full of hits and each is delivered with maximum bang for the audience's bucks, with revealing costumes, salacious dance routines, eye-catching props and sci-fi screens. [...] Her young, predominantly female fans genuinely adore Rihanna, and were full-throated whenever given the chance to join in. Sex and violence might make for effective 21st-century blockbuster entertainment but the price has been a loss of innocence, charm and individuality."<ref>McCormick, Neil (May 10, 2010).

Jason Clevett of ''[[GayCalgary]]'' considered the show's theme reminiscent of [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[The Velvet Rope Tour]], particularly comparing Jackson's live renditions of "[[The Velvet Rope|Rope Burn]]", "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's performance of "Skin."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaycalgary.com/magazine.aspx?id=92&article=2291|title=Rihanna Heats Up The Dome|work=[[GayCalgary]]|publisher=Clevett, Jason|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}</ref> Clay Clane of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] said of the show: "There may have been doubts, but Rihanna proved she has the star power to command a stage for nearly two hours. [...] Rihanna can sing and there were no signs of lip-synching.

From the show opener, "Russian Roulette", to the last encore song – her megahit "Umbrella" – Rihanna was electric for a performance that was amped-up and aggressive.<ref name="NYP-review">Aquilante, Dan (August 14, 2010).

== Show incidents ==
On April 19, 2010, Rihanna made newspaper headlines when she was taken to hospital after her performance in [[Zürich]]. Rihanna's spokesperson says that she "had an injured rib and went to have it looked at to be sure it was nothing serious, and it wasn’t". Alenka Ambroz, head of the clinic's corporate communications said: "Rihanna arrived at the accident and emergency unit. We're not going to give any details." Rihanna, however, was still able to perform at the next show in [[Lyon]], France, on April 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a215697/rihanna-rushed-to-hospital-after-concert/ |title=Rihanna 'rushed to hospital after concert' |last1=Nissim |first1=Mayer |date=April 21, 2010 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref>
