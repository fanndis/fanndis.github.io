'''Madison Brengle''' (born April 3, 1990) is an American [[tennis]] player.

Her biggest success occurred in early 2015, reaching her first [[WTA Tour]] final in January, followed by a fourth round [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand-Slam]] appearance at the [[2015 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Brengle enjoying breakthrough on clay in Stuttgart|work=tennis.com|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/04/brengle-enjoying-breakthrough-clay-stuttgart/54736/|date=April 25, 2015|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> In May, her [[WTA Rankings|singles ranking]] reached a career-best of No. 35 in the world. Her greatest victory so far was in 2017 over world No. 2, [[Serena Williams]]. She has won one [[WTA 125K series]] singles title, 15 [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] singles titles, and seven ITF doubles titles.

In August 2007, she was ranked fourth in the world in juniors. Brengle then toiled for years in the [[ITF Women's Circuit]]. Over the course of 24 consecutive majors between 2008 and 2014, she failed to make it out of the pre-tournament qualifier. The streak ended when she earned a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] for the [[2014 US Open – Women's Singles|2014 US Open]] main draw, which she capitalized on for her first major match-win. Her ranking soon rose into the top 100 for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ontherisetennis.blogspot.com/2015/02/madison-brengle-is-46-saga-in-three.html|title=Madison Brengle is 46: a Saga in Three Acts (So Far) |first=|last=|work=|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=25 April 2015|language=}}</ref>

==Early life==
Brengle was born and raised in [[Dover, Delaware]], and is Jewish.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/312328/title/Madison-BRENGLE|title=Madison Brengle|first=|last=admin|date=16 July 2018|website=WTA Tennis}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/miami-dade/fl-jjdc-tennis-0330-20160328-story.html "Madison Brengle leads Jewish tennis players at Miami Open,"<!-- Bot generated title -->] ''Florida Jewish Journal''.</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sports/Brengle-raises-Jewish-tennis-presence-504049 "Brengle raises Jewish tennis presence,"<!-- Bot generated title -->] ''The Jerusalem Post''.</ref> Her mother (Gaby née Gamberg) coaches her, her father is Dan Brengle, and her brother is David.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated3>http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100044116</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Playing style==
Brengle is what some coaches call a scrappy player, and her game is built around counter-punching and outlasting her opponents in long rallies while waiting for her opponent's error.  When serving she uses an abbreviated service motion. Her forehand has a low follow-through.  Sometimes on her backhand she will drive the ball flat, using a half-swing.  Brengle moves quickly around the court, and is willing to battle to win her matches.

==Junior career==
As a teenager, Brengle participated in an experimental [[USTA]] training regimen.<ref>{{cite news|title=A 'Soviet' Plan to Save U.S. Tennis|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117952508674408010|date= May 19, 2007|accessdate= April 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, she won the Easter Bowl doubles championships with Kristy Frilling, defeating [[Sanaz Marand]] and [[Ashley Weinhold]] in the final. In 2007, Brengle reached the [[2007 Australian Open - Girls' Singles|2007 Australian Open girls' singles]] final, before going down to [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]]. Brengle and [[Julia Cohen]] were the top seeds at the [[2007 French Open]] [[2007 French Open - Girls' Doubles|girls' doubles]] competition, but the team lost in the first round.

Seeded seventh, Brengle lost in the final of the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|2007 Wimbledon]] [[2007 Wimbledon Championships - Girls' Singles|girls' singles competition]] to [[Urszula Radwańska]], 2–6, 6–3, 6–0. Brengle and [[Chelsey Gullickson]] reached the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships - Girls' Doubles|Wimbledon girls' doubles]] semifinals before losing to top seeds and eventual champions Pavlyuchenkova and Radwańska. In August 2007, she was ranked fourth in the world in juniors.<ref>http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100044116</ref>

==Professional career==
===Early years===
2005 saw Brengle win her first ITF title, when, as a 15-year-old, she won a tournament in Baltimore. In the final, she defeated Beau Jones.

In 2007, Brengle received [[wild card (sports)#Professional tennis|wild-card entries]] into two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, losing in the first round both times. Accepted into the [[2007 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2007 Australian Open women's draw]], Brengle lost to ninth-seeded [[Patty Schnyder]]. She was allowed another wild card into the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]], where she lost to [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]]. Brengle and Ashley Weinhold were doubles wild cards, but lost in the first round of the doubles competition to eventual quarterfinalists [[Stéphanie Foretz]] and [[Yaroslava Shvedova]].

Brengle won her first WTA match of the [[2007 WTA Tour|2007 season]] by defeating former top-20 player [[Flavia Pennetta]], before losing to [[Elena Dementieva]] in the following round. In addition, the American reached the second round of the [[2007 French Open]] qualifying draw.

On the ITF Circuit, Brengle reached three out of four singles finals in the first four months of the year. Brengle and Kristie Frilling won an ITF doubles title in Augusta, Georgia. In the final, the team defeated [[Angelina Gabueva]] and [[Alisa Kleybanova]].

[[File:Madison brengle cincy 2008.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Brengle in 2008]]
In 2008, Brengle received a wild card into the French Open (after winning a wild-card tournament), defeating [[Ahsha Rolle]] in the finals. The US Open and the French Open agreed to exchange wild cards in their respective tournaments.

In 2011, Brengle finally won her second ITF title at Hammond, LA. She also reached the final at another ITF event at Rancho Santa Fe, California. At College Park, she defeated recent Wimbledon third rounder [[Melinda Czink]] to win her first WTA match since Quebec City in 2009.

In 2012, Brengle won her third ITF title at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. She also won the doubles title with [[Paula Kania]] of Poland.

In 2013, she won her fourth ITF title at Rancho Santa Fe.

Brengle had a strong start to her 2014 season, qualifying through to the main draw at the [[2014 Moorilla Hobart International|Hobart International]], but was narrowly defeated in the first round by top seed [[Samantha Stosur]] in a final-set tiebreak. The next week, she was in touching distance of a main-draw berth at the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]], but lost to [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] in the final qualifying round. In July, she won the $50k [[2014 Kentucky Bank Tennis Championships|Kentucky Bank Championships]], beating [[Nicole Gibbs]] in the final. Later in the year, she was awarded a wild card into the main draw of the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where she recorded her first ever Grand Slam win over [[Julia Glushko]] of Israel.

She moved into the top 100 for first time on September 29, 2014, after winning the $50k event Redrock Open in Las Vegas defeating [[Nicole Vaidišová]], [[Kateryna Bondarenko]] and [[Michelle Larcher de Brito]], all in straight sets.

===2015-16: Breakthrough===

At the [[2015 Australian Open]] Brengle defeated the 13th-ranked [[Andrea Petkovic]] in the first round. Then, she won in straight sets against both [[Irina Falconi]] and [[CoCo Vandeweghe]], eventually losing in the fourth round to [[Madison Keys]], 2–6, 4–6. This was her best performance in a Grand Slam tournament so far. In Stuttgart, she defeated No. 4 ranked [[Petra Kvitová]] in straight sets.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/312328/title/madison-brengle-0|title=Madison Brengle|first=|last=admin|date=16 July 2018|website=WTA Tennis}}</ref> In May, her singles ranking reached a career-best of No. 35 in the world.
