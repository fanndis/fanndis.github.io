'''Dancer Fitzgerald Sample''' ('''DFS''' and later '''DFS-Dorland''') was a [[Madison Avenue]] [[advertising]] agency during the 20th century. It was founded in Chicago in 1923, and was acquired and merged into the [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] network in the 1980s.

==History==
The agency was founded in 1923 by [[Hill Blackett]] and John Glen Sample, in Chicago. [[E. Frank Hummert]] joined the agency in 1927, and it was renamed Blackett-Sample-Hummert, even though Hummert was never a partner in the company.  Blackett left company management, despite remaining a partner, when he was commissioned into the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in 1942.  Hummert left the company at the end of 1943, forming Hummert Radio Productions with his wife [[Anne Hummert|Anne]].  Sample, after unsuccessful attempts to buy out the absent Blackett, announced that they would allow the firm to dissolve when their partnership agreement expired in 1944, and that he would enter a new partnership with B-S-H president H.M. "Mix" Dancer at that time.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reorganization Plan Outlined For Blackett-Sample-Hummert | work = [[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising]] | date = August 16, 1943 | page = 12 | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | publisher = Broadcasting Publications, Inc. | location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref>  These plans were later altered to terminate the partnership earlier, on January 1, 1944, with Blackett forming his own firm and Dancer and Sample adding as a partner Clifford L. Fitzgerald, then a B-S-H vice president and director.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Two New Agencies Organized From Dissolution of B-S-H | work = Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising | date = September 20, 1943 | page = 8 | volume = 25 | issue = 12}}</ref>

DFS purchased Val-Mar Studios, a Mexican animation studio in 1959, and became '''Gamma Productions'''. It used the studio to produce television cartoons for [[Jay Ward Productions]] and [[Total Television]]; the studio closed in 1968. Its productions remain in [[rerun]]s, distributed through [[The Program Exchange]].  DFS founded Program Syndication Services in 1973 and The Program Exchange in 1979.

On February 24, 1986, [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] agreed to acquire Dancer Fitzgerald Sample for $75 million, and immediately announced that it would be merged with Saatchi's UK network Dorland Advertising. At that time, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample was the thirteenth largest advertising agency in the US, with billings of $876 million and clients including [[Procter & Gamble]], [[General Mills]], [[Toyota]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[RJR Nabisco]]. The new DFS Dorland Worldwide network was to be operated independently from the Saatchi & Saatchi Compton Worldwide network and was at that time the sixteenth largest agency network in the world.<ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts">Goldman - Conflicting Accounts</ref>

By June 1987, however, DFS was merged with Saatchi & Saatchi Compton, the US subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/saatchi-saatchi answers.com]</ref> At that point the merged business became the largest agency in New York with billings of $2.3 billion. The consolidation ended DFS's relationship with Dorland, which at that point was the third-largest London agency.<ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/>

==Legacy==
In 1980, DFS created [[McGruff the Crime Dog]]. 

A famous line to come out of DFS in the 1980s was the pop-culture hit "[[Where's the beef?]]" created for [[Wendy's]] by DFS creative director Cliff Freeman.
