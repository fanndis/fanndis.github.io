== History ==
ProPublica was the brainchild of [[Herb Sandler|Herbert]] and [[Marion Sandler]], the former chief executives of the [[Golden West Financial Corporation]], who have committed $10 million a year to the project.<ref name="New York Times 15OCT07">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Pérez-Peña |title=Group Plans to Provide Investigative Journalism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/15/business/media/15publica.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 15, 2007 |access-date=October 15, 2007 |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713174852/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/15/business/media/15publica.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The Sandlers hired [[Paul Steiger]], former managing editor of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', to create and run the organization as editor in chief. At the time ProPublica was set up, Steiger responded to concerns about the role of the political views of the Sandlers, saying on ''[[The Newshour with Jim Lehrer]]'':

{{quote|Coming into this, when I talked to Herb and Marion Sandler, one of my concerns was precisely this question of independence and nonpartisanship ... My history has been doing "down the middle" reporting. And so when I talked to Herb and Marion I said "Are you comfortable with that?" They said, "Absolutely." I said, "Well, suppose we did an exposé of some of the left leaning organizations that you have supported or that are friendly to what you've supported in the past."They said, "No problem." And when we set up our organizational structure, the board of directors, on which I sit and which Herb is the chairman, does not know in advance what we're going to report on.<ref>''[[PBS Newshour]]'', 24 June 2008, [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june08/mediamodel_06-24.html "Financing Independent Journalism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122044216/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june08/mediamodel_06-24.html |date=January 22, 2014 }}</ref>}}

ProPublica had an initial news staff of 28 reporters and editors,<ref>{{cite web |last=Calderone |first=Michael |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0708/ProPublic_will_hire_everyone.html |title=ProPublica will hire everyone |publisher=Politico.Com |date=July 10, 2008 |access-date=October 18, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017200753/http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0708/ProPublic_will_hire_everyone.html |url-status=live }}</ref> including [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Charles Ornstein]], [[Tracy Weber]], [[Jeff Gerth]], and [[Marcus Stern (journalist)|Marcus Stern]], but has since grown to 34 full-time working journalists.

=== IRS and conservative groups ===

In December 2012 and January 2013, ProPublica published and reported on confidential pending applications for groups requesting tax-exempt status. In May 2013, after widespread coverage of allegations that [[2013 IRS scandal|the IRS had inappropriately targeted conservative groups]], ProPublica clarified that it obtained the documents through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, writing, "In response to a request for the applications for 67 different nonprofits last November, the Cincinnati office of the IRS sent ProPublica applications or documentation for 31 groups. Nine of those applications had not yet been approved—meaning they were not supposed to be made public." ProPublica reported on six of them, after deeming information within those applications to be newsworthy.<ref name="IRSPP">[https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-office-that-targeted-tea-party-also-disclosed-confidential-docs IRS Office That Targeted Tea Party Also Disclosed Confidential Docs From Conservative Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611124557/http://www.propublica.org/article/irs-office-that-targeted-tea-party-also-disclosed-confidential-docs |date=June 11, 2015 }}, Kim Barker and Justin Elliott, ProPublica, May 13, 2013</ref>

The project also allows journalists and newsrooms to partner with ProPublica to write stories based on the dataset they are collecting.
