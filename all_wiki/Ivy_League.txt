Penn considered its founding date to be 1749 for over a century.[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/trustees.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125023024/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/trustees.html |date=November 2, 2012}}  In 1895, elite universities in the United States agreed that henceforth formal [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates.  Penn's periodical "The Alumni Register," published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group that had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the "New Building" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence "Unnamed Charity School" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called "Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania."[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235939/http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php |date=October 2, 2012}}  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to "College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania."[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=April 2, 2006}} Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> 
|Nonsectarian,<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: "The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen."[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=April 2, 2006}}. Jencks and Riesman (2001) write "The Anglicans who founded the University of Pennsylvania, however, were evidently anxious not to alienate Philadelphia's Quakers, and they made their new college officially nonsectarian."  In Franklin's 1749 founding [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/1749proposals.html Proposals relating to the education of youth in Pensilvania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504075701/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/1749proposals.html |date=May 4, 2006 }} [http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=franklin_youth&PagePosition=20 (page images)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018223123/http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=franklin_youth&PagePosition=20 |date=October 1, 2007}}, religion is not mentioned directly as a subject of study, but he states in a footnote that the study of "''History'' will also afford frequent Opportunities of showing the Necessity of a ''Publick Religion,'' from its Usefulness to the Publicks; the Advantage of a Religious Character among private Persons; the Mischiefs of Superstition, &c. and the Excellency of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION above all others antient or modern." Starting in 1751, the same trustees also operated a Charity School for Boys, whose curriculum combined "general principles of Christianity" with practical instruction leading toward careers in business and the "mechanical arts." [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/charitysch.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620024258/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/charitysch.html |date=June 2, 2006}}, and thus might be described as "non-denominational Christian." The charity school was originally planned and a trust was organized on paper in 1740 by followers of travelling evangelist [[George Whitefield]].  The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labeled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as "Episcopalian".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=January 1, 2012}} Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called "Quakers," and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the "Quaker Consortium.") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that "Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America."{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodism|Methodist]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473–475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |access-date=January 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208022301/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |archive-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.  Harvard University uses the date that the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally allocated funds for the creation of a college.  Harvard was chartered in 1650, although classes had been conducted for approximately a decade by then.  The University of Pennsylvania initially considered its founding date to be 1750; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Hughes| first=Samuel| year=2002|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html| title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history| journal=Pennsylvania Gazette| volume=100| issue=3}}</ref> Later in Penn's early history, the university changed its officially recognized founding date to 1749, which was used for all of the nineteenth century, including a centennial celebration in 1849.  In 1899, Penn's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740, in response to a petition from Penn's General Alumni Society.  Penn was chartered in 1755, the same year collegiate classes began.  "Religious affiliation" refers to financial sponsorship, formal association with, and promotion by, a religious denomination.  All of the schools in the Ivy League are private and not currently associated with any religion.</small>

"Planting the [[Hedera|ivy]]" was a customary class day ceremony at many colleges in the 1800s. In 1893, an alumnus told ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', "In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar. ... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time."<ref>{{cite web|title=Class Day, New and Old|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1893/6/3/class-day-old-and-new-it-is/?print=1}}</ref> At Penn, graduating seniors started the custom of planting ivy at a university building each spring in 1873 and that practice was formally designated as "[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]" in 1874.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Penn: Ivy day and Ivy Stones, a Penn Tradition|url=http://www.upenn.edu/spotlights/ivy-day-and-ivy-stones-penn-tradition|access-date=December 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715230153/http://www.upenn.edu/spotlights/ivy-day-and-ivy-stones-penn-tradition|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ivy planting ceremonies are reported for Yale,<ref>Boston Daily Globe, June 27, 1882, p. 4: "CLASS DAY.: Yale Seniors Plant the Ivy, Sing "Blage," and Entertain the Beauty of New Haven;"</ref> [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons]],<ref>Boston Evening Transcript, June 11, 1912, p. 12, "Simmons Seniors Hosts Class Day Exercises Late in Afternoon, Planting of the Ivy will be One of the Features;</ref> [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Play a Romance and Plant Ivy, Pretty Class Day Exercises of the Women's College|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1126&dat=19070609&id=uXpRAAAAIBAJ&pg=4741,1858451|newspaper=The Gazette Times |date= June 9, 1907|access-date=October 22, 2012}}</ref> and many others.

The first usage of ''Ivy'' in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter [[Stanley Woodward (editor)|Stanley Woodward]] (1895–1965).

{{quote|A proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.|Stanley Woodward, ''[[New York Tribune]]'', October 14, 1933, describing the football season<ref>"Yale Book of Quotations" (2006) [[Yale University Press]] edited by Fred R. Shapiro</ref>}}

The first known instance of the term ''Ivy League'' being used appeared in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' on February 7, 1935.<ref name=officialhistory/><ref>"The Yale Book of Quotations" (2006) [[Yale University]] Press, edited by Fred R. Shapiro</ref><ref>[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]] entry for "Ivy League"</ref> Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the [[Colonial colleges|colonial era]], together with the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point), the [[United States Naval Academy]], and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.

A common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed "IV League" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the "IV League" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the "IV League" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |access-date=January 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archive-date=June 6, 2010 }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876, at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |access-date=January 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718192438/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |archive-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Pre-Ivy League===

Seven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of the [[College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].

The influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California at Berkeley are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |access-date=January 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archive-date=September 9, 2010 }}</ref>

Some of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. ''King's College'' was founded at the behest of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] of Great Britain and the [[Church of England]], but renamed [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] following the American revolution. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and "full liberty of conscience", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.

"Ivy League" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an elite class, even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first=Joseph | last=Epstein | year=2003 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-34073-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/snobbery00jose }} p. 55, "by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them."</ref> Novels<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | url = https://archive.org/details/eastsidestorynov00auch_0 }} p. 179, "he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 "''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption. ...

After the [[Second World War]], the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of their students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with doctorates had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>

====19th and early 20th centuries====
The first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools (or any US colleges, for that matter) was created in 1870 with the formation of the [[Rowing Association of American Colleges]]. The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870–1894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.

A basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.

In 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.

In February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = September 4, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = October 10, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.

Before the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an "unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations". The earliest reference to the "Ivy colleges" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/> In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:

{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called "Ivy League" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}

Despite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:

{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years—and markedly in the last three months—there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.

Please do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic "Ivy League". That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.<ref>{{cite news | first = Robert F. | last = Kelley | title = Cornell Club Here Welcomes Lynah | work = The New York Times | page = 22 | date = 1936-01-17}}</ref>}}

Within a year of this statement and having held month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of "the formation of an Ivy League" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'', ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' and the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' would simultaneously run an editorial entitled "Now Is the Time", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.<ref>{{cite news | title = Immediate Formation of Ivy League Advocated at Seven Eastern Colleges | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = December 3, 1936}}</ref> Part of the editorial read as follows:

{{quote|The Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association. The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=456169 |title=The Harvard Crimson :: News :: AN EDITORIAL |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=1936-12-03 |access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref>}}

The Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], [[New Hampshire]], on August 3, 1852. Harvard's team, "The Oneida", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].
The proposal did not succeed—on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the "possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track." However, they noted that the league "has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration."<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = January 1, 1937}}</ref>

====Post-World War II====

[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]

In 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:

{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships. Athletes shall be admitted as students and awarded financial aid only on the basis of the same academic standards and economic need as are applied to all other students.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gwertzman |first=Bernard M. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=128992 |title=Ivy League: Formalizing the Fact  |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=October 13, 1956 |access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref>}}

In 1954, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports, effective with the 1955–56 basketball season. This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that had not joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954–55 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, it is the oldest basketball conference in Division I.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/ivy/ “Ivy Group”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118075519/http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/ivy/ |date=January 1, 2015}}, ''Sports-reference.com''</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/BK09.pdf|title=Official 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Records Book – p. 221 "Division I Conference Alignment History"|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref>

As late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become coeducational. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] [[women's college]]s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at [[Barnard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]], which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie ''[[Animal House]]'' includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet [[Smith College|Smith]] and [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, "The '[[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters']] was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League men's colleges."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Archived: Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |publisher=Ed.gov |access-date=January 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204110037/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archive-date=February 4, 2005 }}</ref>

In 1982 the Ivy League considered adding two members, with Army, Navy, and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] as the most likely candidates; if it had done so, the league could probably have avoided being moved into the recently created Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) for football.<ref name="white19820110">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/sports/ivy-league-considers-adding-2-schools.html | title=Ivy League Considers Adding 2 Schools | work=The New York Times | date=January 1, 1982| access-date=September 18, 2013 | last=White |first=Gordon S. Jr.}}</ref> In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women's athletic teams, which replaced the women's teams previously sponsored by Barnard.

When Army and Navy departed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League in 1992, nearly all intercollegiate competition involving the eight schools became united under the Ivy League banner. The two major exceptions are wrestling, with the Ivies that sponsor wrestling—all except Dartmouth and Yale—members of the EIWA and hockey, with the Ivies that sponsor hockey—all except Penn and Columbia—members of ECAC Hockey.

Further, Ivy League members have produced many [[Nobel laureates]], winners of the Nobel Prize and the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].

===Collaboration===
Collaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led [[Ivy Council]] that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school. The governing body of the Ivy League is the Council of Ivy Group presidents, composed of each university president. During meetings, the presidents discuss common procedures and initiatives for their universities.

The universities collaborate academically through the IvyPlus Exchange Scholar Program, which allows students to cross-register at one of the Ivies or another eligible school such as the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exchange Scholar Program (IvyPlus Exchange) |url=https://gsas.yale.edu/academics/exchanges/exchange-scholar-program-ivyplus-exchange |website=Yale University}}</ref>

Different fashion trends and styles have emerged from Ivy League campuses over time, and fashion trends such as [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League]] and [[preppy]] are styles often associated with the Ivy League and its culture.

[[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League style]] is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s, believed to have originated on Ivy League campuses. The clothing stores [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] represent perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner. The Ivy League style is said to be the predecessor to the [[preppy]] style of dress.

Preppy fashion started around 1912 to the late 1940s and 1950s as the Ivy League style of dress.<ref>{{cite book | title =Elements of Fashion and Apparel Design | publisher = New Age Publishers | isbn = 978-81-224-1371-7 |page=25 |quote=Ivy League: A popular look for men in the fifties that originated on such campuses as Harvard, Priceton {{sic}} and Yale; a forerunner to the preppie look; a style characterized by button-down collar shirts and pants with a small buckle in the back.| year = 2007 }}</ref> [[J. Press]] represents the quintessential preppy clothing brand, stemming from the collegiate traditions that shaped the preppy subculture. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and [[Brooks Brothers]], both being pioneers in preppy fashion, had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]].

Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper class [[New England]] leisure activities, such as [[horse riding|equestrian]], [[sailing]] or [[yacht]]ing, [[hunting]], [[fencing]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], and [[rugby football|rugby]]. Longtime New England outdoor outfitters, such as [[L.L. Bean]],<ref name=Zlotnick>{{cite web |last=Zlotnick |first=Sarah |title=Your cheat sheet to preppy style |url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/shoparound/people/your-cheat-sheet-to-preppy-style.php |work=[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]] |date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> became part of conventional preppy style. This can be seen in sport stripes and colours, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets and nautical-themed accessories. Vacationing in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], long popular with the East Coast upper class, led to the emergence of bright colour combinations in leisure wear seen in some brands such as [[Lilly Pulitzer]].<ref name=Zlotnick/> By the 1980s, other brands such as [[Lacoste]], [[Izod]]<ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285">{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Amy T. |first2=Ann T. |last2=Kellogg |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History 1900 to the Present: 1900–1949 |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313043345 |page=285}}</ref> and [[Dooney & Bourke]] became associated with preppy style.

Today, these styles continue to be popular on Ivy League campuses, throughout the U.S., and abroad, and are oftentimes labeled as "Classic American style" or "Traditional American style".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.details.com/fashion-style/rules-of-style/201006/ultimate-guide-to-american-style|title=The Ultimate Guide to American Style|work=Details|access-date=October 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223223/http://www.details.com/fashion-style/rules-of-style/201006/ultimate-guide-to-american-style|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/200804/american-classic|title=The American Way|first=Adam|last=Rapoport|work=GQ|date=March 31, 2008}}</ref>

Phrases such as "Ivy League snobbery"<ref>{{cite book | title=The Ideal of the University | first = Robert Paul |last = Wolff | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year=1992 | isbn = 1-56000-603-X}} p. viii: "My genial, aristocratic contempt for Clark Kerr's celebration of the University of California was as much an expression of Ivy League snobbery as it was of radical social critique."</ref> are ubiquitous in nonfiction and fiction writing of the early and mid-twentieth century. A [[Louis Auchincloss]] character dreads "the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> A business writer, warning in 2001 against discriminatory hiring, presented a cautionary example of an attitude to avoid (the bracketed phrase is his):

{{quote|We Ivy Leaguers [read: mostly white and Anglo]<!--This bracketed phrase is part of the quotation and is in the original, not an editorial interpolation.---> know that an Ivy League degree is a mark of the kind of person who is likely to succeed in this organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=The 10 Lenses: your guide to living and working in a multicultural world|url=https://archive.org/details/10lenses00mark|url-access=registration|first=Mark|last=Williams|year=2001|publisher=Capital Books}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1892123592&id=bkiuOG-k2vUC&pg=RA1-PA85&lpg=RA1-PA85#PRA1-PA85,M1 p. 85]</ref>}}

The phrase ''Ivy League'' historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter [[John Kieran]] noted that student editors at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]] were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider "[[United States Military Academy|Army]] and [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and [[Fordham University|Fordham]] and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] and [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pitt]]" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:

{{quote|It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not "exclusive" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kieran|first=John|title=Sports of the Times — The Ivy League|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE3D9173EEE3BBC4C53DFB467838D629EDE|work=The New York Times|date=December 4, 1936|access-date=May 30, 2017|page=36|quote=There will now be a little test of 'the power of the press' in intercollegiate circles since the student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth and Penn are coming out in a group for the formation of an Ivy League in football. The idea isn't new. ... It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not 'exclusive' as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose." He recommended the consideration of "plenty of institutions covered with home-grown ivy that are not included in the proposed group. [such as ] Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt, just to offer a few examples that come to mind" and noted that "Pitt and Georgetown and Brown and Bowdoin and Rutgers were old when Cornell was shining new, and Fordham and Holy Cross had some building draped in ivy before the plaster was dry in the walls that now tower high about Cayuga's waters.}}</ref>}}

Aspects of Ivy stereotyping were illustrated during the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], when [[George H. W. Bush]] (Yale '48) derided [[Michael Dukakis]] (graduate of Harvard Law School) for having "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarpley.net/bush22.htm|title=George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography: Chapter XXII Bush Takes The Presidency|first1=Webster G. |last1=Tarpley |first2=Anton |last2=Chaitkin |publisher=Webster G. Tarpley|access-date=December 17, 2006}} <!--obviously a poor source but it has the exact phrase the New York Times columnists are referring to, which I couldn't find in the NYT articles themselves--></ref> ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] asked "Wasn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle elite?" Bush explained, however, that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it. ... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism" and said ''Harvard'' in his remark was intended to represent "a philosophical enclave" and not a statement about class.<ref>Dowd, Maureen (1998), "Bush Traces How Yale Differs From Harvard." ''The New York Times,'' June 11, 1998, p. 10</ref> Columnist [[Russell Baker]] opined that "Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their [[undershirt]] no matter how hot the weather gets."<ref>Baker, Russell (1998), "The Ivy Hayseed." ''The New York Times,'' June 15, 1988, p. A31</ref> Still, the last five presidents have all attended Ivy League schools for at least part of their education— George H. W. Bush (Yale undergrad), [[Bill Clinton]] (Yale Law School), [[George W. Bush]] (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), [[Barack Obama]] (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School), and [[Donald Trump]] (Penn undergrad).

Of the 44 men who have served as President of the United States, 16 have graduated from an Ivy League university. Of them, eight have degrees from Harvard, five from Yale, three from Columbia, two from Princeton and one from Penn. Twelve presidents have earned Ivy undergraduate degrees.  Three of these were transfer students: Donald Trump transferred from [[Fordham University]], Barack Obama transferred from [[Occidental College]], and John F. Kennedy transferred from Princeton to Harvard. [[John Adams]] was the first president to graduate from college, graduating from Harvard in 1755.

Students of the Ivy League largely hail from [[Northeastern United States|the Northeast]], largely from the New York City, [[Boston]], and [[Philadelphia]] areas.

Students of the Ivy League, both graduate and undergraduate, come primarily from [[Upper middle class in the United States|upper middle]] and [[American upper class|upper class]] families.

Ivy champions are recognized in sixteen men's and sixteen women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other; for example, the six league members who participate in [[ice hockey]] do so as members of [[ECAC Hockey]], but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year. In one sport, [[College rowing (United States)|rowing]], the Ivies recognize team champions for each sex in both heavyweight and lightweight divisions. While the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] governs all four sex- and bodyweight-based divisions of rowing, the only one that is sanctioned by the NCAA is women's heavyweight. The Ivy League was the last Division I [[basketball]] conference to institute a conference postseason tournament; the first tournaments for men and women were held at the end of the 2016–17 season. The tournaments only award the Ivy League automatic bids for the NCAA Division&nbsp;I [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Men's]] and [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Women's]] Basketball Tournaments; the official conference championships continue to be awarded based solely on regular-season results.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017 |publisher=Ivy League |date=March 10, 2016 |access-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |archive-date=March 11, 2016 }}</ref> Before the 2016–17 season, the automatic bids were based solely on regular-season record, with a [[one-game playoff]] (or series of one-game playoffs if more than two teams were tied) held to determine the automatic bid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2002/03/06/yale-basketball-shares-ivy-league-title/ |title=Yale basketball shares Ivy League title |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=March 6, 2002 |access-date=August 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209211908/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2002/03/06/yale-basketball-shares-ivy-league-title/ |archive-date=February 9, 2013 }}</ref> The Ivy League is one of only two Division I conferences which award their official basketball championships solely on regular-season results; the other is the [[Southeastern Conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2015/1023/2016%20SEC%20MBKB%20Media%20Guide.pdf |title=Through the Years: SEC Champions |work=2015–2016 SEC Men's Basketball Media Guide |page=61 |publisher=Southeastern Conference |access-date=March 10, 2016 |quote=From 1933–50 the SEC Champion was determined by a tournament, except for 1935.

In the time before [[College recruiting|recruiting]] for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in [[college football]] (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_year.php|title=Recognized National Championships by Year|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|access-date=October 8, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015173918/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_year.php|archive-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref> Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], which has won 15, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and [[USC Trojans football|USC]], which has won 11. Yale, whose coach [[Walter Camp]] was the "Father of American Football," held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 18, followed closely by Harvard and Penn, each with 17 titles. In addition, the Ivy League has produced [[Super Bowl]] winners [[Kevin Boothe]] ([[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]]), two-time [[Pro Bowl]]er [[Zak DeOssie]] ([[Brown Bears football|Brown]]), [[Sean Morey (American football)|Sean Morey]] (Brown), [[All-Pro]] selection [[Matt Birk]] ([[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]]), [[Calvin Hill]] ([[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]]), [[Derrick Harmon]] (Cornell) and 1999 "[[Mr. Irrelevant]]" [[Jim Finn]] ([[Penn Quakers football|Penn]]).

Beginning with the [[1982 NCAA Division I-AA football season|1982 football season]], the Ivy League has competed in [[1982 NCAA Division I-AA football season|Division I-AA]] (renamed [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] {{nowrap|in 2006).<ref name=wergbt>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iqpfAAAAIBAJ&pg=2966%2C4685676 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=NCAA Convention: Ivy League has 'serious doubts' about I-AA status |date=January 12, 1982 |page=4C}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/sports/ncaafootball/17ivy.html New York Times] – November 17, 2006</ref>}} The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion is eligible for an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA.  However, since its inception in 1956, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games due to concerns about the extended December schedule's effects on academics.  (The last postseason game for a member was {{Years or months ago|1934}}, the [[1934 Rose Bowl]], won by {{nowrap|[[1933 Columbia Lions football team|Columbia]].)<ref name=vnqmud>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U7IWAAAAIBAJ&pg=6420%2C101607 |work=Milwaukee Journal |title=Gallant Columbia 'Sea' Lions vanquish Stanford in mud, 7 to 0 |date=January 2, 1934 |page=6, part 2}}</ref><ref name=colamz>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7d9XAAAAIBAJ&pg=6453%2C5030424 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |last=Bell |first=Brian |title=Columbia amazes sport world with Stanford win, 7–0 |date=January 2, 1934 |page=6}}</ref>}} For this reason, any Ivy League team invited to the FCS playoffs turns down the bid.  The Ivy League plays a strict 10-game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 (or, in some seasons, 12) regular season games, plus post-season, which expanded in [[2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2013]] to five rounds with 24 teams, with a bye week for the top eight teams.  Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.

In addition to varsity football, Penn, Princeton and Cornell also field teams in the 10-team [[Sprint football|Collegiate Sprint Football League]], in which all players must weigh 178 pounds or less. Penn and Princeton are the last remaining founding members of the league from its 1934 debut, and Cornell is the next-oldest, joining in 1937. Yale and Columbia previously fielded teams in the league but no longer do so.

The table above includes the number of team championships won from the beginning of official Ivy League competition (1956–57 academic year) through 2016–17. Princeton and Harvard have on occasion won ten or more Ivy League titles in a year, an achievement accomplished 10 times by Harvard and 24 times by Princeton, including a conference-record 15 championships in 2010–11. Only once has one of the other six schools earned more than eight titles in a single academic year (Cornell with nine in 2005–06). In the 38 academic years beginning 1979–80, Princeton has averaged 10 championships per year, one-third of the conference total of 33 sponsored sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ivyleague.com/sports/2017/7/28/information-IvyChampionships-BySchool.aspx|title=Ivy League Championships – By School|publisher=Council of Ivy League Presidents and The Ivy League|access-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>
