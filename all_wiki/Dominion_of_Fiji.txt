{{History of Fiji}}

The '''Dominion of Fiji''' was the official name of [[Fiji]] between October 1970 and 6 October 1987. When British rule ended in 1970, the Fijian Islands were given independence as a [[Dominion]], in which the [[British monarch]], [[Elizabeth II]], remained head of state as [[Monarchy of Fiji|Queen of Fiji]], represented by the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]]. The [[Republic of Fiji]], removing Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, was proclaimed on 6 October 1987 after two [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coups]].

Until 1987, Fiji's highest court was the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], which was above the [[Supreme Court of Fiji]] in the Fijian judicial system.

== History ==

The following Governors-General held office:

# Sir [[Robert Sidney Foster]] 10 October 1970 – 13 February 1973
# Ratu Sir [[George Cakobau]] 13 February 1973 – 12 February 1983
# Ratu Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]] 12 February 1983 – 6/15 October 1987

The following held office as prime minister (and [[head of government]]):

# Ratu Sir [[Kamisese Mara]] 10 October 1970 – 13 April 1987
# [[Timoci Bavadra]] 13 April 1987 – 14 May 1987

[[Elizabeth II]] visited Fiji before its independence in 1953, 1963 and March 1970, and after independence in 1973, 1977 and 1982.

Following the election of the ethnically [[Indians in Fiji|Indian]]-dominated government of [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Timoci Bavadra]] (although he personally was an [[Fijians|indigenous Fijian]]) on 13 April 1987, Lieutenant Colonel [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] carried out the first of two military coups on 14 May 1987. At first, Rabuka expressed loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. However, Governor-General Ratu Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], in an effort to uphold Fiji's constitution, refused to swear in the new (self-appointed) government headed by Rabuka, and so Rabuka declared a republic on 6 October 1987. This was accepted by the British government on 15 October 1987, and Ganilau resigned on the same day. In a letter addressed to Queen Elizabeth II, Ganilau wrote:

"With humble duty, I wish to submit to you the following advice, acting in my capacity as your representative in Fiji. Owing to the uncertainty of the political and constitutional situation in Fiji, I have now made up my mind to request Your Majesty to relieve me of my appointment as Governor-General with immediate effect. This I do with utmost regret, but my endeavours to preserve constitutional government in Fiji have proved in vain, and I can see no alternative way forward. With deepest respect, Penaia Ganilau, Governor-General."

Following the establishment of a republic, former Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau became the first [[President of Fiji]], in December 1987.
