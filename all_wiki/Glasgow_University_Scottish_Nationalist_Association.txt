The '''Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association''' ('''GUSNA''') is a student organisation formed in 1927 at the [[University of Glasgow]] which supports [[Scottish independence]].

==History==
GUSNA is important historically as it predated many pro-independence organisations including the [[Scottish National Party]] itself. It is the forerunner of the [[National Party of Scotland]] (NPS) which is itself a forerunner of the modern Scottish National Party.<ref>[http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02102901.html Archives Hub: Collection of material relating to the Scottish National Party<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720032428/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02102901.html |date=20 July 2012 }}</ref> One of the three founding members of GUSNA was [[John MacCormick]] who had previously been involved in the [[Glasgow University Labour Club]].<ref>[http://theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSD00090 TheGlasgowStory: John M. MacCormick<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

GUSNA was thrown into prominence in the early 1950s when a group of its members (including [[Ian Hamilton QC|Ian Hamilton]] who would later become a well known [[Queen's Counsel]]) took the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] on Christmas Day 1950. This caused a huge scandal amongst the British establishment and it wasn't until April 1951 that the stone was found by the authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/20thand21stcenturies/stoneofdestiny/index.asp |title=Stone of Destiny taken from Westminster Abbey |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Education Scotland |accessdate=26 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731185156/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/20thand21stcenturies/stoneofdestiny/index.asp |archivedate=31 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1950.html |title=Stealing of the Stone of Scone |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Craig |first=Olga |date=14 December 2008 |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>

GUSNA has, almost since its inception, tried to play an active part in the life of Glasgow University with its members regularly being involved in the [[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council|Students' Representative Council]] as well as regularly nominating candidates for the election of the Rectorship of the university.
Notable GUSNA Rectorial candidates of the past have included [[Robert Cunninghame-Graham]] and John MacCormick (who with Ian Hamilton as his campaign manager was successful in being elected). More recent candidates have been Ian Hamilton, [[Alasdair Gray]] and [[Alan Bissett]]; with the most recent being [[Aamer Anwar]], who was elected in 2017.
GUSNA is affiliated to [[Federation of Student Nationalists|SNP Students]], the student wing of the Scottish National Party, and played a leading role in its formation in the 1960s.

Prominent former members of GUSNA have included [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Nicola Sturgeon|Nicola Sturgeon MSP]] and [[Neil MacCormick]] (son of John MacCormick).<ref>[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=62 Media Releases - University of Aberdeen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The current president is Abby Hastings.
